Computational Thinking and related topics are appearing in school curricula around the world. There are many barriers to adoption, and one significant one is supporting teachers to find relevant and easy-to-deploy teaching material. This talk will describe experiences with two on-line open resources that have been developed at the University of Canterbury: CS Unplugged, and the CS Field Guide. We will look at principles used to design the resources, and challenges included making it relevant for different cultures, curricula and languages.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

my name's Tim Bell and I'm going to be

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,250
talking a bit about open computer

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,710
science education resources Jake is here

00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,170
because he actually whenever I say we do

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,740
this and we did that it usually means

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:20,070
ejected this injected that so in

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,150
particular look a lot of the details he

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,189
can give you the honest answer about

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:28,470
what's going on but thank you for for

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,820
the talking discussion about schools

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,469
which is really interesting and it's

00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,210
it's something that I think everyone's

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,180
passionate about education and everyone

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,960
is because we're passionate about what

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,910
happens to our kids

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,489
and in particular of course we're all

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,090
passionate about technology in different

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,410
ways as well I got involved in this

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,870
because I was asked to speak to my

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,210
five-year-old sorry speak to my father's

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,960
at my five year I was always speak to my

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,760
five grow it at my five year olds class

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,859
when they were having parents along to

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,890
talk about what they did for a living

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,840
and literally the the couple of weeks

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,939
before a cop had come in with a cop car

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,159
and these five year olds were calling

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,720
all over it you know trying out the

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,750
sirens and that sort of stuff

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,580
and then the week after that they had a

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,619
nurse and she pulled him fake bandages

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,880
and glad and the kids were imaging each

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,229
other up and that sort of stuff and

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,360
funny out how cool it was to be a nurse

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,930
and the week after it was going to be a

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:33,570
computer scientist and yeah how cool was

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:35,520
they going to be and the bit

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,380
five-year-old turns 32 this year by the

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,890
way so which is a very significant boost

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,829
a course in computer science world but

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,710
the thing is that back in 1992 I think

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,210
it was data projectors computers and you

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,240
know laptops and things weren't a big

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,590
deal and schools and so I had to think

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,119
how am I gonna present because I was

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,799
working on an algorithm so I could say

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,810
well I here's a slow algorithm and

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,049
here's a faster one and you know see how

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,299
much faster it is and in the end it was

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,549
all looking rather hopeless so I thought

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:08,879
I just had this stupid idea which is

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,220
don't bring a computer at all and that

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,840
was the birth of computer science

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,710
unplugged which it went quite well I

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,450
kept on being and by

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,540
Beck and I'll tell you a bit more of

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,400
that story later but this is a picture

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,880
of some school students in Christchurch

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,350
doing computer science what is unusual

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,250
about this picture particular in the

00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:31,800
light of what we've just been talking

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:34,440
about there's no computers and there are

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,820
girls and by the way what we did is this

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,900
was a photo shoot because you have to

00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,390
get permission from kids to put their

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,560
photos all over the internet so we we

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,850
got a bunch of kids who gave us

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,430
permission we took all these foreign

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:48,630
people we Jack took all these photos and

00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,370
then afterwards we said thank you got

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,440
enough photos you can go back to your

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,000
classes now do whatever you want and

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,470
there was the spongy girls that hung

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,170
around the whiteboard they just keep on

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,660
doing this it's um Shannon's theory of

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,480
in the entropy so this information

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,340
theory prediction and that sort of thing

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,510
and we and they just kept going and got

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,360
some great photos because they were

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,910
actually doing what they love the thing

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,290
is that with computing in general we

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,200
have said hey you're interested in

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,640
computing why don't you learn to program

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,830
and then we'll show you the cool things

00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,100
you can do with it and learning to

00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:25,680
program actually takes a lot of time now

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,740
if you'd like computers you don't mind

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,720
programming on that but in actual fact

00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,630
we don't write computer programs for

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,350
computers we write programs for people

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,520
who are going to use those computers and

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,690
you've probably used lots of programs

00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,230
that have been written for computers

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:45,570
rather than for people and we suffer

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,910
from there and so one of the big things

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:50,790
that some new zealand like australia has

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,550
adopted a full curriculum and digital

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,780
technologies which includes an area

00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,270
called computational thinking which

00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,090
we'll talk about a bit more later on

00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,370
but it includes programming but one of

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,230
the big things for us is not so much

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,460
educating the students but they haven't

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,540
come across this that they haven't had

00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,940
the opportunity to learn about these

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,770
things but to educate teachers and

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,960
principals and so on and it's been kind

00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,670
of cool and reminded me of one thing

00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,799
that happened here some some years ago

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:19,380
we were quite involved in pilots for

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,610
schools in that and we were talking to a

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:26,460
local all-girls school and their

00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,630
response was we obviously don't teach

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,000
competing because

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:31,290
we're a girls school it was computer

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,950
science I think all programming awesome

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,270
and we tried to put that right anyway a

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,490
couple years later one of their ex

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:41,580
students came back from a large company

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,620
in Australia with died here and she

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,090
spoke to them about her job and what it

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,680
was like and why she enjoyed it because

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,660
it was so creative making things for

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,220
people all over the world and help what

00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,170
her software was used for and half the

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,380
staff had probably used to his software

00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:57,540
and that sort of thing and the school

00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,160
just flipped around and they said wow

00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,960
this is a great career for Gill's its

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,030
creator if it involves working with

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,060
people designing things for people and

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:08,790
so on and got totally on board so you

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,020
know there is hope and I think one of

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,440
the cool things is because this

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,180
curriculum is new and it's it's feeling

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,260
you around the world this the only

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,580
countries that have really been doing it

00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,890
for a long time at Israel and South

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,300
Korea but a lot of countries have been

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,730
adopting us over the last five years or

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,990
so because it's new teachers are coming

00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:27,300
in with a lot of fear and a lot of

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,360
misunderstandings and so on and it's a

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,740
great opportunity to blow away some of

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,130
the myths and ideas that are around

00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,020
there and they will often though their

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,630
teachers are pleasantly surprised about

00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:43,230
what's involved bad one of the things

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,580
that turns out this thing of unplugged

00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,650
not using computers as something that

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,350
turns out to be really useful for

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,190
getting teachers on board because again

00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,990
when they hear that they're teaching

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,160
computer or computer science or

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:54,690
programming or something they just go

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,200
well obviously there's no way I could do

00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,410
that

00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,580
and in within a few minutes we can get

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,260
them doing stuff that they thought would

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,490
be way too hard for them to do because

00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,950
the reality is this is happening in

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,510
primary schools and so you if a primary

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,160
school kid can do it you would hope that

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,140
an adult qualified to teach could do it

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:17,040
we don't put it that way necessarily to

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:18,420
teachers but what I might do a little

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,920
bit of a demonstration so how many

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,440
people here have come across computer

00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,900
science unplugged or who's actually used

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:29,720
it in a class or something like that I

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:33,840
hope so is one of my PhD students so

00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:36,150
he's been researching unplugged so okay

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,760
what I might do is we're going to do a

00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:40,970
simulated teacher professional

00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,830
development still right

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:48,500
and for this I need five people who will

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:49,910
simulate teachers for me okay one it's

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:56,480
okay if you're a qualified teacher yeah

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:58,580
that's fine okay we've got two now I do

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,900
like to go for gender balance if

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:05,540
possible thank you three four and five

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:10,250
excellent with five it's you know this

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:13,460
is my idea of balance thank you and you

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,200
may have seen this before but and but I

00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,930
just want to use this to illustrate a

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,280
few points and so first of all maybe

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:25,970
just slightly so you're not nervous a

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,280
little bit okay probably never working

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,540
in there one of the cool things about

00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,520
doing things I'm pledge that we don't

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,350
use computers and we just need card and

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,330
paper and things like that and I've got

00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,830
some of the equipment over there when

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,180
the data but it only took us about 10

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,910
minutes to get rid out of a giclee going

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,710
I think today which is pretty good going

00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,800
Thanks tally off you've sorted out in

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,540
the end today but you don't have that

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,250
horrible thought of other whole things

00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,370
off because actually so far I've used

00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,870
one slide

00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:55,940
so with these five people what you do is

00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,410
think about digital technologies and

00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,940
when you talk about it people say oh

00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,530
that's shiny expensive stuff or whatever

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:02,290
but what what is special about digital

00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:07,040
technologies why has it got their name

00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:09,160
its digits right and even that's an aha

00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,000
moment for a lot of teachers like digits

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,540
who would have thought that digital

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,640
technologies is all about digits right

00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,290
and a lot of teachers are passionate

00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,150
about literacy and numeracy and that for

00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,760
their kids and so hey suddenly we've got

00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,530
them versus numeracy right and we're

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,980
gonna look at how these digits actually

00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:30,050
work and these are binary digits and

00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,460
against a binary digits and you can just

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,849
feel the chill go through a room of

00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:36,919
teachers right and it's it's like it's

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,110
the secret code that these people use

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,719
that I will never understand in my life

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,180
and I'll be an outsider and it's

00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,440
somewhere in the curriculum and so lot

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,900
of people say it's not that important

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,050
anyway and no one uses eart and what's

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,300
going on here so we have a binary digit

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,500
here and your job in life is just either

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,900
so the black side of

00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,880
or flip it over and show the white side

00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,100
okay and that's how simple a binary

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,520
digit is and sometimes you know it's

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:06,710
like why do we bother with this the

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,550
first question often ask us we'll just

00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:17,270
do the times table so 0 times 0 is 0 0

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:18,530
times 1 don't worry this is the normal

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:22,370
response right okay

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:24,500
there's K k1 times 0 and 1 times 1 right

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,030
so that's the entire times table and you

00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,160
know you're talking about memorizing

00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:30,110
times tables and memorizing learning and

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,550
that which it does it is kind of handy

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,080
to be able to know the multiplication

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,250
table just like that if you sort of

00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,400
quickly working at a discount or

00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,750
something like that but the binary times

00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,370
table is so much easier and I think a

00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,760
lot of kids go missing how we use that

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:46,940
Prime's table instead because you know

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,470
anyway 0 1 and so we can count up to 1

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:54,040
now we can practice that so zero dots

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:56,210
visible hahoo and one dot visible yay

00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,960
so got enough information here to

00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:01,400
represent a check box or but we need

00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,380
more digits when we run out of numbers

00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,570
and so we have a second digit and your

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,270
job in life is also is to show one side

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,310
of the card or the other but your card

00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:12,230
has got two dots on it which is exciting

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,810
so now I can have up to three dots

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,560
visible now here's the tricky question

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:20,720
and this the way I'd ask teachers what

00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:25,550
number of dots would your children say

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:30,290
that the next card has three is the

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:31,640
correct answer and powder this is

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:33,770
empowering teachers right

00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,500
I mean now how many people here going

00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:39,990
it's for its full term come on yeah yeah

00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:42,250
just get on with it but

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,899
but the point is that when we're working

00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,550
with people who are fearful and never

00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:46,660
seen us before in binary is something

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,490
that we're going to hit over the head to

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,750
show them how stupid they are it's

00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,800
actually really empowering for them to

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,420
go three is the answer

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,639
yep that's exactly what kids would say

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,420
and what we just quietly do is we give

00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,709
out four dots to the next person and the

00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,170
kit they will be able to murmuring the

00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:04,329
kids will go you made a mistake that

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,220
sort of thing that I say no go of this

00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:09,070
now here's the hog vision there's a

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,660
teacher how many dots do you think

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,779
children and eight-year-old would say

00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,779
the next card will have six is the

00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:19,120
correct answer

00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:20,800
excellent but if you just wait for one

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,560
second someone at the back of the room

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,089
will yell out eight because they can see

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,160
the pattern and then there'll be a

00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:30,839
little argument between the sixes and

00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:34,060
the eights and this is good this is so

00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,829
one of the fundamental theories of

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,620
learning is constructivism so who's come

00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:40,600
across constructivism so a it's comes

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,930
from a psychologist called PA Bay and

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,339
his thoughts are probably such as common

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:47,199
sense really but you can't staff

00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:49,060
knowledge into people's heads they have

00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:51,699
to construct ideas in their heads okay

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,829
and so as a teacher all you're doing is

00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:55,389
help them construct things if you make

00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:57,550
them do rote learning they are kind of

00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:58,750
constructing that but it's not you know

00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,800
it's like building Lego following

00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,079
instructions you're not really

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,510
constructing something but you kind of

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,279
have constructed it but if you take them

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,019
through experiences and you say what is

00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:11,440
the next one and you let them argue it

00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:13,029
out and the eights always win right of

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:18,639
course a mathematician would say well it

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:20,680
could be anything right yeah so that it

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,089
is age and then suddenly the entire

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,800
classes on board and I've never told

00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:25,449
them any rules I haven't used the phrase

00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:29,529
powers of two because they're all free

00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:33,190
call the primary school teachers out all

00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:36,130
right we've got a sub excellent so the

00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:38,529
next one is 16 thank you for being a

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,420
simulated classroom the 16 has been a

00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:41,380
mini classrooms by the way so you might

00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,750
want to wash your hands after you've

00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:47,829
used these but

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:49,449
one of it yeah yeah and often at that

00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:51,579
point with kids you cab stopped you know

00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:54,009
and something oh they'll be young at 82

00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:55,509
and then 64 and we can you can't

00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:58,149
actually go up to you know bigger

00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:59,529
numbers and so on sometimes I'll hold

00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:01,810
this up for teachers and just say look

00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,800
you know there's eight bits and someone

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,779
will figure out that that's called a

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,730
byte that's what a biters it's just

00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:08,709
eight people holding cards with two

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,120
sides on right so I mean megabytes

00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:14,290
become a bit of an issue in Santa okay

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,329
so let's work out how we're gonna

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,949
represent values just using a five

00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:19,779
people holding card six it's enough to

00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:21,819
demonstrate it and I again

00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:24,550
constructivism I'm gonna ask you as the

00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:27,959
audience and try and bring your thinking

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:30,189
to an eight-year-old sort of level and

00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:31,689
but the question I might ask you if I

00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:33,670
want exactly eleven of these dots

00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:39,490
showing do you want this one black or

00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:42,639
white that is thank you that's a very

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:45,129
good simulation the other thing was

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,329
employed by the way is that and oh I'm

00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:48,399
talking an awful lot because I'm

00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:51,040
explaining the process about what not to

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,449
do and so on so you know the worst thing

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,559
is just a huge great lecture about you

00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:55,449
will do this you'll flip this over

00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:57,189
you'll turn this your brothers it's like

00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:59,439
basically this would have been about two

00:13:57,189 --> 00:14:01,569
sentences and most of it is that this is

00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:03,879
just like one or two ropes headsets are

00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:05,470
card and its flipped well now or the

00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:07,029
other and the class have told you how

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,889
many docs you're holding right that's it

00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:09,970
that's all we've done so far so we're

00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:13,300
trying to get eleven dots do you want

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:18,819
the eight take could we do it without

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:20,199
the aid no I could explain up that we

00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:25,820
won't bother with it drive at the moment

00:14:20,199 --> 00:14:33,810
but do you not before No

00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:33,810
[Laughter]

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:43,940
yeah do you order two and do you want

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,770
the one and so but what's happened is

00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,320
the teachers or the or the class have

00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:51,610
just said no yes no yes yes and they've

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,130
communicated the number eleven and

00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:57,410
suddenly we and and that is the point of

00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:02,840
a binary representation by the way is

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:05,480
this cab black or white it's white okay

00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:10,820
and the other side is is that actually

00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:14,120
black it's kind of black and if you flip

00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,380
it over it's definitely not white but

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,240
that's the whole point of binaries it's

00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,800
so easy to build circuitry that can have

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,540
two just two different values it's kind

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,610
of white and it's kind of like it's kind

00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,540
of a high-voltage kind of a local sort

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,760
of thing

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,170
and it takes it from you know because

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,690
people want to know you know why do you

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,490
use the secret code called binary in the

00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:33,590
things it's not actually secret it's not

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:37,090
encryption if you think that putting

00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:37,090
things in binary makes it encrypted in

00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,800
[Laughter]

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,230
absolutely

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,339
okay next tricky question for you what

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:53,780
is the lowest number we can represent it

00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:56,800
wrong correct answer the kids will

00:15:53,780 --> 00:16:00,710
usually as one voice will call out one

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,470
then two seconds later that kid will

00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:07,970
call out zero constructor the knowledge

00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:10,250
of themselves I often get that question

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:13,210
from eight you're a whole thing so is

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,210
there a sign but yeah

00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,230
that's one thing to watch out for so

00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,030
often you know there will be a kid that

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,620
switched on to it or maybe a kid that

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,970
did this you know last year with a

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,800
different teacher or in a Science Center

00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,570
or something like that and but the ad

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,010
and one of the messages to our teachers

00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:30,110
is that you actually know about

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,760
classroom management because when I go

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,410
into a class I always focus on their kid

00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,270
that knows the answers and you're

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,220
getting them out very quickly teachers

00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,540
are very good at going thank you now

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,240
could you just go to here mister to the

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,650
office for me but we well there's all

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,470
these positive classroom management

00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:48,150
methods and

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,150
Yeah right

00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,490
everyone else is going that's why I had

00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:56,320
to keep taking visitors to the other

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:57,430
okay so one of the things that you know

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,450
because again teachers coming in feel

00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:04,000
like doing this thing numbers and HCI

00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:06,970
and artificial intelligence and drawings

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,180
and robots and you know it's just where

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:11,590
is it all going to end they have 80

00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,900
percent of what they need because they

00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,910
know how to manage a classroom of kids

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,380
they know how to help that quiet kid in

00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,720
the corner who's just ticking over

00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:22,270
quietly and you know really enjoying it

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,120
but completely not joining in the

00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,320
discussion they they know how to deal

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,670
with behavior and all sorts of things

00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,410
like that they know how to deal with a

00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,870
principle and not whim into shape and

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,310
all those sort of things which is really

00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:35,080
important and I don't know if any of you

00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,700
had gone into a classroom but it's okay

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,690
for a one-hour stunt and especially if

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,910
the teachers still there to manage

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,740
things but it's a she really had to do a

00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,120
good job of all of those things and so

00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,550
one of the encouraging messages for

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,110
existing teachers maybe not every

00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:49,660
existing teacher like the ones that

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,030
display YouTube videos but is is that

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,590
you really have a lot of skills and if

00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,850
we just hired a bunch of industry

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,270
professionals to come and teach this

00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:01,060
stuff you know a few King kids would

00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,770
learn something and it would be one of

00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:07,690
the points about having it in primary

00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:09,310
school level is that we actually the

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,990
curriculum is covered is dated by all

00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:13,330
students right so you you will get a

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:16,870
gender balance female suppose it's just

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:19,450
how many there are and so it's it's a

00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,800
chance for kids to go hey this is cool

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,700
because the other thing is before

00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,590
adolescence

00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,160
if something's kind of cool it's just

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:29,890
cool and and yes knowing binary numbers

00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,480
I'm working with them you know it comes

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,640
up every so often when you're working at

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,250
a I know an IP number or something like

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,900
that but it's knowing what's happening

00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:40,570
underneath is really important to some

00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,920
people and just knowing that sort of

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,400
breaking the power of some of that

00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,890
jargon and wooden with one class and a

00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,630
guilt of your said to me why do you use

00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:54,670
such big words for such simple ideas and

00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:57,200
it's a lot of a lot of that is that many

00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,669
of these things you know I mean all the

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,380
books that we teach whether it's physics

00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:02,299
or science or literature or whatever in

00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,399
school we find a way that an

00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:06,080
eight-year-old can hopefully get their

00:19:04,399 --> 00:19:07,850
head around it and even to maybe develop

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,590
a passion for it or for me just as

00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,539
importantly find out that although it's

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:14,480
got computers in it it's not that

00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:15,980
interesting for me you know you have to

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,049
talk to people you have to find out the

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,029
requirements you have to solve problems

00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:21,470
for them you have to sort out when they

00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:27,289
mess up the computer without actually

00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:28,519
young you know and so and this is a you

00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:29,690
know it gives us an opportunity to talk

00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:31,760
to his teachers rather than all this

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,740
programming as really good skills will

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,059
be good at it just you know get stuck

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,620
into it that doesn't give them anything

00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:38,590
to hang hang things on but if we can

00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:41,679
give them an experience and so with

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:43,490
these things despite me going on and on

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,049
that can be about a five minute

00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,360
experience where they can we're going I

00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:48,740
could do that with my class and I can

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,360
see the learning in it I can see the

00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,710
value this communication literacy

00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,700
numeracy reasoning all sorts of stuff

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,840
going on and then you say oh by the way

00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,130
that was one of the lines in the

00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,470
curriculum that was freaking you out

00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,519
and so a lot of it is just giving the

00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,080
teacher stuff to do there

00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,340
and the same happens of course with

00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,840
other things and programming is

00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,639
something it requires time on task but

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,350
if kids get into adolescence with the

00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,549
experience we don't know if that's a

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,179
good thing or not but I don't think it's

00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:13,909
a bad thing

00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:15,799
because by that point what identity

00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:18,470
during adolescence is based more on what

00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:20,059
your friends think okay I'm probably the

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:25,909
exception will be nearly every L isn't

00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:27,080
in this room but in general if you know

00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:28,399
like do you like computer programming

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:31,909
hang on a minute we'll just ask my

00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:33,049
friends oh okay right no I don't like

00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:35,389
computer programming

00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:37,970
I'd be unfriended by everyone it was

00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:39,590
computer program a program whereas if

00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,350
they've developed the patient earlier on

00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:44,870
then it becomes cool and so we are

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,580
seeing this and so for me when we

00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,559
adopted computer science into the high

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,809
school curriculum even the big effect

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,950
wasn't where we all universities are

00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:53,510
getting bigger and bigger numbers of

00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:55,159
kids coming in to do computer science

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:56,570
but the biggest effect that I thought

00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:59,179
the significant is the number of women

00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:00,830
coming in doubled the very first year

00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:04,309
that their group came through because

00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:05,240
they knew what it was yeah just pull

00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:06,830
your clap too loudly

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,710
it went from a single digit to double

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:11,350
digits

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:14,440
but the year after it doubled again it

00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,120
was four times as many and and now it's

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,100
got to that critical mass where I think

00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:20,200
if we try and stand in the way of them I

00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,350
would be bulldozed out of the way which

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,580
is awesome because you know that's a lot

00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,649
of it is how do we get there critical

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,120
mass so that people who can find their

00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:30,970
passion and also find out that it's not

00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,980
the impatient okay and we've just done

00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:44,169
that with five cards okay thank you very

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:46,510
much to our bets by the way now there's

00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:48,190
an actual fate for kids to get a proper

00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:50,080
experience often they'll do more with

00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:53,679
individual cards on a decibel something

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,850
like that and of course little more

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,200
rough they are the better I mean

00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,190
sometimes I've been in a restaurant and

00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,200
someone says how could you teach

00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,909
computer science without computers you

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,010
just just grabbed a paper napkin tear it

00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:04,360
up put some dots on it the reason for

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,539
the dots by the way as young kids can

00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,110
count so you don't even need the numbers

00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:12,039
they're just counting how many dots and

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:14,490
you can see in sexual sorts of

00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:17,770
interesting logic and they're going on

00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:20,020
now the next question I would ask for

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,610
them is if I only hit those five cards

00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,870
and we would have done some counting and

00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:28,179
figured out you can do any number from

00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:32,260
zero to big biggest number thirty-one

00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:35,440
yeah and yeah yeah the guy on the inside

00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,000
in a bit and and so but then we get that

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,520
whole reasoning about yeah every time we

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,710
add a card it's twice as powerful you

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,570
know if we go and then this affects us

00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,159
because if your security key if you add

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,779
one more bit to it is it just a little

00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:48,370
bit harder you know no it's twice as

00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:50,020
theoretically twice as difficult to

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,700
create and that sort of thing

00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,760
IP numbers you know we ran out of IP

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:56,950
four numbers and so you know if how many

00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,940
bits have we added to them as they

00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,840
doubled the range

00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:03,460
well actually know one of the cool

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,100
things so if this is generally it's not

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:13,529
what you expect four times as many bits

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:18,100
in an IP address the range on the

00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:21,820
integration some kids doing art was that

00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:23,410
hiding messages in art and in music

00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,510
got quite a bit of music around now that

00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:28,540
it's got hidden messages and little net

00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,590
sort of stuff but one question is that I

00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,330
asked kids happy how would we

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,160
communicate the alphabet what if all

00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:36,100
I've can transmit as a digit from a

00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:39,700
number from 0 to 31 and normally we get

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:44,200
the answer any what I said you stand up

00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:46,900
a bit yeah a as one 9 times out of 10

00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,060
a is 1 B is 2 one of my favorite class

00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:52,750
is one boy said Oh a could be 3 B could

00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:54,610
be a live and C could be 2 but you just

00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,900
flip constructivism work you know that

00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:59,560
the rest of the class had a differing

00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:01,120
opinion and there's nothing wrong with

00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,410
this code and of course teachers going

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,510
what is the right code what's the one

00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:09,280
people actually use not this one but

00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:11,470
actually it is the lower five bits of

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:13,450
most of the codes we end up using and

00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,400
and and what we're not actually trying

00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:17,740
to say you must know the S key code or

00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,220
unicode utf-8 or whatever it is this

00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:23,350
month but you need the concept that only

00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:24,070
5 bits is enough to transmit any letter

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:27,420
of the alphabet

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,920
how many letters are in the alphabet

00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,120
trick question

00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,710
[Music]

00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,570
yeah which alpha be it so first first

00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:38,620
one is upper and lowercase and commas on

00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:41,980
the weight sort of stuff that New

00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:45,730
Zealand has three official languages how

00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:50,730
many which and so in the Maori alphabet

00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:54,340
there are about 15 characters I think

00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:56,560
but we have microns as well in effect of

00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:59,020
word you know the famous example is Kiki

00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:02,220
and Kiki which if you leave out the

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:04,240
micron it changes cake into armpit and

00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,410
apparently it's a very common problem

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,150
that people get off at cake and they

00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,150
think that being offered amount it's

00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:18,180
Wittering Rita poo okay

00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:22,610
wheter digital is much worse than its

00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:28,350
[Laughter]

00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:31,650
absolutely and but suddenly language

00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:33,150
matters right and and what teacher isn't

00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:34,830
passionate about language and

00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:36,090
communication and it will might get into

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:41,490
teaching if you don't want kids to learn

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:43,260
language sort of thing and so now we're

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:47,030
actually talking about cultural issues

00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:49,770
you know can you use a macron in a URL

00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:51,690
the word mori itself has a mecklen in it

00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:58,290
if you leave that out it's not the weird

00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:59,280
Maori and we have a suffix Maori hmm it

00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:01,230
doesn't matter does it

00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,760
you know we everyone knows without a

00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,500
macron it's still the same thing or

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,300
whatever and everyone knows that cakes

00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,890
and AM pits and poo and waiters

00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,660
adversity you know that's not really a

00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:11,430
big issue in life but it's same to a

00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:14,520
whole group of people your language

00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,930
doesn't matter and so now what we're

00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,700
doing is actually finding out that yes

00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:18,330
we don't write computer programs for the

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,400
computer

00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:22,170
someone has to use them and there are

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,030
groups that are being excluded and you

00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:25,350
know as we were discussing before women

00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,790
are a big group that have kind of been

00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,650
pushed to one side as well and the

00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,990
program love this machine this is going

00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:34,890
to be so cool and some women love that

00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:36,150
it's cool but others go what's the point

00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,830
how many to change the world if all I

00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,690
learners binary numbers and how to write

00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,330
programs and things like that whereas if

00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,100
you link it to people suddenly it

00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,510
becomes quite different and we end up

00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:50,550
with the right people so the unplugged

00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,710
material is there's actually well

00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:54,750
probably about 30 or 40 main activities

00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,870
and then a whole bunch of community 168

00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,520
there was a good word that he used this

00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,720
morning in the keynote talk further much

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,280
I've now forgotten that I'll go and look

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,660
it up again for things that people have

00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,900
contributed that you don't quite trust

00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,130
but it's probably quite good and tested

00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:12,120
or something I can't really exact weird

00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:13,050
of visionary anyway we have a bunch of

00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,190
those as well that people have

00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,450
contributed but there's there's all

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:18,960
sorts of cool things but the key thing

00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:20,790
is very small explanation very quick

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:26,220
learning that the learning is

00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:27,960
constructed by the kids so but what we

00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,750
wanted to talk about was really how to

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,230
create this as an open source thing the

00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:35,820
it's it's a website that's evolved

00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,380
and you think we just put all that stuff

00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:41,160
on a website how hard could it be is

00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:44,550
this even the title knowing nod from

00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:48,630
Jake beer it turns out that this is

00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:51,300
being used all around the world so what

00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,740
happened in in about 92 93 I met up with

00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,120
another guy in Canada who was doing

00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:57,630
something similar we pulled our eyes to

00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:59,850
give ideas together ran around a few

00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:02,430
publishers we got rejected by I think 28

00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:09,390
publishers which has more addictions

00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:10,680
than Harry Potter yeah and and well I'd

00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,480
like to say because of our care for

00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,620
humanity we decided it should be open

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,650
source although that wasn't a big thing

00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:18,420
in 93 but that we would give it to the

00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:20,100
world which we did we put it up on this

00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,060
new thing called the web didn't know if

00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,320
there was going to be a thing but it

00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,900
seemed like a good place to put it and

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,750
then wind about our daily business

00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,400
working on algorithms and whatnot and

00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,620
kind of didn't forget about it but it

00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,940
was just sort of sitting there a few

00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,620
phonetics around the world picked it up

00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,880
a few people translated it and it

00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:38,610
actually ended up translated into about

00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,520
25 languages and then you realize that

00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:44,400
it's suddenly it becomes quite a big

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,590
thing when you worry about culture and

00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,900
language and all that sort of thing

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:51,240
but I hadn't realized how big it was

00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:54,750
until suddenly it got recommended and a

00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,830
draft curriculum in America and I found

00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,420
that out because I started getting

00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,890
emails from all around the world going

00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:00,480
tell us about your methods

00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:01,860
tell us about your philosophies these

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,870
these wonderful things that you have

00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,510
come up with and are obviously doing all

00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:08,550
the time you know so they had go and

00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,810
dust it off and look at it and but the

00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:12,030
cool thing about that as it got me

00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:13,980
invited to all these basically the

00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,330
birthplace of curricula around the world

00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,730
as people were looking at we should be

00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:19,170
offering this in our schools and so I go

00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,120
to the first one ago here's how this

00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,680
thing works and sort of snoop on what

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,690
they were doing and then the next people

00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,950
would invite me no go yep this is how my

00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:28,050
thing works and that's what everyone

00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,490
else is doing and after about 20 of

00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:30,600
these it's like here this is what

00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,370
everyone else in the world is doing and

00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,960
so on and suddenly found that my

00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:37,140
research area had become computer

00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:40,550
science education rather than the data

00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:40,550
compression algorithms as it was

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,210
the then New Zealand adopted a

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,619
curriculum and we ended up with this

00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,970
thing that we developed called the field

00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:52,379
guide because they've just was no

00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:57,269
literature around to support teachers

00:29:52,379 --> 00:29:59,369
and casts classes and it was hastily put

00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:02,549
together it was going to be a book and

00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:06,029
then it's gonna be an unbuttoned had

00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:09,179
interactive stuff in it but the whole

00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:11,159
point was to get students as engaged as

00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:18,450
possible but at the right level for what

00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:21,269
we wanted the license that we've ended

00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:26,340
up with is a Creative Commons license

00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:29,669
and importantly as a it's a share alike

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:33,389
so yep we get credit for it but people

00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:35,489
are allowed to adapt it and in actual

00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:37,019
fact that's happened a little bit a

00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:38,999
translations are one of the biggest air

00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:40,230
dictations that have happened but for

00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:41,639
example there's a course that Auckland

00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,169
Guinea have put on and I've drawn on the

00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:45,090
resources quite a bit and for us that's

00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:47,340
really cool because we don't do the work

00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:49,379
but the material gets improved and made

00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:50,820
available and used in other ways one of

00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:53,480
the really difficult questions was

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:56,580
should we have the non-commercial

00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,009
requirement on it which in fact I

00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:03,239
probably David was most influential and

00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:04,440
deciding us to remove that we we were

00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:06,059
worried that people would sell it and

00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:07,950
make lots of money offered and so on

00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:09,299
but in the end of course it's less

00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,950
available because a lot of people going

00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:12,299
well I'm charging for classes or on

00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,919
after school things do I need your

00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:16,440
permission to make money by using this

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,970
material and in some countries you

00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,379
needed to publish a book for people to

00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,649
take it seriously and that sort of thing

00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:24,149
so we've removed that and it's greatly

00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:25,889
disappearing from all the licenses

00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:30,269
around the place it still appears in

00:31:25,889 --> 00:31:33,029
some places we did get one person

00:31:30,269 --> 00:31:35,669
actually I got an email from an employer

00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:36,779
and another country I won't name who

00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:38,429
said we've noticed one of our employees

00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:39,989
has been selling your material for a

00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:43,019
very high price but it's available for

00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:44,970
free on the internet is this ethical and

00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:46,679
so repeat see well that's what the

00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,999
license says we do ask them if they

00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:49,889
could donate something back if they

00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:51,059
wanted in fact funnily enough we've got

00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:54,919
a donation from him yesterday

00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,919
have you started talking to him about it

00:31:55,430 --> 00:32:00,200
but the we do have a reasonably large

00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:02,870
team working on this material and it is

00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,960
sponsored by Google and Microsoft micro

00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:07,460
introduced by the way and that was

00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,810
simply because say Microsoft Fletcher I

00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:10,220
don't know if they've got several ways

00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:13,160
of giving away money there's Microsoft

00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,600
who's basically trying to sell software

00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,500
there's Microsoft french-fries who

00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,880
trying to make the world a better place

00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,520
and then things like the Bill and

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,690
Melinda Gates Foundation much less awful

00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,200
entries I just got an email out of the

00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,790
blue saying

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,470
nearly everyone we've been supporting

00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:26,420
around the world with says that they're

00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:29,630
using your material so we'd like to give

00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:31,010
you thousands of dollars so you know you

00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:32,870
know it's like you give these letters

00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:35,540
we're from Microsoft but like he hasn't

00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:47,390
sort of just before my entered the

00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:49,010
deleted the the thing is that our

00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,960
condition was it is always going to be

00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:52,970
open source and it's always gonna have a

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,180
Creative Commons license and no that's

00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:57,080
cool we just basically companies like

00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,760
this what they want to do is just

00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,250
improve the quality of what's around so

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:07,940
they can tips you know cream off bit of

00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:09,140
people at the other in the yeah in terms

00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,360
of other people contribute I know if you

00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:27,560
maybe um Jake I'll let you say a little

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:29,330
bit about there we get hello so it's now

00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,060
in github and it's surprising we don't

00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:35,390
market it we don't publish it anywhere

00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,890
really without the title mints but we've

00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:40,100
had lots of contributions from people in

00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:42,290
Mike Holland in Norway people we can't

00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,480
even speak over a normal language with

00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:48,170
but they all am submit and pull requests

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,160
for typos or additions and whatnot so

00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:50,660
it's pretty cool just to see that

00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,970
naturally occurring people just coming

00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:55,040
across it and could you bring that way

00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,350
as well I think one of the things is

00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,430
that it it's actually the two websites

00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:01,130
we're running now have a lot of

00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:02,840
interaction and then that you can try

00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:05,060
out computer programs that implement

00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:07,410
some of the stuff that has been taught

00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:11,010
but also

00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:16,679
demonstrations in fact just could be do

00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:18,810
my favorite yeah won't work yeah

00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,149
yeah there we go so I took this you know

00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:23,010
you're at a Linux conference win the

00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:25,340
lime scoot why must be saying there's

00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:28,490
something happening in Canterbury

00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:32,909
Canterbury University but we one of the

00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:35,639
bits of software that we wrote is you

00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:39,540
can drop it drop a photo onto the site

00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:41,429
and actually actually zoom in on it and

00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,510
the interesting thing is you know

00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:45,389
teachers will tell you that that's a

00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:48,030
pixel but it's never occurred to them

00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:51,990
that a megapixel is a million pixels

00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:53,970
it's bigger as just means huge right and

00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:57,720
fun fact who's come from Australia to be

00:34:53,970 --> 00:35:00,090
here so to megameters there you go

00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,820
doesn't sound so bad does it if you're

00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,980
from the from the New York coast of

00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,320
Australia at East Coast but as we keep

00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:10,710
zooming in and we can talk about pixels

00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:13,680
and how you know everything's digital

00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:18,330
like that but we've got it so that it

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:19,740
actually comes up with the digits who

00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:25,920
would have thought that a digital photo

00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:27,810
is just digital and it's RGB and

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:39,650
actually one of the cool things that we

00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:41,850
have added know that's going on the list

00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:49,460
you can zoom in and see people holding

00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:53,369
cards millions of them I love it okay

00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:55,770
yeah but the idea that essentially this

00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:58,290
is what a computer can see and we were

00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:59,790
the green bits and in particular we you

00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:02,640
can bring up a green screen photo you

00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:04,530
know which is the face which is then how

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,700
are we doing facial recognition and the

00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,500
next thing we get into the ethics of

00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:09,810
recognizing faces and what color is a

00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,250
face and cultural issues and things like

00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:14,700
that who would have thought it's about

00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:17,130
people and yet it's just a bunch of

00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,790
digits and so it gives us lots of

00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,590
options

00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:23,250
the other fun thing about this is that

00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:25,850
it has to work on a school device yeah

00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:27,930
okay you know what I'm talking about

00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:30,690
could be ten years old it could be

00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:32,970
donated it could be a BYO that could be

00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:35,460
anything it could be a Chromebook it

00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:37,350
could be a tablet it could be you know

00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:40,170
an old iPad school who knows what it

00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:42,360
what it is and it basically works on the

00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:44,810
wall that we can find except up to super

00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,160
cruddy really really old machines yeah

00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:49,560
and be reminded on use Eiland to

00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,910
Australian school device but a device

00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,940
that you might find in a country where

00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:56,510
computers aren't necessarily that

00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:56,510
up-to-date

00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:02,450
the I guess the other fun thing that's

00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:12,150
with this came up quite a bit is when we

00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:15,270
translate things with customization so

00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,260
this is a searching strategy you know we

00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,120
have things that are sorted and unsorted

00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,620
how long does it take to find something

00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,970
one of the surprises is you know you

00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,650
make something twice as big it hardly

00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,010
takes any extra time to search that sort

00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:25,830
of thing

00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:27,840
that instead of saying print this PDF

00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:29,430
document you can choose whether it's

00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,580
easy numbers for younger kids big

00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:34,380
numbers that are searching for whether

00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,000
the instruction seats sheets there

00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,010
whether it should have lots of pink on

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,540
it or whether you know like if you've

00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:44,700
got easy access to color printers then

00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:49,620
you know you want to avoid that if and

00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:54,420
so on but then it could be a different

00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:57,270
language as well I thank you and so and

00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,410
then it can be customized so every

00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:00,380
student in the class gets a different

00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:02,850
sheet and you know different numbers but

00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:04,590
if any of you have set problems picking

00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:07,880
numbers that are a good example there's

00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:09,900
always a challenge as well so just

00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,810
setting the right problems

00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:15,120
so this basically you can write Python

00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:18,750
code to generate these things thanks to

00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:20,160
the work that we did so yeah most of the

00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:21,600
numbers here they're all rigged so the

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,100
examples work well and you don't want to

00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,330
have a search and demonstration where

00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,250
they find it on the very first guess

00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,750
because it's perfectly in the middle so

00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:29,910
we generally try and find the right spot

00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,050
for those numbers to go yet to mention

00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,530
that we ran and we generate those

00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,570
numbers

00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:35,490
because we can have every child in class

00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:37,080
having a unique example which is great

00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,280
so when one person does it they don't

00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,770
yell it out and everyone's like oh

00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,830
you've run my experience now everyone

00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:44,730
can have their own unique examples at

00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,170
the moment they're just pre-generated

00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,660
but we're working on the ability that

00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:49,530
you can would generate them on the fly

00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,660
once we get around to doing that and

00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:52,980
they'll be great you can label it with

00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,720
your school you can make it for a

00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,890
conference for a hundred people and push

00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:02,700
a button and out it comes the other end

00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:06,210
yeah so this was fun

00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:08,970
sorry text translating on these on these

00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:10,859
printables or resources when you change

00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:13,980
them make to German in particular

00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:16,349
generally words are longer so we had to

00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:18,510
make it fit across languages so we have

00:39:16,349 --> 00:39:21,630
a and we have code that will calculate

00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:23,400
the right wrapping of the lines and the

00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,690
correct size so you can see that on the

00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,640
right hand side that we've got the

00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,619
German text compared to the English on

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,359
the left and it all pretty much stays to

00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:34,140
the right spots but even just the words

00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:36,810
culture as well if you want to go back

00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:40,349
to the treasure hunt one so the picture

00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:42,180
of the treasure chests on those on those

00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:43,920
printables that doesn't exist anymore

00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:46,170
because we realized that the chests are

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,520
labeled a b c d there are some cultures

00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:50,160
where that doesn't really make sense

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,750
right our that that doesn't really work

00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,250
it probably would you know most people

00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:55,589
probably know what ages ed is but we

00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:57,390
want to make it as easy as possible and

00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:58,890
so we changed it are you probably own

00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:01,770
for photo of it but it's now using

00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,510
colored shapes so you have Circle Square

00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:05,490
triangle and then there's ones which are

00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:08,130
outlined and - we try to make it as

00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:11,640
accessible as possible surprises keep

00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:13,260
jumping yet so we my favorite examples

00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,330
Oh piano keyboard is a good example of

00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,580
modular arithmetic but you go through a

00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,170
seven notes in your back to the original

00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:22,849
note and that was easy to make this was

00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:28,099
quick and then Tim in the German said

00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:28,099
the note B is called H in our language

00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:34,650
why there's a really interesting answer

00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:38,280
actually because B means bfet because

00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:40,320
that gives you a melodic minor scale

00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,940
which was the more natural scale whereas

00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,589
the major scale with it would be you

00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:47,910
asked

00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:49,769
in terms other passion yeah so so b-flat

00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:51,959
was the natural meaning of be in our

00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:53,369
Tim's and so when you get up to G the

00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:57,930
next leader for something that's common

00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:59,759
as H and in the rest of Europe it's not

00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:02,489
ABC doesn't really mean much either

00:40:59,759 --> 00:41:04,380
okay and in fact that's just Europe and

00:41:02,489 --> 00:41:04,739
there's actually other versions here as

00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,019
well

00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:10,319
Asia numbers tend to be used and there's

00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:11,880
other notations as well so just when we

00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:14,309
think we've got a great example a

00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:18,029
translator or say yeah they're won't

00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:19,410
mean anything in my culture and it alone

00:41:18,029 --> 00:41:21,569
was something like the binary numbers

00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:24,959
that we were doing just before four

00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:27,749
letters of the alphabet and again not so

00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:30,630
hard with Latin based languages but it

00:41:27,749 --> 00:41:33,239
does get tricky suffice it to say that

00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:38,009
we tried to solve each of these in a

00:41:33,239 --> 00:41:39,539
sustainable kind of way and but it does

00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:40,680
make for quite a bit behind the scenes I

00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:43,349
guess one of the other fun things with

00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,829
translations so we opened our

00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:48,059
translations to all it's free to do and

00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:49,499
no one was really touched next we hadn't

00:41:48,059 --> 00:41:51,839
you know told anyone about it and then

00:41:49,499 --> 00:41:53,699
one day we had a surge of translators

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:54,959
about a hundred to two hundred people

00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:56,729
were signing up and just started

00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:59,880
translating a content I'm like this is

00:41:56,729 --> 00:42:01,829
weird it turns out there is an online

00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,029
group called utopian which encouraged

00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:05,130
people to contribute to open source

00:42:03,029 --> 00:42:07,739
projects and then they get paid with a

00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:09,569
blockchain currency that they can redeem

00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:12,019
and so they were just coming in

00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:14,849
translating it so they could get paid

00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:16,079
but they weren't translating of

00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:18,150
knowledge of their head they were using

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,369
Google Translate and when you have a

00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,499
technical document with keywords like

00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:23,670
algorithms and whatnot the corn the

00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:25,380
content out the other side is pretty

00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:28,289
poor now there were some people who were

00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,880
genuinely genuinely translating the

00:42:28,289 --> 00:42:31,799
content and they were great but it was

00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,719
very hard to pick them apart from

00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:36,329
everybody else so we had to scrap all

00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:37,769
that work and start again we now accept

00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:40,829
it from anybody but we now have to pay

00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:44,869
an official translating service to then

00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:44,869
proof check and check it at the end

00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:53,189
about half a million words so far so if

00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:54,520
you've got spare time so transferring

00:42:53,189 --> 00:42:57,220
yep but

00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:00,190
one of the big scenes we have finished

00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:01,930
with a factory of Maori proverb which

00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:04,359
actually captures a lot of what this

00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:06,760
whole work is about this mahi which is

00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:08,440
here are her to Mir Nui Katina R which

00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:10,020
is you asked me what's the most

00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:14,530
important thing you may have heard this

00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:17,650
Mac o ik it are - I'll tell you most

00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:20,170
important thing is your tangata which is

00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:23,200
people there's actually three things six

00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:26,980
winners here tangata in the food winners

00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,839
it tango - and that's a lot of you know

00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,640
where we've ended up is you start with

00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:33,220
people and you finish with people and

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:36,280
yes we need binary numbers and

00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:37,660
programming and operating systems and

00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,390
all sorts of weird and wonderful stuff

00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:42,339
but if you can ground that then it means

00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:45,430
the most school teachers are going to

00:43:42,339 --> 00:43:47,080
see the point of it and they can and if

00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:48,520
you give them resources that are open

00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,690
and free then they can trust that it's

00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,040
not only disappeared that they're not

00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:53,440
gonna be charged a whole lot next year

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,450
for it or anything like that and they

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,220
can contribute to it and the other thing

00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:00,099
is that when I say we actually there's a

00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:02,440
property about you know nearly a hundred

00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:04,330
people probably have contributed in some

00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,700
way and many practicing teachers have

00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:09,480
contributed and basically and we have a

00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:12,099
few practicing teachers on our staff now

00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,869
so that they basically if they say that

00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:15,609
will never work we just go thank you

00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:19,089
rather than we know what we're doing

00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:20,440
we're computer scientists I think we can

00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:23,010
open up for questions

00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,010
yeah

00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:32,230
we use a place called crowdin but if you

00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:34,180
go to the websites for unplugged or the

00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:35,320
I think definitely on unplugged it

00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:38,260
towards the bottom of it there's a link

00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,490
to translate somewhere and on field

00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:44,880
guide we're opening that up pretty soon

00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:44,880
as well getting kraut crowded

00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:09,220
how do you do that I just yeah is it

00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:12,930
like yeah just a general overview

00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:12,930
because I'm just thinking as a teacher

00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:22,869
so but we'll use the example of

00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:24,520
searching so what you know one of the

00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:26,020
things so we don't teach binary search

00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,000
you don't need to know binary search but

00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,320
you need to know that if I give you you

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,119
know a thousand things in sorted order

00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:32,290
you can find something very quickly the

00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,589
trouble is if I say I'm giving you

00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:37,089
numbers from one to a thousand and and I

00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:38,890
want you to find the number 800 you'll

00:45:37,089 --> 00:45:41,290
look about 80% of the way through it

00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:44,079
so we deliberately have a non-uniform

00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:45,310
distribution and this is where you'll

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,490
just need to put your evil teacher

00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:51,910
mindset on and go okay I'm gonna go from

00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:53,859
you know 1 to 900 right at the start and

00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:55,240
then all the numbers are between 900 you

00:45:53,859 --> 00:45:58,119
know just trying to break any patterns

00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:00,329
and so on and so we've just kept that in

00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:03,160
Python code that generates the numbers

00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:05,440
doing at different ways but never but

00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,970
very uneven and evenly distributed so if

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:13,930
they try and be clever they realize that

00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:14,700
they have to stall yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:16,810
yeah

00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,450
and so you can improve it if you've got

00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:22,540
a more evil way of making it making it

00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:24,339
educational some of our Interactive's

00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:27,220
are really fun for the human-computer

00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:29,410
interaction chapter we need to show how

00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:33,040
an interface can be frustrating without

00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:35,440
purposely making and quit our chapter so

00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:38,109
we're to make a I think David you made

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,730
this the calculator was a trim someone

00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:43,329
made a calculator for us and we had to

00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:45,760
make a particularly awful calculator my

00:46:43,329 --> 00:46:48,369
favorite one actually was a check box oh

00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,250
yeah with a delay turns out really hard

00:46:48,369 --> 00:46:53,650
to program browsers to add a delay to a

00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:57,790
check box because no one ever wants to

00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:59,710
do that but we get around it but yeah so

00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:01,480
it's all use it's already in all the

00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:04,210
text is written in markdown it goes

00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:07,030
through a system we have in Python and

00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:10,240
we use Django to publish a Delap and the

00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:12,609
printable resources a series of images

00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,040
created and they'll create into a PDF

00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:17,870
you

00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:20,330
a pillow and Weezie print so but it's

00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:23,330
all documented some parts more than

00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:33,740
others but it's it's all open and free

00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:36,080
there's no hidden pass so yeah how well

00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:39,320
does work for sweaters so the field

00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:40,670
guide was intended for that it's able

00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,190
you know it's more setup for an

00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:45,050
individual and Planck teens to be

00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:46,880
assuming a class size of 20 or 30

00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:48,470
because it's a number and

00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,640
under-resourced education system you

00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:54,350
have to have 1 to 20 ratios in there but

00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,580
most of the activities you can do that

00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:57,530
like for example they just come in

00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:59,420
different formats I needed 5 people for

00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:01,820
their demonstration but actually you can

00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:04,010
sit around a table with 5 cards and say

00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:05,600
what do I do needs to know what's the

00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:07,010
people and most of them have been done

00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,000
in a way I mean in the end some of them

00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:12,020
can be done as board games that that and

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,340
with there is actually a version

00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:14,900
floating around that's a parent-child

00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,650
version so if you're a parent was one

00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,480
kid

00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:19,340
it suggests see how to adapt them for

00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,560
that as well

00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:24,200
yeah so it's and some of them are fine

00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,730
just one-to-one anyway so I unplugged as

00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,830
I resource written primarily at the

00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:29,420
teachers to teach to their students

00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:31,190
while field diet is more aimed for the

00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:32,300
students to directly use it on the

00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,920
machine or whatever and read through it

00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:35,240
and work through it there is a teachers

00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,880
version of the field guide which has

00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,410
extra information like the solution to a

00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,120
question or something like that

00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:43,340
and you can find the teachers version by

00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:45,230
going to the end of the about this is

00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,580
one of the other fun problems it's open

00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:50,090
source so the teachers version of all

00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:51,650
the answers can't be hidden right but

00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:53,240
the way we hit it is you have to read a

00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:54,740
whole paragraph of text before you find

00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,750
out where it is and we think that's

00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:58,890
pretty childproof

00:48:56,750 --> 00:49:00,809
plus we just made the teachers pension

00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:02,700
pretty boring like if you're gonna rate

00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:04,440
it it's more like teaching methods and

00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,970
methodologies and the solution you're

00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,589
only you know happening your own

00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:09,809
learning by reading it what you also

00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:11,160
made the header bright red so if a

00:49:09,809 --> 00:49:14,059
teacher walks past their computer they

00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,059
can tell which version they're on

00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:35,119
yeah but it doesn't necessarily have

00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:36,590
government involvement oh sorry it does

00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:39,200
have quite a bit of gunk involvement as

00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:41,060
well but when I say government bear in

00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,190
mind that we I mean this is used in

00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:44,720
dozens of countries and so the

00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:47,450
government involvement is often a

00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,220
teacher or in officials saying to us hey

00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:51,440
can we use this and we go yeah you know

00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:53,360
knock yourself out and then Lim saying

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,830
but in our culture when you know like

00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,230
these Christmas trees and what about

00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:58,310
it's like you know we're Christmas trees

00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:01,400
aren't allowed there's any one country

00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:06,170
that's complained about them America

00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:07,730
yeah yeah no Israel the Arabic

00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:09,410
translations now Christmas trees a fan

00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:11,930
no problem China different knows what a

00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:17,750
Christmas tree look at the seaweed you

00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:19,430
know but anyway but but people you know

00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,810
so we've got teachers coming to us we've

00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:24,440
got Education officials from all over

00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:25,850
the world and we try not to write this

00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,220
for New Zealand if that makes sense and

00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:29,750
in fact you know one point probably five

00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:32,060
years ago people was could say to me

00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:34,990
must be amazing in New Zealand you must

00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:37,190
have this in every school in this light

00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,960
there are people fighting this going

00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:40,850
into the curriculum at the moment but

00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,869
yeah and by the way the other thing is

00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:43,880
wit because I was working on the

00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:45,260
curriculum I didn't push this him so

00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:48,530
we're running workshops for teachers on

00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:49,609
lots of ways of doing things and and one

00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:51,500
teacher came to me once you see the

00:50:49,609 --> 00:50:52,820
stats all very cool Tom but this is a

00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:54,859
really cool website you should know

00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:57,109
about it's yeah I think I think would be

00:50:54,859 --> 00:50:58,490
good to share with teachers that was my

00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:59,930
own podesta go okay we will use

00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:03,380
unplugged as well when you're showing

00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:04,820
teachers how to do things but if so this

00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:06,770
is just one teaching tool and and it's

00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:13,160
it's more used as a gateway drug sort of

00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:14,690
thing if it makes sense like like well

00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:17,090
yeah if you say to teachers you know

00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:18,170
teach programming nah you know I even

00:51:17,090 --> 00:51:20,030
knows that's horrible

00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:22,670
but if you say oh just play with these

00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:24,500
cards it sounds evil now doesn't it yeah

00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:26,060
then then the yeah I like playing with

00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,350
cards I like photocopying stuff I like

00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,609
printing things out and sticking you

00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,560
know and all that sort of thing I I'm

00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:32,450
comfortable it's my space and then you

00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:34,100
go ah well now if you really want it to

00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:35,660
happen automatically if you don't want a

00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,760
million people holding cards

00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:42,850
I can show you how to do that in a few

00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,850
lines of code yeah and suddenly they kid

00:51:51,100 --> 00:52:03,740
last question can you print the dots on

00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:11,810
overhead transparencies and teach

00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:13,220
quantum computing okay just going on the

00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:18,530
issues list now raised on the github

00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:19,670
