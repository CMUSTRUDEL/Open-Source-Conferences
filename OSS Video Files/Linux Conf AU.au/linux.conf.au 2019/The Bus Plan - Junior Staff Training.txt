Automation is incredibly useful, but is it limiting the ability of our junior staff to actually learn?

In this current age of SaaS/IaaS, the effort required now to set up a blog or a website or do anything these days is minimal - with just the click of a button it's all up and working due to the wonderful power of automation.

What if the button doesn't work? 

What if you need to go further, or do something more complex? 

People are relying on automation more and more. So how do we educate our staff to be able to deal with it whether that be maintaining, fixing or even replacing?

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

okay thanks that so yeah as the slide

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,680
says I'm here to talk about the bus plan

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:10,200
and how it affects jr. start training

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,160
particular around automation he is my

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:17,760
concern my concern mostly is the fact

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,670
that started coming in to the business

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,289
at all levels across various different

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,109
industries where automation is the focus

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,500
and they come in saying automation is

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,240
the best but if we go to them going how

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,669
do we do this without automation because

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,250
the puppet masters down something's

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,070
broken your it takes time to push it

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,350
through your automation can they do it

00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:44,460
it's new movement and the answer is yeah

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,079
maybe which is a little bit wiring so

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,210
yeah just quick sorry who me

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,520
Andrew Jeffrey was already another slide

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,320
just to sort of reinforce it planes

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,920
contact secure well I think that's me

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,910
yes I'm a solutions engineer anchor

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,920
systems in Sydney

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,489
we're a managed service writer mostly

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,559
focusing around Amazon Web Services and

00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:05,850
we do a lot of custom bespoke solutions

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,710
for customers so everything is a little

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:13,890
bit different just a quick disclaimer

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,930
views and mine not my employers they

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:21,210
sent me here though so I'll let you take

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:23,400
that so why am i giving the talk as part

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,740
of what I said earlier the concern is

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,229
that the staff are coming in or only

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,180
thinking about automation they come in

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,430
they go I've played with puppet I've

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,869
played without spool and when you dig

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,360
into that a bit deeper it's like yep

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,180
cool I downloaded a playbook from a

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,520
spool galaxy and I ran it okay but can

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,110
you do what that PlayBook does manually

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,280
do you understand it did you verify

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,899
where it came from

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,840
did you do anything else that's

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,509
necessary for it to work or did you just

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,049
download it and run it is essentially my

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,689
main concern and the main reason I'm

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,670
coming across it is we're trying to

00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:01,320
solve that problem my employer and we're

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,899
starting to bring people up through some

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,540
slightly different methods to have the

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,090
awareness to be able to do things

00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:11,929
without that or before you have to get

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,929
the automation involved

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,269
the bus plan who here has heard the bus

00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:21,120
plan or is familiar the phrasing bus

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:24,659
plan bus factor you know yeah that half

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,299
okay so it's essentially a measurement

00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:29,849
of risk resulting from departure or

00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:31,019
sudden vanishing of staff from both an

00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,030
information perspective and a

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,220
capabilities perspective so information

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,470
is documentation lots people are cover

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,480
that today I'm talking at capabilities

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,980
in terms of their skill sets do they

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,299
actually have the skills and knowledge

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,970
to actually execute on your

00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,349
documentation because if you give them

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,140
documentation saying here's a pacemaker

00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,299
class stop run all these commands if

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:55,440
they don't know what pacemaker is

00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:57,540
there's some problems so just a quick

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,450
disclaimer again another second

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,920
disclaimer it's a bad sign

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,989
automation isn't bad I don't dislike

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,730
automation I write automation for a

00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,400
living extensively in my day to day job

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:12,959
I use three or four different automation

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,709
technologies on a daily basis but in

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,709
this particular situation

00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:31,260
staying yes good ok so yeah I use puppet

00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,690
absolute and terraform along with the

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,090
collection of custom tooling ah that we

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,680
use it at work so quite a bit of random

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,129
automation quite a lot of different ones

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,739
so automation I know is a pretty broad

00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:45,660
term I've worked up in sort of four

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,730
little sections here I know it's still

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,660
pretty broad but just to mostly help

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,190
focus on what we're going to talk about

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,269
I mostly talked about configuration

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,560
management and infrastructure as code

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:57,359
today custom tooling it's got its own

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,659
sort of side effects they all do they're

00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:03,209
pretty common how many of you use

00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:06,900
automation in some form puppet chef at

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:09,540
school infrastructure as code see ICD

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,069
pipelines and how many of you have lots

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,720
of random custom scripts and tools

00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:15,060
you've written internally the kind of

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,130
automation like anyway you're they run

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,880
by a cron it's all automated Cron's

00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,139
automated it's all mentioned you know

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,479
okay I'll get there I can argue that

00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,750
point to death right so in this

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,590
situation

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,180
I can't use actual code examples

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,440
alterations got lots of buttons lots and

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,120
lots of buttons so that picture is a

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,900
ballast control panel on a nuclear

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,150
submarine so if you press the wrong

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:44,220
button or the wrong combinations of

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:47,410
buqun's you're gonna have a fun time

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,690
your things could work the wrong thing

00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,770
could happen nothing could happen it

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,150
could throw a weird error that you then

00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:56,920
have to go look up in probably a book

00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:58,570
that's yeah thick printing paper so you

00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,040
need to understand not just what the

00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,450
button is labeled to do but what

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,160
behind-the-scenes is happening when you

00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:06,730
push the button or you change those

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,710
values in your automation it's

00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,380
particularly important when you get into

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:14,050
situations where the button doesn't

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:19,240
exist or in this case wasn't actually

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:23,230
implemented as you can see there yeah

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,720
great I've gone right so I went to use

00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:29,680
that functionality for a customer it's

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:31,150
not there was the scenario that I got

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,180
given by a junior staff member who came

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:37,180
to me so it's it's there it just says to

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,520
be added later it's literally the entire

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:43,930
file and later on I found out I'd

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,550
written that yeah because the first

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,720
comment was uh who would write that

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,520
that's not me it's not made sure it

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,280
wouldn't be me it was me

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,560
so yeah in this case the scenario is

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,210
okay the button is not there do they

00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,400
have the understanding sure you can copy

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,040
code that does similar things but you

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,710
don't know what you need to do how do

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,260
you understand what needs to change or

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,479
if you need add something completely new

00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,669
in this case you there's functions for

00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:12,700
open the doors there's no function for

00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:14,200
closing the doors you can extrapolate

00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,530
some of the logic you need from the

00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:21,370
functions open the doors I'd hope but

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:23,440
what if we need to make the doors open

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,320
or closed in a different direction just

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:31,330
to be weird because customers asked for

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:34,030
weird things so in this scenario they

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:36,669
need to have played ideally with the

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,100
doors in the scenario manually in some

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:40,420
aspect without hurting themselves

00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:45,660
because that would be somewhat dangerous

00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:48,040
an elevator so if they play with it

00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,420
without using the automation they're

00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,680
going to have a better concept and

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:52,060
understanding of where they need to go

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,510
look to be able to implement those

00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,870
changes to make the fixes otherwise

00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:00,700
they're going to spend a lot longer

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:02,170
writing your automation and then

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,460
probably fixing the automation multiple

00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,680
times over the next couple of months or

00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,930
weeks depending on what the scenario is

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,280
and what how badly it is because they'll

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,960
add the initial thing that'll go great I

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,090
can use it elsewhere ah now it needs

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,070
this feature and this feature and this

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,260
feature and this feature then you rent

00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:20,200
backup to pretty much you've got one

00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:22,870
button and it's doing about six

00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,700
different things what if it stops

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:29,110
halfway through what do you do if it

00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:33,360
doesn't return anything did it work

00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:36,460
how do I tell how do we deal with that

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:42,010
so mostly the solution is do it the

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:44,830
manual way so the key process for me is

00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:48,490
we do with a lot of web hosting at

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:51,940
anchor so we have Apache nginx is the

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,600
main two web servers we use every custom

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:54,880
is slightly different

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,860
the main issue you get is that the

00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,470
configurations are very different per

00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:03,430
customer and sometimes we add options

00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:05,080
that we've never used before and if I go

00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,650
to a junior staff and we go how do you

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,050
add this option and they go well I can

00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,750
just add the option and Papa great the

00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:16,440
options not there its new function new

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:19,960
feature it's only been released just now

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:24,400
how do we go out that so what we do is

00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,990
we train them so the way I've been doing

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,080
training this is something that we're

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,600
still in process of doing is we start

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,800
out with a virtual server that is

00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,560
completely blank there's no automation

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,580
on it there's nothing like that we

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,550
literally give them very vague

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:41,919
instructions install WordPress was the

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:45,550
instruction I gave I don't care what web

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,660
server you use database you're anything

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:51,310
I'm not first get WordPress up and

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,759
document your steps on the blog the e

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:57,670
running in WordPress

00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,720
after you've done that then we start

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:03,250
playing with it then we start extending

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,110
things okay add SSL what if I want to

00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,720
have more - WordPress sites how does

00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:11,230
that change your setup what if I need to

00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,990
add caching what if I need to move the

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:17,139
database to a separate server how do I

00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:20,139
make it highly available we start

00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:22,560
expanding upon it we tweak it we change

00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:25,300
it we log in and we break things and

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,079
sometimes we delete things do they have

00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,610
backups it's one way to find out since

00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:34,000
it's all the training exercise it's

00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,500
perfectly safe to do that that's the

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,980
main idea we're trying to get across is

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,170
that you should not be afraid of

00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,720
touching things manually especially in

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,000
complex environments because in a lot of

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,730
cases making the change via automation

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,490
or an automated process will take a very

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,800
long time or may not necessarily be

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,170
something you can achieve at this

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,720
present state with your skill set your

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:02,769
you may need to put the fix in manually

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,329
to test if it works in so we go through

00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:08,800
that we build through the entire

00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:11,949
environment we test it all and we just

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,899
keep expanding on it and I've actually

00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:18,100
hid it 10 minutes Wow that's why I get

00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:28,589
for not rehearsing no no I was saying

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:32,399
I'm done yep yeah so I expected that

00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:32,399
yeah questions please

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:46,130
so it it sounded like you were

00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:48,360
describing a sort of a series of

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,500
training plans for your junior staff

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,330
members when you're talking about

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,520
starting with a simple little server and

00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:57,779
then add feature X feature why do you

00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,490
have any process to decide on what that

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:02,010
in state is do you take a look at what

00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,750
your infrastructure looks like say I I

00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,190
want this to be my end state for

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,250
whatever they build so what's the

00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:12,810
simplest thing I can start with somewhat

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:15,839
yes since we tend to do a large portion

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:18,089
of what we do is web hosting it's

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,560
usually sort of the websites the key

00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,180
focus oh it's just mostly expanding it

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,339
to make it highly available and then

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,690
adding different things you get I said

00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,120
WordPress was the initial scenario but

00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,470
what if it's a ruby app you know you get

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,450
there's tons of scenarios out there on

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,910
how to set up WordPress with your PHP

00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:36,899
fpm there's a fair few scenarios about

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:38,190
setting up Ruby or Python it's

00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,870
completely different sort of kettle of

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,890
fish though because the way things work

00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,570
is different and they have to sort of

00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,760
change things okay the customers

00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,839
actually come back and said oops we're

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,480
not actually using WordPress we're now

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,010
using Ruby what do you need to change

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,300
how do you change it what do you say to

00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,800
the customer in the situation we're

00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:58,800
training from multiple purposes not just

00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:00,990
a technical one with your junior staff

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,270
and like um inducting them like what

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:08,010
kind of percentage of like real work and

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:10,760
training work do you split up it sort of

00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:13,250
varies depending on all sorts of

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,730
variables

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:19,410
mostly it's probably about a 30/70 split

00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:22,470
so 30 percent training 70 percent sort

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:23,910
of real work we try and include actual

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,250
work as training within reasons like

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,630
sort of carefully reviewed and sort of

00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,890
mentor than someone's that they're

00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:33,120
staffing them sort through the process

00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:36,180
so yeah as for their actual sort of

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,910
obviously across stuff like this it's

00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:39,839
usually sort of you can work on a bit

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:41,579
during hours you can also play with

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,970
after hours you want to do other weird

00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:47,730
stuff outside of what we've sort of

00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:49,140
asked you to do you're it's not set in

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:50,430
stone that you have to just do those

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,449
things if you want to play with

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,370
something else you can play with

00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:54,630
something else

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:58,649
you know we sort of want to enable them

00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:00,240
to be able to learn and extend their

00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:10,980
knowledge with systems that we may not

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:13,589
be familiar with do you transition in

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:16,740
your training from doing it manually to

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:20,010
doing it automated and how do you just

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:23,250
so how do you decide when to do that

00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:25,410
transition yeah we do

00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,269
what we do is it starts out actually

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,670
using ansible and we sort of work the

00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:30,750
way up to puppet and scripting and

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,970
various things like that so in the

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,070
milk's of it so the initial sort of

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,690
virtual server build with just WordPress

00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,250
on up once they've got that up they've

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,660
got some backups it's the in a situation

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,640
of let's do okay

00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,829
cool I've flown all the way you've got

00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,170
it back up I want you to rebuild it

00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:47,519
right apps would rebuild it and then it

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,459
comes to sort of a clustered solution we

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,870
start working towards sort of a school

00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:53,519
or even puppet depending on the scenario

00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,350
and sort of we eventually since we use

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,870
puppet is our main automation technology

00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:04,020
we do end up using puppet in the end

00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:05,550
result and do you have like a preset

00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,110
training plan they you know you go

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:10,140
through with the staff that you're

00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,149
induct or is it just sort of you know

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,520
whoever's training on the day what they

00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:17,910
come up with to train them and if you

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,770
have a training plan and how do you you

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,930
know who does the task of actually

00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,490
making up those training plans I missed

00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,700
the last bit of that if you have a

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:30,540
training plan who makes up who makes up

00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:33,839
those training plans as to who makes

00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:36,360
them up me along with my color

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,740
colleagues we sort of look at where we

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:42,300
need to go where the weaknesses are on

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,770
the team what sort of we might be

00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,390
pursuing the future for a business

00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:48,930
effective of your technologies we might

00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:51,230
be deploying or technologies that we're

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:53,430
not using much but we expect to grow or

00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,110
technologies that there isn't much of it

00:14:53,430 --> 00:15:00,540
left but it's one of the more fiddly

00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:04,649
ones and they need to be aware of it do

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,430
you train one-on-one or in small groups

00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:08,000
or what is too

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:11,190
preferred approach I prefer one on one

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
because everyone learns differently has

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,440
different questions and inevitably with

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,670
it being Linux within reason you

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:29,790
encounter different issues depending on

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:33,300
whatever is happened one thing I've

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:34,709
noticed is that people like I'm familiar

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,360
the configuration management where you

00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:37,740
use but other people aren't so they tend

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,230
to try and avoid it do you have any tips

00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,300
for making it safe for them to play with

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,209
without breaking stuff in production and

00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,950
or just introducing them so they can

00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:48,480
become more familiar and yeah I guess

00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,899
it's that transition from doing it

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,180
manually

00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:57,779
how do you do that I guess yeah so our

00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:06,120
puppet is very unique I think would be

00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:07,500
the word it's uh it's a several tens of

00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,529
thousands lines diverged from mainstream

00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,330
puppet from the actual pup age and

00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:15,330
everything but just due to changes we've

00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:17,820
made for our various reasons the way we

00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,930
use it is bit non-standard in terms of

00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,370
getting them into it we've got a lot of

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:22,200
linton that happens both on the client

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,880
side and on the puppet master before

00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,040
anything gets rolled out that certainly

00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,839
helps some of the other changes we've

00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,920
made in terms of those your tens of

00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,560
thousands of lines of difference from

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,029
mainstream is that we have added a lot

00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,830
of sort of sanity checking into places

00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:36,990
that doesn't allow you for example

00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,180
install MySQL across your entire sort of

00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:42,240
infrastructure if you leave it you're

00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,890
outside the wrong set of brackets yeah

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,089
we sort of ease them into it mostly with

00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:49,260
a non custom version of puppet I guess

00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:50,790
to try and get them to understand the

00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,339
sort of principles of it that aren't

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,810
necessarily the ways we do it because

00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,190
we're not always of the opinion that

00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:59,279
everything we do is the best way to do

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:00,630
it because practices change and your if

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,970
our practices work for us we're not

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:03,990
likely to change them within reason we

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:07,050
don't want them to be stuck in the

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:10,280
mindset that everything we do is the

00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:10,280
right arts 100% of the time

00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,520
well thank you very much please join me

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,580
in thanking one last time

00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,580
