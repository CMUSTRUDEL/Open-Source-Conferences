Technological advancement is not just about intelligent design, clever cryptography or brilliant coding; it’s also a function of power. To make technology work for people, we need to take this power back – and demand that the development of technology involve social, political and ethical considerations. Protecting encryption is about protecting democracy – it is about shifting power away from states and companies and towards people. 

In late 2018, digital rights activists took on the national security establishment to try to resist attacks on encryption. It was a important and spirited effort but it was ultimately unsuccessful. The AABill passed, despite it being widely-accepted as a serious threat to our digital security. This talk will explain how that occurred, and how the intersection of technology and politics can be a challenging place for people interested in good public policy. 

If we are going to improve our laws and public policy in relation to technology, we are going to need to fight for it. This requires a broad based alliance. We must take highly technical debates to the mainstream. It means finding ways to discuss these issues with precision but also simplicity, with determination but also compassion. The opportunities are there provided we can organise and make the most of them.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

Peace Prize and she's also been named a

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:43,969
human rights hero by access now please

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:47,430
welcome Lizzy can you all hear me

00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:50,850
wonderful it is a genuine honor for me

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:52,649
to be here I have to say I'm so grateful

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,510
to be asked and to be standing in front

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,610
of the open source community I'm a big

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,899
admirer of the work that you do I have

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,270
also written a book which talks about

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,320
history and politics and technology and

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,870
I've got a chapter where I talk about

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,580
the importance of open source but I'm

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,229
wanted to also acknowledge the

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,850
conference organizers because this has

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,439
been a wonderful experience it's been

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,729
very well organized I'm extremely

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,350
impressed with how it's been put

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,150
together and I think they're deserving

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,100
knowledge meant so the many hundreds of

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,380
hours of volunteer time is incredibly

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,680
valuable and I think we all owe them a

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,680
debt of gratitude

00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:33,620
so I wanted to start by saying that I

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,350
think as an activist and as a lawyer who

00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,820
advocates for digital rights that I see

00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,370
the open source community really as a

00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,720
set of natural allies for us we're all

00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,120
committed to transparency and

00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,760
accountability in writing of both code

00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,070
and law and we're all committed to an

00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,900
egalitarian and respectful relationship

00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,390
between users and developers of

00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,640
technology and I think the open source

00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,080
community can be an immense source of

00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,820
strength when working in partnership

00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,370
with digital rights activists and the

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,870
reverse is also true and perhaps more

00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,730
than that I actually think we can't win

00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:07,280
any of these arguments unless we work

00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,350
and collaborate together so the short

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,900
version of my talk for anyone interested

00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:15,770
is that the access and assistance bill

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:19,220
now Act is a disaster of both policy and

00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,990
also democratic process and it's going

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,730
to have very far-reaching implications I

00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,650
think not just here in Australia but

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,300
around the world so if that's all you

00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,800
need to hear that's fine I'm now going

00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,780
to go into quite a bit more detail as to

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,150
why I think that's the case but that's I

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,920
think the key takeaway and I think it's

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,160
really important that we work out how

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,410
such a law came into being and what we

00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,390
can do to build power to make sure that

00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,950
something like this doesn't happen again

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,930
and that we might be able to reverse

00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,209
some of these attacks on our civil and

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,980
digital liberties and that means I think

00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:50,770
that we need to make sure we do

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,180
everything we can to help those realize

00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,640
those who made a mistake realize what

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,310
they've done pay the price politically

00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,800
for it and put them to work at chlorine

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:03,170
back our digital and civil rights and

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,560
these are civil and digital rights that

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:08,000
very much would have been protected had

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,890
lawmakers listened to those who are

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,570
experts in the field and also the public

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,670
so of course it's easy to identify

00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:17,209
lawmakers as the key people who made

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:19,070
these mistakes but I also think it's not

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,290
just enough to think about them alone

00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,239
it's not enough to be correct about

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,070
policy positions it's very important to

00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,320
also be effective and we need to think

00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,910
about how power works in politics about

00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,350
how we can shift the mindset of

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,660
politicians perhaps not by looking to

00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:34,910
Canberra but by building our communities

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:36,109
and movements outside of those spaces

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,410
that can hold those lawmakers

00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:39,240
accountable

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,580
so what I'm going to use the time to

00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:43,440
talk about is some of the background and

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,360
the context to how this act came to be

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,090
tabled in our Parliament some of the

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,890
content of the act itself and then why I

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,920
think in practice it's going to be quite

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,570
disastrous the process of how it got

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,790
passed which is the eponymous

00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,550
sausage-making factory of Canberra and

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,170
then some reflections and on it all and

00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:03,750
some discussion about what we might be

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:06,510
able to do to correct the situation and

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,640
make sure it doesn't happen again so

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,950
I'll start by saying that the ia act

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,690
while it's very problematic is not

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,080
unprecedented it didn't come out of

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:19,620
nowhere since 2001 Australia is passed

00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,209
82 anti-terror laws all of which grant

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,110
considerable powers to a bunch of

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,900
different Commonwealth agencies

00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:27,930
including people like azo as well as

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,600
federal police as well as local state

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,010
based police agencies as well the one

00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,750
that comes in for special mention of

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,280
course is the data retention regime

00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:39,300
which you can see there was passed in

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,150
2015 and this I think is particularly

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,760
troubling law for this for technologists

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,740
around the world because it's it

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,970
requires companies to hold metadata

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,030
about their clients for up to two years

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,410
to be accessed by a long list of

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,210
agencies without a warrant

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,130
so no requirement to check whether this

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,950
is an appropriate use of power and we've

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:02,130
seen an expanding use of these kinds of

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,630
rules and despite being told that that

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:05,970
would be very limited in their effect

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:08,340
when the laws were debated it is

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,710
actually the reason why digital Rights

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,420
Watch came into being we watched how we

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,310
fought against the murder data retention

00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,110
regime and we ultimately lost it was

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,760
passed into law and we wanted to start

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,560
building our ranks so that we can we can

00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,450
stop these things happening we can try

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,920
and limit their worst excesses and we

00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,530
can try and create a culture of rights

00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,850
respecting politicians who make good

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,800
tech policies so that's where digital

00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,380
Rights which came into being noting that

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,060
there was an absence of digital rights

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,910
advocacy organization of course there

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,710
are others like AFA and many other

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,750
but we thought this was an opportunity

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,960
to build an organization which is what

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,880
we've done so it's also not

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,370
unprecedented in the sense that the UK

00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,350
has a very similar law and now I'll

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,030
explain why it's it's nowhere near as

00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,580
bad as the AAA Act but the snoopers

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,700
Charter did come into force it allows it

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,710
allows people to agencies to review

00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,650
browsing history it does allow some

00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:03,170
powers to - that are similar to the

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,810
Australian law with limits now this is

00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,330
not an accident so the United Kingdom

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,700
and Australia are both part of the five

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,990
eyes intelligence alliance now if you

00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,360
don't know what that is the five eyes is

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:16,580
the Anglophone countries so the United

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,620
Kingdom Australia the United States New

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,690
Zealand and Canada and that's a long

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,850
term intelligence sharing alliance who

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,710
cooperate on all sorts of things so

00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,990
since the Snowden revelations of course

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,970
we've seen a lot of encryption adopted

00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,430
as standard in mainstream services and

00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,540
this is a problem for law enforcement of

00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,430
course because it means they can't

00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,830
access people's communications as easily

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,050
which for privacy advocates is a good

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,270
thing of course but what it meant was

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,130
that they see this as a phenomenon as

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,500
I'm sure you all know of going dark so

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,880
it limits their capacity to conduct

00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,840
surveillance and they're trying to do

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,550
something about it

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,660
so the snoopers charter was really the

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,340
first foray into that space and then we

00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,620
know that the fibers had been talking

00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,480
for some time about focusing on in

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,420
tacking encryption specifically and

00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,940
using Australia as a place to do that as

00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,490
the fibres turned their attention to

00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,530
Australia because were the only Western

00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:13,610
democracy without a bill of rights which

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:15,740
i think is an astonishing fact we do not

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,030
that that puts the sinner in a category

00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,430
we don't want to be in for a bunch of

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,860
reasons it means our law doesn't have

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,720
the capacity to consider rights in a way

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,580
that it ought it means that we've become

00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,990
quite distinct from similar

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,790
jurisdictions around the world because

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,010
of it and it means also that we've

00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:33,460
become the place in which lawmakers can

00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,420
experiment with this egregious laws

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,190
without having to worry about the

00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,260
consequences from a rights perspective

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,910
so what happens is the firefights get

00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:42,380
together people like Peter Dutton and

00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,610
he's equivalent they talk about how to

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,470
make policy and where to do it

00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,060
and for digital rights activists I think

00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,080
it came as no surprise that Australia

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,689
would be the place

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,879
which some of the serious attempts to

00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:55,819
break encryption would happen for the

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,979
reason that I just mentioned so we get

00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:59,300
to 2017 where Malcolm Turnbull are

00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:02,180
supposedly very intellectual Prime

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,669
Minister talks about the war on math now

00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:08,479
the discussions were happening in 2017

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:10,129
we knew of course that this would be the

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,060
place where they wanted to experiment we

00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:13,849
didn't know what the bill would look

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,539
like at this stage and so that's when

00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:18,409
the politicians start talking about

00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:19,909
terrorists criminal hackers and

00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:23,569
pedophiles which is the great unholy

00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:25,310
trinity of authoritarian governments I

00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,990
think they're like the three horsemen of

00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:30,800
the authoritarian apocalypse you know

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,930
when you hear those terms that your

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,000
rights are going to be violated so

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:37,010
that's when these politicians started

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,390
talking about this and of course it's

00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,729
not quite clear to me whether Turnbull

00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:42,620
actually believed what he said about the

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,390
law of math laws of maths not applying

00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:46,370
in Australia but it also occurs to me

00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,709
that it doesn't really matter what we

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:52,370
can see here on display is the poverty

00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:54,140
of our political class they are not

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,760
prepared to stand up to the national

00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,079
security establishment when they ask for

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,570
powers they're not prepared to even ask

00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,620
why they might need those powers and

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,570
they're not even bothered by the

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,990
technical realities of the requests that

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:09,170
are being made so I think what we see in

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,790
this claim is is not really that the law

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,220
of math doesn't apply in Australia but

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,750
more that the laws of logic don't really

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,779
apply in politics politics is about

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:20,510
power it's not about good policy or

00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:22,610
technical realities or logic so in the

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,380
lead-up to this bill we're there for ads

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:26,180
digital rights activists and probably

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,220
many of you as observers of this space

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,110
sitting there waiting for a legislation

00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,430
or a bill to drop because we know it's

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,290
coming and we know that they're

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,380
preparing for it but of course it's all

00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:39,260
done behind closed doors so then we get

00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,630
to August 2018 which is when the first

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,779
public exposure draft of the bill was

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,949
made available now I want to tell you at

00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:47,390
this point a little bit about the

00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:49,100
content of the bill because it did end

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,870
up being passed largely unchanged and

00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,610
while it's a very complex piece of

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,199
legislation that amended many different

00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,640
acts I want to tell you a little bit

00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:57,709
about the most controversial aspects

00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,089
because I don't expect you've all got

00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:01,170
time to read it yourself and I've done

00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:03,660
that work for you so you don't have to

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,549
the key part of the legislation that

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,189
captured probably the most attention is

00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:11,009
a schedule that introduces some notices

00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:13,589
and requests so what these do is they

00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:16,199
allow certain agencies to provide these

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:19,499
to technology companies and others to do

00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,939
apps or things and all of these that

00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:23,669
none of these steps require the approval

00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:25,859
of the judge I should say so the steps

00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:28,199
are there the agency in each of these

00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:30,109
components have many things attached to

00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:32,519
them I should say so the agency can be

00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:34,589
anyone from the Northern Territory

00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,179
police right up to the Australian

00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:38,279
security and intelligence service our

00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:40,109
overseas spying arm and everything in

00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:41,730
between so state and federal police and

00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:45,419
law enforcement a designated

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,949
communications provider can be many of

00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:49,109
the major technology companies that you

00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:51,149
can imagine but also when we were asking

00:10:49,109 --> 00:10:53,220
our the cyber security minister who that

00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:56,309
portfolio no longer exists tellingly but

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,199
at the time he was asked about what this

00:10:56,309 --> 00:11:00,299
meant and was told anyone who operated a

00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,919
website so really anyone who's

00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:03,119
facilitating communications across the

00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,730
internet would be captured by this

00:11:03,119 --> 00:11:07,169
definition and then what the agency can

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,329
do is provide to the designated

00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:12,209
communications provider a request or a

00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:14,669
notice and attach to those three things

00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:16,079
many many apps or things that can be

00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:17,730
required of the designated

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,129
communications provider to assist the

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,749
agency now the distinction between them

00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:24,389
is that a technical assistance request

00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:26,399
is voluntary and the notices are both

00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:28,139
compulsory so the assistance request can

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,879
be to assist obviously as can the note

00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,040
assistants notice even though the notice

00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,559
is compulsory the capability is to build

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,949
something rather than just assist but I

00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,749
did want to pause on that for a quick

00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:42,029
moment because I'm actually very

00:11:39,749 --> 00:11:44,279
troubled by the voluntary one as much as

00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:47,189
the compulsory one and I say that

00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,419
because well Claire I should say of

00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:50,009
course if you refuse to comply with a

00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:51,809
notice there's very lengthy jail terms

00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,549
associated with it and also considerable

00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:56,459
fines so it's not as though it's easy to

00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:57,329
resist a notice but one of the things

00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:58,919
that came out in the course of

00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:01,679
discussion around this legislation is

00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,299
that the someone from the Communications

00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,989
Alliance which is the industry body for

00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:07,859
telecommunications sector indicated that

00:12:05,989 --> 00:12:10,379
technology companies respond to a

00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:12,899
thousand requests a day from law

00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:15,169
enforcement for data under the meta data

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,489
retention regime which I find shocking

00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:19,319
because that's a lot of information

00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:22,230
that's being shared without a warrant

00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:23,579
without scrutiny by a judge and without

00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,649
really I think the public being aware of

00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:27,509
how commonplace it is so I think there's

00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:30,059
a lot of problems with a voluntary

00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:31,439
regime as well because that's that way a

00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:32,939
lot of things can happen without the

00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:34,739
public having the chance to scrutinize

00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:36,389
them of course while I'm also concerned

00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:38,220
about the compulsory requirement I

00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:40,079
should say there's no reporting on these

00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,230
in any meaningful way so we can't know

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,059
how many requests or notices are issued

00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,709
we don't even get to know whether any of

00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:48,899
them were varied or done in an emergency

00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:51,539
setting or whether the Attorney General

00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,519
who does have to approve notices how

00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:55,169
many the Attorney General approves none

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,739
of this is transparent it's designed to

00:12:55,169 --> 00:13:00,209
be a closed-door secretive regime to

00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:01,850
facilitate cooperation between

00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:04,049
technology companies and law enforcement

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,249
now I didn't say that I was going to

00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,779
talk about some of the safeguards that

00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:10,350
are in place on this and there are a few

00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:12,509
the the most perhaps notorious is that

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,249
they that the agency cannot request that

00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:15,959
their provider

00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:18,629
create a systemic weakness which of

00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:20,459
course is sounds good but I probably

00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:23,309
don't a systemic weakness is not defined

00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:25,499
in the act in any meaningful way so it's

00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:26,909
very telling that the key safeguard that

00:13:25,499 --> 00:13:28,319
they like to talk about is in fact

00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:30,360
something that is almost meaningless

00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:32,100
it's very difficult to identify systemic

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,809
weakness in advance except to say that

00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,939
almost any of these things that you can

00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:37,769
imagine a law enforcement agency would

00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:40,559
like a company to do probably do risk

00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:41,459
creating a systemic weakness and it's

00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,439
something really that you can only

00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:45,779
define in retrospect I think so this

00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:47,610
safeguard I think is almost meaningless

00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:51,299
it's window-dressing more than anything

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,619
else I am prepared to buy a coffee or

00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:53,850
something more substantial for anyone

00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:55,110
who can come up with a good metaphor for

00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,299
this because I was trying to talk about

00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,230
why systemic weaknesses are difficult to

00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:00,360
define in advance

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,800
and to stop before they happen and the

00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,420
best one that I can come up with is it's

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,640
like hiding a nuclear bomb in an

00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,920
unlocked ship in an unlocked garage or

00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,960
shed because you're not offering any

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,520
protection on it if it goes missing then

00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,230
it's over you have no control over what

00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,930
happens to it after that and it's a very

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,550
serious thing a nuclear bomb and also a

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,900
systemic weakness but if you've got a

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,130
better one please come and talk to me

00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,150
afterwards because I think we do need to

00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,460
get better at talking about these things

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:26,190
in real world world talk real world

00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:28,020
terms so the other issue is that there's

00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:31,830
no judicial oversight over this process

00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:33,900
so what I mean by that is you can issue

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,150
one of these requests or notices subject

00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,590
to a warrant or an authorization so you

00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,300
need to have an underlying warrant in

00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:41,640
some circumstances so what that means a

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,920
judge will approve the activity that law

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,930
enforcement Strine to carry out but the

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,110
judge will not see the request or the

00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,640
notice and so how that warrant is

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,590
executed is not something that the judge

00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,240
gets to a pine on i'm relief the judge

00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,590
at least looks at something but I don't

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,630
think that's enough I think it's very

00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:00,690
important that agencies are put to the

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,070
task of reducing to paper why they want

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,170
to do a particular thing but I often

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,430
think it's not enough in this context

00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:08,010
for the judge not to see how it will be

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,390
executed in the request or notice but

00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:11,190
what I should say is what I said before

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:12,960
was it's not just a warrant it's or an

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,130
authorization and that's I think where

00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:18,870
it gets quite tricky I did have a

00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:20,190
glorious moment actually in this nasty

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,000
period in which were advocating on this

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,250
I don't know if you guys do you guys

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,210
know who Chris Kinney is I was gonna put

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:25,710
a picture of him up but I thought I

00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:28,920
might get sued for defamation but he's a

00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:31,670
notorious right-wing commentator who did

00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,320
see the tracer for defaming him by

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,810
photoshopping his image on it was

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,910
uncouth joining me to someone having sex

00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,440
with the dogs so the point being he's

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,720
like across those trying to describe him

00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,520
it's crossed between Andrew Bolt and say

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,620
Alan Jones and he's on spy knees so I

00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,090
I'm campaigning in this time with my

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,470
fellow advocates in this brief window

00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,820
where we had to discuss this and I was

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:52,020
asked to go in and do an interview on

00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,850
Sky News and of course I was very

00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,930
reluctant it was 9:30 that's my evening

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,160
it's quite valuable I don't want to

00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,190
spend it with people I don't like

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,940
however I went in and Chris Kenny says

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,440
to me directly

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,820
you've been talking all about how this

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,980
is the warrantless raegene that's not

00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,930
true I've been told that you need to

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,800
have a warrant in order to use these

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,779
notices and I

00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,339
the great honour of saying directly to

00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:13,380
his face on live television that he was

00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:18,930
wrong so it makes it all worth it in my

00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:20,070
view of giving up the evening so I want

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:24,930
to explain why he's wrong so an

00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:27,660
authorization manie's an example in the

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,920
meta data retention regime you can you

00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,019
do not work you're not required to get a

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,240
warrant you're authorized to access the

00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:35,160
metadata of anyone if you're in on the

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,480
list of agencies without seeking the

00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,160
approval of a judge so that's an

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,329
authorization and I want to put this

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,880
into practice as to what this might look

00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:43,620
like in terms of a notice because I

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,589
think it's kind of telling how bad this

00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:49,140
law is so if an agency for example knew

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,180
that a source was leaking information in

00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,339
in breach of national security rules to

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,260
a journalist what that agency could do

00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,910
is they could aim they could seek the

00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,769
metadata of that source without knowing

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,420
the identity of the source and to do

00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:01,860
that that's an authorized theme they

00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,020
don't need a warrant to do that they

00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,490
could go and to a technology company and

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,170
ask them to install malware on a

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,089
journalist own who's communicating with

00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:11,400
that source and a judge would never have

00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:12,809
seen any of that which I think he's

00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,189
deeply troubling it's also troubling

00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:15,750
because one of the few concessions we

00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:17,730
got in the debate about the meditator

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:19,410
attention bill was that there would be a

00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,439
journalists warrant that was designed to

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,910
protect exactly against the government

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,620
seeking the metadata of journalists for

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,569
this purpose and essentially that's now

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,760
been rendered moot that's circumvented

00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:31,320
by the capacity to issue these requests

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,610
or notices which I think is deeply

00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,130
troubling so once you have a program

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:36,809
that allows warrantless capabilities and

00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,280
infects other forms of legislation when

00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:40,050
other powers are increased upon what

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,340
already exists and it's it's deeply

00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:43,010
problematic we really must just stop

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,480
this at its source before it happens so

00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,919
the other quick thing I wanted to

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,570
mention is that there's also a bunch of

00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,190
computer warrants

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,440
computer access warrants that facilitate

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,520
government hacking they are at least

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,140
somewhat better in that there's a

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,520
warrant process but they're also deeply

00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,050
troubling because I think government

00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,280
hacking is a big problem for our

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,020
democracy for all sorts of digital

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,790
security and that's the other kind of

00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:04,679
very controversial aspect of the bill

00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,820
but the one that received the pot that

00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,110
received the most attention is the

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,940
requests and notices that I just

00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,380
mentioned so I want to give a little bit

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,210
of context as to what this looks like in

00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,590
relative terms I talked about the

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,870
snoopers Charter before in the United

00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:17,309
Kingdom but I should say this law

00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,540
wouldn't pass muster and somewhere like

00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:20,250
the United Kingdom which has rights

00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,340
protections built in domestically into

00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,990
their law who

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,659
the United Kingdom at least for now is

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:26,769
also subject to EU rights protections it

00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:28,210
wouldn't pass muster in the United

00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:29,830
States where they have a First Amendment

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:31,809
protection which prohibits of course

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:34,360
limitations on speech but also prohibits

00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:36,669
forced speech so the requirement to

00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,740
write code or disclose code which i

00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:42,639
think is an interesting idea it doesn't

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:44,230
exist in Australia so in that sense this

00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:45,850
is the I think very egregious in a

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,620
world-first in terms of the capabilities

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:52,450
that it bestows upon our agencies and

00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,789
the critical absence of a lack of

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:58,090
judicial scrutiny I think also sets us

00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:59,830
apart now I would like to take the

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,200
opportunity of course to note that I do

00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,659
think law enforcement needs powers to be

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,269
able to do their job I'm not naive about

00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:08,769
that but I also think it's very critical

00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:11,169
that we think carefully about what we

00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:14,080
put at risk when we extend extensive

00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:15,190
powers to those agencies this is not as

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,350
it's not as though this is always going

00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:21,129
to be an extremely targeted set of tools

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:23,619
or or capabilities created by this law

00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:25,299
it's going to affect all of us and that

00:19:23,619 --> 00:19:26,649
should give pause rather than just

00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:28,840
assuming that everything is that is

00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:30,850
asked for by law enforcement is valid to

00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,379
fight even even very serious crimes and

00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,139
I'm a lawyer right so I understand that

00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:37,779
there are limits on systems for example

00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:39,549
I have the privilege over communications

00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:41,529
with my client if I was a criminal

00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:43,029
lawyer I would go into court and I would

00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:45,009
be able to say to my client that they

00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:46,029
cannot that they have a right to a

00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:47,619
privilege against self-incrimination

00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:50,529
that they don't have to give evidence

00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:52,240
against in a case against them that they

00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:54,460
also have a right to be presumed

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,649
innocent until found guilty

00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:59,379
these are limits on our legal system

00:19:56,649 --> 00:20:01,480
that undoubtedly mean that some people

00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:02,619
will get off there's no doubt about it

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,600
but we think they're important

00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:07,480
protections against unsafe outcomes in

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,700
our systems and that is the balancing

00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,110
act that just when people need powers to

00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,549
do something from law enforcement

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,590
doesn't mean we should necessarily grant

00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:16,090
them that we have to change the calculus

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:17,559
of how we understand these things and

00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,240
also appreciate that there's a public

00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:21,159
interest it's safe isn't it there's the

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,070
integrity of our digital systems and a

00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,499
judicial system in my example and that's

00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,970
the way to think about it so I want to

00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:29,590
just talk a little bit now about what

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,299
this law might look like in practice in

00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:32,590
the example I want to use is the wanna

00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:33,999
cry ransomware attacks

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,499
now I'm sure there's many of you in the

00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:37,149
room that know more about this than me

00:20:35,499 --> 00:20:39,639
but I want to walk through it so that

00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:40,929
anyone who doesn't can perhaps have an

00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:43,210
insight into what this might look like

00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:45,249
in practice so I'm sure you all realize

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,870
that the wanna cry ransomware attack

00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:49,509
compromised thousands of computers

00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:51,159
around the world it was it operated by

00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:53,519
exploiting a vulnerability within

00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:55,690
Microsoft software that allowed the

00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,389
attackers to prevent people accessing

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:01,360
their files unless they paid a ransom it

00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:03,399
was eventually revealed to be it

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,950
eventually was revealed to be small-time

00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:06,789
criminals using this exploit

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,100
opportunistically to make money but

00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:10,929
there is of course a broader context to

00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,509
this particular episode in our recent

00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:16,049
past so Microsoft claimed in a company

00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:17,950
bug blog post that the National Security

00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:19,720
Agency in the United States had

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,279
discovered this vulnerability well in

00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,480
advance

00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,100
however instead of disclosing the

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,980
vulnerability to Microsoft so they could

00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,659
patch it and protect their users the NSA

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,809
kept it to themselves so the NSA in

00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:33,369
essence was holding on to this

00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:36,399
vulnerability to use for its own

00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:37,840
purposes and in this way I think this is

00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:40,059
going to be a phenomenon we see more of

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,320
where agencies hoard these

00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:43,149
vulnerabilities as a form of digital

00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,279
weaponry to be able to use against their

00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:47,080
enemies with the risk of course that

00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,769
they'll also eventually be used against

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,369
against us so at some point that

00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:53,049
intelligence about that vulnerability

00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:55,090
was either stolen or went missing we're

00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:57,759
not exactly sure but it was entirely

00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:59,169
predictable because these

00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,960
vulnerabilities are a highly valuable

00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:03,970
commodity in the cyber world and it's

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,230
real people who pay the price so the NHS

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,299
was obviously compromised people

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,249
couldn't access their medical records

00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:10,720
ambulances were diverted of course many

00:22:09,249 --> 00:22:13,379
thousands of people were put to their

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,820
gross inconvenience large and small of

00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:17,980
not being able to access their files and

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,350
all those sorts of things but the

00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,960
reality is I think this is not

00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,330
unexpected by many in this space who saw

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,710
the potential for these things to occur

00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:30,009
or in retrospect could see it as being

00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,419
highly foreseeable and Brad Smith's for

00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:32,619
a Microsoft wrote a blog post at the

00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:34,809
time and I think it's worth reading in

00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:36,129
full that repeatedly exports in the

00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:37,690
hands of governments have leaked into

00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:40,119
the public domain and caused widespread

00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,470
damage an equivalent scenario with

00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:43,090
conventional weapons would be the US

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,309
military having some of its Tomahawk

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,860
missiles stolen and this most recent

00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:48,679
attack

00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:51,049
represent a completely unintended but

00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:53,510
disconcerting link between the two most

00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:55,610
serious forms of cybersecurity threats

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:58,400
in the world today nation state action

00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:01,220
and organized criminal action the two

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,620
most serious forms of cyber security

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:06,290
threats in the world today

00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:08,540
the Australian law the AAA Act not only

00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:10,190
allows agencies to exploit similar

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,650
vulnerabilities it gives them the power

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:15,590
to create them so it facilitates the

00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:17,330
exact nation-state action that microsoft

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:19,880
claims is one of the most serious

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:22,730
threats to our cybersecurity and it also

00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,950
puts us at risk of the other of

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:27,020
organised criminal action in the event

00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:30,980
that these exploits cannot be controlled

00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:33,290
and managed by our agencies so I should

00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:35,840
play to be fair there is one limitation

00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:37,970
in the AAA Act which talks about how an

00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,070
agency cannot prevent a technology

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:42,440
company from patching a vulnerability

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,990
that they know about which also sounds

00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,370
good but in this instance it didn't it

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,049
means nothing at all because of course

00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,730
Microsoft didn't know about the

00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:51,440
vulnerability the NSA did there's no

00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,720
duty in our act disclosed a

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,549
vulnerability to the company to be able

00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,309
to patch they're not interested in cyber

00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:59,750
security and safety for users they're

00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:01,669
interested in maintaining their act

00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:04,580
their ability to access vulnerabilities

00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:05,600
now of course the one akroy example is

00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,160
slightly different because it didn't

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,960
involve an agency building it but you

00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,760
can see how a very similar phenomenon

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,230
might well play out in circumstances

00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,559
where one of our agencies makes use of

00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:20,059
an exploit or also forces a company to

00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:21,410
create one for them to use and I mean I

00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:23,660
should say as well that we have to trust

00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:25,340
here that all these agencies are going

00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,020
to be able to protect and guard the

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:29,419
capabilities that are created under this

00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:32,150
act and we're talking about not just a

00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:34,309
Zeo or ASIS we're talking about the

00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,390
Northern Territory police and I mean I

00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:38,090
don't mean to bag the Northern Territory

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,710
but I'm just not convinced that these

00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,450
guys understand what they're going to be

00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,990
holding on to if they request these

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:46,820
things and I should say as well that in

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,210
subsequent discussions I spoke with a

00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:52,010
New South Wales police officer at a

00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:55,130
think-tank event in Sydney where he

00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:57,140
talked about how he was he works on kind

00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,720
of investigations relating to things

00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,910
like pedophilia and others

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,610
he was as far as I know new south wales

00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:05,710
police were not meaningfully consulted

00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:08,800
in the lead-up to the tabling of this

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:10,720
bill and he was essentially telling me

00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:14,800
that there were but now being encouraged

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:17,020
to use it so the idea that this was a

00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,340
response to a need by people actually

00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,930
dealing with these crimes on the ground

00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:24,220
seems somewhat hard to believe for me

00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:26,170
when the key people were doing this work

00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:32,410
and involved in the process of creating

00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:34,950
the legislation itself so yeah we'll get

00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:40,000
to that in a minute so it gets to August

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:41,950
2018 and we the public consult the

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,020
consultation draft is is released by the

00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,760
Department of Home Affairs and we're

00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,170
given an extremely truncated period

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,670
within which to respond

00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,380
we've given two weeks essentially a

00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:52,750
little bit more to provide a response to

00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:55,000
the exposure draft and so of course we

00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:57,100
diligently get to work so civil society

00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,300
where we drafted a lengthy submission

00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,250
highlighting all the faults with the

00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,010
bill we worked with the juice media to

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,530
create a wonderful video about the arts

00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:07,540
access act and an honest government

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:10,930
advert which you're welcome to watch -

00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:12,910
we also recruited nearly 15,000 people

00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:15,100
to make a submission through this

00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:17,860
process it was a performance submission

00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,420
but it I think is an important number to

00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,130
remember in a context in which we're

00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,870
commonly told that people don't care

00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,160
about their privacy that this bill is

00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:25,900
far too technical for people to

00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,410
understand but that's not true so

00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:32,410
widespread engagement with this process

00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:34,240
and it wasn't just us of course you

00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,700
don't need to believe just me there was

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,590
very widespread engagement

00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:44,350
oh no I'll go back to this that's coming

00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:48,010
there was very word engagement from gave

00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:49,370
me a shock from industry and business so

00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:51,800
lots of

00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:54,740
and lots of the community that you would

00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,180
usually expect perhaps who unaligned on

00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:00,170
lots of different topics coming together

00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,670
to talk about these issues so there was

00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:03,410
a large number of submissions in

00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:04,880
addition to the 15,000 that we made and

00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:06,680
pretty much what you could discern from

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,680
that process is that the only people who

00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,450
were interested in passing these laws

00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,950
who advocated for them were the people

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,840
who are likely to gain power from them

00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:16,880
it was not as though others saw the

00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,500
benefit of them to any great degree and

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,030
many I think it's fair to say that there

00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,250
was an intense course of opposition

00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:24,500
through this process what we then know

00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:27,770
of course is that two weeks after that

00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:31,130
period of consultation ended two weeks

00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:34,790
after that the the legislation the bill

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:37,220
was tabled so essentially this guy waved

00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,929
it right through a cabinet and which I

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,030
think it's quite open and ominous

00:27:38,929 --> 00:27:42,800
without reading any of the submissions

00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:45,050
that were put by civil society and

00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,670
others I think in any meaningful way

00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:48,800
it's not possible I think to have read

00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,600
them within a two-week period so what we

00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,660
see here is a clear intention to get

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,160
this on onto the table in Parliament to

00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:58,059
get this passed as quickly as possible

00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:01,220
and to show a real contempt I think for

00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:03,320
engagement with the political process by

00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,660
people who have a stake in these issues

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:08,020
which is deeply disappointing so as a

00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,610
mediator then referred to a committee

00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,900
which is the parliamentary Joint

00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,250
Committee for intelligence and security

00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,870
which of course is the hilarious name

00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,850
because there's not much intelligence

00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:18,260
and not really a commitment to security

00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,970
on that committee

00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,470
the parliamentary Joint Committee is the

00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,750
body that a lot of these bills are

00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,700
referred to the process is common so the

00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,780
82 bills that I talked about before many

00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,860
of them will have gone through the

00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,020
parliamentary Joint Committee on

00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,700
Intelligence and Security so the process

00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,080
is designed to allow people who are

00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,910
experts in the field to come and talk to

00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,230
politicians about it to try and explain

00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:38,150
what they think of the problems with the

00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:40,850
laws to provide written submissions of

00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:42,380
course to provide evidence in person to

00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:45,140
kind of talk politicians through about

00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,570
why this law might be not ideal and what

00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,160
they could do about it but what happens

00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:51,050
in this committee is it operates under a

00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,270
gentlemen's agreement really between the

00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,890
two major parties whereby they come to a

00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:57,179
compromise behind closed doors about

00:28:54,890 --> 00:29:00,950
passing this legislation

00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:03,929
it feels often quite to be quite a a

00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:05,639
vacant and and empty process to provide

00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:07,799
evidence to them doesn't mean it's not

00:29:05,639 --> 00:29:09,539
worth doing but it is immensely

00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:11,729
frustrating when a lot of lawmaking

00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:13,619
happens by a coterie of people rather

00:29:11,729 --> 00:29:15,479
than by politicians who feel accountable

00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:17,849
to those that they're there to represent

00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:19,409
so many people gave evidence including

00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:22,139
me including other people in this room

00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:24,450
for which you know I think we should all

00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:28,289
be very grateful it was you know people

00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:31,529
from business people from from the

00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:34,619
Academy cryptographers civil society

00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:36,149
advocates like me and a large range of

00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:37,469
submissions which I think in a very

00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:40,769
articulate way highlight all the

00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:42,539
weaknesses with this proposed law now in

00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:44,429
some circumstances this bipartisan

00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:45,869
consensus this gentlemen's agreement

00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:47,999
might have been a valid way to make law

00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:49,409
I suppose if you're in a crisis but I

00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:51,629
just don't think that's the case anymore

00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:52,849
and I think it's deeply troubling for

00:29:51,629 --> 00:29:56,879
our democracy

00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:58,109
so the pjc is heard all the evidence and

00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:59,789
it's not just me that you have to

00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:02,279
believe I thought this was a problem

00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:03,809
there were many people in Australian

00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:05,339
business who found it deeply troubling

00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,779
who put it to them there's some great

00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:08,219
submissions online if you want to see

00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:10,139
some of the arguments against it that

00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:11,789
answered all the talking points put by

00:30:10,139 --> 00:30:14,190
the coalition and the diversity of this

00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:16,229
coalition of people diversity of the

00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,489
coalition people against it and not the

00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:20,099
political coalition I think is quite

00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:21,690
impressive there was also some polling

00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:23,729
done on this so it found that 85 percent

00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,989
of Australians thought it was important

00:30:23,729 --> 00:30:26,700
or very important that the government

00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:29,099
not introduced weaknesses into encrypted

00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,599
systems and essentially there's quite a

00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:32,669
strong case there that this is a very

00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,159
problematic piece of proposed

00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:36,539
legislation I should say as well at

00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:39,029
digital rights activists joined forces

00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:42,779
with industry to put up a united front

00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:44,839
which is not a common occurrence and as

00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:46,889
a digital rights activist obviously on

00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:47,849
commonly very very critical of these

00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:49,859
companies and how they approach

00:30:47,849 --> 00:30:52,109
questions like privacy and user rights

00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:54,089
but in I think this coalition is a

00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:58,589
testament to the seriousness of this

00:30:54,089 --> 00:31:00,479
bill yep and I was involved in giving

00:30:58,589 --> 00:31:01,889
evidence as well as I directly lobbied a

00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:03,659
bunch of politicians with industry

00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:05,339
people as well to try and talk them

00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:07,559
through I thought this was a problem and

00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:08,999
why they should not pass this

00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:11,489
legislation

00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:12,689
so Nestle sounds like it's a good kind

00:31:11,489 --> 00:31:14,699
of campaign to stop it

00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:16,169
and I must admit I was very proud of the

00:31:14,699 --> 00:31:18,299
work we did but I was a little bit of

00:31:16,169 --> 00:31:20,429
surprised when the Labour Party started

00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:22,079
to say that it wasn't necessarily gonna

00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:24,119
wave these laws through I mean maybe

00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,909
that's reflection on the Labour Party

00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,809
the backbenchers started talking about

00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:29,549
it

00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:31,019
penny Wang start talking about who's a

00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:33,239
member of the committee I mentioned

00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:34,589
Shadow Attorney General Mark Dreyfus

00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:38,519
started talking about the problems with

00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:40,619
the law and eventually they they began

00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,269
to say that they would publicly

00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:44,999
indicated that they wouldn't file a

00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:45,989
report that was about consensus on that

00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:47,669
community that they were going to file a

00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:49,889
dissenting report highlighting the

00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:51,509
problems with with the bill now that may

00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:54,059
sound like not much but I have to tell

00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:56,459
you that's never happened so in there

00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:57,749
Peter CAS those 82 bills they're all

00:31:56,459 --> 00:32:00,059
pretty much gone through without any

00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,139
kind of opposition so this is the first

00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:03,569
time we've seen a cracking that

00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:05,009
bipartisan consensus on a law I think

00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:06,299
that is a testament to the work of lots

00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:10,139
of people who contributed to the

00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:14,269
campaign to stop it but how long do you

00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:18,839
think that lasted just in four days so

00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:20,219
then the bill passed into law and it's

00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:22,079
pretty disappointing of course that that

00:32:20,219 --> 00:32:24,029
occurs the Labour Party started talking

00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:26,219
about the need to compromise the need to

00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:28,289
pass these laws before Christmas so this

00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:30,749
is the statement from mark Dreyfus which

00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:32,339
i think is a ridiculous proposition

00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:34,049
because a lot of the time frames on the

00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:36,239
the powers contained within the act

00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:39,089
wouldn't have permitted anything to be

00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:41,639
done before Christmas but this idea took

00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:43,469
on a kind of zombie violence and it

00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:45,209
became very difficult to argue against

00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:46,889
so because by the time we're talking

00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:48,509
about this is all sort of early

00:32:46,889 --> 00:32:49,679
mid-december so the idea that this was

00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:51,329
going to be used before Christmas was

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,919
fast cool but of course when you say the

00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:55,319
words terrorism it becomes very

00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:56,489
difficult to find the Labour Party doing

00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:58,919
what it's supposed to be doing which has

00:32:56,489 --> 00:33:00,809
been in opposition now of course the

00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:03,869
Labour Party then tried to complain that

00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:05,789
they were double-crossed that that they

00:33:03,869 --> 00:33:07,469
had plans to introduce amendments and

00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:10,379
all those sorts of things and that may

00:33:07,469 --> 00:33:12,220
be true but I also think it's less of a

00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:14,260
betrayal and more of

00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:16,480
the loud party being outmaneuvered I

00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:18,310
think on these questions and part of I

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,900
suppose what I imagine their strategy is

00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:22,870
is to be a small target at that time

00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:25,120
before the general election which came

00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,950
shortly thereafter which they assumed

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,690
that they had a very good chance of

00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:32,650
winning which of course was a gross

00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:35,680
miscalculation so what I would say is

00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:38,350
that the Pro the more you learn about

00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,000
how this bill actually passed the worse

00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:41,650
it is there was a lot of horse trading

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,140
and gross stuff going on behind the

00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,970
scenes and it got to the point where

00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:49,030
Bill Shorten eventually was tweeting at

00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:50,650
labour liberal politicians to return to

00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,060
the Parliament flog this is the last day

00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,100
before the end of the parliamentary year

00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:56,470
to pass this bill this has been a

00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,390
context in which that led acknowledged

00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,340
how bad it was and their backbenchers

00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:02,290
were tweeting against it that had a huge

00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:06,100
amount of evidence that telling them

00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:07,060
that it was a bad law and it's gross I

00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,560
don't really want to spend much more

00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,850
time on it I've written about it if you

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,580
want to know more about it but it's a

00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,929
really disgusting display I think of how

00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,120
our democratic process at its absolute

00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:18,660
worst that it need not be like this and

00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:20,650
that horse trading and playing politics

00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:23,380
between the two major parties is a

00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,940
really damaging phenomenon for our

00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:27,179
democracy and we need to do something

00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,179
about it

00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:36,340
great they're all agreed we've got to do

00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,320
something about it so the bill is

00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:41,470
already also having consequences so we

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,150
know it's well that it's being used we

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:44,860
know that it's going to have widespread

00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:47,350
implications notwithstanding that it's

00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,820
shrouded in secrecy I'm sure many of you

00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:51,040
as an educated audience in this field

00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:53,740
will appreciate just how bad these

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,630
powers are when left unchecked and even

00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:57,820
if I don't think we should believe any

00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,960
accounts from law enforcement that

00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,030
they'll use them correctly and

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,220
appropriately and have regard to the

00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:05,440
wider question of digital security I

00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,910
think we should presume the worst and

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,400
use that as a basis to say that this

00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:13,060
should be reversed so the question then

00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,320
is what do we do about this I think it's

00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:16,480
important to come to terms with how it

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,460
happened how this this process was

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,570
allowed to unfold and how we can make

00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:22,350
sure that it doesn't happen again

00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:24,430
because we're not alone in this

00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,830
counterparts in the other five countries

00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,510
will face similar battles in future and

00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:30,580
we need to build we need to lead by

00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:32,410
example but we also need to build

00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:35,530
alliances so that we're better able to

00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:37,480
resist these these there's really

00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:39,010
oppressive laws and the first thing I

00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:41,920
suppose I'd say is that it's very clear

00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:43,690
that experts and people with detailed

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,970
knowledge of their field are constantly

00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:48,010
and systematically disrespected and

00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:50,800
disregarded by those in politics their

00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,060
voices are just not valued and even on

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,680
matters where it's a technical

00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,360
impossibility to balance the

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,510
considerations that politicians say

00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:00,370
they're trying to do it's very easy for

00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:02,890
that to just be forgotten and replaced

00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:05,890
with a soundbite and you know cheap

00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:07,900
rhetoric even people who are supposed to

00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:09,850
be our allies I should say as well admit

00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:11,740
that technology is peripheral to our

00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:13,090
understanding so Clara Neil gave a

00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,980
speech at the end of last year where she

00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:16,000
talked exactly about this she

00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,100
acknowledged that she was absolutely

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,380
part of the problem thanks Claire

00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:22,060
that technology is pretty peripheral to

00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,500
what we talked about in Parliament and

00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,880
the last quote I think is important

00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,560
there we saw this with encryption of

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,720
metadata where even some of the people

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,410
advocating for the legislation didn't

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,360
seem to understand it properly what I am

00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:36,010
getting at here really is that the party

00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,710
political system and our politicians are

00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:40,420
really failing people they're failing to

00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,730
get us good policy in relation to

00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:43,650
technology but

00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,680
not convinced to be honest that getting

00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:48,510
them to better understand it is our key

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,010
objective here because it's within their

00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:52,170
grasp to do so they think it's

00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:53,970
politically expedient or they think

00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,310
they've made a calculation that there's

00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:58,050
not serious consequences in conducting

00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:00,570
themselves in this way and it's our job

00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:03,390
to change that so if we're going to

00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:04,740
resist these laws and featured Ukrainian

00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,630
laws and we're going to make good laws

00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,710
in relation to technology we need to

00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,110
think about not just educating

00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,430
politicians but building power outside

00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,920
of Canberra that can hold these

00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:16,110
politicians to account that can ensure

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,520
that this kind of attitude is not

00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:20,100
allowed to continue in places like

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,380
Canberra so what does that look like I

00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,030
think that means talking about technical

00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,860
topics in accessible ways first and

00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:28,200
foremost so encryption is not just about

00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,790
maths or cryptography it's about the

00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,280
security of our digital infrastructure

00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:34,320
our healthcare system our energy grid

00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,840
our banking system our public transport

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,310
services they all rely on encryption to

00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,320
ensure that the wrong people can't get

00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:42,990
access to information as it moves

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,150
through space it's not that encryption

00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,980
is just a good source of protection it's

00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:50,220
really our only protection our last line

00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:52,230
of protection against criminal activity

00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:54,330
and state-sponsored hacking so when we

00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:57,000
compromised it deliberately we put all

00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:59,130
those systems at risk we need to get the

00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,870
message across that everyone has a stake

00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:03,630
in defending encryption everyone who

00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:05,280
uses the internet which is on a regular

00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:08,460
basis to do any kind of thing which in

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,380
the digital economy is everybody I think

00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,330
in framing encryption and debates about

00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,550
encryption in this way we can undermine

00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:16,050
them the National the the accepted

00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:19,890
narrative about what these laws are

00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:22,220
about that that we can start to but push

00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:24,690
back against the idea that terrorism

00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:26,880
pedophilia criminal hacking are so

00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:30,060
egregiously bears that we need to pull

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,160
out all stops to defend protect

00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,140
ourselves from them law enforcement

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,150
agencies have considerable power at

00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,740
their disposal currently to deal with

00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,170
these threats and they need to get

00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:43,020
better at using them we cannot allow

00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:45,270
them to put our digital security at risk

00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,010
so that they can get easier access to

00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:48,930
things that can help them do their jobs

00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,890
it's not a compromise that we ought to

00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,810
be prepared to make

00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:54,670
if we were to define national security I

00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:57,190
think in this room I think we'd include

00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,840
digital security for everybody as part

00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:01,720
of the idea of what it is to have a

00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:03,520
secure nation but when it's left to

00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,290
intelligence agencies and law

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,970
enforcement to define national security

00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:09,130
they make it synonymous with powers for

00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:13,980
them and that's something we have to

00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,980
change yeah

00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:19,630
so therefore encryption is not just a

00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:21,430
pretty it's not a barrier to law

00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:23,290
enforcement doing jobs doing their job

00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,240
it's actually a source of protection for

00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:27,460
us from criminal conduct and

00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,750
state-sponsored hacking and in that

00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,860
sense I think we also need to start

00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,150
talking about encryption is not just

00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:32,530
something that's for the protection of

00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:35,590
journalists and whistleblowers but

00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:38,070
actually it's for everybody that unions

00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:41,200
welfare organizations health charities

00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:42,400
lawyers that we all need to work

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,010
together with technologists

00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,810
cryptographers and coders to build a

00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,460
very diverse coalition that can talk

00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:50,860
about these issues rather than seeing it

00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,180
as a niche technological one and I think

00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:53,440
civil society has a great role to play

00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,940
in that and this kind of collaboration

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,530
talking to you guys you guys hopefully

00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,330
talking to me and others who are in

00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:00,490
civil society is a great opportunity to

00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:02,500
do it and again I just think it's

00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,060
fantastic that you guys are prepared to

00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,290
spend their time listening and thinking

00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,500
through these issues because this is how

00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:10,300
we start to build that power industry

00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,590
certainly has a role to play in my view

00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,480
and industry has a role to play in

00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:15,430
recruiting other kinds of industry to

00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,460
the cause as well because of course many

00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:20,650
many different aspects of industry have

00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:22,690
a stake in making sure that we have

00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:23,830
strong encryption and I'm just going to

00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,090
take the time but you to make sure that

00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,950
I'm not taking up too much time but I

00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,750
just wanted to tell one quick story

00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,460
which was that I spoke to a journalist

00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:33,010
when I was in Canberra from the West

00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,450
Australian who talked about how which

00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,890
didn't occur to me I must say so I'm

00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,660
learning all the time how ground zero

00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:40,030
for driverless technology in Australia

00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,740
is actually in the Pilbara where

00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:44,770
mining companies make use of driverless

00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:47,170
technology and using it all the time now

00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:50,320
he also pointed out to me that bhp is

00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:51,550
constantly facing hacking attempts often

00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,740
by what they assumed to be

00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,180
state-sponsored hacking that I think

00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,320
there's plenty of people in all parts of

00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,690
the world who we trade with who are very

00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:00,520
keen to know how bhp fits its price for

00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,530
iron ore or other things to get inside

00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,230
information into how that

00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:06,420
he works bhp is not someone I normally

00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,650
feel like I'm aligned with and yet I

00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,090
think they've got a stake and also

00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:11,160
protecting encryption so that their

00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:13,470
systems can remain intact and resist

00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,700
these kinds of hacking attempts so I

00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,020
think industry's got a role to play in

00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,600
talking to those people because those

00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,490
people don't listen to me they like to

00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,810
talk to their counterparts in other

00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:23,820
industries and there's a diverse

00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:25,590
coalition that can be built there but

00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:27,510
that's work for industry to do itself

00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:29,600
and I think we've got a job to do our

00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:32,250
part in building a diversity of

00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:34,410
colleagues from other organizations who

00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:36,600
were unexpected perhaps in terms of how

00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:39,180
we share our interests but that's what

00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,290
makes it a very strong coalition when I

00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,550
was in Canberra spoke to Michelle

00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:44,220
Rowland who was the shadow

00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:46,500
communications minister at the time and

00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,300
she said to me don't worry we're not

00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,880
gonna pass this this law and I was like

00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,500
great and then she said but you should

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,120
run it you should run a marginal state

00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,320
campaigning on this law for us and you

00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,400
know I'm trying to put together why

00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,930
those two things go together but I think

00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,570
that is something advice that we should

00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:05,610
take up if we could organize different

00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:07,380
into the organizations but also lots of

00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:09,780
different people to start communicating

00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:12,450
with their politicians to show that

00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,550
voting in this way has consequences for

00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:16,500
their electorate I think we can start to

00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:18,420
build power to make sure that

00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:20,580
politicians start factoring into their

00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,170
thinking but they may face electoral

00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:24,090
consequences if they continue to make

00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:27,390
bad policy in relation to digital

00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:28,920
security and technology the bottom line

00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,900
I think has been in seeking to break

00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,520
encryption what's going on is the

00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,500
government is prioritizing the interests

00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,680
of agencies over the citizens that

00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:39,750
they're supposed to protect they want to

00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,640
stockpile these digital weapons to use

00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,530
against their enemies and this is I

00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,530
think the future of warfare we're only

00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:50,250
going to see more of this as time goes

00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:53,640
on and we we need to be the ones that

00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:55,680
resist it you can't you can't say that

00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,390
you're preparing for peace when you're

00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:59,670
building weapons and stockpiling them

00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:02,520
and it's our job as activists to turn

00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:06,110
those weapons into plowshares to beat

00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,640
them into plushies into to make it as a

00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:10,800
technology topics as a force of peace

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,800
building rather than preparations for

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,640
war so we weren't successful of course

00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,490
in Australia and

00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,049
in the AAA Act but we did manage for a

00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:20,940
very brief moment to break the

00:43:19,049 --> 00:43:23,069
bipartisan consensus on national

00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:24,599
security and I think this is extremely

00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:26,519
significant we also managed to recruit

00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:28,470
15,000 like people to make submissions

00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:30,269
on those topics despite the fact that

00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:31,410
it's considered technical and and

00:43:30,269 --> 00:43:32,700
there's a widespread assumption that

00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,900
people are prepared to give away their

00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,599
privacy at the drop of a hat

00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:40,619
those those things are significant wins

00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:42,269
I would also say that we are having

00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:43,349
other successes I don't think the

00:43:42,269 --> 00:43:46,289
success has always looked like how we

00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:48,269
imagined but for example Peter Dutton's

00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:50,359
biometric bills which were also about

00:43:48,269 --> 00:43:52,529
facial recognition which were also

00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:55,680
permitted egregious invasions of privacy

00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:57,420
were rejected by the parliamentary Joint

00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,680
Committee for intelligence and security

00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,390
which I mentioned before which is

00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,849
astonishing given it's a bipartisan

00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:04,440
comedian and Peter Dutton is from the

00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,730
government that they would reject these

00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,069
bills on the basis that they had

00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:09,539
insufficient privacy safeguards I think

00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:12,089
that's a consequence of people getting

00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:14,160
active on these issues and appreciating

00:44:12,089 --> 00:44:17,220
that these kinds of approaches to

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,779
lawmaking can no longer go on I don't I

00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:21,119
think it would be very easy for them to

00:44:18,779 --> 00:44:23,490
waive through these things and we need

00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,390
to keep building our opposition to these

00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:29,130
laws so that they can't continue to be

00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:32,400
to consider these processes without

00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:33,839
scrutiny without consequence of course

00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,210
there are downsides as well we've

00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,970
certainly seen several raids on

00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,960
journalists that have occurred since

00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:42,329
since the passage of the AR bill

00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,220
including relying on provisions within

00:44:42,329 --> 00:44:45,839
the that were imported into legislation

00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,730
by the AI bill as well so I'm not trying

00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,869
to make out like we're successful in

00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:50,130
this way we've got very serious

00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:52,589
consequences that we have to deal with

00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:54,240
but I think there is a way in which we

00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,890
can start to see how these things can

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,509
turn around that we can start to change

00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:59,849
that calculus and the mind of lawmakers

00:44:57,509 --> 00:45:01,920
and make them feel as though they may

00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:04,470
pay a price if they continue to support

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:09,150
legislation that violates privacy and

00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:10,500
digital security I suppose I ought to

00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:12,839
probably admit that the Labour Party has

00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,390
tabled a bunch of amendments to the

00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:17,609
legislation itself to the AAA Act which

00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:20,339
were in line with the legislation that

00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:21,960
they were betrayed by the Coalition on

00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:24,239
I'm not convinced that they're going to

00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,649
get up but it would be nice to see that

00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:27,629
passed in the event the government did

00:45:25,649 --> 00:45:29,399
change hands so there is movement and

00:45:27,629 --> 00:45:32,099
they feel accountable enough to have had

00:45:29,399 --> 00:45:34,919
to do that but we need to keep pushing

00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:38,129
and keep organizing because this this

00:45:34,919 --> 00:45:40,049
war is going to continue one of the

00:45:38,129 --> 00:45:41,519
things I like to go back to is look back

00:45:40,049 --> 00:45:43,289
in history for people who faced similar

00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,239
battles and to see how they approached

00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:46,829
it and one of my favorite people from

00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:47,969
history is a woman called Rosa Luxemburg

00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:49,439
who was involved in the German

00:45:47,969 --> 00:45:51,509
revolution actually in the early 20th

00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,859
century and why luckily she talks a lot

00:45:51,509 --> 00:45:54,959
about defeats and how you approach

00:45:52,859 --> 00:45:57,179
defeats in political terms and she said

00:45:54,959 --> 00:45:59,009
her argument is where would we be

00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:00,569
without those defeats this is what she

00:45:59,009 --> 00:46:02,249
wrote from which we draw a historical

00:46:00,569 --> 00:46:04,799
experience understanding power and

00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:06,689
idealism she says we can't do without

00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:08,429
them because each one contributes to us

00:46:06,689 --> 00:46:09,689
strength and understanding I think

00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:11,579
that's what we should take from this

00:46:09,689 --> 00:46:13,559
process we need to contribute to our

00:46:11,579 --> 00:46:15,659
strength and understanding and make sure

00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:18,509
we can use these lessons to build a

00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:20,549
stronger movement for next time so what

00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:21,959
you can do I think is to get involved so

00:46:20,549 --> 00:46:23,579
digital rights watch has a program

00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:25,409
called digital rights defenders for

00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:27,809
people from the technology sector to get

00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:30,269
involved in in it in all kinds of ways

00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:32,129
that might take the form of helping us

00:46:30,269 --> 00:46:33,859
write submissions helping us activate

00:46:32,129 --> 00:46:36,479
groups of people who can call

00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:38,939
politicians in marginal seats it might

00:46:36,479 --> 00:46:40,949
also be providing technical expertise it

00:46:38,939 --> 00:46:42,269
might also be giving money if you don't

00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:44,039
want to be involved in these things

00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:45,689
I think Lindsay might have mentioned in

00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:48,989
her talk earlier we only have one point

00:46:45,689 --> 00:46:50,749
for paid activists who work on digital

00:46:48,989 --> 00:46:53,759
rights issues which is an astonishing

00:46:50,749 --> 00:46:55,739
reality of how small our civil society

00:46:53,759 --> 00:46:57,869
is so we need to build our ranks and

00:46:55,739 --> 00:47:00,989
we're looking to you to help us to do

00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:02,519
that work I'm not a coder I'm neither to

00:47:00,989 --> 00:47:04,169
develop another technologist I'm a

00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,359
lawyer but I love working with people

00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:07,649
who are in interested in these issues

00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:08,759
from a technological background could

00:47:07,649 --> 00:47:09,959
always learn a lot

00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:12,779
let's get told when I've made a mistake

00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:14,519
which I don't mind and it's the way in

00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:17,129
which we can be more powerful to build

00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:18,689
the consensus in all different ways that

00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:20,669
these laws can't continue that this

00:47:18,689 --> 00:47:22,349
approach to lawmaking in technology

00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:25,409
policymaking should not be allowed to

00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:27,359
continue so I would encourage you to get

00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:30,449
involved in any one of our activities

00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,799
to talk to your employer about what they

00:47:30,449 --> 00:47:33,470
might be doing as well if you're from

00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:35,330
the tech industry and

00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:37,070
in ways that we can contribute to our

00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:39,619
strength and understanding of these laws

00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:42,260
so that we can make sure that next time

00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:44,480
we face a better like this we can win

00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:47,180
and we can even start to claw back some

00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,520
of what we've lost and build a society

00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:52,460
that is based on respect for rights and

00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:56,469
good technology policy thank you

00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,469
