All professionals possess some measure of expertise, and not only is this expertise useful, it is usually also necessary to do the job. In general, this expertise is viewed as a good thing.

But what if there is an issue with expertise? Is expertise always a good thing?

This presentation will discuss how expertise has limitations when it is applied outside its normal area of application, and how these limitations will typically not be evident to the individual applying the expertise. Further, even in situations where evidence suggests the application of the expertise is inappropriate, it is likely that an individual will continue to apply their expertise regardless of its inappropriateness.

To explore these issues the presentation will examine the behaviour of a group of firefighters fighting a wildfire in Mann Gulch in the US in 1949, it will look at psychological studies that examine the concept of Priming, and it will discuss how the game of baseball can assist in unravelling why expertise can sometimes let us down.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

dr. Shawn Brady is a forensic engineer

00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,060
who specializes in investigating the

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,429
causes of engineering collapses and

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,679
failures Shawn is interested in role

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:13,259
played in the role played by human and

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,179
system factors in failure and he's

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,680
recently completed a review for the

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:18,690
Queensland Government into the causes of

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,630
fatalities in the Queensland mining

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,369
industry since 2000 he's actually just

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,990
finished that taking a break to come

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:30,029
here so please join me in welcoming him

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:40,879
to come up on the stage and present his

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:45,960
keynote good morning everyone

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:49,440
let's go back to 1971 and join the team

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,559
who are designing and constructing this

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,570
structure the Hartford Convention Center

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,510
this is a massive structure you've got

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,239
about 10,000 seats inside this thing it

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,660
the roof in plan is about a hundred and

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,260
ten meters by about 95 meters and it's a

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,200
spider web of about 2,300 individual

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,510
steel members the crazy thing about this

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,130
roof is it's held on only four points so

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,020
it's got four columns that are just

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:22,560
sitting from the edges they run into

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,420
problems pretty quickly they build this

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,380
thing on the ground and what they're

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,790
going to do is they're going to lift it

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,130
up onto the top of those four columns

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,990
when they build it on the ground the

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,000
contractor goes back to the design

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,579
engineers and says I think we've got a

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,299
problem with your structure it's sagging

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:41,070
too much even before we lift it up to

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,290
the top of the columns you've missed

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,790
something in your design the design

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,229
engineers said no problem we'll go back

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,490
we'll have a look at the calculations

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,840
they have a look at the calculations to

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,799
go back to the construction engineer and

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,610
this everything's fine

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:52,610
keep going

00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:57,310
the contractor lifts the structure up

00:01:55,569 --> 00:01:59,469
and pops on at the top of the the four

00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,539
columns this is 23 meters up in the air

00:01:59,469 --> 00:02:03,520
they go back to the designer and say no

00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:05,140
no no no something is very wrong here

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,819
this thing is actually bending and

00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,950
sagging twice as much as your

00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:10,929
calculations suggest you've missed

00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,370
something the designer says well we'll

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:13,480
check the calculations to check the

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:16,840
calculations to come back say

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,670
everything's fine subcontractor turns up

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,099
to put all these little fascia boards

00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,080
all this paneling on it and that's got

00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:25,090
all these bolt holes he has to match up

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,239
and he comes back and he says there's

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:30,010
something wrong with the structure

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,599
he says the this thing is so bent and

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,970
twisted in the air that the bolt holes

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,239
won't line up for me I can't actually

00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,739
fit the fish on this thing the designer

00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:43,690
says well we've checked calculations and

00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:46,560
everything's okay they put new little

00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:49,060
bolt holes on they finished the fascia

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,799
twice in the life of this structure

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,840
members of the public go the City of

00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:53,859
Hartford and they say there's something

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,579
wrong with that structure have you

00:02:53,859 --> 00:03:02,980
actually looked at it it's going in the

00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:04,930
air the engineers say yeah well we've

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,310
checked the calculations and were more

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:12,459
than happy with it it's fine

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:18,370
fast-forward five years to 1978 and it

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:19,750
starts to snow it's the first major snow

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,639
they've had in Hartford since the

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,470
structure has gone up but it's only half

00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,790
the design load on the structure so you

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,290
know you'd need to double the amount of

00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,120
snow you got to actually cause any

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,419
problems to this structure so it should

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:35,319
have been totally okay except on the 18

00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:38,410
- January 1978 at 19 minutes past 4:00

00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:45,250
in the morning this thing collapses in

00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:47,709
its entirety what is insane is that six

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,590
hours earlier there were 5,000 people in

00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,359
there watching a basketball game now

00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,760
what went wrong here you know you have

00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:56,650
reasonably smart we hope engineers

00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,810
designing these things and we got

00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,919
warning after warning after warning that

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,289
something was wrong that we're missing

00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:04,509
something they checked their

00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:06,260
calculations yet nobody picked up on

00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:09,099
what the problem was there even seemed

00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:11,689
looked ins to admit there was a problem

00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:12,769
what's driving this what's causing this

00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:14,629
well the interesting thing is when we go

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:16,669
and look at mani structural failures and

00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,470
when we look at any failures even in

00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:20,479
medicine and business we see the same

00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,910
thing over and over again well many of

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,740
these professions including our own tend

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,770
to think of ourselves as being in a very

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:32,090
technical profession there's one problem

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:34,580
and that is that people are involved and

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,250
we have an amazingly creative way to

00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:39,560
stuff things up quite unlike just

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,789
anything else and what you find when you

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,979
start looking at the causes of these

00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:44,330
fears is the human factors plays a key

00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:46,310
role and we can honestly spend the

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,169
entire day talking about human factors

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,210
but we're going to talk about warden in

00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:54,320
particular we're going to talk about the

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,610
concept of expertise because expertise

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,250
is an interesting thing that we all

00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,380
possess expertise in this room not only

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,120
do we see expertise is a good thing but

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,460
it's actually necessary for us to do our

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,190
jobs we couldn't do the jobs we do

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,600
without possessing expertise and we tend

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,270
to be of the view that the more

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,889
expertise we can accumulate the better

00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,160
we'll be at our job in other words the

00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:18,229
less susceptible to mistakes and failure

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,520
we will be if we can accrue more

00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:24,620
expertise and by and large this is right

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,320
except sometimes what if it's not right

00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,530
what if sometimes actually possessing

00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:32,810
expertise has a dark side what happens

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,580
if it causes a problem and that's what

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,650
we're going to talk about today because

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,500
the reality is the greatest obstacle to

00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,960
knowledge is not ignorance it's the

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,150
illusion of knowledge we're at our most

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,900
vulnerable when we think we've got it

00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:50,240
all figured out and by the end of this

00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,590
presentation we're going to go on a

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,849
pretty strange journey we're going to

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,919
talk about why you get some of your best

00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:56,630
ideas in the shower we're going to talk

00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,240
about baseball and we're going to talk

00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:02,270
about fire fighters but before we do let

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,610
me just show you how awkward your brain

00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,340
is we like to think of our brains has

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,250
been incredibly rational but sometimes

00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:11,479
they're not and they let us down so have

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,159
a look at this just give me a show of

00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:14,539
hands if you've seen this before I'm

00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:16,789
sure many of you have seen this before

00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:17,400
and the question is which of these lines

00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:19,050
is long

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,280
which these lines are shorter and most

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:22,410
people when they look at it would say

00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,500
the top line is shorter what's the

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,699
answer exactly the same Landon if you

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,979
have any trouble with that we can put

00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,539
some visual aids on and see that those

00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,910
two lines are exactly the same length

00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:36,270
but here's the thing keep your eye on

00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:39,440
the screens don't watch me once we do

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:45,210
this it's like you've learned absolutely

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:49,199
nothing and we can put them back again

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:51,180
and you go oh yeah and then oh no gone

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,639
again so what's really interesting here

00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,800
is your brain knows those two lines are

00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,320
the same length but you can't train your

00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,180
eyes to see them as being the two lines

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,280
the only reason this works for you is

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,220
that your brain said your eyes is to

00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,419
your brain that top one is shorter and

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,919
by the time that signal gets to your

00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,630
brain your brain goes oh I've been

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,000
caught by this before they're exactly

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,530
the same land your eyes have not got any

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,639
smarter you'd think about this for a

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,680
moment your eyes are where the most

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,740
expert systems you have in your body and

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,220
they're letting you down what happens if

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,599
we tackle other problems like

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:28,710
programming and engineering and medicine

00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:29,639
can we have the same problem so that's

00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:31,680
what we're gonna talk about and we're

00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,690
going to start by going to the u.s.

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,699
we're gonna go to Montana we're gonna go

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,580
jump on a boat I'm gonna go down the

00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:39,990
Missouri River and we're gonna stop when

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,520
we get to this valley so we're in the

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,820
middle of the wilderness area here in

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,300
the US nothing for miles around and this

00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:50,880
valley should be completely unimportant

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:53,580
except for what happened here in 1949

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:57,720
and the name of this valley is man gawk

00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:59,820
and on the 4th of August 1949 there was

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,820
a lightning strike and the lightning

00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,919
struck about here and started a fire on

00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:08,639
what is known as the southern slope of

00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:10,889
mangog ad passes the next morning a

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,659
forest ranger by the name of Harrison

00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:17,789
sees the fire and he calls in these guys

00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:20,280
these are the smoke jumpers these are

00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:23,310
the elite of the elite of the US

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,380
firefighting teams they've been around

00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,210
for nine years and what these guys do is

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,190
they tackle the fires when they're small

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,039
and to prevent these small fires turning

00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,529
into big fires in these will

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,750
areas they parachute in on the fire and

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:38,029
that is to save time from from tracking

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,769
true that the forest to get to it and

00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:41,899
when they get there they've got all this

00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:44,029
gear they've got all the backpacks

00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:46,070
they've got sores they've got shovels

00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:48,110
they've got Pawlowski axes which they

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,230
invented and what they do to fight these

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,690
fires is they dig fire lines around them

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:56,029
so they get about a metre clear of the

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,949
fire and they scrape it down to mineral

00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:59,329
soil and then they get their saws and

00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:00,529
they cut away any branches that are

00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:03,470
across that so essentially you're

00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:05,389
removing fuel for the fire and then what

00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,459
they do is they draw it the they care

00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:10,100
about these fire lines in such a way

00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:13,600
that they drive the fire on to rocky

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:17,779
area where it usually burns itself out

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,240
now we're interested in from 10 past 3

00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:23,149
and the 5th of August 1949 because

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,980
that's the time that the c-47 play and

00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:28,519
carrying the smokejumpers arrives for

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:30,230
its first pass over mangog the door on

00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,630
the side of the plan is open the wind is

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:35,209
roaring through that door and lying on

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:38,360
his stomach looking out into the valley

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:41,510
is this guy his name is Wagner dodge he

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,300
is the smokejumper foreman it is his job

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,560
to make sure that the 14 smokejumpers

00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,810
were about to jump out of this plane

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,870
with him get down there get that fire

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,970
fought and get out safely Dodge is about

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,100
33 years of age so he's a veteran at

00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:58,490
this but most of the smokejumpers behind

00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:01,970
him are around 20 Rumsey and salar even

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:04,850
younger this is a cylon the right Sal is

00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,290
only 17 he lied to join the smokejumpers

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,649
because he reckoned it'd get him

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,649
Garren's

00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:14,000
lying beside Dodge looking out the open

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,990
door is a guy by the name of Earl

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,180
coolies the spotter

00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:20,389
its coolies job to find his place to put

00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:22,819
these men down in he sees a place on the

00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:25,069
northern slope of mangog he elbows dodge

00:10:22,819 --> 00:10:26,510
dodge takes a look at it hmm

00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:27,860
it's not perfect they'll have trouble

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,829
getting out of there if something goes

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,810
wrong but it will do he needs a

00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:35,449
 gets in the radio to the captain

00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:38,060
he says we found a spot the captain says

00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:39,139
right I'll come back in for my pastor to

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,880
let you jump they're gonna let the men

00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,820
jump in groups of four they're called

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,590
sticks then they jump then they

00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:48,320
the equipment out at the end and

00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:51,470
parachutes but as they're turning around

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,210
for that pass pilot says to Cooley okay

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,830
we're gonna be jumping but we're not

00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,990
gonna jump from 1,200 feet we're going

00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:00,890
to jump from 2,000 feet the reason is

00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:02,540
the winds in this valley are intense and

00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:05,120
they're actually sucking the plane down

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,310
into the valley when they across Cooley

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,480
tells dodge dodge nuts

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,250
it's not ideal they'll get more

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,280
scattered men and equipment but it

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:16,070
should be possible plan comes in for its

00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,380
first pass to drop the main Wagner Dodge

00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,450
stands up he Clips a static line in a

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,670
rod above the door the other end of it's

00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:25,880
connected to his parachute and the rest

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,830
of the men follow suit behind him and as

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,270
they're coming in Cooley is watching the

00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,610
landing zone he's watching the wind

00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,500
speed he's watching the air speed and

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:35,390
when he's ready for a dodge to jump out

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,600
he's gonna reach up and tap him on the

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,340
left calf voice is absolutely useless in

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,470
this situation the engines are roaring

00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,170
the wind is roaring through the door and

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:47,000
Dodge stands there as the plane comes in

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:50,420
over the valley waiting for that tap on

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,420
his calf and he gets it and he steps out

00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:55,100
into the air five seconds later his

00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,080
static line pulls Todd rips his

00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:01,520
parachute open and he begins the

00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:04,010
60-second drop to the valley below and

00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,870
as he's falling down into that Valley

00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,790
he's watching the fire which is about 60

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,980
acres at this point it's not a big fire

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:12,710
by their standards and he's thinking to

00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,820
himself this is a 10 o'clock fire which

00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,710
means they're going to grab something to

00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,960
eat when they land they're gonna fight

00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,460
the fire all night and they're gonna

00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:24,920
have it out by 10 a.m. the following

00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:26,390
morning but Dodge is wrong this is not a

00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,240
10 a.m.

00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:31,850
fire here is the weather records for

00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,590
Saint Helena Airport on the day that

00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,170
these men are dropping into this valley

00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:40,960
it is 36 degrees this is the hottest day

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:44,930
on record for centralina Airport that

00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,850
temperature combined with the winds that

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:50,270
are in that Valley creating possible

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,680
firefighting conditions this is not a 10

00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,390
o'clock fire but the time this fire is

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,760
out it's going to have burned for a half

00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,150
thousand acres and it's going to take

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,810
the combined resource

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:02,810
of 450 firefighters to get it out

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:10,410
here's mangog the the black stain is the

00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:13,230
Missouri River we we sail down earlier

00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:15,720
and this is this is the valley but two

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:18,810
and a half miles long it's a dry Valley

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,850
a dry dock this is the northern side

00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,650
here and this is the southern side and

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:25,950
these two sides are completely different

00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:28,290
the southern side is heavily timbered so

00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:30,660
a lot of ponderosa pine Douglas fir and

00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:33,120
the northern side is quite bare there's

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:35,070
a few clumps of trees not money but the

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,220
rest of it is covered in check grass so

00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:40,770
this is grass about up to your waist now

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,180
the fire moves completely different in

00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:43,980
these in these different environments

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,760
when it's in a ponderosa pine which it

00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,250
is at the moment

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,220
it burns what an incredible heat because

00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,920
there's so much fuel there but it moves

00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,750
relatively slowly but one mile per hour

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,220
it burns completely differently in the

00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,520
northern slope and there's no fire there

00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:01,380
yet but if it gets over there that fire

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,470
will not burn with the same intensity

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,520
because it doesn't have the fuel

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,040
certainly will burn hard enough to kill

00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,900
you but it will move incredibly quickly

00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:13,770
through that grass it can move as fast

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:17,160
as the wind that is driving it so the

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:19,440
men land here 4:00 p.m. northern slope

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,770
and the fire is down here among the

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,510
ponderosa pine and the southern side

00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,790
they're gathering up the gear and as

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,980
Dodge is rolling up his parachute he

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,410
hears a tump and the sound of something

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,090
shattering and that's the radio the

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,680
parachute never opened or the radio and

00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,570
it pulverized itself when it hit the

00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:40,380
ground from this point onwards the men

00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:42,060
are cut off in mangog together

00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,710
everything else they moved to the

00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,340
southern slope they get there about 5:00

00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,010
p.m.

00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,560
dodge orders the men to to eat something

00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,690
and he goes looking for Harrison the

00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:54,060
Harrison is the forest ranger who called

00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,280
the fire in earlier that morning and he

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,830
spent the afternoon trying to cut a fire

00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,660
line on the southern side of the Gulf to

00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:06,690
stop it going into the valley further

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:08,370
south here is Harrison now a very famous

00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,080
book was written about what happened in

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:12,870
mangog this day but

00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:15,030
McLean and McLean said that Harrison

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,620
ironically had switched to patrol duty

00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,720
and cleaning up picnic grounds to please

00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,050
his mother who was afraid smokejumping

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,490
was too dangerous now here he was with

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,140
dodge and he made his well a run into

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,830
General Custer and the seventh Cavalry

00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:31,380
on June 25th 1876 on their way to the

00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:37,200
Little Bighorn this was not a good

00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:39,780
Valley to be in today the men rejoined

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,400
the crew dodge tells them he's going to

00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,500
eat something himself so with Harrison

00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,570
and he sends the crew down the southern

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,810
side of the valley to start working on a

00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:51,810
fire line along that side of the fire

00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,760
and as he's eating and he's looking at

00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:56,520
the fire he starts to get incredibly

00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,320
nervous just something wrong with this

00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,530
fire he doesn't like it and he doesn't

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:05,160
trust it and now he's concerned that his

00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:08,520
men are in that thick pine in around it

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:10,050
and it could do anything he finishes up

00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,180
eating as quickly as he can him and

00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,010
Harrison rejoin the crew and he tells

00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,210
the crew that they're moving across down

00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,460
through the bottom of the valley up the

00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:18,420
other side on to the northern slope what

00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,340
they're gonna do is they're gonna head

00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,810
down that slope to the river and they're

00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,000
gonna come back up at the fire from

00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,200
behind now this is good firefighting

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,910
practice they're keeping themselves

00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,280
between the river and the fire that way

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:32,460
if something goes wrong they can get to

00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,230
the river now as they're walking down

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:38,070
that northern slope heading for the

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:41,490
river Dodge is watching the fire and it

00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:44,010
starts to change through the trees he

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,270
sees these massive tongues of flames

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:48,540
starting to lick their way up through

00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:52,200
the trees black smoke is starting to

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:53,970
billow out from among the trees and it's

00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,290
at that point dodge makes this decision

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,520
they're not gonna fight this fire it's

00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,840
too dangerous it's too unpredictable

00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,700
they're just gonna head down to the

00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:05,070
river and they're gonna stay there

00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:07,350
they're gonna wait it out what Dutch

00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:10,589
doesn't see is that spot fires have

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:13,620
already started between him and the

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:16,890
river on the northern side and the time

00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,510
is 5:30 in the afternoon while he

00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:21,480
doesn't see the spot fires was the

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,820
ground curves round and down away from

00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,490
him

00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:26,350
he feels the wind the wind picks up

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,750
dramatically between 20 and 40 miles per

00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:35,620
hour and it's coming straight up at the

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:37,810
valley towards them 15 minutes later

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:42,430
they come across the brow of a hill and

00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:44,740
dodge sees the fire and he gives the

00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:46,870
turnaround order now we're interested in

00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,990
what happens in the next 12 or 13

00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:51,490
minutes not much after that now what's

00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,410
happening here he's seen the fire he

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,090
knows they can't get to the river so he

00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,770
defaults back to the second best thing

00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,540
to do standard firefighting procedure

00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,430
you head for the ridge they're gonna run

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:01,510
up that slope to get to the ridge why

00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,280
are they heading for the ridge they're

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,780
heading for the ridge because you tend

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,850
to get less vegetation up there so you

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,350
get less field for that fire and also

00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:10,210
what happens up there is you get

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,980
confused wind conditions which means

00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,560
that if you can get into the next Valley

00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:18,970
you have a chance about running the fire

00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,920
so they have 15 minutes or so to get to

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,260
the top of that hill it's 5:45 and

00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,630
they've got a 150 yard start on that

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,810
fire and they're not panicking they're

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:31,000
moving solidly up that hill but they

00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:33,940
don't know yet is that this is no

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,320
ordinary fire it would take them decades

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,270
to actually work out what happened in

00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,630
the valley but it's it's known as a blow

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:43,480
up so what happens here is the fire is

00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,950
burning with such intensity that the air

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,960
around the base of it is getting

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,240
convected upwards so quickly that you're

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,760
actually getting a vacuum that vacuum is

00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,670
causing fresh air to rush in to replace

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,920
it at the bottom that that air rushing

00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:59,530
back in is Fanning the flames even worse

00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,440
driving more convection so think of this

00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:07,720
as a tornado of fire that is moving up

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:11,500
the valley behind the men it's now 553 8

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,790
minutes later the men are moving up to

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,290
say the valley now they're moving up the

00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,790
side of the valley at 1 mile per hour

00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:17,800
you might think you might move a little

00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,970
bit quicker if the fire was after you

00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,070
but remember they've got all their heavy

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,650
packs on they've got their shovels

00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:28,180
they've got their axes they've got their

00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:32,590
saws and they're running up 72 percent

00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:34,390
slope this is the following morning now

00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,950
remember when they were running up that

00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,290
was

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:45,190
waist-high Chitra's that they're trying

00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:46,750
to run through but the fire has sped up

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,130
it's gone from one mile per hour to

00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,350
three mile per hour is now traveling

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:52,120
three times faster than them it is

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:54,640
within a hundred yards of them and

00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,450
there's 20-foot high flames coming

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,430
behind them

00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:01,090
dodge knows they're in a world of

00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:04,420
trouble he gives the order to drop the

00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:06,940
tools throw off your backpacks drop the

00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:11,370
shovel drop the axes drop the saws and

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:13,840
run up that slope he gives that order

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:17,980
but the interesting thing is most of the

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:21,130
men don't drop their tools they hang on

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,900
to them Rumsey who we met earlier he can

00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,000
remember watching Harrison for a couple

00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,700
of seconds sit down on the side of that

00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,320
slope with his big backpack on and he

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,000
said it was like it never entered

00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,670
Harrison's head that if he true off that

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,680
backpack he could go a whole lot quicker

00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:37,990
sow remembers watching one of the guys

00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,400
running with a shovel and how absolutely

00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:41,830
ridiculous he looked running with a

00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,960
shovel and he grabbed the shovel and

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,190
pulled it off on and then he found he

00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,160
couldn't just throw that shovel on the

00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,420
ground he had to run with the shovel and

00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,640
he ran with the shovel until he came to

00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:55,540
a tree and he rested the shovel against

00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:58,270
a tree and kept on running so something

00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:00,490
really strange was happening with the

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:06,190
men and their tools as they ran up the

00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:09,940
valley by 555 they've increased their

00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:13,030
speed to an incredible 4 miles per hour

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:16,540
but at this time the flirt the fire has

00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,920
gone from 3 miles per hour to 7 300-foot

00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:22,000
tick you can't get back through it

00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:24,280
30-foot high flames dodge is in the lead

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,340
they're running through a small grove of

00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,980
trees they come out the other end of the

00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:33,130
trees and dodge gets his first good look

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:38,200
at the ridge and he is horrified by what

00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:39,670
he sees it looks like this the men are

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,550
running up on the left-hand side of that

00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:43,990
there is a rock shelf at the top of this

00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,130
Ridge when they get to the top of that

00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,620
and dodge doesn't even think they're

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,480
going to get there now there

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,730
fists would have basically a wall of

00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,320
rock that's taller than a man and

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,110
they're gonna have to find their way

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,520
through there will be crevices but dodge

00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,960
knows that if they go down one of those

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,690
crevices and it's a dead end they're

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:06,280
gonna get burned too that in there it's

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:07,870
a dire situation so dodge does something

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,309
that is believed to be the first time

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,980
this has ever been done in wild

00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:14,080
firefighting he pulls out a box of

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,480
matches from his pocket he cracks a

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,929
match he lights the grass in front of

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:23,470
him and another fire rips straight up

00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:26,590
the hill towards the ridge and he starts

00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:30,340
screaming at the man to lie down in the

00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:34,030
burned ash but at this stage the men are

00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,620
exhausted there's smoke absolutely

00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:39,340
everywhere the men are like black

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:42,880
figures in the smoke the heat from this

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:47,380
fire is intense the roar from this fire

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,940
is monstrous dodge is standing there in

00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:52,510
the middle of all this screaming at them

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:56,050
to lie down then he hears out of the

00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:58,420
smoke someone say to hell with that and

00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:01,240
then he watches as the black figures

00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:04,929
just disappear one by one into the smoke

00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:09,070
the men are continuing to run to get to

00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:10,990
the top of that Ridge Rumsey and Sal get

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:13,030
there first they're the youngest they

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,770
find a crevasse that's really quite

00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,420
right they can't see to through the

00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,660
other side of it because it's twists off

00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,920
but they think they might give it a go

00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,350
Rumsey hesitates he turns around he

00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:27,340
looks back down the slope he sees dodge

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:29,800
tie handkerchief round his mouth and lie

00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:35,020
down in the burnt grass just as a wall

00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:36,910
of water roars over the top of them then

00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,950
they watch for a few seconds in horror

00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:44,410
as that fire starts to pick off the

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:46,030
trail of men running up the hill they

00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,200
turn round they jump to the crevice to

00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,230
start making their way through it

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,510
bizarrely they find this juniper bush in

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,000
the middle of everything Rumsey sits

00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:56,890
down beside the juniper bush Sal says

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,870
not until Rumsey seems to realize if I

00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,730
sit here and going to die he stands back

00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,320
up the two men make

00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,850
we're through the crevice miraculously

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,830
they get through to the other side

00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,960
they found that we're through they start

00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:10,270
running down the other side of the

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,370
valley the fire does not stop it comes

00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,840
straight across the top straight down

00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,960
their side of the valley and starts

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:20,290
chasing them down that side by good luck

00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:23,320
we find a rock shelf hole rock exposed

00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:27,280
area and they move around on that as the

00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:31,480
fire burns its way round them and then

00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:34,630
it's gone and they're sitting there they

00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,070
can't believe they've survived let me

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:39,280
hear the sounds of someone stumbling

00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:40,570
down their side of the valley and it's

00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,880
one of the main it's one of the men

00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,679
called Hellman and he's been really

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,440
badly burned he's going to die from his

00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:49,120
injuries before noon the next day and

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,720
they comfort him as best he has best

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:55,179
they can and Hellman gives Sal a message

00:24:52,720 --> 00:25:00,160
for his wife but the following morning's

00:24:55,179 --> 00:25:07,419
I can't remember what the messages the

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:09,760
men died between 557 and 559 we know

00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:13,210
this because Harrison was wearing a

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:20,950
watch and that was the time the pans

00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:23,380
were melted into the face it takes five

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:26,049
long minutes think of how long that is

00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:30,010
for the fire front to burn across judges

00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:31,960
position the updraft is so bad he's

00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:33,549
physically lifted off the ground three

00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:39,820
times he thinks he's going to be pulled

00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:41,679
up into the fire and then it's gone and

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,049
he stands up and amazingly he's pretty

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,040
unhurt and he looks back down in the

00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:48,460
valley and he said it was like a

00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:52,330
moonscape just burn clean and it was

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:55,630
perfectly silent except for the sound of

00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:58,360
staccato explosions as trees which whose

00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:01,840
resin had been superheated started to

00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,400
explode and pop down the valley then he

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,980
turned around and he started walk back

00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,540
up the valley towards the ridge and he

00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:11,350
started to make grim discovery after

00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:18,019
grim discovery after grim discovery

00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:20,779
now thirteen men died in the valley that

00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:22,669
day now we could talk about a lot of

00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,169
things about what happened in here and

00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:26,989
many people have and we're going to talk

00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:29,179
about just two two things their hope of

00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:31,210
interest to us today the first is you

00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:35,769
know why didn't the guys dropped it whoa

00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:38,739
whoa there we go

00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:40,999
why didn't the guys drop the tunes you

00:26:38,739 --> 00:26:42,200
know they knew the ridge was too far

00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:44,749
away I mean that was that was pretty

00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,369
clear at this point but they still kept

00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:48,799
running why didn't they drop the chills

00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:51,470
even after they were given an order to

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,789
do that the second question is why

00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:54,700
didn't they use this gift fire you know

00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:58,100
here was their leader saying do this I

00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,330
may ignored it they ignored it even

00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,499
though they knew they probably weren't

00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:02,570
going to get to that Ridge because if we

00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:04,879
can answer these two questions we can

00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:06,499
actually tell a lot about how we think

00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:07,700
when we're under pressure now I know

00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:13,249
we're unlikely to get caught in a

00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:15,919
bushfire situation but we all react in a

00:27:13,249 --> 00:27:17,149
similar sort of way when we're faced

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,749
with pressure so answering these

00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:22,039
questions can tell us a lot about that

00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:23,570
how do we answer these questions well to

00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:27,350
answer these questions we need to talk

00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:29,539
about a thing called priming now priming

00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:32,239
is a psychological term and what it

00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:35,570
means is that you get put in a certain

00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:39,080
stage you get information that Prime's

00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:40,940
you to behave in a certain way it's

00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,549
generally subconscious and it's

00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,590
generally automatic now there's a very

00:27:43,549 --> 00:27:47,179
famous example of this which was done in

00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,580
New York University they took some

00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:51,409
students as part of a study between 18

00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:54,230
and 22 years of Ages and the ages are

00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:56,509
important and they decided to test them

00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:58,850
for priming and what they did was they

00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:02,960
said right come into a room we're gonna

00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:04,609
give you a bunch of word games what you

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,249
get is you get five words and you have

00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:08,539
to turn it into a four word sentence you

00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:10,460
don't have to use one of the words five

00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:13,279
words turn into a four word sentence

00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,440
they had a control group in the room and

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,999
they had a different group before we get

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,269
to that what's the five word what's the

00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:22,730
four word sentence oranges are from

00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:23,870
Florida so very very simple so we the

00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:25,340
control group got a list

00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:28,460
of sentences they had to move true

00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:34,990
individually and the other group had a

00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:37,850
peppering of words among their sentences

00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:41,170
wrinkled forgetful bald Florida bingo

00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:48,400
grain and what does that remind you of

00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:51,650
that read Saturday oh the elderly yes so

00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,680
this group are subjected to words that

00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:58,760
we associate with the elderly they

00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:01,400
finish their tests in room one they're

00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,620
told to walk out a room one walk down

00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:07,730
the hall walk into room two where

00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:10,400
they're going to do another test now

00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:11,630
they were lied to because the tests

00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,440
weren't actually happening in the room

00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:17,630
at all the tests were happening in the

00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,750
hallway they timed how long it took

00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:24,080
people to walk between room one and room

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:25,670
two and they found that the group had

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,540
been exposed to the more elderly team

00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:32,660
words walked slower to room two than the

00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,980
others now you may think that's absolute

00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,840
crap Shawn that's rubbish

00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,850
absolute rubbish well it's not it's

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:41,780
repeatable and it's even got a name they

00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:44,179
call it the florida effect the people

00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:46,940
were primed to behave in a more elderly

00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:49,250
fashion and it just seems insane doesn't

00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:51,110
it it seems absolutely insane that we

00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:54,700
could play some word games and suddenly

00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:57,320
we'd all start behaving in a certain way

00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,880
so I thought we'd test ourselves to see

00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,670
if this happened to see if sometimes

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,240
we're not near as rational as we think

00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:05,090
we are

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,760
what if sometimes someone else is loose

00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:08,929
at the controls so what we're going to

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,179
do is we're going to play a bunch of

00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:15,230
these games which are called remote

00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:16,670
associative tests or rat tests which is

00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,780
a lovely name for them what we're going

00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,920
to do is we're going to put three words

00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,929
up here and you need to come up with

00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,670
another word a fourth word that when you

00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:25,400
put with those three words actually

00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:28,780
makes sense anyone like to take a shot

00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:32,330
oh jeez jeez so we have blue cheese

00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,890
cheese knife cottage cheese so are you

00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,690
all ready this works best if everyone

00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,880
just goes for it just shows us right

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:40,720
show that you ready

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:43,030
here we go safety cushion point tin

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,360
safety pin pin cushion pinpoint plate

00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:49,150
broken shot go for it last plate glass

00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:54,910
broken glass shot glass here we go stick

00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:57,010
maker point much matchstick match maker

00:30:54,910 --> 00:31:00,580
match point this is a controversial one

00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:02,830
kay and daddy plum sugar cane sugar

00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,570
daddy sugar plum now we're gonna keep

00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:06,100
going I'm gonna put some other words in

00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,300
brackets don't even read the brackets

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:12,300
the words in the brackets don't even

00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,300
look at the words in the brackets Hey go

00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:19,480
it's really hard isn't it someone one

00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:22,360
person got a cold hearted cold feet

00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,040
being a cold there's just something

00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,700
about those words in the brackets that

00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:30,190
are just not fair

00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,680
and what's really really interesting is

00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:33,280
that it actually feels like your brains

00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:39,340
gone

00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:42,460
nah I'm out I'm out I'm tapping out dark

00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:46,720
glasses shot glasses sunglasses now what

00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:48,700
is well what is happening here is that

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,370
the words and the brackets are

00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,660
negatively priming you so you were

00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:54,970
nailing it up till you got to those

00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,500
words in the brackets and then the words

00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:58,030
in the brackets are negatively premiere

00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:00,010
why are they negatively priming you well

00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:03,430
this was was put together by evil

00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:05,080
psychologists and those words are

00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:07,200
negatively priming you because what is

00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:09,580
happening is when you see the word dark

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,190
your brain automatically reads the word

00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,890
light and the word light has been

00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:18,720
deliberately selected to make your brain

00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:21,040
go down a solution part that's incorrect

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,840
the really interesting thing about this

00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,050
is once your brain starts going down

00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:29,040
that solution path you cannot stop it

00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:31,960
you cannot get it back you cannot unsee

00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,520
the words in those brackets I've seen

00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,140
some people put their hand up there was

00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,910
one person who did it to cover the words

00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,500
you can't stop your being reading the

00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:41,290
words and once those words sent you on

00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:43,270
that wrong solution path you were in

00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:46,000
trouble now think about what's happening

00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:49,650
there is your rational thinking has been

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,470
messed up with deliberately and

00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,580
predictably we're not nearly as rational

00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:57,520
as we think we are so we're being

00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,960
negatively primed here now what's really

00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,490
interesting about this is if we came

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,050
back after lunch and I showed you the

00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:04,510
words without the words inside the

00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:06,190
brackets you would absolutely mail it

00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,320
you would nail it in exactly the same

00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:11,020
way as you nail the first ones because

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,230
what happens is your brain has time to

00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,190
forget the negatively priming words

00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,780
because your brain has forgot them

00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,990
you're not negatively primed anymore

00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:22,270
you can find the solution this is why

00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:26,100
you get most of your best ideas in the

00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:29,050
shower we tend to think this is because

00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:31,810
we've had more time to think about the

00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:33,610
problem but the reality of what's

00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:35,470
happening is whether we get the ideas in

00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:37,510
the shower or the gym or driving in the

00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:38,650
car or when we're over for work what's

00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,090
that right for walk what's actually

00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,220
happening is

00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:46,150
that the negative priming that's at your

00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,860
desk at work every day all the stuff

00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:51,150
that's sending you on the wrong solution

00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,900
paths you've had time to forget and

00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,340
suddenly when you think about the

00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,780
problem you're not thinking about it in

00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:58,150
terms of those negatively priming

00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,460
elements you're thinking about what are

00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:02,620
the core facts what are the core issues

00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,380
you're trying to deal with and suddenly

00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,580
because of a thing called incubation

00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:08,860
because you do not have those negative

00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:10,800
Prime's you were able to think through

00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:15,010
that problem in a much more rational

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,680
sensible way now this point you might

00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:20,260
say well hang on a minute Shawn there

00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,280
are some fancy word games but I'm a

00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:26,410
trained professional

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:29,140
I possess expertise I'm trained in what

00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:31,420
I do I've got expertise that will save

00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:34,120
me from this sort of silliness that

00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:35,680
you're talking about I will not run into

00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:38,170
negative priming because I possess

00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,330
expertise well a team at the University

00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:42,240
of Pittsburgh said well that's an

00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:45,970
interesting idea I wonder if that's true

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,370
what if our expertise can actually prime

00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,870
us what happens if instead of our

00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:51,940
expertise necessarily being always a

00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:53,830
good thing it can actually trip us up

00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:56,410
what happens if negative our expertise

00:34:53,830 --> 00:35:00,040
can Primus in a way that those words in

00:34:56,410 --> 00:35:02,620
the brackets primed us what happens if

00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,570
our expertise is a barrier to rational

00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,430
thinking and problem-solving on what

00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,260
we're trying to actually problem or

00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:10,360
actually solves so how did she Jennifer

00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:13,390
Wiley and her team work at this were how

00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,070
do you test for priming because of

00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:17,620
expertise well what she did was she

00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:19,600
picked a control group and then she

00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:23,830
picked a group who knew a lot about

00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:25,900
baseball avid baseball fans and what she

00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:28,300
did was she said well let's design some

00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:30,700
remote associative tests some rat tests

00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,140
three words but instead of putting words

00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,420
inside brackets that will negatively

00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:37,410
priming people why don't we set the test

00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:39,820
up in a way that the people will prime

00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:42,250
themselves because of their baseball

00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,870
knowledge let's set it up that when they

00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:46,030
see the first word they'll make a

00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:47,620
connection with baseball and it's that

00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:50,620
connection that sets them on the wrong

00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:53,260
solution path let's see what happens so

00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:57,430
this is the sort of thing she did well

00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:58,660
the answer unless is really cruel

00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:03,310
because I've actually just deliberately

00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:05,740
negatively primed you so gold is the

00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:07,030
right answer strike gold quite gold gold

00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,260
medal but of course what happens is

00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,910
because we've talked about baseball

00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:12,160
you're already primed to think about

00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:13,720
baseball now she didn't do this she

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,300
didn't well we'll get to that but she

00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,500
didn't do it initially so they didn't

00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,820
have that problem but because I talked

00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,470
about baseball and you were negatively

00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:23,970
primed what happens to most people's

00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:27,610
head in this room is you go strike out a

00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:31,810
good baseball term why Tosh still doing

00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:33,970
good then you go middle that doesn't

00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:35,260
work and then what's really difficult

00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,850
for most people in the room is once you

00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,580
get that far you can't undo this

00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:44,560
thinking you can't get back to the clean

00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:46,000
slate and find the answer is gold so how

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,830
do you think it went how did the

00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,630
baseball people do did they do really

00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:52,120
well or did they do appalling li did

00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,830
their expertise negatively primed them

00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:57,040
set them on the wrong solution path and

00:36:53,830 --> 00:37:00,340
they ended up in trouble yep they

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,200
absolutely crashed and burned really

00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,120
really badly what was interesting was

00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,470
she asked him when they were leaving do

00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,970
you use your baseball knowledge and they

00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:11,170
said no why would I had nothing to do a

00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:12,970
baseball which shows one of the key

00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,770
things we have about our expertise in

00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:16,930
priming which is we we use it

00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:19,510
subconsciously we don't even know we're

00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:21,480
using it the next thing she started to

00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:24,250
say was what happens if we warn people

00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,140
what happens if we actually say this

00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:28,060
test is designed to mess with your head

00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:31,830
because you know about baseball do not

00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,830
on any account use your baseball

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,820
she warned them and they did just as bad

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,510
and what she found from that was that

00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:47,720
not only is our expertise subconscious

00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:50,900
but it's also automatic we can't not use

00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:52,790
it we can't not use what we have in her

00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:56,690
head we do it automatically we do it

00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:58,370
subconsciously and that's fine for most

00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:59,930
of what we do but we run into problems

00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:03,110
when the problem we're trying to solve

00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:07,130
is slightly different slightly outside

00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:09,910
our expertise we'll use our expertise

00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:12,830
consciously and automatically anyway

00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:17,720
even if it's going to give us the wrong

00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:18,860
answer that's exactly what's happening

00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:24,530
in the northern slopes

00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:27,200
mangog and the 5th of August 1949 the

00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:30,560
Maine can no sooner drop their

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,960
firefighting expertise than the baseball

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,210
fan was good and that goes for both

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,240
physical and mental tools they couldn't

00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,770
drop their physical tunes and they

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:42,850
couldn't drop their mental tools which

00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:45,530
told them you have to get to the ridge

00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:47,990
no no he could not drop these tears but

00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:51,260
they couldn't accept new tools when

00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:54,680
dodge showed them that fire that escaped

00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:58,280
fire they couldn't accept it they'd

00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:00,620
rather defaulted to their existing

00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,050
expertise and worked with the tools they

00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,520
had and there's a name for this they

00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,510
call it the law of the instrument when

00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,710
all you have is a hammer everything

00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:10,730
looks like a nail

00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:13,340
and we are all people running around

00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:17,240
with our respective hammers looking for

00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:20,450
nails to hit we see the world through

00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:23,420
the prism of our expertise and we cannot

00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:25,760
stop ourselves doing so and the problem

00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:28,010
with that is that if we're in a

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,840
situation like the firefighters were or

00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:33,170
the baseball fans were where our

00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,720
expertise is not appropriate where the

00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:39,560
tools we have available are not going to

00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:41,300
solve the problems we're in do we accept

00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,850
that no we don't we default to our

00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,170
expertise and we ignore the

00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:47,950
it's because we're now ignoring the

00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:51,620
facts we actually can't effectively

00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:55,190
problem-solve and this is not just a

00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:57,880
rational problem this is what makes it

00:39:55,190 --> 00:40:00,080
so tricky it's also an emotional problem

00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:01,940
Norman MacLean again the guy who wrote

00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,910
the book he said when a firefighter is

00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:06,710
told to drop his firefighting tools he

00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:10,520
is told to forget he is a firefighter

00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:10,820
and run for his life and we're all the

00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,430
same

00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:16,520
it is deeply uncomfortably but

00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:18,770
rationally and emotionally to accept

00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,540
that the tools you have are no longer

00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:23,960
able to solve the problem you're faced

00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:26,270
with most of us will default to relying

00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,010
on those tools anyway this is why when

00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:31,190
we do failure investigations we see all

00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:33,260
these warning signs that tell us that

00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:35,210
failure is imminent regardless of what

00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,920
profession you're in when we look back

00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:38,870
with hindsight after the fair they're

00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,670
really obvious warning signs they're not

00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:42,230
warning signs the people involved in the

00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,670
failure there are things that are

00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:46,540
inconsistent with that person's

00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:49,160
expertise therefore must be irrelevant I

00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:52,040
have relied on my expertise my entire

00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:55,970
career why would I not continue to do so

00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:58,520
no they found there was a huge problem

00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:01,220
with the firefighters after mangog they

00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,020
said right well we have to we have to

00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,000
train our firefighters that they can run

00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,770
they can drop the tools and they can run

00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,900
so they told them you know if you're in

00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:10,070
a situation where you're not going to

00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,330
run this fire but you should carry on

00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,450
all your tools and drop all your tools

00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:17,000
and run did that work

00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:18,940
no it didn't work right up until the

00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,560
2000s there were still killing

00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:23,000
firefighters who were almost in their

00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,380
safe zones and when they'd find these

00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,670
guys the guy still had their backpacks

00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:30,260
on and they were still holding their

00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:32,450
chainsaws so what did they do they

00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:34,130
actually had to train them properly to

00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:35,630
drop their tunes what they'd do is

00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,400
they'd make them run an obstacle course

00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:39,170
with the tools on and timed them and

00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,580
then make them run the same obstacle

00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:43,510
course with the chills off and say hey

00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:43,510
look you're much faster

00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,950
now that sounds absolutely silly doesn't

00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:52,220
it but what they're actually doing is

00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:53,780
they're embedding in YouTube in to the

00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,720
tool box for the firefighters they're

00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:58,970
saying this is something you can do and

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,980
you're still a firefighter very very

00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:04,700
important point and they call this

00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:07,460
comparison awareness and refinement so

00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:10,040
comparison is simply you know I can run

00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:12,170
with tools or without tools awareness is

00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:14,690
I can firefight much more effectively

00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:16,790
with tools but I can run much more

00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:19,970
effectively what I've chose and then

00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:22,610
refinement am i firefighting or am i

00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:24,890
running they take a decision that's

00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:27,260
subconscious and they make it conscious

00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:29,120
and explicit and then they give the

00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:31,160
people the training to actually deal

00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,390
with that so that was the firefighters

00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,090
but what about dodge I mean what dodge

00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:36,920
did was truly truly amazing not only

00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:39,710
that he dropped his physical tools but

00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:41,690
he dropped his mental tools and he came

00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:42,920
up with a whole new tool this concept of

00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,750
an escape fire which was then

00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,210
subsequently built into all the training

00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,750
for for all firefighters how did this

00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:50,540
happen

00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,160
what was going on in his head that was

00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,660
completely different than any other

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:57,080
men's head

00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:59,480
well the psychologists have a name for

00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:03,710
this as well and they call a creative

00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:05,210
desperation and we've all been in this

00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:07,010
situation where you're trying to solve a

00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:09,110
problem and you have tried everything

00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,550
you know and suddenly you realize you're

00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:12,230
not able to solve this problem and at

00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:15,700
that very last moment when your back is

00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:18,110
truly at the wall you suddenly go ah

00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:20,300
it's actually quite an obvious answer

00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:23,420
and what's actually happening in there

00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:25,370
is you are dropping your tools you are

00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:28,160
accepting and admitting to yourself that

00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:30,800
everything you know all your expertise

00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,750
is not going to solve this problem for

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,600
you and you drop it

00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:37,130
and once you do you see the facts for

00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,930
what they are and once you see the facts

00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:40,580
for what they are you have a chance of

00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:44,030
solving the problem and dodge knew that

00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:46,000
a fire needs fuel oxygen and heat and

00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:48,410
you can't do anything about the last two

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,510
but he can get rid of the fuel and

00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:56,300
that's what he did which brings us full

00:43:53,510 --> 00:44:00,560
circle back to our friends in Hartford

00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:03,380
and we have repeated warnings that this

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,940
structure is unsafe but it's not

00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,700
behaving in the same way as the

00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:10,670
engineers think it should be behaving

00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,110
and they ignore the warning and ignore

00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:15,140
the warning and ignore the warning and

00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:17,600
they do so because they keep defaulting

00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:21,290
back to their expertise our calculations

00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:26,110
see it's okay so it must be okay even

00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:29,140
though the facts are telling us it's not

00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:32,030
now there's a little twist in here

00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:36,440
something very specific about this

00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:40,100
particular failure to drop the tools and

00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:44,020
this is early 70s why were these guys so

00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:45,860
so confident in their calculations

00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:50,810
exactly they just got their first

00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:52,160
computer in fact what they did was they

00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,750
went to the City of Hartford when they

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,040
won the job and they said we can save

00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,510
you half a million dollars in

00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,390
construction costs if you buy us this

00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,960
new whiz bagging thing called a computer

00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:01,430
they'll be able to do all our

00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,870
calculations on it it'll be much more

00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:05,450
efficient than humans it'll get a much

00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:07,460
better answer unfortunately the computer

00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:12,140
worked just fine they just put all the

00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:13,700
wrong inputs in and interestingly this

00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,190
is where we get back to this emotional

00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:18,830
investment you've just convinced the

00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:21,500
city of Hartford to back your decision

00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:24,020
to to get this brand-new computer that's

00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:26,600
going to be amazing it's almost

00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:31,010
inconceivable but that thing can now be

00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:32,720
wrong we see this specifically when we

00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:34,370
get to computers because remember

00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:36,860
computers have enabled people to make

00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:39,950
more mistakes faster than almost any

00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:43,480
invention in history with the possible

00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:43,480
exception of tequila and handguns

00:45:44,229 --> 00:45:50,209
so we're faced with a choice we all have

00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:52,279
expertise we love that expertise we need

00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:54,229
that expertise to do our jobs but we

00:45:52,279 --> 00:45:56,630
will be faced in our careers regardless

00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:59,569
of what it is times when our expertise

00:45:56,630 --> 00:46:03,049
will not further fect leafit the problem

00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:04,880
that we are trying to solve and all of

00:46:03,049 --> 00:46:08,150
psychology tells us that once that

00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:12,279
happens we will default to using that

00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:14,569
expertise regardless of how wrong it is

00:46:12,279 --> 00:46:17,059
and that's where we have to try and work

00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:21,549
with a choice because one choice is we

00:46:17,059 --> 00:46:25,009
can be 15 doomed men running up a ridge

00:46:21,549 --> 00:46:28,009
trying to get there before the fire gets

00:46:25,009 --> 00:46:30,789
them hanging on to our tools the whole

00:46:28,009 --> 00:46:33,650
way to the top or we can be like dodge

00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:36,079
we can see the warning signs for what

00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:38,089
they are we can accept that our

00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:40,429
expertise is no longer applicable for

00:46:38,089 --> 00:46:43,009
the situation we're in and we can drop

00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:46,249
them and see the facts for what they are

00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:47,749
that's ultimately the battle we all have

00:46:46,249 --> 00:46:50,119
to go through in that situation because

00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:53,420
in the pursuit of knowledge every day

00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:58,329
something is acquired but in the pursuit

00:46:53,420 --> 00:47:00,390
of wisdom every day something is dropped

00:46:58,329 --> 00:47:10,739
thank you very much

00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:10,739
[Applause]

00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:15,190
come from

00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:23,809
thank you very much Sean for that

00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:26,059
insightful presentation we've got a

00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:30,380
small gift for you oh thank you actually

00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:31,940
slightly heavier than all of our

00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,520
keynotes this week we'll be getting

00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,500
thunder eggs that are polished very

00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,690
nicely they're from Mount Tamborine just

00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:41,089
in the Gold Coast hinterland and we hope

00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:42,740
that you can enjoy this as a memento of

00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:53,510
presenting here thank you Joe Thank You

00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:56,140
Ben thank you Thank You Vera for coming

00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:56,140
