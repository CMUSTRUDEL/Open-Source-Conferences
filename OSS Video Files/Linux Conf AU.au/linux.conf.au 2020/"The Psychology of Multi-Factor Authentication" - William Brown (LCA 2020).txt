Multi Factor Authentication is becoming more important in our infrastructure, with organisations starting to require it for sensitive accounts and more. So why does Multi Factor Authentication ... work? How does human behaviour influence our security and interact with threats that exist online?

Come along and learn about human interaction and design, the psychology of how humans interact with systems. We'll extend this into security to understand why human error is really the fault of poor systems design. Finally we'll talk about different threats and how MFA works to protect us from them - at a psychological level.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
