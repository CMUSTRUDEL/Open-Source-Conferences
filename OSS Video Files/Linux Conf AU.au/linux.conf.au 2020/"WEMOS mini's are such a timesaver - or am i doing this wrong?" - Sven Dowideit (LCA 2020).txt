I was roped into helping FollyGames, an emersive theatre and performance group, to build distributed actuators to add to their experiences.
Initially, to rescue a performance at the Museum of Brisbane, using Raspberry pi's, audio and NFC, and then over time, adding neopixels, UHF RFID, buttons, motors, servos and more.
In and attempt to head off the joys of last minute ideas, I've been leaning heavily on using WEMOS Mini's and the shields that you can buy on aliexpress
