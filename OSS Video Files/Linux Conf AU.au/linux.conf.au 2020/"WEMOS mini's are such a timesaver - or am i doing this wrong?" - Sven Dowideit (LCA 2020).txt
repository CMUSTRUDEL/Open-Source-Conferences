I was roped into helping FollyGames, an emersive theatre and performance group, to build distributed actuators to add to their experiences.
Initially, to rescue a performance at the Museum of Brisbane, using Raspberry pi's, audio and NFC, and then over time, adding neopixels, UHF RFID, buttons, motors, servos and more.
In and attempt to head off the joys of last minute ideas, I've been leaning heavily on using WEMOS Mini's and the shields that you can buy on aliexpress

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

hi I'm Sven first thing I'd like to say

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,880
is that I came and did this assembly

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:16,830
thing in Auckland many years ago and it

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,010
reminded me how much fun it was and

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:23,490
eventually got me into doing this so so

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,080
all of to all of you who organize this

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,189
and all of you who attend to make sure

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,920
that they do it every year

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,900
thank you very much it's brilliant it's

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,950
a wonderful way to remind some of us

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,270
that we can do more I think my demo is

00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,649
defective looking at this because half

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,760
the stuff hasn't started so it doesn't

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,210
matter okay

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,010
so in my day job I'm a devil I have done

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,250
all sorts of software things I don't do

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,270
hardware my last hardware before all of

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:54,660
this was my thesis and then somewhere

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,570
because of these things somebody who

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,309
knows me from Woodford or knows me via a

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,570
friend of a friend roped us into

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:06,270
building hardware for theatres and I'm

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,430
not going to cover all of it but over

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,240
the last two years we've we've done four

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:15,060
shows and it's been great fun and what I

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,009
was going to try to talk about is the

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:20,850
exact opposite of what all the rest of

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,950
the talks are in that I want to remind

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,700
you this is so much easier than you

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:30,869
think it is so long as you

00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:34,079
over-provision so mark and and and Tish

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,960
talked about the ESP 32 being too small

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:42,780
and being a pain for all of my purposes

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,340
it's massive and so yeah hopefully I'll

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,549
cover that in a way that makes sense

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,670
okay so the worst thing about this is I

00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:54,360
now have a new hobby and the hobby is to

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,479
add distributed tiny things that prop

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,250
designers can then build into something

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,560
one of the crops that I wish was working

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:05,850
is this thing here it's got an esp8266

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:10,770
in it and some neopixels and then we put

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:12,370
an A UHF and NFC thing on it so when we

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,819
put it on the reader it

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:18,790
and we get a sound effect but it looks

00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:23,410
to all intents and purposes like oh just

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:28,690
see if I can do this maybe later it'll

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:34,930
work I simply don't have enough power

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:36,640
here okay alright so there we've done

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,769
four things one of the the first thing

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,920
was a thing at Museum Brisbane where we

00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:44,590
used six raspberry PI's yeah NFC readers

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,480
and then a whole pile of props and the

00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,180
whole point of the show from my

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,599
perspective was to create some really

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,910
simple things that you put on these

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,650
breeders that then trigger audio and the

00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,860
only trick was that it had to work

00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:02,019
without me being there and it did so for

00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,610
four months the actors rolled out this

00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,069
entire set put it all together plugged

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,510
it in and did their show for an hour

00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:10,030
then they packed it all the way I

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,099
brought it back out again and they did

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,220
four shows a weekend and then a whole

00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:17,310
pile of shows during the week and I

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,700
think the reason it worked was because

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:23,319
what I did was use what we do in

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,480
large-scale websites where we have micro

00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:28,569
service type architectures so everything

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,630
was as simple and as stupid as it could

00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:34,239
be because it was a rush job for me I

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,510
think most of the code was essentially

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,000
the demo code for whatever device I was

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:46,530
using wrapped in a little bit more

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,530
Python to do MQTT and so if we're lucky

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:55,419
you get that which from the perspective

00:03:50,889 --> 00:04:02,889
of your average punter is magic and no

00:03:55,419 --> 00:04:04,870
way ya know it's magic for me too it's

00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:05,980
it's one of those really hard curses

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,660
where while you're building this it

00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:11,380
becomes boring and simple and trivial

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:15,030
and then we see an actor sell the story

00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:17,950
and do this thing it's just like wow

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,079
and then Woodford would produce a

00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:22,630
wonderful project in 2018 I turned up

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,160
nothing worked and we tried to get

00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:26,470
dueling working and

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,110
don't know I may have forgotten to give

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,000
us photos and then we did another show

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,280
this year and then finally Woodford

00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,850
which is this year's show where which

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,250
I've got most of the photos for this is

00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,200
what the prop people built in the whole

00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,470
month before Woodford so all of December

00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,450
they build this large area about this

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:50,230
sort of you know front of the bill there

00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:52,690
the room size set into which they placed

00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,790
you know professional lighting and sound

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:58,060
and smoke machines that we had to

00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:02,530
control and also actuators using these

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:05,860
simple little spo2 sixes which then used

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:09,040
MQTT so this thing here is literally

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,470
just pinging the bus asking for you know

00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,690
is the button pushed and when it is it

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:15,760
sends out an MQTT message and that is

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,130
all it does and that's what I mean by

00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:23,200
this thing is way overpowered for the

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:26,820
purpose but I think let's just ignore

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:29,320
the backboard that's $7 worth of stuff

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,380
you know if you were doing large amounts

00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:35,160
I'm sure you'd care but in my case that

00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:39,460
was perfect it doesn't take any time and

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:42,130
then not only does this prop get built

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:44,110
by volunteers in a month without me

00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,400
being there because I have a day job but

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,560
then they get some volunteers who've

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,290
never seen this stuff before to build

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:53,740
all of the interactions so they you know

00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:55,450
find an RFID tag that they've attached

00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,800
to something and on one of the many

00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:01,780
readers it triggers something that's

00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:04,900
some audio that comes from the museum's

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:08,200
Brisbane show where the podiums we had

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:12,190
six of them had different personalities

00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:17,350
and and the actors play to that and and

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:20,350
riff off at to add to the experience to

00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:22,630
my surprise this month this year we had

00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:26,650
two volunteers who basically created the

00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:28,780
entire show I haven't looked into how

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,990
the node Reds done yet it worked and I

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,970
don't care

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,550
they they wrote the the interfacing for

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:38,100
DMX and then the entire control system

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,020
effectively for this all I did was put

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:44,970
together the devices that then they

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:46,349
could use this is the beastie that for

00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,539
me saves me lots of time and money

00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:52,979
although I noticed that I think I paid

00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:56,400
five bucks for five bucks a pop for each

00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:58,410
of these and I've got 30 40 of them but

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:04,410
then you've got the SP 32 version that's

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:06,449
four dollars a pop yeah considering that

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,610
in the 90s we used to buy something this

00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:11,130
powerful for hundreds of dollars and be

00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,789
scared of breaking it

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:17,099
it's just frightening lis awesome and

00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:20,340
then from Aliexpress again you get a

00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:24,750
whole stack of shields that allow us to

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:26,669
quickly prototype stuff out and I get

00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:29,159
the feeling that you know the power the

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:32,340
DC power one is your board that they've

00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:34,080
just swiped and yeah and it looks

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:38,190
suspiciously the same as the one they

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,979
sell just in a different color yeah yeah

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,449
no which is you know from our

00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,680
perspective really awesome because we

00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:45,389
don't have to think very hard we just

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,370
get a stack of them if we break one we

00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:56,430
don't care yep this is that typical

00:07:50,370 --> 00:08:01,289
thing if I needed some things not very

00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:02,909
many and they're easy to program if you

00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:06,659
don't look under the hood what have you

00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:09,210
do don't look under the hood you end up

00:08:06,659 --> 00:08:10,919
with what Mark did and finding out how

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:15,210
old memory allocation goes and it's just

00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:17,190
don't want to know I I think almost all

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:21,150
of my code looks pretty much like the

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:24,270
examples plus a bit of MQTT because when

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:25,800
the theater producers or the actors come

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,380
to me they basically go so we're a

00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:35,070
performance tomorrow we want to do this

00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:37,349
and I'm like okay so here and this is

00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,419
also why I pretty much make it so that

00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:41,719
each one of these does one thing and one

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:41,719
thing only

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:50,550
okay so here we go we have you know the

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:53,460
neopixel thing and that turns into some

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:56,190
glowing mushrooms and to me that's the

00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:00,630
standout prop of this year where we just

00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:04,500
have this lovely ability to change

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:17,780
colors I'm gonna risk it so we get these

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:17,780
lovely purples and things like that yes

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:25,140
[Music]

00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:27,120
No so this one's powered from your speed

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:52,500
because I've reduced the brightness down

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:55,200
to you know so my biggest problem with

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:58,380
this one which only has 32 neopixels in

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:02,880
it is that max brightness it Browns out

00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:06,750
the CPU and I end up having nothing yeah

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:10,710
yeah and it's like fine you know reduce

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,390
it but these things here I got really

00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,000
lucky

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:17,510
my brother-in-law found 112 volt power

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,180
supplies on the side of the road and so

00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:23,310
so now we have power supplies coming out

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:28,350
of our ears and I don't have to carry

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:30,180
any more and and the caveat to all of

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,760
this is is that I am very carefully

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:36,090
ignoring any knowledge of electricity

00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,790
here we even have the point where we've

00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:41,970
got two of these power DC power adapters

00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:43,470
going into one board one to power the

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,460
motor and the other one to power the ESP

00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:50,300
board and it feels bad and I'm sure

00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:53,100
someone here can tell me why it's bad

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,760
this is another one so this is the SP 32

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:59,290
board which I use only to be for touch

00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,300
because the tree has these feathers on

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,940
it and the kids run around touching them

00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:06,040
and all they do is change the color of

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:11,290
the tree so they change the DMX lights

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:13,420
which looks gorgeous at nighttime and

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:16,680
we've got these linear motors they sound

00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:21,640
awful and they got converted into this

00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:23,529
octopus that moves and then they've also

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,890
attached the touch controller to the

00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:29,560
chains so you touch the the chains and

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:31,240
the octopus moves in a different way and

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:41,740
that then becomes part of the story that

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:45,640
the actors can tell yes they gave you

00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:49,329
two rows of peanuts instead of one I may

00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:51,130
as well yeah so it's you know so though

00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:53,019
the inner pins are pin compatible with

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,930
the way Mouse and then the outer ones

00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:58,540
are the extra bits and it's cheaper than

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:06,550
the 80-66 version which I find

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:10,890
embarrassing and then these you know 25

00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:13,029
kilo servos become flowers which

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:15,040
underneath there's a board that lifts

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:17,800
the the sticks and then the servos have

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,550
an armature so that they open the

00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,320
flowers up which again is one of those

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,329
really simple little things you budge

00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:29,529
together but when you have people

00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:31,600
telling a story it looks incredible well

00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:33,490
then we have an RFID reader while NFC

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,130
reader with a Raspberry Pi attached

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:39,490
because I've been too lazy to DSP that

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:43,449
and that becomes a tree stump with a

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:46,390
reader in it and the cup over there when

00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:52,870
you put that on the reader gives you

00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:54,010
wait maybe I can do this maybe gets your

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,830
lightly

00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:59,470
but then on top of that because the set

00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:04,210
is a great big cloud during the daytime

00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:05,740
it rains and so and the raining was just

00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:07,690
one of these boards with a relay on it

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,730
and everything else the prop people just

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:15,100
went out bought the pieces and made it

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:18,100
work and so the biggest takeaway I think

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,900
from what I've ended up being able to

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,240
experience is that you can close your

00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:27,040
eyes not worry about the details of how

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,840
it works or any of understanding most of

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,710
electronics even and you can get away

00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,820
with building something amazing so long

00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,070
as you're willing to spend a little bit

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,680
more I mean if you if you design

00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:40,720
something specifically to do that would

00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:49,060
it cost more or less than ten bucks in

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:51,640
the end biggie no no yes yeah and I mean

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,050
that that's that's kind of sad but it

00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,670
does mean that I have this thing that

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:58,750
the prop builders will build into

00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:00,490
something else next time and so like the

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,400
the woodford show ended up with a whole

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:05,020
stack of things we had to build probably

00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,720
the biggest nasty thing was that we had

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:10,210
to buy a big ubiquity mesh network

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:17,170
because otherwise this stuff is just not

00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:20,560
reliable enough yes this on the other

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:22,030
hand is my nightmare you know the

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,820
director comes to me and says we want to

00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:28,530
do this and I'll spend weeks staring at

00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:30,880
different places I can buy things and

00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:32,050
you know then on top of that you've got

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,210
to think about the fact it takes time to

00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,780
arrive so in the end you order something

00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:38,920
and hope that it works

00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,720
funnily enough same things to your

00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:44,260
software there are so many libraries to

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,330
do the same thing and so this is where

00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,190
the messages just pick something use it

00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:50,740
it probably will do most of what you

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:53,080
need unless you're running towards the

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:55,480
you know the capacity of the device and

00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,880
that's why I kind of go get something

00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,300
massive and if you're in mark situation

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,960
cook something way bigger I mean raspy

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:11,030
but why would you want to use a screen

00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:13,010
yeah yeah is anybody interested this is

00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,470
what the message our metric messages

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:18,710
look like for all of these devices they

00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:20,410
are really simple JSON packets and I

00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,700
mean I feel slightly weird about

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,350
constructing Jason in an embedded

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:28,520
processor and then throwing it over a

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:31,700
network but then you know I first played

00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,470
with embedded things in 1995 where it

00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,150
was build a bootloader build an

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:38,750
operating system build at this build

00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:43,910
that all just to get a cart running

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:46,850
around yeah it was literally you know

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:50,480
this sort of thing spent the whole year

00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:55,450
doing it as a thesis and now you know I

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,450
can send an event we got one more thing

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:05,450
and the control as a node read will then

00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:08,090
send a reply to all of the devices to

00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:12,980
say play the sound and make the lights

00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:15,110
go this is actually my biggest problem I

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,570
was going to take so many photos and

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:22,190
instead I didn't I was so busy enjoying

00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:25,400
the show all right and I don't know how

00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:29,140
we are cooked for time but we have

00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,140
questions does anybody have a question

00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:43,680
in most shows I use DNS right here I've

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,800
hard coded the IP and I set up a network

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:50,540
of Wi-Fi thing on my notebook and done

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:54,600
some things but a standard boring simple

00:16:50,540 --> 00:17:22,890
technology as possible because I don't

00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:24,959
have time yes yes yeah that's cool

00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:31,200
because the first thing we built for our

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:32,490
daughter's caught on fire and so we kind

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,050
of went maybe we should worry about that

00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:38,160
and this here is is an esp8266 was

00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:41,490
supposed to have a battery in it but

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,440
that didn't work out too well I think we

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:45,750
did no no I think we had a short but

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,490
nonetheless you know you just go this is

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:52,050
an ESP board sitting inside some paper

00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:54,990
there's it from a shredder that's then

00:17:52,050 --> 00:18:01,980
sitting inside plastic so it just feels

00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:03,780
like it's asking for fire it's well it's

00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,830
well insulated it could be warm inside I

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:09,420
don't know and you know if these things

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:15,050
have temperature and then maybe I could

00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:21,410
make it blow as it gets hotter and yeah

00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:21,410
