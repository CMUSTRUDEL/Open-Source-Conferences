An introduction to Twine.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
to be emceeing for me in my stead

00:00:01,939 --> 00:00:07,890
alright so next up we have one of the

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,200
mini conf organizers Tim ujin who's

00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:16,109
gonna give us a workshop arm twine a one

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:18,960
of a little tool take away Tim hello so

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,670
yes I would like you all to please sit

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,350
back in your chair you're a little bit

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,050
cautious you're not sure what's going on

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,910
I thought I'd try something a little bit

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,640
different I thought I'd try letting you

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,399
the audience control this this sort of

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,320
workshop I know you might be thinking

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,969
you know you can't help but wonder that

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,739
maybe that's a bad idea but you know

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:40,980
what I would like you to try and relax

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:44,210
what's the worst that could happen let's

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,210
learn twine whoo

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:54,329
so audience am i glib or am i nervous

00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:55,620
glib I'm a glib fool so shall we go

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:05,430
through a bit of history about twine or

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:09,150
just jump straight in but a better

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:16,200
adventure I don't I don't really have

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:17,310
anything else prepared what are we going

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,619
to do we're going to learn about twine

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,619
or do you need me to do your bidding

00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,749
[Music]

00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:35,610
so what are we doing now Stanley parable

00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:37,110
okay yep you got me I did actually just

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,860
steal this whole idea off the Stanley

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:44,700
parable shall we just get back on track

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,360
though yeah we've got a yes all right

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,080
there we go

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:54,600
oof okay so twine is a tool for creating

00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:56,640
interactive fiction now as you're seeing

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,050
this you might be thinking back who here

00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,399
has actually used one of those old

00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,030
choose your own adventure books when

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,440
you're a kid

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,640
does anyone study yeah they're great

00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,840
everyone ran into them at some point

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,789
they've been around for a lot longer

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,890
than I thought the earliest ones are

00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:09,300
actually from like 1912 before they

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,979
choose your own adventure was even a

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,790
thing but the earliest game books are

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,980
actually quite old unfortunately I would

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,840
suggest you never use that term in

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,810
anything you create because the company

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,910
who owns that term is super litigious

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,130
and Sue's anyone who looks like they're

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,670
gonna make any money off it so please

00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:32,640
don't do that at its core twine is all

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,959
about the passages everything you're

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,760
gonna be doing in twine is you're going

00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,010
to be building up things out of a series

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,450
of passages now these are what

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:42,810
passengers look like this is actually a

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,370
early screenshot of my slides the

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,680
passages are those little individual

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,200
squares that you're seeing inside of it

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,690
no nearer passages it's everything that

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,910
you want to be effectively shown or

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,070
controlling the flow of things goes into

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,630
one of these little passages here this

00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:00,090
is a early shot it's got a lot more

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:04,350
branching and stuff now but you foolish

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:07,250
people have chosen the linear path so

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,250
what would you like to know more about

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,950
linking passages well the great thing is

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,440
links are hey move between passages tada

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:17,820
magic so if you think back to that

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,220
picture before you had all these little

00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,620
boxes the boxes contain your story I'm

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,870
probably going to call them nodes a lot

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,500
because like all vertices because I come

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,269
from like a

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,840
Kansai background so it's gonna be nodes

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:33,180
and edges instead of links instead of

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,080
passages and links but how do you make

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,489
these it's really easy

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,110
anytime you're just typing and you

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:39,180
suddenly want to make a link in your

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,720
text you just stop any write some code

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,220
like this you

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,630
use you know two of them what are the

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,040
square brackets called again actually

00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,230
just called brackets aren't they you

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,390
just show two square brackets the text

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,910
you want a vertical bar and then the

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,120
name of the node so each node actually

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,320
has a name these names have to be unique

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,870
if you don't have them unique you have

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,360
all sorts of nightmarish issues popping

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:03,290
up but it's pretty straightforward so

00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,080
now what would you want to know about

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,840
macros okay so macros are pretty much

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,420
how you do everything but links in twine

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,459
so twine has this slightly unusual

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,290
perspective I come from a very concise

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,090
so the way twine handles a lot of this

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,350
stuff is slightly weird to me but

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,910
apparently works really really well with

00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:24,990
writers which is where it's primarily

00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,730
focused I kind of want to get across the

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,430
point that outside of the actual

00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,930
branches these little passages linkages

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,730
that you make if you want to do anything

00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,320
else that's not just text in twine

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:38,490
you're going to be doing it through a

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,169
macro now macros do actually change a

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,600
little bit depending on the variant of

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:44,310
twine you're using but as a rule of

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,680
thumb what most languages would call a

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,450
function twine would call a macro so you

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,919
can sort of think of them in your head

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,820
the same way they are a little bit

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,370
different in that would people call if a

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:59,160
function in most languages I mean

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:02,160
personally I wouldn't but in twine if is

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,960
a macro so it's kind of the same thing

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,520
but they've got macros for all sorts of

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,100
stuff and you can define your own if you

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,830
want but you can't really get anywhere

00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,080
unless you've also got variables so

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,919
twine is actually under the hood it's

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,150
JavaScript because it's a web-based tool

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,640
its type system is nothing at all like

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,919
Java scripts which you may like or you

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,750
don't like even get into that I'll leave

00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:26,400
that for other people but they are

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,140
implicitly typed so as soon as you

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,180
declare like I'm gonna create a variable

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,910
and it's gonna be equal to two it is now

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,030
an int from that point on they are

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,740
statically typed so you can't actually

00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,870
dynamically change their type on the fly

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,720
without doing a couple extra steps it's

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,130
not that bad I'm it generally when you

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,510
say static typing people think a little

00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:47,250
bit more rigorous than what twine likes

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,800
but it basically just means you can't

00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,349
add hello to one without being a little

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,350
bit more explicit in this case and every

00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:57,820
non instance of air

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:59,560
variable actually has defaults so that's

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,810
mostly I believe to probably avoid

00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,310
crashing on unwrapping a null variable

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,340
cuz riders don't have to worry about

00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,910
null variables so you want to know more

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:11,440
what else would you like to know under

00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:15,910
the hood excellent this is my favorite

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,610
section it's all web-based we have base

00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:21,210
do you say so yes under the hood when

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,710
you're actually writing twine itself

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,630
when you're saving twine the thing that

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,910
twine actually has under the hood is

00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:30,160
it's just running in a browser it's just

00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,840
spinning out a HTML file all twine is a

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,250
single HTML file you can split it up if

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,770
you want don't do it don't don't even

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,630
get into that with a JavaScript runtime

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,250
all the data is embedded in there and it

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,010
generates this lovely little webpage

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,500
here now you might be worrying that

00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,880
means you need to know HTML I am I'd be

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,280
willing to put money on I'm the worst

00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,720
web developer at this conference I'd be

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,670
willing to put money on that if I'm not

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,380
the worst I'm gonna be awfully close I

00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,820
once actually got told off at a

00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,990
conference saying man your web dev

00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,400
skills or at least 10 years out-of-date

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,040
and like that's good the last time I did

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,200
professional web dev so you know that I

00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,300
thought that was comforting to me but

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,330
the main thing is you don't have to

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,620
worry about web when using the built-in

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,730
tools and I'll show off the tools in a

00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,610
little bit when hopefully we get a

00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,470
little bit more interactive twine uses

00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,560
this thing called a story format we're

00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,060
going to be using harlow by default

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,650
there's a few others there's snowman and

00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,200
sugar cube are the two most common ones

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,030
this is a kind of one of the weird

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,500
things about twine in my opinion in that

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:31,660
it's more like an API I guess then you

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,250
define how things will work and then you

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,530
can write your own custom story

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,240
languages around it Harlow's the default

00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,070
it's also in my opinion the most

00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,510
polished which is why I'm gonna be using

00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,820
it it's also the one you'll find most

00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,140
search results for however if you ever

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,150
like playing around twining you see

00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,590
something and suddenly the brackets are

00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,090
using a different bracket format or

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,730
keywords have changed that's because

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:54,370
they're using a different story format

00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:56,230
so it is a little bit weird but you

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,760
don't have to know HTML you don't have

00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:00,310
know CSS you don't have to know

00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,440
JavaScript the great thing is if you do

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,660
know HTML CSS or JavaScript if you want

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,220
you can just dump it straight in summer

00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,990
what I would say are the better twine

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,520
games out

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:13,210
one of my favorite ones that I've

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,040
recently played is battle against the

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,230
man-sized cabinet which was made by

00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,050
Stephen Colbert's team in the downtime

00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:23,080
between him leaving what was the show he

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:26,320
was on before the colbert report daily

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,760
show into the The Colbert Report they

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,410
actually made a little minigame because

00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,820
they're effectively losing their writing

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,080
muscles so they made a twine bass

00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,820
minigame that had a lot of custom

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,070
JavaScript and stuff in it to do extra

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,110
stuff but if you do know this you can I

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,300
am garbage JavaScript I'm probably worse

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:43,270
at HTML and I know I'm worse at CSS

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,770
because I find them too hard so I've

00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,300
left this pretty plain in fact all I've

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,010
done from the default twine here as I've

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,740
changed it from black to a sort of a

00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:53,890
mild ish green because you know I like

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:56,980
green what else would you like to know

00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:01,750
about making things pretty

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:03,550
oh good guess so twine twine is by

00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:07,930
default designed for riders so you

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:09,670
shouldn't have to touch CSS so it does

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,320
actually have a few things like italics

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,880
like bold it's got some strike throughs

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,320
it's got some underlines my underline

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,690
isn't appearing there actually which is

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,420
interesting I'd be willing to blame that

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,970
safaris fault I don't actually know that

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,460
but most way you do your twine stylings

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,990
is actually through CSS so if you do

00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,020
want to go further you're gonna have to

00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:31,330
pick up CSS I never do I use twine

00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:33,460
primarily for prototyping so I would say

00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,260
I know twine from like a high to

00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,340
mid-level I don't know what a mid to D

00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,940
people who make twine games

00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:42,820
professionally like Anna Anthropy

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,770
all these England that they would also

00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,170
be Queen they would laugh at me at my

00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:49,050
twine skills and brightly so la wouldn't

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,980
laugh they're actually quite nice people

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:56,290
so what else would you like to know

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:58,960
about oh thank you I'm totally okay just

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,630
sit here and go like I'd be a great NPCs

00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:05,050
feel like what else would you like know

00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,520
about I think I could be an NPC so the

00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:10,120
trick is if you really want to install

00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:13,570
twine you go to this URL here twine org

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,089
and you can download it one really great

00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:18,400
thing about twine is it's actually just

00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:19,500
a web tool itself so if you do like

00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,220
they've also got an online

00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,900
editor there I found some slightly weird

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,640
things with the online editor myself

00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,320
again that might be as a side effect the

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,180
fact that I was doing all my testing on

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,340
my iPad on mobile safari so it might be

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,990
better on crime I'm not I'm honestly not

00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,640
sure I always download the tool and do

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:39,360
it that way it's like 10 Meg if you want

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,440
to grab it it's really really small okay

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,630
I really think that's not for my

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:47,100
terrible prepared content let's start

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,360
making some twine so relieved you guys

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,190
didn't pick any of certain up guys you

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,980
people didn't pick any of the hard ones

00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,680
ah such a relief you picked them nice

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,550
linear path I had way too much terrible

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,810
stuff okay

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:03,810
so where's my twine gone so this here is

00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,340
fine this is the app I'm running at full

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,260
screen again you could be rolling this

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:10,230
in your browser this is my workshop

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,900
slides so this is everything you just

00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:15,600
saw we actually went down we weren't

00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,820
stopped and intro than here then we went

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,740
over to the spin-off we went down to the

00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,900
Stanley parable then you jump right over

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:25,740
to the concepts you skipped all of that

00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,730
middle here which is good because that

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:33,630
was the harder bits

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:35,280
to do properly um think he got it no

00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,900
there's not a confusion ending sorry all

00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,390
endings do eventually lead back onto

00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,280
twine because there is no control

00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,680
everything's in the hands of me as the

00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,060
writer I should say I'm not a games

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,330
writer I'm actually a program by

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:52,230
training I have only gotten two games

00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:54,300
relatively recently twine is seeing a

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,890
lot of use in games both as a standalone

00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,839
to where people will make whole games in

00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:59,370
twine I would say it's probably more

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,530
used and I don't have numbers to back

00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,440
this up as a prototyping tool not just

00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:06,960
for stories but also for testing if

00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,540
ideas make sense I'm like you can

00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,430
actually do rather complex mechanics in

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,260
twine by itself or at least get the

00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,450
basics of complex mechanics testing I

00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,250
know by a way for a long time I don't

00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,540
know if they still do actually the

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,100
interview process if you want to be a

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,140
writer for by way also he's ever know

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,960
who Bioware is

00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:27,870
Bioware is arguably the best video game

00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,480
company for writing narrative games

00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,880
that's very arbitrary of me to say that

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,460
but they're one of the

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,110
revered companies for their video game

00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,610
stories and dialogues they have a lot of

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:39,770
branching things they don't use twine

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,810
internally but the interview process for

00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,070
being a writer at least up until

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,390
somewhat recently I'm not sure if it's

00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,890
still the case you would actually submit

00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,720
them a twine game you would basically

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,700
write fanfiction about one of their

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,990
their games or characters submit it and

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,120
then they'd look through Italy be like

00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:55,100
yep you clearly understand how story

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,920
evolves in a game and how branching can

00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,590
impact it so I'm actually just gonna go

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,410
back here you can see all of my terrible

00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:04,850
things so I will just I wasn't going to

00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,530
talk about this but I got so annoyed cuz

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,440
last night twine crash and took out

00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:11,120
about three days of work twine just

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,890
stores everything is HTML files it

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,450
doesn't this is by far its biggest

00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,160
weakness it doesn't do a great job of

00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,050
looking after that you can't really

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,580
chuck it in a get repo it tends to freak

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,190
out a little bit I've noticed in my

00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:25,310
experience so all last night when I was

00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,170
rebuilding all of my slides luckily John

00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:30,080
actually had a copy that I sent him that

00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:31,760
was only like a few hours old so he

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,980
could play through it I was able to

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,390
rebuild it but you will find yourself

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,070
copying and pasting your stories a lot

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,170
which is by far twines biggest weakness

00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,330
in my opinion I'm actually gonna make a

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:43,520
new story here and if you do want to

00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,560
follow along feel free we're just gonna

00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,550
sort of go through and build this here

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,930
in our remaining time I'm just gonna

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,270
make this story up we're gonna build it

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:54,500
together as a team so what should our

00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:59,110
story be called neither named Steve I

00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:03,020
love Steve it's the best story ever okay

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:05,300
and there we go so this is Steve this is

00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,580
our starting passage by default you're

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,170
given a passage because you need one I'm

00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,540
just gonna zoom in a little bit here so

00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:13,130
this is our passage it's got that little

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,230
rocket ship next to it which means it's

00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,060
the one that gets run first you can move

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,920
that rocket ship just by like clicking

00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,380
on this rocket ship on any other passage

00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,930
we've only got one you can double-click

00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:26,240
it to open it up I'm gonna rename this

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,620
so this is the passage title you can put

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,150
pretty much any characters you want here

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,430
including spaces I'm gonna rename this

00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:33,500
to start because that's just in my head

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,190
scape I have a real hard time finding

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,090
the start unless it starts with start

00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:44,620
I'm not going to go into tags don't

00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:44,620
worry about it so what's Steve gonna do

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,920
so I think thing is Steve doesn't I'm

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:56,949
just gonna zoom in a little bit know

00:14:50,920 --> 00:15:01,660
what to do Steve looks to the left and

00:14:56,949 --> 00:15:06,699
the right head left it's gonna make that

00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:09,970
go to left and head right I'm gonna make

00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:11,500
that go to right okay now this is a bug

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,269
in my version of twine because I was too

00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,040
afraid to update it but if you don't

00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:16,959
click this close button it won't build

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,199
new passages but normally you can just

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,420
click anywhere and it will work and now

00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:23,920
it's changed so we now have a left and a

00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,209
right and they actually put them on the

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,310
left in the right which was very

00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:28,509
convenient of them you can actually drag

00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,300
these around you can move them wherever

00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:33,449
you want at this point so I'm just gonna

00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:38,829
open this up and I'm just gonna put left

00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:41,470
I'm just gonna put right and now I'm

00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:44,350
going to run it so I'm just gonna sort

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,600
of zoom in down here here's a little

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,209
play button this will essentially just

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,529
run it in engine I guess is probably the

00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:52,510
best description it just launches a new

00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:53,620
browser context runs it that way it's

00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,850
also got a testing mode which is

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,440
actually really cool it'll show you

00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,940
variable State and things like that you

00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,740
can override on the fly if you need to

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:03,029
do some debugging I'm not going to go

00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:06,670
into that I really don't have time so

00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:07,779
here is Steve loved this game so Steve

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,540
doesn't know what to do

00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:12,880
Steve looks to the left and the right to

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,220
Steve head left or right at left

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,680
I love left good choice look we made it

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,740
laughs tada so we've actually just made

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,600
our first twine game together whoo

00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:29,649
Congrats how am I going for time John

00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,740
half an hour left 20 okay that feels a

00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:35,800
bit more all right so this isn't

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:37,149
particularly interesting though and I

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,250
mean and it is worth just pointing out

00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:40,839
you can I believe technically because of

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,630
how maths works

00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:45,519
build any story with any level of

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:47,500
complexity just using links but it will

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,790
get a little bit messy so instead we're

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,470
gonna do is we're gonna put a challenge

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,329
in front of Steve I think we're going to

00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,829
make it so poor Steve is gonna have to

00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:56,540
find a key and then use the key to open

00:16:53,829 --> 00:17:00,529
a door so

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:04,069
in the right we'll just go Steve sees a

00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:06,350
door and then I'm just going to create

00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:10,490
here's my first macro so I'm going to

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:16,130
create the if macro Dollar door locked

00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:18,949
is true then inside these brackets here

00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:21,289
this is what twine calls a hook I would

00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:23,569
probably call it a code block in any

00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:25,579
other programming language so macros

00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:28,490
have hooks associated with them I would

00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:30,139
probably say functions have code blocks

00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:33,080
associated with them this is what runs

00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:38,269
if the in this case the if evaluates to

00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:45,039
true no matter how hard he tries he's a

00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:48,679
dude now apparently he can't open it

00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:51,799
okay so we've now got I'm just gonna

00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:53,240
zoom that in a little bit again so we've

00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:56,659
got our first macro here we've got Steve

00:17:53,240 --> 00:18:03,309
seeing a door and he can't open it so

00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:03,309
we'll also do an else just that yep

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:12,050
please don't mock my spelling I'm really

00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:16,210
bad at it I in theory write books as

00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:16,210
part of my living and my editors hate me

00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,190
obviously you should probably have a

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:24,740
better naming scheme than this for your

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,790
braces alright so what we got here is

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,500
we're gonna start we're gonna go into

00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:32,360
right if we hit the right sorry we're

00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,540
gonna hit a locked door cuz door locked

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,910
by default it's actually going to be

00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:40,730
unlocked because variables default to

00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:42,890
false by default so he'll actually just

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,690
be able to swing the door open go on

00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,400
down the path so we're gonna have to

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,960
change that we can change this pretty

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,330
much any way we want you can actually

00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,020
create custom nodes which run before the

00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,980
story starts oh yeah why not I'll do

00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,620
that alright so create a whole new

00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,840
passage and we'll do I'll call this one

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:03,500
I'll just zoom in a little bit call this

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,280
set set up I'm gonna give this the tag

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,900
of startup he says hoping that that's

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,510
the correct one and what I'll do is I'll

00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,230
just create a new macro here set door

00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:16,910
locked

00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:18,260
to true like so so basically I'm doing

00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:21,830
here is I'm just setting up a variable

00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:24,230
this whole passage sorry not node or

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:26,300
vertex will be run before the other ones

00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:29,660
do and it's just a way of setting up

00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:31,250
sort of different variables or other

00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,300
gamestate you may need so it's kind of

00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,950
up to you as to how you really want to

00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,070
do it you can just chuck them into the

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,600
passages yourself I'm a programmer so in

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,370
theory I like to have things nice and

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,560
cleanly separated I'm also gonna be

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,240
honest and be and say that's not always

00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,630
the case that I always do that so now

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,010
let's give this a go so Steve doesn't

00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,080
know what to do he looks the left looks

00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:53,720
at the right I'm gonna head right Steve

00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,650
sees a door no matter how hard he tries

00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,210
he can't open it now this is not perfect

00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:01,880
cuz he's currently trapped in the right

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:04,250
hallway unable to go anywhere I will fix

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:09,140
that in a minute but first of all we'll

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:12,790
go I'll just zoom in again Steve sees a

00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,790
key on the ground

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,510
pick up the key obviously I'm not I'm

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,460
gonna be honest I'm not a writer so my

00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,140
dialogue tends to look like Zork

00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,620
where it feels like you're going action

00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,880
now proper writers can make twine

00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,340
actually look great I highly look

00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,460
recommend everyone checks out the writer

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:37,660
will do something which is a ward

00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:40,060
winning twine game about dealing with

00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:43,120
being a video game writer in a game that

00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,100
was rapidly heading down the spiral in

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,270
the last minute as budget changes came

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,890
about it's written by a professional

00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:50,440
video game writer about their

00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:56,680
experiences of having to solve this sort

00:20:50,440 --> 00:21:01,450
of stuff and it's very fascinating who

00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:02,980
wants an old key anyway so in that case

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:06,220
we'll go back to the start

00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:08,500
all right so we'll close that we're

00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,210
getting more nodes here ah this

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,920
incidentally is what I would say both a

00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,630
strength and a weakness of twine it's

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:17,710
very easy to make lots of passages very

00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:19,300
quickly which is great it can also get

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,920
out of hand very quickly you could sort

00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,540
of see with just my slides that had

00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,250
about 60 nodes in it that was already

00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:27,400
getting a bit cluttering and hard to

00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:30,220
sort of follow is that actually a

00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,530
problem that's debatable it is just

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,710
something to be wary of in my opinion so

00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:40,630
first thing we do is we'll just zoom in

00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:42,880
set dollar door locked to false oh sorry

00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:44,860
I forgot this variables in twine start

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,590
with the dollar symbol and then just

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,970
standard sort of variable naming schemes

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:52,210
annoyingly variables are case

00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:56,050
insensitive that really irks me for some

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:58,630
sort of deeply ingrained like university

00:21:56,050 --> 00:22:00,880
lecturer brain in there's like no you

00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,890
can't do that but door locked spell all

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,450
capitals or lower cases is perfectly

00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,330
valid if you want

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:13,930
so our door is now locked Wow what a

00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:18,430
heavy key so then we'll just go I wonder

00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:20,450
if it opens that door over there it's a

00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:23,929
such good dialogue

00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:25,489
jeez pi hours should be paying me I know

00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:27,200
it was called path not door oops

00:22:25,489 --> 00:22:29,899
well this is a great chance to show you

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,869
how you delete things then we get a

00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:34,759
little pop-up yes delete it's gone

00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:36,289
and we're also helpfully being shown by

00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:38,749
twine hey you've actually got a broken

00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:42,529
link here you've got a little you've got

00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:45,169
a an edge in your graph that's that's

00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:47,179
that doesn't class that you've got a

00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:51,950
link in your passage that doesn't go to

00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:57,859
another passage so I'll just quickly fix

00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:59,720
that path like so okay ouch

00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:04,190
now unless I've made a mistake which is

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:08,359
possible let's see what happens I did

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:10,369
bypass the door whoops good catch no I

00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:13,970
mean I meant I did that intentionally

00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:15,710
and it was for you to all to pick up on

00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:19,429
it and I'm just gonna space this out

00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:21,649
because I like mine to look neat there's

00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:25,489
no technical reason for that I just I

00:23:21,649 --> 00:23:26,899
have issues okay Steve does know what to

00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:28,909
do he looks the left he looks to the

00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:30,619
right we still haven't fixed that bug if

00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:33,169
he can't leave that right room but okay

00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:35,480
so he had left I'm gonna pick up a key

00:23:33,169 --> 00:23:38,389
wow what a heavy key I wonder if it

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,830
opens that door over there see the door

00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:41,629
I should have actually put in another

00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,200
check so you actually push the door and

00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,820
so on so forth

00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,739
but he's sort of getting the point of

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,049
hake and build up slightly more

00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:49,489
intriguing dialogue and again you could

00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:50,929
have built this out by more links and

00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:52,970
pathways it's just would have taken

00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:56,539
longer and been harder so we go down the

00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:58,789
path and now we're stuck at this path so

00:23:56,539 --> 00:24:00,159
that's sort of at its core I would

00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:03,549
actually be willing to bet that's like

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:06,200
99% of twine that anyone ever uses

00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:08,809
there's also an else--if if you need to

00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,509
do more now I kind of want to show off

00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:13,999
something a little bit more complex too

00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:16,460
because one problem I've had with a lot

00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:17,989
of twine is if you take it to people who

00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,100
riders they tend to be like wow this

00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:20,600
actually seems really interesting I like

00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,279
it if you take you to people who are

00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,359
generally more programmer focus I'm

00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:25,759
willing to bet most people here have

00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:27,799
some sort of programming background some

00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,950
degree they tend to feel like it's a

00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:33,019
little bit limited and I very much

00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:33,510
disagree with that assessment

00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:34,890
if nothing

00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,510
else it's already handled the problem of

00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,660
creating a text engine for you as

00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:43,050
someone who makes a text engine that is

00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:46,350
not easy on pave handle it for you and

00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:48,180
it is also used everywhere for for good

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,380
reason so I'm just gonna sort of I'm not

00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,570
gonna rebuild it so I know I'll make a

00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,460
mistake so this is based on someone

00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,770
else's code that I saw I'm just gonna

00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,350
actually no I'll just go back to the

00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,660
original version of it this is based on

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:05,460
some code that I found online when I was

00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:06,720
trying to really get into building some

00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,270
more complex mechanics I found this

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,280
would have been three or four years ago

00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:14,040
and it's actually a slightly more

00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,120
interesting version of showing how you

00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,620
can build these things up actually now

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,420
I've changed my mind again I'm gonna do

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:23,040
it this one because you sit back in your

00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,450
chair cautiously relaxed what's the

00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,700
worst happen I think he's a bit nervous

00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:29,220
this time we're going to demand a bitter

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,290
adventure no I'm the protagonist we're

00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:35,580
not gonna talk about Stanley parable

00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:37,500
okay not so fast you have to get first

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,200
the first you have to get past my Mikey

00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:43,740
mcjones Locke so this is obviously

00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:46,640
causing a huge conundrum so in this case

00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:51,540
you could think he's bluffing no I'm not

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,070
what you can do is panic you can't help

00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:55,080
but notice I might zoom that in sorry

00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:58,560
cuz it's not got my custom.css of

00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,360
pressing the command + button you can't

00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,990
help but notice the codes of lock is 11

00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,360
3 8 8 that's ok you know we can all zoom

00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:07,470
in enhance we've all seen CSI so we're

00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,950
going to attempt to open the mcjones

00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:13,590
lock it make this a little bit bigger

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:15,150
all right okay so what I've got here is

00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:17,130
is based on someone else's code I'll

00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,570
look their name up in a moment and it's

00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,490
the way they get properly attributed

00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:22,860
it's not mine I did modify it a little

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,420
bit is this is actually a lock this will

00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,370
actually work exactly like a combination

00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:29,790
lock and this is written 100% in twine

00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:31,620
just using macros and hooks so for

00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:43,510
example does anyone want to suggest a

00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:45,940
code to put in 4 8 3 7 0

00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:48,640
didn't work alright let's also we gotta

00:26:45,940 --> 00:27:01,510
go back to the panic right would anyone

00:26:48,640 --> 00:27:03,280
like to suggest another lock 0 4 5 100

00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,670
sorry oh no oh no I meant that was

00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:12,730
actually my bad sorry sorry John

00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:16,600
so it was sorry was 0 was it 4 5 1 you

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:18,730
got an extra digit 0 nope doesn't seem

00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:24,160
to be working yeah I'm gonna be obvious

00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:32,970
here ok all right

00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:32,970
to a 4 5 you got an extra digit 0

00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:42,210
maybe I'll just hand let me try

00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,210
adjusting there a screen reflection

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,970
there's only silly only a hundred

00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,680
thousand combinations it will actually

00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:55,810
let you keep going I'm gonna I'm gonna

00:27:50,680 --> 00:28:02,260
make a suggestion of one one three eight

00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:05,080
eight I'm just lucky so this is actually

00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:07,290
yes I'll just close this now but that

00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:12,550
was written entirely in twine itself

00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:14,470
this actually works by using an array

00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,600
twine actually you can create array of

00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:19,570
variables using more custom macros and

00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,310
so on civil so here it's basically just

00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,350
showing this some text which will get

00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:26,410
dumped in and it's setting individual

00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:28,750
positions on the dials based on what you

00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:36,940
pick in there and the actual dial check

00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:39,280
itself do it so basically I've got a

00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,970
check that if you've punched in the the

00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:45,450
correct number and it wasn't correct

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:48,220
reset the dial to an array of five zeros

00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:51,430
and then start the counter again and

00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:56,980
then be a jerk and then reset it and

00:28:51,430 --> 00:29:00,850
then inside the lock itself which

00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:03,280
is that one they'll go sorry

00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,290
see this way space things up what it's

00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,950
actually doing in here is it's actually

00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:10,870
going through and this is not the

00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:12,760
cleanest way of doing this this is the

00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:14,980
easiest way of writing this which is

00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,809
actually to sort of build it up in

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,790
chunks is I'm actually going I want the

00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:20,020
first element to if it's equal to one I

00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:24,220
want the second element the array if

00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:26,890
it's equal to one and three 8 1 1 1 1 3

00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,080
8 yeah and this is sort of showing you

00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:32,650
can actually build a lot more complex

00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,210
sort of mechanisms in twine itself just

00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,799
using twine you don't have to jump out

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:37,570
to JavaScript or its own programming

00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:41,890
language there are people who built

00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:43,179
entire RPGs in twine obviously you are

00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:45,700
limited by the fact it has to be

00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:48,010
discrete mechanics you can't do

00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,290
real-time mechanics with it because it's

00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:53,350
just how would you do real-time

00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,730
mechanics if someone can work out do let

00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:56,380
me know that would I would be very

00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,980
impressed if someone could work out how

00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:01,809
to do real-time mechanics as to sort of

00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:06,040
customizing your twine so I'm just gonna

00:30:01,809 --> 00:30:07,780
jump back in to Steve now that sounded

00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:12,070
weird I'm gonna go back into the Steve

00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:15,250
story I apologize so I like I said I'm

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:19,210
really bad at web so I tend to try and

00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:25,660
stick to the basics so you can do really

00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:27,790
sort of basic markup like so or is it

00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,990
that slash might be that slash never

00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,520
remember which way the slashes go

00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:37,330
doesn't really matter I'll look it up

00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:39,669
I'll cheat but if I now run this steve

00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:41,320
has now gone italics and that's sort of

00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:43,090
how twine works it's got a really simple

00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,730
markup you can it's got about five or

00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:48,190
six different markups it's got its own

00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:51,610
markup language cuz everyone has to

00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:53,500
invent their own markup language why we

00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,780
can't all agree on tech it was the

00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:58,929
correct one I'll never understand but we

00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:00,640
can't but when it sort of comes down to

00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:02,020
it you are very limited by what you can

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:07,270
do with this so you tend to find

00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:10,480
yourself trapped in in the the world of

00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:11,770
CSS you can add your own custom CSS

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:17,320
I'll just jump back to my workshop one

00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:19,720
here you can this is just normal CSS in

00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,030
here there's a few predefined sort of

00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:23,620
twine IDs that exists you know twine

00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:26,950
story twine link to I'm body blah blah

00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:28,450
blah blah blah in this case I'm turning

00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:30,790
off the sidebar and the undo button

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,950
twine out-of-the-box actually has a go

00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:34,540
back I personally hate that I like the

00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:38,260
idea if the user made a mistake they're

00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:39,880
trapped in their own punishment that's

00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,310
why other people always do game

00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,840
balancing and not me in games and then

00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,730
otherwise I've just set the colors to

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,530
something sort of nice ish looking I

00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:50,020
don't have the best design sense so I

00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,180
apologize if it doesn't look nice and

00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,680
that's how you can do it there now with

00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,660
the final little bit of time left I

00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,940
would just sort of I just want to show

00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,190
the reason personally I think twine has

00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,920
taken off is because of the really hard

00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:04,960
work of of the various people who push

00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,420
it especially in the LGBTI community

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,300
they really pushed it particularly hard

00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:12,520
but one interesting side effect of twine

00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,620
being web-based is it's the easiest tool

00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,930
under the Sun to develop to publish I'll

00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:19,900
show you how you publish twine just go

00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:22,140
down here click on this you go publish

00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,790
to file

00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:25,870
you then just save where you want it I'm

00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,300
gonna save it to my downloads folder

00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:30,510
because that's where all important

00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,310
documents should be saved

00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:34,720
tada we've just created our twine game

00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:39,970
this is now finished this is good to go

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:42,820
this file if I open it up is a

00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,860
completely working version I did make a

00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,690
couple little tweaks to this in the CSS

00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,580
after the fact on my final ones I want

00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,050
to change a few things after I'd already

00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,520
baked it and at that point I was too

00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:54,130
afraid to touch the twine again so I

00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:56,110
didn't but this has been this is

00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,610
actually a truly monumental advantage of

00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:00,280
twine that as far as I can tell almost

00:32:57,610 --> 00:33:02,590
no other tool out there has in that you

00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:06,430
can just if you have the capability to

00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:07,900
host a HTML file and not only do not

00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,160
necessarily need the capability of like

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,110
running your own servers there's so many

00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,730
free services out there you can just

00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:14,920
give them the file and it's done and

00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:20,320
that is I think a really

00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:20,830
underappreciated part of twine Gerardus

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,740
yeah

00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:25,120
so with my last few minutes

00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,260
that's pretty much all I had prepared I

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,620
could go into more stuff if you want

00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:31,059
here's my giant blob of slides I'll

00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,890
actually make this twine file available

00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:35,710
later if people want it I have about

00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:38,559
five minutes according to my jar my John

00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:40,120
my Proctor John there who is gonna start

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,160
throwing rocks at me if I go over so

00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:44,500
does anyone have any questions about any

00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,320
of this Oh Ferdy can go too fast

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,940
yes I dunno if you need them Mike I

00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:54,670
think you need the Mike Johnny needs the

00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:56,350
Mike and hopefully you want to start

00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:57,640
using twine like I'm actually a

00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,750
professional programmer I still prefer

00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:21,070
to do a lot of stuff in twice it's

00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:25,179
easier so body is from memory for the

00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:27,250
whole surrounds of the page story is for

00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,510
an individual passage from memory I'm

00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,490
going purely from memory I'd have to

00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:36,940
look it up exactly but basically yes so

00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:39,129
could you make separate passages I've

00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,109
seen it done I'm not sure how off top my

00:34:39,129 --> 00:34:43,179
head you would do that you may actually

00:34:41,109 --> 00:34:45,580
have to set some sort of custom Flags

00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:47,830
yourself it is worth pointing out you

00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:51,250
can actually just write HTML directly in

00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:53,020
a passage so my gut feeling B we'd do it

00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:54,850
that way you would just write you

00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:56,139
override it here and then next passage

00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:58,810
over write it back would be my gut

00:34:56,139 --> 00:35:02,440
feeling like I'm a truly horrific web

00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:09,580
developer so yes I have seen it done but

00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:12,090
I'm not sure how you do it sorry yes so

00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:19,090
I did actually embed an image in

00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:21,430
passages here and it's yeah that's

00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:25,109
entirely it's just a standard image tag

00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:28,869
from HTML so like I said I used harlow

00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:30,670
there's sugar cube and snowman and from

00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:33,520
memory sugar cube has built-in support

00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:35,080
for showing images but what it does it's

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,670
just a custom macro that under the hood

00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,799
dumps this text out so it's still

00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:43,250
the exact same thing this is all written

00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:45,500
in twine two point one point zero I want

00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,920
to say I'm could have my numbers wrong

00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,440
there

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,540
twine one actually had implicit support

00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,490
and would embed the images in I've also

00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:54,650
seen people will base64 encode their

00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:57,020
images and then call them that way I'm

00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:59,030
not a big fan of that myself because it

00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:02,750
just bulks up your story with huge blobs

00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:04,730
of blur you can't really look at it's a

00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:07,910
personal choice but yes you can do i do

00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:10,309
images this way you can do images base64

00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:13,690
encode or different story formats have

00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:13,690
different image support as well you

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,670
can we see the slides about the young

00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:30,140
spinner Oh I mean though very simple

00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:31,730
okay I'll just see if I can quickly get

00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:34,310
to it what was the poppy on spinner

00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:36,350
again I think I'll go to my they've got

00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:38,720
uh okay

00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:41,450
he looks slightly confused you relax

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,230
he's a glib fool that's what you could

00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:48,020
ask Who I am

00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:49,280
yeah you got a hit my trade oh you oh oh

00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:55,670
okay sure yeah

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:57,980
Oh young spinners great oh okay

00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:00,020
so it's a narrative engine it's pretty

00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,640
similar of twine the main difference is

00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,560
while twine creates its own standalone

00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,810
sort of self-contained world

00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:08,210
yon spinner is at its core designed to

00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:10,970
be embedded into other game engines so

00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:13,370
it's got explicit support from like me

00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:15,530
and John and Paris for support for unity

00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:17,870
it's got explicit support from todor

00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:20,750
I've forgotten his last night in Amer of

00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:22,390
for support for G develop and actually

00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:25,910
works arguably better than the unity one

00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:30,350
it's got some third-party support for

00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:32,750
web sites using bondage Jas and it's got

00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:34,310
some gato support as well apparently so

00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,920
it works very similar to twine it's got

00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:38,990
sort of a similar terminology we use the

00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:41,570
word nodes because we're Kansai people

00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:43,550
we call them edges instead of links cuz

00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:45,380
we're Kansai people um but at its core

00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:46,400
it's the same you write text you control

00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,640
it it's got a little bit more

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,690
flexibility in my opinion than twine

00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,680
because it doesn't have any display

00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:56,360
layer uh yeah it's also more line by

00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,820
line than passage by passage but that's

00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,550
kind of a choice rather than a than a

00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:05,000
thing if you're interested you go here

00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:08,630
it's great that's a new website it's

00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,790
much nice in the old website which

00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:14,060
didn't exist well is it Google it was a

00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:17,270
it was a github site so if you go to

00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:20,180
that website yeah dev you can see here

00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:21,800
how to get started with it if you do

00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,270
want to use the answer to my only little

00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:25,820
bit of warning is you do need another

00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:28,550
game engine to wrap around it it can't

00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,660
do it by itself that does have a lot of

00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,760
advantages in that we don't have to

00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:33,860
touch anything display wise but for you

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,380
if you just want to get started you'll

00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:41,540
also need to know how to use unity God

00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:42,920
or do develop and there's happily talk

00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,600
to you about all those I think they're

00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,550
all great I don't really have time for

00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,960
that though unfortunately but if you are

00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:50,540
doing a game and it's gonna be using

00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,490
unity or and/or gato or do you develop I

00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:55,040
highly recommend yarn spinner there are

00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:58,160
a few similar sort of things like fungus

00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,220
like ink like what's the one that embeds

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,720
twine into unity called kami what it's

00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,550
called in my opinion they're not as good

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,050
kind of bias though so I wouldn't

00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,610
necessarily take my word for it check

00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:11,780
them out yourself they were also all

00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:13,940
really good but for just getting started

00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:16,190
with making games twine is easily the

00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:18,440
best tool out there you can do more than

00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:22,090
you could possibly think and it works

00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,090
