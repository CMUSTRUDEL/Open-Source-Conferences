How do you build an open source community of non-open-source developers? The Yarn Spinner narrative tool is an open source project for building choice-driven conversations and interactive dialogue. This means that its target audience is game developers, who aren't typically used to open source development practices. In this talk, we'll discuss how we bootstrapped the community around Yarn Spinner, and how to work with enthusiastic people who aren't used to free software licensing.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

all right so it's continuing on time so

00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,910
we're under a second talk of the day now

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,439
up we've got John John is a game

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,689
developer he's going to be talking

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,039
however not specifically about making

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,949
games what about making communities

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,399
around games so please take it away John

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,579
alright hi everyone um

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,320
as Tim wonderfully introduced I'm John

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,149
mang my twitter username is displeasure

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,980
please follow me there um

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,050
and I'm gonna be talking about how we

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,940
built a community of game developers

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,640
around a game development tool that's

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,010
releases open source so the credential

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,960
slide I'm a author for a rally I've

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,670
written a whole bunch of books most

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,500
recently please buy practical artificial

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,109
with Swift this talk is not about that

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,539
but it's worth looking at anyway um I'm

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,680
best known for my work on a game called

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,909
night in the woods which came out in

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,820
2017 thank you and people liked it and

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:11,189
one of the things that I did for night

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,950
in the woods was I produced I think

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,170
called yarn spinner yawn spinner is the

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,470
system that powers all of the dialogue

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,299
in the game so not in the woods is a

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,740
very dialogue heavy game most of what

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,880
you do involves talking to other

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:29,430
characters and so a really good robust

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,860
solid solution for managing game

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,340
dialogue for that game was required so

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,130
yawn spinner is a combination of like a

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,770
node-based dialogue tool combined with a

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,810
scripting language that we invented so

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,860
you can manage all the dialogue in the

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,450
way that you flow through the

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,600
conversations with characters in the

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,369
game and then zoom in on the individual

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,820
nodes and write it in like a screenplay

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:56,280
style format the system was written for

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,049
the use of a single writer in fact the

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,030
lead writer of night in the woods the

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,950
dialogue writer Scott Benson who was

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,090
also the game's lead artist didn't have

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,100
time to oughta learn how to be a

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,500
programmer as well and be a gameplay

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,690
implementer and so most of what he did

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,120
was he would go to literally a cafe and

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,350
write on paper or the game's dialogue

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,380
then come home

00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,480
transcribe it into into yarn the

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:22,140
language that Yan spinner interprets

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,400
execute and then do whatever logic was

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,170
needed to actually make that work in the

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,110
context of the game and it worked really

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,030
really well so Yan spinner in addition

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:32,430
to powering over game's dialogue also

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,670
powers all the games cutscenes we

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:38,070
released it as open source in around

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:41,600
2015 I think a two years before the

00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:44,250
release of not in the woods itself and

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,830
it it's grown and grown and grown in

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,000
terms of Community Interest so a couple

00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,890
of really cool games that have come out

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,200
recently that you see on spinner include

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,960
frog detective two the cases invisible

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,240
wizard which is a beautiful little fun

00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,460
game and also a short hike which is I

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,590
believe up for some awards at the

00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:05,700
independent Games Festival this year at

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,370
the Game Developers Conference so not in

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,620
the woods makes use of aviÃ³n spinner

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,300
like this it's running lines of dialogue

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,070
and then the player has the ability to

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,230
choose between options based on what

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,780
they select none' spinner will then jump

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,220
you to different lines of dialogue and

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:24,630
the whole thing works pretty seamlessly

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:26,280
- to the player so this is the script

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,240
powering the scene that you just saw and

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,220
you'll notice that there are some lines

00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,950
you didn't see because the play in that

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,890
video chose the line um I don't know it

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,180
ran the line with Gregg says I'll help

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,430
you pick somewhere out but if they

00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,220
chosen not long gonna move - then

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:44,100
another set of lines could have been run

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,330
and at the end of that in addition to

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,070
running lines of dialogue it also

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,650
manages the game state so at the bottom

00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:51,660
of the slide you'll see a number of

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,850
instructions telling the game to modify

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,150
variables to perform actions in the

00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:59,250
scene to unlock some art in other parts

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,700
of the game and also to change scene to

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,290
another part of the game as well so

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,180
today I'm going to be talking about how

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,640
we built the community surrounding yarn

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,410
spinner with a particular focus on how

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,810
we communicate the open source nature of

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,040
a project to a community of game

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,310
developers who are not themselves

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,410
open-source developers they're often

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,600
smaller independent studios solar

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:24,450
developers or larger studios as well

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,290
I'll be talking about what you should

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,810
know when you're building a tool

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,390
that's been used by people who are not

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,380
as familiar with open-source

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,600
methodologies and practices in the open

00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,310
source tradition as people in this room

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,900
might be as well as that we're talking

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,180
about how to build a community in

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,700
general for for when your users are

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,100
developers so let's take a look at how

00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:48,400
game development and open source kind of

00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,950
interact so game developers have a very

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,600
very long tradition of sharing code

00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,790
sharing anything with each other because

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,710
a lot of people especially younger

00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,230
developers these days learn how to

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,210
develop at all how to program at all

00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,950
through an interest in making games and

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,890
so they hop onto YouTube they happen to

00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:09,400
forums I hop onto discord usually these

00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:12,550
days to find and share tips and code and

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,020
art and everything they need to to start

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,140
making their own video games with

00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,130
usually with either a professional

00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,110
interest they want to get into the games

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,250
industry or for a hobby interest they

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:24,700
want to be able to you know make some

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,800
art and in the form of a game now this

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,440
sharing is not based in the tradition of

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,170
open-source when we think of open-source

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,820
share and we think of some fairly

00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:36,370
structured ways of sharing we think in

00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:38,290
terms of the popular licenses we think

00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,270
in terms of you know all we have github

00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,850
and we have a bit buck and we have these

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,410
these common places to go to share code

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:47,260
and the ways in which we share code we

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,420
ways in which we discuss that code game

00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,060
developers love to share as much as we

00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,800
do and I don't mean to create a gulf

00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,990
between open-source and game devs

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,370
there's a massive overlap but more often

00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,160
than not I see a lot of game developers

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,560
who simply release code out of the wild

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,090
go here it is have some code and they

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,650
don't attach a license because they

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,690
aren't aware of the need for a license

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,390
I've often seen more than a few times

00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,530
people were declining to add a license

00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,240
because they believe that it will

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:14,800
actually restrict what people can do

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,570
with the code you know I'm not gonna add

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,110
a license that will just limit what you

00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:21,520
can do mmm no because when you attach a

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,830
license you're actually giving more

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,230
freedom because by default everything is

00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:28,780
proprietary and locked down we often see

00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:32,230
people released with no license or bad

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:36,510
licenses so for example a popular one in

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:38,680
the game dev circles is the WTF PL the

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,570
do what the fork

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,910
want with license which contains a

00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:46,150
single cause which is you can do what

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:48,490
the fork you like which is legally

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,860
ambiguous to say the least and also we

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,889
had code being released under like not

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,240
flippant licenses but custom licenses

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:56,229
which can cause some problems when you

00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,780
want to integrate their code in other

00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:01,060
open source projects for example um two

00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,789
days ago an amazing game by Terry

00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,470
Cavanagh called V was released the

00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:06,669
entire sorry the game was released many

00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,180
years ago the source code was released

00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:11,800
two days ago and V is a wonderful game

00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,870
strongly recommend that you check it out

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,710
it's a beautiful punishing platformer

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,479
yeah lots of love the V the source code

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,360
was released and they said it's open

00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:23,789
source but the license for these source

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,789
code actually contains clauses

00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:29,500
prohibiting commercial use and requiring

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:32,349
you to contact the developer if you want

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,030
and a number of clauses that it appears

00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:35,289
to be like based on MIT but with

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,770
additional clauses on top and that

00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:40,419
caused some some rumblings from the open

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,060
source community who said this is an

00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:46,720
open source and the conversation

00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:48,669
diverged into away from wow that's

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,560
amazing thank you for sharing into you

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,550
didn't do it the right way and that kind

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,849
of created a little bit of friction

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:57,400
between some communities but look at the

00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,990
code it's really good to see such a

00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,750
popular and wonderful game being having

00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,400
character source code made available the

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,320
other alternative way in which people

00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,539
get their software in the game dev scene

00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:10,300
is very similar to how other software

00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:11,860
scenes work and that is seat based

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:16,720
subscription model licensing or

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:18,970
proprietary code so hopefully that's not

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,650
like a astonishing thing to people

00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,570
people generally want to make money out

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,080
of selling their code and Pablo I do

00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:27,639
that is to sell licenses Photoshop unity

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,159
Houdini most professional asset and

00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,260
content generation tools deliver the

00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:34,060
suit in this way what that means is that

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,709
large of studios tend to be quite

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,990
familiar with dealing with sales teams

00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:42,849
but possibly less familiar with people

00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:44,260
with Randall indie devs like me it also

00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:47,589
means that like this and it is a

00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:50,020
vocabulary of how we talk about software

00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:51,839
licensing so it's not sufficient to say

00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,670
MIT license

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,399
to people who are brand new to

00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,259
open-source it's important to explain in

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,209
some fairly clear in simple terms what

00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:02,250
people can and can't do this is very

00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:03,720
similar to how Creative Commons deals

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,000
their licenses they have the actual

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,930
license itself and then a human readable

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,639
license that summarizes it so that's the

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,540
open-source 'part of it but in addition

00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:14,069
to that we also want to build a

00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,279
community around this code as well and

00:09:14,069 --> 00:09:20,100
that requires marketing so like any

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,870
other product open-source projects have

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,939
to be marketed if you want anyone to be

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,920
using at all now that nothing does not

00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:27,389
necessarily mean a significant ad spend

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,819
it just means you need to be aware of

00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:32,579
how you talk about your project to

00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:34,259
others this involves figuring out what

00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:36,089
kind of audience is likely to be using

00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:38,129
your project and then figure out what

00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:39,660
they want and how to talk about your

00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:42,389
project to them in a way that aligns

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,160
with what they want so we did a bit of

00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:46,709
thinking about how yan spinet is being

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,879
used a lot of people discovered yun

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:49,829
spinner through its association with

00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,389
night in the woods and so the audience

00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:53,189
kind of has a bit of an overlap so

00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:55,829
people who are using yan serena tend to

00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:58,019
be independent game developers who are

00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:59,160
probably hobbyists possibly

00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:01,139
professionals we are aware of some

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,360
Studios using yarn spinner and we love

00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:05,040
them for us but usually it's it's in

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,569
these solos that kind of stuff usually

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,100
young adults I'm guessing around 25

00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:12,660
probably english-speaking again because

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,430
of the audience of night in the woods

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,100
which was released primarily in in

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,839
English almost certainly on Twitter most

00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,149
game devs are on Twitter it's very rare

00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,040
to see a social network that has the

00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:24,629
same kind of population of game devs and

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,389
they probably learned how to code from

00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:33,439
YouTube so that that means not that they

00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:36,000
towards the younger end of people so

00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:38,040
that meant that we had to figure out

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,870
like our branding we hired a really cool

00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,730
designer to make our awesome logo and

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,170
also our calipers and also our font

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,269
selections so big shout out to social

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,730
Richard who made our amazing logo hire

00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,889
them they're great once you have

00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:53,879
something that you can attach the

00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:55,439
project to visually and and you use it

00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,149
everywhere and use it consistently

00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:59,819
figure out how that brand is gonna be

00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:02,759
deployed and be consistent with it so

00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:05,430
just this slide deck we also figured out

00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,890
how we're going to deploy yon spinner in

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:10,560
online presence so there are five main

00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,570
pillars of Yan spinners presence online

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,720
so github twitter slack the web and also

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:17,250
our live streams so the most important

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,530
of these is in fact the Twitter presence

00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,940
because that's where people tend to be

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,040
it's people people spend their time

00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,290
there is a really active game they've

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,790
seen on Twitter and that means it's lots

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,830
of opportunity for discovery of Yan

00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:31,590
spinner on that platform and also

00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,150
because all the developers have an

00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,240
existing presence on Twitter we were

00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,700
able to leverage that both to help build

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,350
the audience and also the familiarity

00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,150
with how that platform works means that

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,160
we're able to you know speak the

00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,690
language and be aware of not just like

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,610
for example the memes but also just the

00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,200
phrasing in the tonality people expect

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:54,600
from Twitter now we live in an age where

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,700
Sunny Delight so a sunny day the orange

00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,680
juice brand pretends to have depression

00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,870
the reason why people do this is because

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,820
people want relatable engaging personas

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:05,070
from brands this is an extreme case and

00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,990
no one actually really like that what

00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:11,280
Sunny D and Moonpie were doing here

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:13,800
where Sunny D basically acted like

00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,720
someone who was going through depressive

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,580
episode and people began to push back on

00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,220
like you know you're a brand you are not

00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:22,290
an individual here and so the account

00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,670
brands saying babe gave a fairly

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,170
succinctly alysus people crave

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,430
authenticity and it's what they look for

00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,230
in their relationships and with their

00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,030
brands which is why the orange juice

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:33,990
account has depression now and everyone

00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:36,120
likes it and it's good so Twitter based

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:37,620
marketing does rely on some degree of

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,660
personality what you just saw was a

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,280
fairly extreme case and I recommend that

00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,020
you don't take it to that level but at

00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,790
the same time relatability is an

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,160
important element of that you don't need

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:49,260
to be a brand saying BAE but creating

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,570
some kind of persona for your Twitter

00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:55,530
presence does help you figure out how

00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:57,780
you can approach people so these points

00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:59,220
here by the way a big thanks to Harris

00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,350
foster who's the community designer for

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,570
Finn G who is a studio that published

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,490
night in the woods people tend to engage

00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,680
with an online presence in the same way

00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:10,260
as that online presence acts and behaves

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,300
this is the reason why when a comedian

00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,160
posts a joke on Twitter most of the

00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,020
people replying are people trying to

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,880
make a joke back at them

00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,010
so the persona that you put out into the

00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,720
world from your

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,760
media presence does tend to attract

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,500
similar kinds of attitudes which means

00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,780
that you need to consider how you want

00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,630
to tweet not just what you want to treat

00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:33,160
I saw someone taking a photo here so I'm

00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:36,800
going to grab that eyelid on there cool

00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,900
you're welcome so with that in mind we

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,390
designed how young spinners Twitter

00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,340
persona should be now I'm not being

00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:45,380
extremely cynical with this because this

00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,600
is mostly me realizing how I present

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,880
myself online deciding what elements

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,980
that I liked and then tying that into

00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,630
what I expect people who are going to be

00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,610
using young spinner expect as well so

00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:57,650
young spinners persona is enthusiastic

00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:00,620
it's eager to share it's a little bit

00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:03,080
self-deprecating and also it's got a bit

00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,610
of the Millennial performative incident

00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,170
re poisoning that afflicts everyone

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:10,040
these days because it's 2020 and also I

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,540
importantly refers to herself in the

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,280
first person I don't want this to be hey

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,200
young spinner we're here to help its

00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,610
young spinner hey I want to help you out

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,410
and I make it pretty clear that it's a

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,690
person behind this rather than you know

00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,670
I'm not trying to be Moonpie saying I'm

00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:24,920
depressed sorry give me sunny do you

00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,500
think I'm depressed but rather it's hi

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:31,330
i'm not i'm yun spinet and identity but

00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,330
hi i'm going to help you use yan spinner

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,130
with that in mind the actual stuff that

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,170
we put out there via our social media

00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:41,540
presence is largely feature related or

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:43,730
what people are making so we tweet about

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,990
new features features that aren't new

00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,140
because people are going to be joining

00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:51,050
the the conversation as it were late in

00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,700
the game we do retweet people who talk

00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,860
about yan spinner but not too much

00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,210
because we don't want to be marketing

00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,350
people who are already following us and

00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,790
saying hey have you heard a young

00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,080
spinner they have we don't need to tell

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,270
them that what we do want to show them

00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,550
is look at this cool thing that someone

00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,080
made and boosting that small amount we

00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,480
don't have a huge amount of reach but

00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,490
that people do enjoy being part of that

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,820
you know whole experience of not just

00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:16,160
young spinner as a as a projects but yan

00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:19,340
spinner as an overall thing so we boost

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,440
their fans to that end like anytime but

00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,970
not anytime but when people will say hey

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,260
i made this with Yan spinette that's

00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:28,580
great i retweet them i boost them and

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:32,680
people like helps people discover stuff

00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:34,899
it's great so images do grab more

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,490
tenshun than text in a wide variety of

00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:39,220
places not just Twitter but the problem

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:41,200
is Yan spinner is largely text so our

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,720
solution has actually been to post

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,960
pictures of text and also screenshots of

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,910
games that use Yan spinner so to that

00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,160
end we have been doing some stuff like

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,270
you know brighter hair really pretty

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,970
syntax highlighter which allows us to

00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:57,220
demonstrate language features and just

00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,600
really promote what is going on inside

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:03,520
you and what you can do with the an

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,920
spinner the web component of our

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,560
presence online is the most serious

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,000
business part of the project so we make

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,190
sure that we aren't flippant or silly or

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,300
too casual we're there if they're on the

00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,370
site that means that they're there to

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,410
learn and so we try and be as

00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,180
comprehensive and straightforward like

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,490
this is yarn spinner it does this thing

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,080
go here to download it not hey kids

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:27,700
welcome to wacky yeah spin a fun time

00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:29,680
that's not what the web is about we have

00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,350
a slack community and that primarily

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,760
exists to be the direct point of contact

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,660
that people can have with the developers

00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,100
so some kind of live chat system is

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,980
really important to have for a community

00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:43,240
we use slack but discord is increasingly

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,160
a popular option especially at the game

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,750
developers because game developers tend

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,029
to be game players and discourse where

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,400
the players are so we use the slack for

00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:53,950
community Q&A tech support announcement

00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,529
and we primarily use that for giving us

00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:59,440
direct access to users in Reverse as

00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:01,660
well any kind of chat based space

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,970
requires a tension emulation it is work

00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,620
to run this kind of stuff so it's

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,179
important to promote friends and other

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:09,730
trusted people to some kind of position

00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:11,620
of authority it's also really important

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,410
to be aware of the corrosive nature of

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:16,360
people talking in the community you

00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:18,309
should not be afraid to ban people from

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:21,189
these communities because they are

00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:23,470
silencing people who are not toxic the

00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:25,030
github is largely the central

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:28,270
development hub people go to the github

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:29,410
page for downloads to file bugs and also

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,840
to learn how to contribute they're not

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,100
really there to see the cool stuff that

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,530
people are making with the ant spinner

00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,450
this is more like the guts of the

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,280
project itself and so that to that end

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,710
the readme has been designed to be large

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,660
about the features and how to contribute

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,830
this is not hugely game dev specific

00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,030
there's not really much difference

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,830
between young

00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,630
read me and popular open-source read

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:51,660
Me's but we want to make sure that we

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,420
aren't there to be hey fellow kids on

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,460
github readme for streaming streaming is

00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,220
really important for any kind of game

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,860
David thing because games largely

00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,720
marketed through through streams so our

00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,600
streams tend to be fairly high energy

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,670
opportunities for live Q&A and for demos

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,530
most people working in games these days

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,830
like to learn via video at least

00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:16,450
partially which means that using streams

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:19,030
is an excellent way to grow the audience

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,590
it also allows us to record the stream

00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:22,960
and that gives us material to post to

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:26,410
YouTube as well which built just an

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,180
archive of that good content it's really

00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:31,110
important to be fairly consistent with

00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:34,600
how you how often you are putting out

00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,890
material consistent delivery of your of

00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,330
your marketing is really important and

00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,610
it's really important to never ever go

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,640
quiet a lot of people feel like they

00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,800
don't have anything important to say

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,260
that's fine even if it's not brand new

00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,660
you you can even put something out there

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:51,040
find a tip that you know about and your

00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,560
use developer you're quite like its

00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,880
integrated into your brain and just put

00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,590
push it out there that tweet from

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,260
earlier of hey yawn tip here's a

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,030
language syntax feature like that's

00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,000
something it's fairly well known to most

00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:06,490
developers but anytime you put out a tip

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,530
you're teaching someone something new if

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:11,020
you have a monetization element to your

00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:13,900
project never shy away from promoting

00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:16,300
that it's important and it's important

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,650
to realize what value that your your

00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,780
project gives people and people will not

00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:21,790
know that they can support you unless

00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,560
you tell them so to that end please back

00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:28,440
our patreon it's a patron that come to

00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:31,450
our secret lab so running the project is

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,390
not terribly dissimilar from standard

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,590
open-source procedures we respond quite

00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:37,720
quickly at least we aim to respond

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:40,150
quickly to people who post issues and to

00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,190
people who give pull requests we welcome

00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,650
new contributors quite quickly and ask

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,300
them to and so and thank them for

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:48,850
reporting bugs and that helps them feel

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,470
like a part of the project we also give

00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,870
people admin access and give people

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,970
responsibility it can be quite tempting

00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:56,440
to try and hold on to the project

00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,260
because it's your baby and you know

00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,860
there's a lot of your your personal

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,010
personality

00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,929
in that try and avoid that kind of

00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,520
feeling to be precious about it we gave

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:09,280
for example complete control over the

00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,929
web editor to a person who made like

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,970
five pull requests and he's an amazing

00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:15,070
job also it's important to accept

00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:17,500
imperfect pull requests don't be waiting

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,270
for the perfect feature to come in

00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,780
accept it and then you can make changes

00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:25,240
yourself it's also really useful to flag

00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:28,330
certain bugs as low-hanging fruit don't

00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,250
be tempted to fix the easy bugs your job

00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,440
as the lead developer is someone who

00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,840
knows a lot about the project and is in

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,120
a position to solve the really hard ones

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,710
so if something easy comes in fraggle is

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,650
low-hanging fruit and say hey this is a

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:44,559
good first point of contact for people

00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:46,179
who want to contribute so yeah we found

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,700
that to be really good for like bringing

00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:50,980
more people in you will get people who

00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,200
have tech questions try and be as

00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,780
available as possible because your users

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,429
are going to have the best ideas for but

00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,500
both feature quests but also help you

00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:02,620
realize bugs and features either you

00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,890
should have so running this kind of

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,600
thing is quite hard work but it is

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:09,700
incredibly rewarding both in terms of

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,100
the emotional side of it you love to see

00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,929
people working on your stuff in terms of

00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,760
the technical side Jasmina is nowhere

00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,799
near as good without the support of the

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,090
people who could rip your code and also

00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:21,159
financially if that's important to you

00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,330
it is for me because you know it helps

00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:24,970
raise them people who could potentially

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,830
support you financially so with that in

00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:30,140
mind go and make an awesome community

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:36,979
and I want to see what you make Thanks

00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:36,979
[Applause]

00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,610
so we got a little bit of time for some

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:51,050
questions does anyone have any questions

00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:52,850
yes in regards to always been available

00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:56,330
to your users

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:58,130
I find that 99% of the requests I get

00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:01,220
are when on my sleep because I live in

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:03,080
Australia and no one else does yeah how

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,090
do you deal with that bring on people

00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,490
who are not in your time zone so go

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:10,700
going back to that point of giving

00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:14,060
people responsibility you will find it

00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:16,340
easier to have people who as

00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,560
knowledgeable as you if they have been

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,540
working along alongside you on there so

00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,090
if you're not at a point where that's

00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,640
possible yet in your project just make

00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:27,230
that make that information the fact that

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,310
you're not gonna be available all the

00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:33,140
time quite easy to find so and who come

00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:35,210
in and ask you questions just say hey if

00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:38,110
I I'm in Australia oh I mean I'm in this

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:40,070
time zone and so it'll take me some time

00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,780
just this morning we said we've put up a

00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,220
post saying everyone we're gonna be less

00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,550
available for a week because we're LCA

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:48,800
so just communicating your availability

00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:52,370
is really important and can it's like

00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,560
you don't have to be on call but being

00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,060
as available as you can and that last

00:22:54,560 --> 00:23:02,290
part is important as you can is

00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:02,290
important any other questions

00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:13,360
how much should be awake do you dedicate

00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:19,770
to Yan spinner how much of my your wake

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:23,320
of my week in more and more every day so

00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:24,640
last week we basically the entire week

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,809
was nothing but young spinner because we

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,120
launched 1.0 these days it's about two

00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:33,190
full-time days a week and we want to

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,899
increase that that's made possible if we

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,700
get more backers because that way we can

00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:38,919
put more of our time and we have to work

00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:49,179
with some client stuff so yeah yeah

00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:51,300
right now it about two days a week well

00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:54,990
please join me in thanking John again

00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,990
