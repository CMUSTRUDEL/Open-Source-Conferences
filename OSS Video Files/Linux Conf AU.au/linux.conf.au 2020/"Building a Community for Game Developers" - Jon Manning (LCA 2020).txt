How do you build an open source community of non-open-source developers? The Yarn Spinner narrative tool is an open source project for building choice-driven conversations and interactive dialogue. This means that its target audience is game developers, who aren't typically used to open source development practices. In this talk, we'll discuss how we bootstrapped the community around Yarn Spinner, and how to work with enthusiastic people who aren't used to free software licensing.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
