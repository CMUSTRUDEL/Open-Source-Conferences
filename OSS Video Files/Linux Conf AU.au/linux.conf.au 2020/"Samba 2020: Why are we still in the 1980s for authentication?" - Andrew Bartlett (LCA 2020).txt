As a developer of Samba's authentication and domain control features since 2001, Andrew Bartlett will ponder how 1980s network authentication technology is faring in Samba and consider the future for on-site authentication and authorization as well as the ever more important cloud/federated identity space. 

This will in turn inform a bit of crystal ball gazing on where Samba needs to go, to stay relevant, doing more than just being a great AD DC following the protocol pattern from Microsoft.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
