Title: "Keynote: From 2020 to 2121: How will we get there?" - Donna Benjamin (LCA 2020)
Publication date: 2020-01-15
Playlist: linux.conf.au 2020
Description: 
	Donna Benjamin

https://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/217/

Who is watching? Why are they watching? and why does that matter?

As members of the global free and open source software community we're all secret agents in a mission to change the future. Tragedy is, some of us don't even realise this is true, or that the future is already here.  We're up against the powerful forces of distraction, disinformation, fatalism and apathy. We need to rally. we need to defend, and we need to act.

Donna will re-introduce some old ideas we can all embrace to arm and protect ourselves, and empower each and every one of us to take back our power, and take action steps into the future.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

why does it matter to you why does it

00:01:50,250 --> 00:02:00,840

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:03,569

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,659
introduction I'm Donna Benjamin I'm an

00:02:03,569 --> 00:02:11,370
engagement lead in the open innovation

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:17,010
labs at Red Hat where I lead teams help

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:20,190
teams change the future I want to

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:22,890
acknowledge the young number people the

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,410
elders past and present and emerging and

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,110
thank them for their generous welcome to

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:35,040
country on Monday that acknowledged the

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:37,500
country we're meeting on today over the

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,170
years I've been involved in a bunch of

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,250
different organizations in one way or

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:46,889
another I'd also like to acknowledge

00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,810
that that work and those engagements

00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:51,450
with those people have made me who I am

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,930
today and informed what I have to say

00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:57,900
but I'm not here to talk about them and

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:01,349
I'm not here to talk about me when I

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,970
first heard that the conference theme

00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:08,190
for LCA 2020 was who is watching I

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:11,730
immediately thought of math surveillance

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:15,630
and the increasing threats to our

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:20,780
collective privacy so why does this

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:25,130
question who is watching matter to me

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:30,319
let me tell you a story in 1938

00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:35,880
my grandmother set off on an adventure

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:40,259
with her new husband they bordered the

00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:43,280
Jarvis Bay to Australia not for their

00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:47,620
honeymoon as you might

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:52,700
have thought but to escape Nazi Germany

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:55,130
they were incredibly lucky you see this

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:59,390
was before World War two before the war

00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:05,420
and my grandmother had been arrested and

00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:11,720
imprisoned by the Gestapo for hanging

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:13,850
out with dissidents allegedly she was

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,430
eventually released by the Gestapo

00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,919
somewhat ironically because she was a

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:22,880
Jew and they thought she'd be no good

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:26,210
for breeding stock later during the war

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,620
her mother and my grandfather's mother

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:33,610
and sister were killed in camps in

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,710
Europe they were incredibly lucky I

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:42,140
wouldn't be standing here today if they

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:48,860
hadn't got aboard the Jarvis Bay so who

00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:53,690
is watching and why it matters so in the

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:58,790
past surveillance involved spy craft and

00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:01,850
tricky devices think James Bond think

00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:06,020
you cleaned every spy movie ever

00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:09,080
I love spy movies who else like spy

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:12,100
movies hands up a lot of people do like

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:18,410
they're awesome right it's like it's fun

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:23,000
but now well what's your wake word of

00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:28,810
choice do you have a virtual assistant

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,570
by your side CCTV cameras are everywhere

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:40,340
to help keep us safe to keep our stuff

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:42,770
safe I put out a call on Twitter to send

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,270
me pics of camera to have people send me

00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:46,820
pics of cameras they came across in

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:50,990
everyday life and this was fun so here's

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,060

also Thank You Katie to opera cam I

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,590
think this was actually my favorite it

00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,670
took me a little while to figure out

00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:11,860
what is that and where is that library

00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:14,010
can series of photographs from Clinton

00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:17,800
thank you wherever you are

library can and David sent me a series

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,660
of photographs two of this traffic cam

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,040
which is just one of them it was kind of

00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,180
fun David where of you out looked like a

00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,620
little journey that you're sort of

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,360
taking photographs as you went I was

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,860
like I like this like I want to hear the

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:34,000
story about this little trip that you

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,830
were taking tram can also one of my

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,370
favorites Steve I think is this the tram

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,690
that just goes goes past here I suspect

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:44,490
yes very good

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:47,470
also I'm from Melbourne so I like trans

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,450
car cam a late entry from yakov thank

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,040
you this is it's hard to see the actual

00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:57,570
camera here but it's the automotive

00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,570
sensing system is car and curry cam

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,990
which Pete took and just as we were

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,910
having dinner in Indian restaurant a few

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,460
weeks ago they're everywhere and they're

00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:09,910
you know we don't really usually pay

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:13,870
them much much heed but seriously

00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:17,820
we're kind of making it too easy we're

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:23,130
making it too easy in two main ways

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:27,940
and firstly many of us willingly

00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:31,420
mindlessly throw our data around like

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:36,150
confetti and a wedding paying no heed to

00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:38,760
how it will be cleaned up or by who I

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:43,510
know that's not all of you some of you

00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:46,930
are hyper conscious of your digital

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:50,890
footprints of your security settings of

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:55,930
your privacy some of you make take a

00:07:50,890 --> 00:08:01,120
great deal of care I don't I should I

00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:02,920
know I should but I don't and I don't

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,930
know why that is it's not that I've got

00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,450
nothing to hide or any of those come

00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:11,650
things that people say I'm not really

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:15,520
sure why I don't take more care perhaps

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:18,970
it's just all too hard perhaps I'm just

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,330
lazy perhaps I don't think the

00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:25,510
consequences are dire or a big deal I

00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,760
don't know I actually asked myself this

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:32,050
every now and again why don't I take

00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:35,789
more care I should but what if what if

00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:43,810
my government decides I'm a threat

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:48,610
what then this is the front page of my

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:51,040
dad's a zio file for those of you who

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:53,770
don't know what a zio stands for it's

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,290
the Australian security intelligence

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:59,460
organization now why on earth does my

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:03,610
dad have an azo file I mean he's my dad

00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:06,160
well he was seen as a little bit of a

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:11,310
troublemaker in the late 1960s and early

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:13,950
1970s he was involved in things like

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:18,370
campaigning against capital punishment

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:21,060
and getting indigenous people counted in

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,060
the census

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,580
thanks dad I'll make sure I don't tell

00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,820
him he got a round of applause for that

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:35,880
good work he was photographed attending

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:43,830
meetings and conferences just like this

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:51,540
one his phone was tapped his mine who

00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:56,550
cares Siri is listening hey Siri what's

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:58,730
the weather like today it's currently

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,140
cloudy and 26 degrees in Broadbeach

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:03,480
expect cloudy skies starting in the

00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,220
afternoon and thunderstorms tonight with

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,710
mixed conditions for the rest of the day

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,500
temperatures are heading down from 27

00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,390
degrees to 24 tonight

00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:14,070
well Thank You Siri that's very handy do

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,200
you ever like asking Siri about the

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,520
weather and about and what the time is

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,870
like if my hands are full and I'm

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,040
running like quick hey Siri what's the

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:24,960
time and I like asking Google like

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,700
telling Google where I'm going so you

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,500
can give me directions and I do this

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:34,250
willingly gleefully I think it's amazing

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:36,420
this is fabulous this is the future hmm

00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,280
but there's another way that we are

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,850
making it too easy

00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:46,620
we makers of free and open source

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:50,010
software kind of like surveillance arms

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:54,810
dealers our free operating systems

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:57,450
databases libraries servers all the

00:10:54,810 --> 00:11:01,350
tools we make are being used by the

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:05,610
persuasion industry whether we like it

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:08,190
or not so here's an uncomfortable

00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:11,400
question and llama explored this

00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:17,700
yesterday in her talk are we responsible

00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:22,020
for that are we accountable for the acts

00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:25,620
enabled by the tools we make the tools

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:29,850
we support the tools we sell are we

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:32,160
responsible are we accountable well

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,770
that's a complicated question with an

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,589
even more complicated answer

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:40,740
poor answers I'm looking forward to

00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:42,959
Nicolas session tomorrow on practical

00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:46,500
ethics to learn how to build some

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:49,230
ethical muscle and yesterday Alana's

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,089
talk was very powerful and if you missed

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:54,420
it then I urge you to find the video and

00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:59,490
watch it maybe one way to think through

00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:06,300
this is to ask ourselves a leading

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:14,339
question what's the intent what's the

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:17,220
big why the why matters search and

00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:20,190
rescue is one very good reason for

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:23,010
watching for some time now

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:26,100
dr. andrew tridgell better known to many

00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:27,899
of you just as trench has been working

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,270
on an open-source autonomous drone

00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:32,270
project called

00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:35,190
RG pilot and I believe they're

00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:38,100
developing flight path algorithms to aid

00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,930
in search and rescue this is awesome

00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,720
right

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:47,520
this is life-affirming work this is work

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,680
that matters social media is now being

00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,279
monitored by global public health

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,520
authorities to watch for signs of

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,029
disease outbreak a number of studies

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:01,560
around the world have shown that

00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:05,130
tracking leading indicators for signs

00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:08,750
and symptoms of influenza Zika virus

00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,750
dengue virus these sorts of things

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,630
matches that being reported to doctors

00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:19,760
and health health providers but it does

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:23,370
so faster and sooner and allows those

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,770
organizations to prepare and stock up on

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:28,620
medicine or help track the origin and

00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:31,880
likely spread of infection to warn or

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,200
quarantine people who may be affected

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:38,339
later today Rachel Bunder will talk

00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:40,470
about smart energy meters these machines

00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:43,290
are constantly monitoring our energy

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,120
usage and sending that info direct to

00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,709
the energy provider rather than having

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,720
someone come and physically read the

00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:50,310
meter

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,760
Cathi red we'll be talking about sensing

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:56,370
and prosthetics and how important it is

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,320
to protect the sorts of private and

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:02,490
sensitive data they can collect in good

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,279
better breasts later today compliance

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:07,740
with road traffic regulations bland

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,750
banal but it's another why another

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,930
reason for monitoring and observation

00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:16,490
and the very obvious placement of

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:18,990
cameras is thought to be a deterrent to

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:21,630
unwelcome and criminal behavior to the

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,240
extent that fake cameras are often

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:27,829
installed with that aim in mind so in

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:31,260
that case the intent the aim to deter

00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:32,910
would seem to matter more than capturing

00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:39,089
and recording evidence of the unwelcome

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:46,350
behavior itself the why matters but when

00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:54,390
the intent is to suppress repress or

00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:59,279
oppress then it matters even more but we

00:14:54,390 --> 00:15:06,000
are freedom lovers we are agents of

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:08,970
change and we can change the future but

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,699
first we need to ask and answer some

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:14,640
important questions how do we work

00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:18,769
together how do we work together to

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:23,130
create the future we want or resist

00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:25,230
apathy Janis Joplin sang that freedom's

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,970
just another word from nothing left to

00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,730
lose

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:36,060
but I think that freedom's what we make

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:38,040
it to be let's be makers let's shift our

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,790
thinking from the scary realm of

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:47,000
surveillance to the somewhat more

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:51,870
objective space of observation last year

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,920
sitting beside my dad in hospital in

00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:58,380
intensive care I I noted the

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,380
professionalism and attention to detail

00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,750
of the nurse who was taking

00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:07,590
our early observations of his vital

00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:12,290
statistics she was tracking blood

00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:18,030
pressure heart rate temperature

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:22,340
respiration skin tone she was also

00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:26,960
paying attention to me and to my mum and

00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:32,960
I realized this too was a kind of

00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,960
surveillance but it was all good

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:42,440
observation isn't always a bad thing so

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:49,880
what's the real difference between

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:49,880
surveillance and observation intent

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,590
surveillance is observation when the

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:58,230
subject is under suspicion there are

00:16:55,590 --> 00:17:01,290
very many reasons we have to observe

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:04,920
things observe each other or observe the

00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:07,410
world around us benign reasons good

00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,410
reasons bad reasons lots of different

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:13,610
reasons but when the primary intent of

00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:18,750
observation becomes suspicion that's

00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:22,350
surveillance intent matters this image

00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:24,530
is from police infrared footage of the

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:27,810
fires near mallacoota on New Year's Eve

00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:30,450
so from a nurses careful observation in

00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:32,700
intensive care to public health teams

00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,860
using social media to track the outbreak

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,290
of disease to early warning detection

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:43,250
for natural hazards like volcanoes and

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:45,930
bush fires monitoring sensing automation

00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:50,670
machine learning these are all being

00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:56,250
used to watch to learn and to help us

00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:59,070
help us make decisions to act we should

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:03,930
and we must use our skills and our

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:06,000
smarts to fight fire with fire we should

00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:09,930
all be watching and learning so we can

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,540
make meaningful choices to act we should

00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:15,450
also work to protect our own privacy

00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:18,330
Marnie is resolution for 2020 is to

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:20,360
clean up my own data act because just as

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:23,250
vaccinations Foster's herd immunity

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,980
using VPNs and encryption helps protect

00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:28,680
our collective privacy normalizing

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,130
strong privacy for everyone protects

00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:34,470
those who need it most

00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:38,370
there are things we can all do right now

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:41,880
and some of you are doing them and can

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:43,830
help the rest of us also do them but

00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:47,160
what about the future I want to go on a

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:51,630
journey to the future fast forward to

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:57,170
the year 21 21 not 2021 not next year

00:18:51,630 --> 00:19:04,290
but 101 years from now can you imagine

00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:05,730
what the world might be like in 21 21 it

00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,860
was William Gibson who said the future

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:11,160
is here it's just not evenly distributed

00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:15,510
the telephone was invented well over a

00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:18,570
hundred years ago but and we probably

00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,980
all have one in our pockets I do and if

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:24,660
you don't you're probably a

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:26,850
conscientious objector right who doesn't

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:31,410
have a phone in their pocket or about

00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:33,300
their person I don't actually see a

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:39,660
single hand is there one there was one

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:43,650
one good talk to me later no tracking

00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:46,940
device on you sorry you've got to okay

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:46,940
who's got more than two phones

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:55,200
okay so we are well endowed with phones

00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:56,940
in this room but there are places in

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,989
Australia right now that do not have a

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:07,619
phone that works comms tower burnt out

00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:12,600
power down no NBN the future is here

00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:13,320
it's just not evenly distributed young

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,869
way to help

00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:21,989
imagine the future is to study the past

00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:26,279
and some people like to think that the

00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:30,059
past was some kind of perfect Golden Age

00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:33,629
would like to go back there the truth is

00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:34,619
though Humanity is better off today than

00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:37,350
it has ever been

00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:41,429
Hans Rosling and his successor Max Rosa

00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:43,320
advocate for a fact-based optimism and

00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:45,210
if you haven't seen their awesome

00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,980
animation sort of showing you know key

00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,899
indicators changing over the over time

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,359
then I urge you to go and check them out

00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:52,619
they're really they're really cool

00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:55,019
humanity according to many measures of

00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:58,080
progress is actually doing really well

00:20:55,019 --> 00:21:00,269
if historical trends continue it's

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,559
likely the world will keep on getting

00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:07,590
better so whilst it may seem bleak right

00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:11,730
now as we start to really feel the heat

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:14,820
of the climate crisis we're doing really

00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:17,039
well some people are even saying you

00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:19,039
know rebuilding after the bush fires is

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,929
going to stimulate economic activity

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:25,129
well others suggest we need to be

00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:29,119
thinking much more critically about

00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:32,369
using growth as a measure of progress

00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:35,669
people like Greta tunberg Time

00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:38,580
magazine's Person of the Year scolding

00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:43,919
our leaders for believing in fairy tales

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:47,330
of eternal economic growth what was I

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:52,679
talking about oh that's right the past a

00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:56,940
hundred years ago this week our friends

00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:58,920
in America enacted prohibition and

00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:05,760
banned

00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:09,390
I think it's fair to say that had a few

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:15,660
unintended consequences okay

00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:19,950
fast-forward to 1996 now some of you

00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:22,410
probably weren't born then but some of

00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,930
you may remember things like we were

00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:29,070
about to become a republic here in

00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:33,860
Australia remember that John Howard was

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:36,540
elected prime minister there was

00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:42,000
unbelievably tragic massacre in Port

00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:47,490
Arthur in Tasmania dolly the cloned

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:51,840
sheep Dolly was born remember that yes

00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:54,750
one person more awesomely New Zealand

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:58,320
paid some compensation to Maori for the

00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:01,950
loss of their land in the 1800s coffee

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:06,120
and Ann became secretary-general of the

00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:10,320
United Nations and I attended a futures

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:14,510
or Global futures forum called 2121 and

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:24,770
it's been on my mind ever since

00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:28,890
21:21 101 years from now so let's begin

00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:32,430
let's start now let's talk about the

00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:35,760
future not your personal future the

00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:37,770
future of the world you can plan for

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,970
your own future we all can that's just

00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:46,530
called or to-do lists planning what to

00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:48,600
do with our own lives isn't the same as

00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:54,120
planning the future I think the future

00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:58,440
exists beyond our lifetime trouble is we

00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:05,460
can't do anything then we can only act

00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:08,320
now so let's stop for a moment let's

00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:13,899
gaze out through the galaxy

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:15,630
and just breathe let's take a leaf out

00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:19,389
of a cart Ollie's book

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:26,529
quiet all the noise in your head breathe

00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:30,580
in breathe out feel your breath filling

00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:38,529
up your lungs feel it flow out of your

00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:41,769
mouth or nose now take those breaths a

00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:47,100
little deeper just think about the

00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:50,559
breath our other thoughts rushing in

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:56,610
there just thoughts you can deal with

00:24:50,559 --> 00:25:03,070
them later close your eyes feel yourself

00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:07,110
here in this room how are you sitting

00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:11,919
are you warm are you cold

00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:14,740
feel the energy in your body this might

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,440
sound like we were to some of you but

00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:22,149
every blood cell in your body is

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:26,080
carrying oxygen from your lungs powering

00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:38,129
your brain feel the energy of your

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:47,379
breath feel that power we are all here

00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:50,340
joined in this moment this one single

00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,340
moment

00:25:56,830 --> 00:26:05,400
are you here now this is what Eckhart

00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:08,710
Tolle calls the power of now living in

00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:12,280
the moment once you start living in the

00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:15,580
moment you can stop reliving the past or

00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,920
fretting about the future the future is

00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,200
coming anyway

00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:22,600
you can't stop it and you can't wish it

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,220
away just like you can't relive the

00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:28,000
glory days of the past

00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:32,850
don't let the past prevent you from

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,850
living your life now

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:46,180
welcome to 20/20 here we are now so

00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:50,530
thinking about next year I'm prepared to

00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:55,530
bet predict but some of us will meet

00:26:50,530 --> 00:27:05,910
again I believe it's come fate you 20:21

00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:10,570
yes good and it will be in Antarctica oh

00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:13,540
we're on a boat I think there's a bluff

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:18,130
is it today to chat about the future of

00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:20,350
LCA sorry we can cobble make some fairly

00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:24,160
confident predictions but again it's

00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:28,270
kind of planning it's a to-do list but

00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:30,550
what about next century truth is you

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:34,090
probably won't get to see it none of us

00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:36,130
will okay well some of us might human

00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,830
lives are getting longer there's that

00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:41,650
progress thing life expectancy increases

00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:46,420
but I'm not as confident I can predict

00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:52,450
what it will be like the picture painted

00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:55,270
by climate science isn't great but can

00:27:52,450 --> 00:28:01,510
you imagine what the world might be like

00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:05,260
in 21 21 take a moment and just dream a

00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:13,750
little just

00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:20,420
dream a little have you imagined a

00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:27,830
perfect world or can you foresee some

00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:30,890
issues you could act to prevent if the

00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:34,310
future is a destination what are we

00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:43,370
going to do today that will have an

00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:47,690
impact in 21 21 what do we want to do to

00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:51,230
impact the future can we work together

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:53,570
to prevent the dark dystopia foretold by

00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:57,430
aural on Friday

00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:59,930
Esther is speaking about RFC 1984 and

00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:03,500
why we should start worrying about

00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:06,080
encryption backdoors and mass data

00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:10,640
collection I very much hope she will

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,290
have some action steps for all of us or

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,610
on the other hand perhaps we could work

00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:21,460
together to build some perfect utopia or

00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:23,930
a meth topia how do we avoid

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:28,850
sleepwalking into a bland future of

00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:31,700
unfulfilled potential how can you make

00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:34,490
the future happen the trick I think is

00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:38,630
not to worry about the future at all but

00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:42,170
act now to gather what we need when we

00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:46,340
get there pack like for a hiking trip

00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:49,310
take everything you need with you but

00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:52,310
you will need to make some choices about

00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:54,890
the things you want to take but don't

00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:59,120
necessarily want to carry every step of

00:29:54,890 --> 00:30:01,790
the way so what will we need on this

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,330
journey to the future it's not just

00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:08,150
about technology it's about people it's

00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:13,620
about you and what you do it's also

00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:17,960
about social change change in thought

00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:21,450
changing mood changing attitude and

00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:24,090
changes in ourselves what are we

00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:26,640
learning about ourselves when we make

00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:28,740
these kinds of changes version alig wins

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,130
beautiful phrase it's good to have an

00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:36,840
end to journey toward but it is the

00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:39,299
journey that matters in the end so if we

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,789
look to 2121 as our destination and

00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:46,169
getting there is a journey let's ask

00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:47,700
ourselves what would we need I think

00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:49,320
this is a useful way to stop feeling

00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:53,490
powerless about what the future might

00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:58,409
bring because you are powerful together

00:30:53,490 --> 00:31:03,990
we are incredibly powerful but we need

00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:09,059
to understand what power is and how to

00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:11,730
use it so what do you want to do what

00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:16,799
kind of world would you live in if you

00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:21,120
could change everything you can start

00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:25,440
making it now another attendee at the

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:28,799
2121 global futures forum 24 years ago

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,059
that's a long time ago was my mother

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,409
John Benjamin

00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:37,230
she is a lifelong educator working

00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:39,919
together to tackle poverty in the 1970s

00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:45,090
she and her colleague Connie been

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:49,559
identified four key sources of power to

00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:51,539
harness to affect change they designed

00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:53,490
and ran a pilot program at the

00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:56,309
Brotherhood of San Lawrence it was an

00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:59,700
evidence-based approach that rejected

00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:02,669
casework as the key methodology because

00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:06,809
it tended to see people experiencing

00:32:02,669 --> 00:32:10,340
poverty as cases to be solved rather

00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:13,409
than people who simply lacked resources

00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:17,480
they lacked more than resources they

00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:21,200
lacked power over their own lives and

00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:24,280
looking through the lens of power itself

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:30,670
proved to be the case

00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:33,890
so for powers one power over resources

00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:36,470
food as a resource electricity is a

00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:42,140
resource your internet connection

00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:45,110
thank you our net is a resource a roof a

00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:50,470
safe secure stable roof over your head

00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:56,180
every night is a resource how much power

00:32:50,470 --> 00:33:00,680
do you have over your resources how much

00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:03,650
power to the people around you have over

00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:08,660
the resources they have and the

00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:11,680
resources they need is there a sense

00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:14,890
that resources are scarce

00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:19,700
should they be rationed or restricted

00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:23,030
are they a basic human rights what

00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:30,880
resources will we need to forge our

00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:35,350
future on this journey toward 2121 to

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,640
our over information now in the past

00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:39,590
when Joan and Connie we're talking about

00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:43,250
this stuff information was not as easy

00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:46,130
to come by as it is today although as

00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:49,210
we're seeing in this apocalyptic

00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:53,180
bushfire crisis incorrect information

00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:56,150
can be just as powerful as the truth Eco

00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:58,160
anxiety was them a short list was on the

00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,860
short list for McQuarrie's the Macquarie

00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,620
dictionaries word of the year

00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:09,790
the oxford dictionary chose climate

00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:14,480
emergency today we have info overwhelm a

00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:16,880
veritable glut of data we have more

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,370
information than we can deal with so

00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,830
we've started to ask machines to help us

00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:25,400
make sense of it we're still developing

00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:30,590
ways to manage information to wield

00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:35,500
power over it how will we verify

00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:35,500
increasingly compelling deep fakes

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:43,260
number three power over decision-making

00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:47,760
the power of decision-making is how

00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:52,379
we're going to make 2121 think about all

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,750
the things in this in this world that

00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:59,700
were decided for you long before you

00:34:54,750 --> 00:35:01,980
were born our system of law even Road

00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:04,079
rules really simple things were decided

00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:06,119
long ago we don't really discuss them

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:09,530
anymore occasionally we tweak the edges

00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:14,640
of them but lots of stuff gets decided

00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:18,599
all the time by someone else and has

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,329
long lasting impact the decisions you

00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:23,839
make today will likely impact people

00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:27,359
your age living a hundred years from now

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:32,880
so let's not take our power over

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:35,190
decision-making for granted ladies today

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,079
no I'm not sure if it's today or later

00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:39,420
in the week nor today Josh Simmons is

00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:42,150
talking about open source citizenship

00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,220
josh is that today today awesome which

00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,890
should provide some food for thought for

00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:50,549
the power dynamics of decision-making in

00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:53,040
and about our own communities this

00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:56,609
community the communities we intersect

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:59,780
with number four speaking of

00:35:56,609 --> 00:36:02,069
intersection power over relationships

00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:04,740
none of these powers is any more

00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:07,849
important than than any other but let's

00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:11,910
just say some are more equal than others

00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:16,859
our communities our voices our feelings

00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:22,109
the way we work together we're all so

00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:25,470
connected now across the world there's

00:36:22,109 --> 00:36:31,410
huge power in our relationships so so

00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:37,109
how do we nurture them how do we protect

00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:39,480
and respect different voices we need to

00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:41,460
have the space and the means of

00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,950
communicating each other and our

00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,160
institutions and we need ways of knowing

00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:50,640
we've been heard and under

00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:53,450
Stewart how to recreate a future where

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,100
everybody feels empowered to speak and

00:36:53,450 --> 00:37:00,810
everybody can feel their viewpoint is

00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:04,430
valid but do so in a way that respects

00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:12,420
everyone else's agency privacy and

00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:14,670
perspective so now let's take a look at

00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:19,160
those four powers in relation to each

00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:24,050
other the link between information and

00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:27,720
relationships is communication we need

00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:32,430
resources and decision-making are linked

00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:37,920
by allocation and distribution and we

00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:42,060
need information to to help us find and

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,130
use resources and make decisions our

00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:48,450
relationships with others also help

00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:52,710
determine how we share and allocate

00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:58,410
resources the four powers are connected

00:37:52,710 --> 00:38:02,370
and interdependent so just as the future

00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:07,250
isn't evenly distributed the same is

00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:10,800
true for power so where do we begin

00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:14,730
21:21 is a long way off and we need to

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:19,200
get started what's something small you

00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:25,230
can do today tomorrow this week this

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:29,310
year what change can you make I'm going

00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:30,900
to try I'm going to try and improve herd

00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:33,270
immunity to mass surveillance by

00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:34,440
cleaning up my act with data and

00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,960
tomorrow I'm going to try and get to

00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:41,130
opal session to learn about collecting

00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:44,940
information with care what step will you

00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:47,010
take do you know of good resources on

00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:49,740
how we can all improve our herd immunity

00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:51,600
to mass surveillance please share them

00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,730
and if you're willing to share please

00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:56,580
add them to this etherpad that i've set

00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:59,930
up it's very slow to load so take a deep

00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:02,240
breath be in the moment let it load

00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:04,700
or you know feel free to tweet or talk

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,980
about it on IRC or in the hallway track

00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,990
here this week or even blog about it

00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:11,420
later if you know waves if you're good

00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:13,520
at this stuff please share it please

00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,920
make it accessible please make it open

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,760
and help other people do it to people

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:24,130
like me who just got it's too hard I

00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,130
should know better I do know better a

00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:31,250
journey of a thousand miles begins with

00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:36,859
a single step so what are you going to

00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:40,819
do what step can you take to help more

00:39:36,859 --> 00:39:43,849
evenly distribute now sorry distribute

00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:46,910
power now what step will you take to

00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:50,779
help more evenly distribute power now

00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:58,630
and more evenly distribute the future in

00:39:50,779 --> 00:40:02,380
21 21 take a moment to think about it

00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:02,380
and I'll have a sip of water

00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:11,289
so imagine imagine if the future was

00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:16,220
like using software and you found a bug

00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:19,549
right could you replicate the bug could

00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:23,869
you submit a bug report could you fix

00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:28,339
the bug how might we all take more

00:40:23,869 --> 00:40:31,160
responsibility and accountability for

00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:34,279
what we're making possible and how could

00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,430
we take one single step to make that

00:40:34,279 --> 00:40:36,430
happen

00:40:36,819 --> 00:40:41,990
one of the organizations I've been

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,950
involved with is open Australia who's

00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:49,069
heard of open Australia few of yous most

00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:51,500
not I think so open Australia runs a

00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:53,599
bunch of websites that help us watch the

00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,430
government the first one they created

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,589
was putting hand-side online in a

00:40:55,430 --> 00:41:01,390
machine-readable format rather than in

00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:05,779
PDFs another one they've got is called

00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:07,250
right-to-know and it's a really easy way

00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:09,380
to submit a Freedom of Information

00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:11,210
request to a government agency now I

00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,620
know some of you have used it hands up a

00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:18,260
few of you

00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:20,840
thank you it's a really easy way to

00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:23,330
submit Freedom of Information requests

00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,930
it can get a bit interesting and

00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:30,350
complicated but it's a good way to start

00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:36,590
this this helps us move from being

00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:38,630
watched to being the watches it helps us

00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:41,930
take responsibility for what becomes

00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:45,020
possible theoretical biologist Stuart

00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:48,770
Kauffman coined this phrase as the the

00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:51,890
adjacent possible it's all the possible

00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:54,080
combinations of factors that could call

00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:56,210
something into being that could summon

00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:59,240
some new future everything is in place

00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:02,570
it makes something new possible we don't

00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,730
necessarily know what that is he used it

00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:09,140
to describe the primordial soup of life

00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:12,380
that sequence of things and stuff that

00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,940
was in place that meant that this

00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:17,060
chemical interaction happened to the

00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:20,060
igniters life on earth he called it the

00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:22,670
adjacent possible the idea was

00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:25,930
popularized by Steven Johnson in his

00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:28,130
book where good ideas come from

00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:30,260
he used the idea of the adjacent

00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,270
possible to look at the history of

00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:35,540
innovation and he suggested that this

00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:38,870
kind of theory of the solitary you know

00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:44,000
inventor is an utter fallacy he says it

00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:47,600
actually all comes from groupthink he as

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,790
he puts it chance favors the connected

00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:53,690
mind an LCA

00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:57,620
this conference is very much a place to

00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:59,290
connect with other minds so what's

00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:02,450
coming next

00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:04,100
it's hard to know until it happens but

00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:07,010
we can work together to foster more

00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,930
positive kinds of observation and work

00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:12,590
together to achieve fairer distribution

00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:17,890
of power and guard against the worst

00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:17,890
excesses of oppressive surveillance

00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:24,760
finally I'd like to talk about one more

00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:27,250
old idea just one more thing

00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:30,750
and that's appreciative inquiry hands up

00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:30,750
if you've heard of appreciative inquiry

00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:38,590
maybe three or four really cool well I'm

00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:40,420
glad I'm introducing this idea to you

00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:42,970
then if you're not familiar with it

00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:45,610
please please do go and check out the

00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:48,670
world of appreciative inquiry we tend to

00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:52,300
be problem solvers right so we look for

00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:55,750
problems to solve this means we focus

00:43:52,300 --> 00:44:01,440
much of our time and energy on problems

00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:01,440
and that magnifies their importance

00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:08,370
appreciative inquiry says let's work to

00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:11,080
discover the best of what is happening

00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:16,750
look at what is working and do more of

00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:22,780
that the next step is to dream imagine

00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:27,190
what could be possible then go ahead and

00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:32,020
design a future state that is compelling

00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:35,920
and desirable we design a desirable

00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:39,670
future together and then we figure out

00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:44,800
how to deploy or deliver or implement

00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:48,970
that future we've designed by focusing

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:52,470
our time and attention and energy on

00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:56,680
what's good on what we want

00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:59,200
perhaps we'll spend less despair spend

00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:03,880
less energy on things that can't be

00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:09,060
fixed let's look at what we can do what

00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:09,060
we could do let's plan to do it together

00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,530
the Dalai Lama Center for peace and

00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:17,580
education in Vancouver is using

00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:22,180
appreciative inquiry to facilitate

00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:26,920
compassionate communities I'd like to

00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:33,660
think we to here at Linux confer you are

00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:33,660
a compassionate community I think we are

00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:41,940
how wonderful it is that nobody need

00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:52,830
wait a single moment before starting to

00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:59,280
improve the world so who is watching we

00:45:52,830 --> 00:46:00,480
are all of us but we are not lawyers we

00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:05,730
are not spies

00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:10,290
we are not secret agents we are change

00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:14,880
agents and we can change the world some

00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:20,550
say we already have and why are we

00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:24,150
watching to learn how best to leave this

00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:26,360
place just a little better than we found

00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,360
it

00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:35,909
thank you

00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:35,909
