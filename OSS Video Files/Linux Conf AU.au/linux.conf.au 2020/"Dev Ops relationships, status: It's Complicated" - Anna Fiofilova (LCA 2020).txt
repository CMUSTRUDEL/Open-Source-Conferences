	00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,160
well hi everyone my name is Anna I'm a

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:17,100
software engineer and I work in real

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,380
estate that counter to you today I will

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,670
tell you if a very short story about

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:26,400
developers and ops relationships well

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,590
big warning sign here everything that

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,830
I'm going to say is based on my personal

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:35,399
experience in some names and details I

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,530
change for the purpose of this talk so I

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,219
start working in a team more than thirty

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,920
years ago and I'm around seven years

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,460
with my current company and back then we

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,640
didn't have the votes we had developers

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,420
we had ops people and there was a

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,360
supermassive black hole in the middle

00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:59,989
they were not friends those days I think

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,660
we were more like two different species

00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:06,510
and you know there were many things that

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,540
were setting us apart one of them is

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,880
that developers didn't have access to

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,810
production for the systems that they

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:19,710
were building so our continuous delivery

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:23,759
process look like this developers would

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:26,640
write some code throw it to QA QA would

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,939
tested on environment that was nothing

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,240
like production then we would package it

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:38,579
up and throw those packages down on Avvo

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:44,130
ops team to deploy and support well that

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:46,950
was our process and we call it agile our

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,740
ops team they were not very strong agile

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,159
believers they didn't really like this

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,700
package down approach but they were not

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,130
complaining

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,710
you know they were ops people they were

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,960
tough and you needed to be tough to be

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,540
an ops person back then you know you

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,860
needed to smoke a lot drink a lot you

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:12,069
stuff language maybe skip a few showers

00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:14,349
you know bit off another developer I

00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:17,079
very difficult relationship to that team

00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:21,010
I guess because we had different

00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:24,900
priorities my priority was to build more

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:27,760
stuff it was literally in my KPIs

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,909
my manager would even try to calculate

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,379
how many lines of code I was writing

00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:37,900
today but I always confuse her miss my

00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:41,079
refactoring you know to ends in ten

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:44,829
lines out at the end was very hard for

00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:47,739
her to calculate so my performance was

00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:51,040
tied to the number of bills and I was

00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:55,150
trying to build as much stuff as fast as

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:58,030
I possibly could but our ops team I

00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,699
think they just wanted to get a good

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,310
night's sleep

00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:06,010
they were conflicted priorities but you

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:09,370
know they were agile so we try to

00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:12,099
collaborate I will tell you how our

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:14,349
regular interactions would look like on

00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:17,889
any given day when they have a build

00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:20,319
ready I would go downstairs to the

00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:22,449
dungeon you know we used to keep our ops

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,479
people in the dungeon they don't really

00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:26,319
like sunlight I would find the random

00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:30,009
mobs person

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:33,819
what's named him Steve and I would say

00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:35,409
something like hey Steve why you haven't

00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:41,049
deployed the bill that I send you 10

00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:44,500
minutes ago he would say well hello nice

00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:47,049
to see you too I have no idea what are

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,389
you talking about and I would say well

00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:51,430
open your email and you will see that

00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:55,389
there is a piece of software attached to

00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:57,129
it I want you to deploy it well you know

00:03:55,389 --> 00:04:00,099
back in those days we didn't have the

00:03:57,129 --> 00:04:03,569
fancy CI told like built kite or bamboo

00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:07,419
so we were emailing each other packages

00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:09,519
so he would open his email and said well

00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:13,150
I clearly see there is a piece of

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:16,419
something but what changes are you

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,340
trying to deploy you know so I need to

00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:22,389
know what I am deploying like what's

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:24,940
inside your package what's inside you

00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:27,550
should never ask developer this question

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,410
what's inside the package it's like

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,460
asking a butcher what's inside the

00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:37,420
sausage you know it's good it's working

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:39,010
all it matters you know like all people

00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:43,950
can understand the complexity of

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:47,590
software please but he would deploy it

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:51,130
in the next day I would find out that he

00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:54,100
rolled back my belt so I needed to go to

00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,770
the dungeon again and I would not be so

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,830
friendly I would basically scream at him

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:04,720
like why you're all back my belt and he

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:08,440
would say well at 1 a.m. I received a

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,740
call from a very really from a very

00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:15,850
angry it's Helen and he was complaining

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:18,010
that application is not working so after

00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:21,010
I checked all the possible network

00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:24,220
issues I wrote back the way it is built

00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:30,880
and it came back to normal so I think

00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:32,560
that your code has a problem well my

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,970
company used to have the office back in

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,760
Italy and unlike Australians they were

00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:44,800
using very fast and modern browser at

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:48,070
that time called Internet Explorer and

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,620
ok I put a comma in the wrong place and

00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:53,710
my script was not working in Internet

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:56,440
Explorer because we never bothered to

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:59,820
test our changes in that browser so

00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,250
technically it was QAS fault

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:07,300
but we were a child

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:10,450
so we taught our ops team to test every

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:13,810
single built after they deployed in

00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:16,650
Internet Explorer you know you made a

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:20,980
mistake you learn from it

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:22,810
so years went by and culture started to

00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:27,190
change a little bit in my company I

00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:29,919
think it was four or five years ago when

00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:34,180
we pioneered a new fashion called

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,910
team managed infrastructure what it

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,320
meant that from then on every single

00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:40,720
development team

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:45,310
is also responsible for deploying and

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,440
supporting the applications our ops team

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:51,130
got so excited about it they even came

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:55,030
out of the dungeon they came to Atiamuri

00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:57,910
and said congratulations now guys you're

00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:00,730
the lucky owners of all the systems that

00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:03,370
you guys work on here is your production

00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:06,810
access and here is the phone to talk to

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:06,810
Italians ciao

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:13,720
well I wasn't excited about that change

00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,010
I guess I was happy to have a production

00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,930
access for a change

00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:18,690
but I didn't wanted to talk to angry

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,150
Italians in the middle of the night

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:24,250
back then I was working with legacy

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,700
financial systems that were running on

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:31,060
Windows but it was nightmare to support

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,900
them one of our services had such a

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:37,780
massive memory leak that our

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:41,380
recommendation to support it was to

00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:43,240
restart at every 12 hours well you know

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,620
it was easy call for developers to make

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:50,500
wasn't our job to do it plus as a

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:53,320
developer I was never countable for the

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:55,810
stuff that I built I mean if it turned

00:07:53,320 --> 00:08:00,070
out to be good I would take a credit for

00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:03,280
it but if there was a problem there were

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:07,420
always ops people to fix it anyways to

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,460
blame for it but I could not stop the

00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,990
progress the whole company was changing

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:17,890
so I had to join the after-hours pager

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:21,190
so what that package included first you

00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:25,510
need to carry your laptop 24/7 for one

00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:29,050
big second no trips outside of good

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:31,030
internet coverage zone third zero

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,780
alcohol because you are dealing with

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:39,760
financial systems and lots of sleepless

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:42,200
nights alcohol and smoking was my only

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,839
therapy back in those days

00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,600
they were helping me to deal with our

00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:50,649
financial systems and have an agile

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,649
process I was not ready to give it up

00:08:50,649 --> 00:08:58,279
even for one big though

00:08:54,649 --> 00:09:02,750
I realized that you know like my laptop

00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:03,949
doesn't have a breathalyzer but you know

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,579
I was a good citizen

00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:13,550
I needed to comply so fine I joined the

00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:16,190
pager well I was voluntold in my company

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:20,209
it meant you highly encouraged to

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:24,430
volunteer and I started my shift on

00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:28,610
Monday I got zero alerts

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:32,269
then came chill day I got zero alerts as

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,430
well I started to think wow that might

00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:39,290
be the easiest money that I will ever

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:43,490
earn in my life but then it came Ben's

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:46,490
day turned out Wednesday was the last

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,160
day of the month if he didn't these

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,740
financial systems especially the ones

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,720
that we have in my company it meant that

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,440
we need to bill and invoice our

00:09:53,720 --> 00:10:01,490
customers and I completely forgot about

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:05,110
it so on Wednesday night I received a

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:08,390
call from a friendly obscure son Steve

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:10,940
he said something like hey I hope you

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,250
enjoy your pager by the way it's the

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:19,000
last day of the month so make sure that

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:21,070
the bidding run runs successfully crap I

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,589
forgot about it

00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:28,370
at that moment I realized that I made a

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:32,540
big mistake I now need to babysit this

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:35,810
stupid billing run and it was stupid

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:38,630
because it's monitoring system well it

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:41,329
was a bit unconventional when I say

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:43,880
unconventional I mean it's not gonna

00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:48,139
alert you when something went wrong

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:50,329
duh it's gonna send you an email when

00:10:48,139 --> 00:10:52,060
it's successfully completed a certain

00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:56,980
stage of the process

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:59,590
so even when nothing went wrong you need

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,870
to stay awake for seven or eight hours

00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:05,500
in the night to make sure that the

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,540
process actually finished like who would

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:11,110
build such a stupid monitoring and

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:16,180
alerting system Wow

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:19,450
what technically that was me but you

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,040
know I had access to production I mean

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:25,390
like how should I know how the good

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:29,140
monitoring and alerting look like so

00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:32,110
there was a 10:00 p.m. in front of my

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:36,070
computer waiting for billing run through

00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:40,030
write me well I got a first email saying

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:43,420
something like I started great then I

00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:45,880
made myself a cup of tea in started to

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:50,470
think about all the bad decisions in my

00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:52,900
life that led me to that point but I

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:56,650
also started to feel some empathy for

00:11:52,900 --> 00:12:00,040
office people well they had to babysit

00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:06,610
this thing every single month like for

00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:09,070
years even on New Year's Eve well one

00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:11,110
and a half hours in I started to have a

00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:15,130
feeling you know like you have this bad

00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:19,570
intuition that I think something is

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:22,600
wrong well there was no easy way to

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:26,770
validate it there was no diagnostic and

00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:29,740
point nothing so I said ok I'll just

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:33,010
jump on the box so I connected to the

00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,960
windows box I opened a task manager like

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,670
trying to find the process that would

00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,400
indicate that it's coming from this

00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:44,560
billing run and it's running I found

00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:49,560
nothing Mike ok walks locks they should

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:52,270
be locked somewhere but as a developer I

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,390
realized I never actually bothered to

00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:58,080
lock anything I mean why should I I

00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:01,210
never had access to those locks anyway

00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:04,510
so they even an OK

00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:05,530
I thought Turing those box so there

00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,430
should be

00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:12,370
system locks somewhere and I found one

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:15,460
and there was a very weird error saying

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:20,110
something like invalid character in line

00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:22,750
three or six at that moment I just

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:25,000
panicked I like I have no idea what it

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,790
means I have no idea the processes

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,900
running or not like I exhausted all my

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:36,160
options I don't know what to do next so

00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:39,760
I called Steve he was very happy to

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,460
receive my call after midnight but I

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,130
think he knew he knew because it took

00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:49,000
him three seconds to diagnose the

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:53,080
problem he said it sounds like a Rob

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,980
Smith problem like what Rob Smith what

00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,250
are you talking about

00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,770
and he is like there is a customer Rob

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:03,070
Smith I think he happened to have a

00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:05,380
carriage return symbol in his name so

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,130
every month when his financial

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:11,290
transactions end up in our database

00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,610
being run fails because it doesn't know

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:17,080
how to deal with the carriage return

00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:19,630
symbol I was like what how often that

00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,580
happens if you know so much about it you

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,589
don't even know his name

00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:26,650
he's like oh every month apart from

00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:31,420
August he's probably only fat that time

00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:33,730
I was furious like one customer breaking

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:37,240
the whole billing run for five billion

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:39,760
dollar company every single month like

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,760
why you never told us about it you're

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,860
like I told you guys I told you multiple

00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,080
times you need to fix your validation

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,450
you need to make sure the data is

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,960
correct but you're very busy running

00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:55,630
around you know doing other stuff well

00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,360
it was too late to argue about that so I

00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:01,030
asked him fine I mean what should I do

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:05,050
now we need to invoice our customers

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:08,320
tomorrow he said oh connect to the

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:11,740
database find every single transaction

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,690
that Rob Smith made that month and

00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,610
remove a carrot written symbol from his

00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:19,400
name

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:22,640
so there it was right in sequel

00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:27,490
statement on our production database in

00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,490
the middle of the night unsupervised

00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:34,820
when I click the execute button I

00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:40,910
realized I should have probably back it

00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:43,790
up you know just in case well if my

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:47,660
script by accident would corrupt or

00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:49,970
remove our financial data you know I

00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,450
would be in a big trouble my company

00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:55,070
would be in big trouble but I didn't

00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,990
know any better you know it was my first

00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,470
time dealing with production issues I

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:03,430
was stressed was middle of the night

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:07,190
well luckily for me my script worked I

00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:09,350
restarted the process but I still needed

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:11,810
to stay awake till 7:00 a.m. the next

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:15,550
morning to make sure this bloody process

00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:19,070
finished so when I came back to work

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:24,040
next day I was very angry

00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:25,250
I was tired but I learned a few lessons

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,710
first

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:30,230
never ever signed up for a shift that

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,650
falls on the last day of the month if

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:36,350
you're dealing with financial systems

00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:40,130
second have some empathy for ops people

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:43,250
you know their job is very hard but

00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:46,010
honestly since that night my development

00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:49,250
practices changed a lot I started to

00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:52,790
think about monitoring logging alerting

00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:57,410
and documentation every system that I

00:16:52,790 --> 00:17:00,170
built after that I started with sl8 how

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,720
it should work how the system gonna tell

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:05,690
me when it's not working what should I

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,070
look what should i document and whom I

00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:11,630
should escalate when something goes

00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:14,420
wrong I think I was lucky that my whole

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,620
team jump on pager with me so it helped

00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:20,990
us to have a very productive

00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:24,920
conversations and we gave a very good

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:26,210
priority to support issues I think the

00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,730
whole company changed

00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:31,370
well we no longer keep up

00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,780
people in the dungeon now they enjoy the

00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:36,020
sunlight like rest of us

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:38,780
I think they act more like consultants

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,470
they help us to set up infrastructure in

00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,070
the clouds

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:46,549
answer tricky questions and keep an eye

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:48,860
on our ADA bias bill I cannot say that

00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:52,429
we lived happily ever after

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:55,700
but we go to the same pub and we drink

00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:58,490
the same beer so for every developer in

00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,520
the audience I encourage you to jump on

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,919
pager have this experience on another

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,950
side of the fence or at least spare

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:10,120
resorbs people when they deal in these

00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:13,970
production issues for every obscure s'en

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,890
have some empathy for developers they're

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,520
not making your life miserable on

00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,500
purpose

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:22,160
try to understand they delivery

00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:25,070
pressures well that is all that I

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,950
prepared for today I'm very keen on your

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:30,860
feedback so please deliver good one to

00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:33,679
