Even if you have the best content in the world, a bad information architecture (IA) leaves users feeling frustrated and confused. A good information architecture reduces support load, increases user empowerment and can even drive sales. But what is information architecture? How do you get from bad to good?

This session will explain the basics of information architecture, but then move onto a practical workshop where participants will explore some of the tools of IA: content inventory, card sorting, taxonomies, and user testing. Given an example help site, you'll get to pull it apart and put it back together again, bigger and better, using your brand new IA skills.

We'll finish with a review and a set of resources for you to take your information architecture skills further.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

next presenter Nicola Noi is going to be

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,120
presenting on information architecture

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:17,190
in a presentation title build it better

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:18,090
pleased to make Nicola feel welcome good

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,930
afternoon everybody

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,550
I hope there are a number of you in the

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,010
audience who've gone old school and have

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,019
brought a pen or two because the latter

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,050
half of this is actually a bit of a

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,430
workshop so I'm chief of staff at fast

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,899
mail although I was originally hired

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,610
there as a technical writer and

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,649
documentation is near and dear to my

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,649
heart as hopefully it is to all of you

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,600
otherwise you wouldn't be in this room

00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:44,340
we all know that users and their

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,230
internal teams have a better time of it

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,399
when there's good documentation for them

00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:52,770
to follow however good documentation is

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,890
not just about content it is also about

00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,170
how that content is structured so now

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,199
I've got a question for you how many

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,760
people here have ever used a wiki all

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,479
hands in the audience thank you very

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,939
much good how many people here have used

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,799
a wiki or on a wiki where the content

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:15,689
has mmm

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,610
let's politely call it a time fire which

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:20,820
is notoriously difficult they go out of

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,110
date very quickly and so hold that in

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,460
your brain while we go through this

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,650
process today information architecture

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,900
is about how you structure that totally

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,140
great content that you have and make it

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,240
worthwhile so I'm going to my definition

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,560
what information architecture is might

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,030
not be what you're thinking about so I'm

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,970
going to quickly go through what

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,299
information architecture is some tips on

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,520
how you go about building an information

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,960
architecture for your docks and some

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,020
ways that you can go about making sure

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,909
that they're good useful some pro tips

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,170
from what I've learnt from attempting to

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,399
apply it and some things that you should

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,810
not do for baby dragons then that we're

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,670
going to have a bit of a session where

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,640
I'm going to show you a terrible website

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,899
and you guys get the job of trying to

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,399
make it better and then we'll get

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:10,520
together at the end and share what we

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,520
know

00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:17,790
now mmm just in case it's not clear

00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:19,980
relying on search and FAQ is not a good

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:23,520
information architecture please don't do

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,230
that to yourselves or others so what is

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,910
it what you know information

00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,550
architecture it's a big big word it's

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,340
got lots of kind of overlaid meaning

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,030
from from maybe building and stuff it's

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,890
all about helping your users figure out

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,020
what they're looking at what else might

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,450
be useful for them what they might need

00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:46,290
to go and do next and even potentially

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,430
why are they even here if you think as

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,530
someone has once told me that

00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,540
information architecture is about how to

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,250
trap your users on your site for the

00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,950
longest time possible so they buy your

00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:01,950
stuff you should come to my talk on

00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:03,870
Thursday about practical ethics so what

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,580
is an information architect what does it

00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,980
look like who is an information

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,960
architect have you ever met anyone with

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:16,710
the title information architect Wow

00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:18,390
one person awesome the secret answer to

00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:21,870
these special sources the answer is you

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:25,110
everybody has input into information

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:27,060
architecture and so we all get to take

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,040
on this role but usually it falls into

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,320
the hands of people who are in charge of

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,880
documentation to turn that all those

00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,720
ideas into a reality

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,780
[Music]

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,450
so using information architecture when

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:46,560
you're building or or rebuilding a site

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:49,010
don't you into a superhero how does it

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,780
how does information architecture help

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:53,940
it makes your users happier and guess

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,860
what happier users like to recommend you

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,720
to your friends and their friends and

00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,550
their friends are friends and they give

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,160
you a repeat business and they give you

00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,470
very free advertising that makes

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,450
everybody happy it means that your

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,840
support team don't have to do all the

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:12,510
hard work of looking after your users it

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,180
means that your internal team are

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:20,580
agreeing on what vocabulary are you

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:24,330
going to use and documentation writers

00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:26,039
we are often quite low in the totem pole

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,900
we are the people brought in at the last

00:04:26,039 --> 00:04:29,729
minute to fix what they couldn't fix

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,590
earlier on in design what they didn't

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:35,360
pick out potentially if they even did

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:37,349
user testing if we are the the

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,960
documentation is the equivalent of I'll

00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:42,620
fix it in post it doesn't make sense I

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,479
will just write some dots to fill it up

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:48,150
but this then puts us in a very awkward

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,520
position when someone with authority

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,379
power or a higher pay grade comes along

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,419
and says no no no no that's not what I

00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,520
want it to look like you should do it

00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,599
like this

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,030
we're left sitting there going that's a

00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:01,650
terrible idea that's how you think with

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,020
your assumptions but it's not how our

00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:07,080
users think but how do I say no to this

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,629
person so I'm going the tools that we'll

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,400
go through today will help you have some

00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:15,469
ammunition to fire back against that

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:18,389
hippo the highest paid person's opinion

00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:20,190
to prove to them that what you're saying

00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:23,810
is not just your opinion versus their

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:26,129
opinion yours is backed up by science

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:29,819
so after this workshop this is what you

00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:32,479
were going to look like we're going to

00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:34,949
I'm going to tie into some librarian

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,840
information I am a part-time librarian

00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:39,599
you should be where I like shooting

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,580
things with laser guns you will have

00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:43,409
armor you'll be able to defeat the

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,590
dreaded FAQ you will have boots of

00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:48,870
efficiency I look forward to seeing you

00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,580
swish around the halls all right so how

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:53,099
do you build information architecture

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,229
there's five general steps you skip the

00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:56,699
first one if you don't already have some

00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,560
documentation that you're trying to fix

00:05:56,699 --> 00:06:01,650
and that is taken inventory of your

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,110
existing content but let's go through

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,639
all of this in more detail how do you go

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,819
actually go about inventorying your

00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,979
existing content and this is when the

00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:15,270
expertise of lovely librarians comes in

00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:16,680
they were already very good at dealing

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,419
with things that have got acronyms in

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,069
them and be figuring out from a large

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:22,889
pile of content what you need to get rid

00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:24,629
of because they look after books and

00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:27,000
books hang around for a really long time

00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:29,729
and you can't just delete them with a

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,310
link single line of code and it takes up

00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:34,860
physical space so they've got two

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,690
acronyms that they use and I would say

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,610
that they are also equally useful for

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:39,199
when you're figuring

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,659
what have you got in your existing pile

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,180
of content that needs to be re-examined

00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:48,439
or just plain removed so you've got

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:50,150
musty or you've got rot so you want to

00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,370
have a look at what you've got now what

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:53,780
needs to go what needs to be changed

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,639
what are you actually aiming for and

00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,319
then you can do a bit of a gap analysis

00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:03,129
and figure out what do you have that's

00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:05,750
left to right step 2

00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:07,610
what vocabulary you're going to use

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:10,430
anybody who's ever had an argument with

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:14,509
maybe the dev team or the marketing team

00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:16,789
on who's a user versus an account versus

00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:18,650
a customer will discover that terms get

00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:20,900
overloaded very quickly and what someone

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,610
what may be sales is talking about as

00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,639
being a customer is not what everybody

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,979
else thought was a customer so you want

00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,779
to have common terminology and you want

00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:31,699
to start that terminology in terms that

00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:34,969
the user understands not what the

00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:37,219
internal team understands because

00:07:34,969 --> 00:07:38,719
otherwise your internal code will not

00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:41,419
match what's on the website and it won't

00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:42,889
match what's in your Doc's what are your

00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:46,550
users expecting your site to be

00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:49,250
structured like if you've got a shopping

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,409
website now is maybe not the time to go

00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,900
off the reservation and decide that tree

00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:55,310
structures are not your thing

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,099
users have got this concept of cognitive

00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,659
load if they are having to work harder

00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,009
to figure it out what it is that you're

00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:07,759
trying to tell them they're gonna turn

00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:08,689
away and go to your competitors once

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,069
you've figured out what your overall

00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:11,839
sort of structure is going to look like

00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:13,759
what your vocab is going to be then you

00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,199
want to take the information segments

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,879
that you have now although you think you

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,139
want to build and chunk them into diet

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,330
digestible bits this can often help you

00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,949
discover that once you've checked your

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,039
addition your current content into bits

00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:29,990
you've maybe got orphans or just giant

00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,939
gaps that are left over so it can be

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,740
very helpful to figure out what relates

00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:36,820
to what and what shouldn't be there at

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,820
all and what's missing

00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,339
I like to diagram the structure in

00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,950
visual aid helps you and your customers

00:08:46,339 --> 00:08:51,050
figure out when they go down a link are

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,029
they expecting to maybe hit a leaf node

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,320
or are they expecting to end up in the

00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,149
center of a flower which is going to

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,370
explode with additional bits of

00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:00,620
information you think about a shopping

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,149
tree site versus Wikipedia and you think

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,500
about your mental map of how all the

00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:07,160
pages are laid out they're very

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:09,529
different you want to think about how

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,470
deep your intended structure is going to

00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:14,480
go versus how wide most people don't

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,279
like clicking more than maybe three

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,230
levels deep if your structures got

00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:20,690
something but all the content is buried

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:22,670
12 layers deep probably a sign that your

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,709
architecture needs to be reworked and

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,270
you can do this you know with technical

00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:30,980
tools or you can sit down with a piece

00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:32,240
of paper and a pen so you've got your

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,560
structure and you've examined and you

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,600
think you know where everything's going

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:40,660
to go you want to validate that thing

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,339
much like Alec was renting his

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:46,940
documentation earlier we need to check

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:48,560
that what we've got is also legit but

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,120
we've got all a bunch of biases so you

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,260
need to go out and find other people and

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,390
hopefully they're the kind of people

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,190
that you're planning on accessing this

00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,990
content so that you know they're coming

00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,490
in with their experience level and their

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,920
context and they can figure out what

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:05,240
they're doing and so we've got a bunch

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:07,279
of tools that we can use card sorting is

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,020
the most commonly one used one and we've

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,790
got closed and open card sorting and

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,790
you'll get to have a chance at this in a

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,560
minute and tree twisting and all of it

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:18,170
is about sitting there and asking your

00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,060
users if they had this website fully

00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,890
formed before them could they find the

00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,620
information that they're looking for in

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:26,959
an easy way and you can use this to

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,459
figure out hmm everybody fell over

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,490
trying to find out where to put the frog

00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:33,560
nets well maybe we need to reword that

00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:37,880
get better vocabulary put a different

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,500
site structure on there it's it's a way

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,180
of validating than what you think you

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:49,940
are going to build is the best of all

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:51,380
possible things because out of that

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,560
testing you've got to go back and rework

00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:57,399
it all over again

00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:59,110
all right pro tips when you have got a

00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:00,189
user tester and you're sitting there and

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,509
you're showing them your site

00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:03,629
architecture and you're asking them

00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:07,990
questions or asking them to do tasks

00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:09,579
don't influence them it can be really

00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,180
helpful to read up on what it is to be a

00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:14,829
coach so instead of saying to someone

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,410
that's really weird nobody's ever put

00:11:14,829 --> 00:11:19,509
that card over there before which will

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,759
make them rethink their life choices you

00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:24,509
want to say interesting tell me more

00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:26,949
about why you chose to put that there

00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:28,360
you want to vary your demographics just

00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:29,649
as you've got different kinds of users

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,149
of your product you want to have

00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:34,120
different kinds of users into your user

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:36,910
testing you want to go about finding

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,790
testers in different locations and this

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:42,339
can seem really daunting I mean you use

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,600
marketing budget to find actual users

00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:45,850
who are going to pay but how do you

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,379
often don't have marketing budget to

00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,629
have people come and test your

00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:51,220
documentation companies get a bit

00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:53,439
freaked out about that

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,899
finally find the meetups find them in

00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:57,790
co-working spaces go out to where you

00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,920
would normally find your users and offer

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:02,199
them something in order to come in and

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,910
test and given that hopefully you're

00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:05,230
accessing a pool of people who are

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:09,279
interested in your product you could

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:13,029
even bribe them with free products there

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,980
are no wrong answers the goal here and

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:16,480
you need to tell your testers this the

00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,279
goal here is not that you are testing

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,050
your testers to see whether they can run

00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,309
through the maze appropriately the goal

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:25,120
is to test whether your site

00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:26,410
architecture meets the users needs so in

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,629
that case it's totally appropriate to

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,100
have them say I don't know you've asked

00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:31,720
me to do this task and I don't know how

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,639
to achieve it that is not their failure

00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,730
that is our failure in our information

00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:38,709
architecture don't have more than one

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,920
tester at a time they'll influence one

00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:44,709
another if you complete a round of

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,350
testing and everybody's given you

00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:50,110
different answers there's no common

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,850
patterns also a sign that maybe you're

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,040
safe architecture needs to be reworked

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,120
because nobody's got sort of common

00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,179
models in their head on what they're

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,980
doing equally don't keep doing it over

00:12:58,179 --> 00:13:01,839
and over until you finally get a

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,809
glorious synergy and everybody is

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,850
picking the same thing people aren't

00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:13,959
like that about 50

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:17,289
grounds is enough don't just ask your

00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:19,059
mom to come and fill it out unless your

00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:20,619
target demographic is mothers of

00:13:19,059 --> 00:13:22,299
technical writers which seems very

00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:24,249
narrow as a product selection but I

00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:28,600
don't know don't ask Scotty from

00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:30,279
marketing unless you want someone from

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,499
marketing I'm not sure

00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:34,479
don't use your current team we already

00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:35,139
know too much unless they're brand new

00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:40,389
to the job

00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:41,949
in which case a plus now this is all

00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:43,329
about bandwidth when you're watching

00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:45,100
someone go through and doing your user

00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:47,350
testing the most useful thing you can do

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,899
it is do it in person you get their body

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:51,489
language you get comm you get to see

00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:53,229
that they might sit there and go I'm

00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:54,369
gonna put the card over here and then I

00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:57,850
changed my mind

00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:59,589
and as you shrink down like you can get

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,319
paid testers online who will do things

00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:03,789
for you over Skype that's great but you

00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:05,919
know you only kind of see half of their

00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:07,119
body you can get people to fill out

00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,649
surveys you can give them their

00:14:07,119 --> 00:14:10,239
information architecture and ask them to

00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:12,489
complete some tasks and all the rest of

00:14:10,239 --> 00:14:15,909
it and then write them in on write them

00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:16,989
back to you with some answers then

00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:18,129
you're missing all the body language

00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,419
you're missing all the verbal cues

00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,949
you're missing whether they found it

00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:22,539
exciting and interesting or whether they

00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:24,339
were bored and did it over dinner and

00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:25,689
weren't really paying attention so

00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:28,179
ideally you want to do this in person

00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:30,399
but be aware there are other ways to do

00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:33,970
it just it's less bandwidth you're

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,279
getting less results back all right

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,959
superheroes it's your turn I'm gonna

00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,739
give you a terrible website and then I'm

00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:42,999
gonna divide you into four groups and

00:14:40,739 --> 00:14:44,339
you're gonna do some card sorting and

00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:48,669
it's going to be awesome

00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:52,539
so before I reorganize the room I'll

00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:54,369
just give you some context I went to

00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:55,539
Twitter when preparing this talk and I

00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:59,799
asked Twitter what is the most annoying

00:14:55,539 --> 00:15:01,629
website you've ever used the delightful

00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,159
Kathy Reid who's talking about her

00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:05,199
breast sense project later in the week

00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:07,179
you should all go and see it she said

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,529
this was far and away the winner and

00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:10,419
after having looked at it I almost

00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:12,100
didn't use it because it was so bad I

00:15:10,419 --> 00:15:13,389
couldn't come up with anything that was

00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:16,089
going to be sensible for this thing but

00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:19,379
now I am so is anybody like a lifelong

00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:19,379
lover of element14

00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,950
last time I did this a whole bunch of

00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:27,990
people said yes all right

00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:29,550
so element 14 it's a website that is all

00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,530
things to all people who are into

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:33,150
electronics and micro components and

00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,460
things like raspberry PI's and Arduino

00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,390
it's got a discussion board it's got a

00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,460
shop

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:41,310
it's got tutorials it's got webinars

00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,690
it's got videos it's everywhere they've

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,220
got about three different kinds of

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:51,180
navigation depending on where you are

00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:52,530
and it's it made me sad so we're not

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,030
gonna do the whole five steps because

00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,310
this is only a 40-minute tutorial and

00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,270
even if I talk really fast we're not

00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:59,100
gonna have enough time anyway because

00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:02,130
there's more of you that turned up than

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,690
I was expecting so we're just going to

00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,400
follow it focus on the hierarchy and the

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,690
discoverability because in my view that

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,210
was the number one thing that would make

00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:11,100
this website much easier to use they the

00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,480
ability to find what you're looking for

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,490
and once you're there figure out what

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,010
else was useful so we're going to do

00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:19,020
some card sorting open and close card

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:24,620
sorting if we get time we'll do some

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:27,870
tree testing so card sorting is where

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,190
that you've got a bunch of headings here

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,440
we go a bunch of headings imagine that

00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:35,940
blue bar up there is the headings and

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,450
I've got a number of topics and you need

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,220
to sort them into the right heading

00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,990
that's close cards holding open card

00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,000
sorting is where I don't give you those

00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,680
headings you've still got the same set

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,050
of topics and I want you to come up what

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,480
you think we've would be useful headings

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:53,130
for the topics that I've given you now

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,410
I've only done a subset of this site

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:59,220
because this site is humongous and it's

00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:00,450
got thousand and one things but and then

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,240
what we're going to do after you guys

00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:05,220
have sorted I'll have two groups sorting

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,740
clothes two groups sorting open then we

00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:11,520
can compare and contrast and admire the

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,020
horror so I need two groups on this side

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,290
and two groups on this side since we

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,760
have one two three six seven tables I

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:19,950
would say that you know three to four

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,420
rows should form the front group three

00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,670
to three to four rows form the back

00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,630
group and same on this side and huddle

00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:27,320
around because you're going to need to

00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,320
look at some cards

00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:59,769
all right if you're on they write your

00:23:57,339 --> 00:24:02,039
own headings now's a good time to start

00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:02,039
writing

00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:38,720
oK we've got the clothes swapping with

00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,309
clothes the open swapping with open sea

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,690
whatever other people did feel free

00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:44,059
actually at this point to move around

00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,040
the room and see what some of the

00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:47,870
headings were that the other groups came

00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:52,309
up with and the different kinds of

00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:53,419
grouping I'll let you wander around for

00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:57,820
a couple of minutes and then we'll

00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:57,820
reassemble like Voltron

00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:43,929
alright once you've had a look at what

00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:43,929
everybody else has done find a seat and

00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:49,899
then we'll have some time for some more

00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:49,899
audience participation

00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:11,770
this is where I feel like we needed some

00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:15,070
sort of backing track the music possibly

00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:28,809
Benny Hill style music you were all

00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:31,090
thinking it so it's something that you

00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:33,220
may or may not have noticed was that the

00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:35,500
people who had a closed sort so when I

00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,240
gave you already the headings you

00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,160
finished putting things into bucket much

00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,320
faster than the people who had an open

00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,410
sort because thinking about things is

00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,630
hard and that's why we do this you will

00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:48,940
also notice having swapped tables that

00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,830
even though you know I told you only

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:56,590
ever do user testing in groups of one

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:58,000
and we had groups of 500 this group came

00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,710
up with different sorting - that group

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,420
came up with different like everybody's

00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:03,730
one was different and this goes to show

00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,770
you just within this room of very smart

00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:07,720
intelligent people who maybe don't even

00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,890
know what an Arduino is we still come up

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,920
with different categories and this is

00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:14,620
what your users are gonna do so I'm

00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,150
gonna take I'm interested in hearing

00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:18,400
from you what did you find

00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,960
easy what did you find hard if you were

00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,110
running this for yourself with other

00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,820
user testers what would be tips to your

00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:28,350
future self if you were going to ever do

00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,350
this again because it's awesome

00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:03,800
yeah thank you so when you if you're

00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,950
starting at the very beginning of this

00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,660
process having an open model means that

00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,280
you get much better ideas and what your

00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,680
top-level categories can be and as

00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,660
you've seen from this this interesting

00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,880
website their top-level category choices

00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:20,390
are actually very misleading not very

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,850
clear and hard to sort stuff normally if

00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,290
if I had a really good taxonomy and I

00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:26,240
was confident in it and it was using

00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:28,190
language that maybe already existed in

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,840
the world then I would then I would you

00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,610
just stick with a closed sword because

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,680
it's faster and less cognitive load for

00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:35,480
your users if you're at the very opening

00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,430
end of your process though and you want

00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,560
to sit there and and maybe overhaul some

00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:41,360
of your language then you absolutely go

00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,400
with an open sort and then you can also

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,140
do a mixed one and say here are some

00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,510
categories you can use here's some

00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:49,040
blanks fill in the blanks or you know

00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,810
which ones do do you think that we don't

00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,990
need at all and get rid of them and

00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:56,030
that's why if you're doing doing this

00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:58,340
sort of thing in person you can actually

00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,840
explore further with the user based on

00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:03,020
how they're reacting to what you've

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:09,530
presented them what did anybody else

00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:13,910
notice yes Katie you mean naming things

00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:16,220
is hard who would have thought yes the

00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:18,320
titles were not very clear and hopefully

00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,150
you know this user feedback if I was

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,650
actually doing this for element 14 for

00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:24,440
real then I would be sitting there and

00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:26,660
saying what did you not understand why

00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,700
is this not clear what what else would

00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:34,870
you be suggesting that we title this out

00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:34,870
anymore yes

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,110
yes

00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:07,730
so understanding who your user is and

00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,800
who you're trying to sell things to is

00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:11,960
very important and it will actually

00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,370
affect the hierarchy that you're trying

00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,810
to build I mean there's obviously

00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:18,500
there's a whole bunch of factors that go

00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:19,850
into building a good ia and they're

00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,770
actually the same set of factors that

00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,360
you always consider when writing content

00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,560
you know who are your users what do you

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,970
what are they trying to achieve when

00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,920
they are looking at this content whether

00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:30,380
it's microcopy or help files on a

00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,910
website or a printed brochure you're

00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:33,410
still answering the same questions and

00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:36,320
you need to understand it before you go

00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:37,760
diving into your ia and that is one of

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,370
the biggest things that I struggle with

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,800
element14 is that some people are just

00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:44,450
going to use it to go and buy hardware

00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,190
other people are really invested into

00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,390
the community aspect and there and make

00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,950
friends and they're talking about their

00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:50,990
projects and you know what are they

00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,520
going to do next and there's webinars

00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:54,860
and the Ben Heck show which actually Pat

00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,910
hasn't been produced for two years like

00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:59,150
they've got all this additional content

00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:01,400
that's been generated by either paid for

00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,750
or by contributors and that's going in

00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,920
there and it's sort of all things to all

00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:08,780
people and that's why I think that some

00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:13,190
of this tasks really struggles because

00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:14,510
it doesn't know who its user is I'd love

00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,890
to talk to you more about this I've

00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:17,720
actually got a bunch of tree testing

00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,920
tasks that you can do afterwards so if

00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,930
you want to come find me in the hallway

00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,870
track then I'm happy to talk to you some

00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:25,070
more with the terrible element14 but

00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:27,350
we're running out of time so here's some

00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,450
additional resources this slides will be

00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:32,630
available on the internets so that you

00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:34,100
can click on them there are online tools

00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:35,840
that will let you do card sorting and

00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:39,590
tree jacking so that you get tree

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,060
checking tree testing so that you can do

00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:43,070
them online without having to do have

00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,390
bits of card around there's lots of

00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,070
websites that talk about information

00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,250
architecture it is not new

00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:50,030
it's been around since the 70s people

00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,680
were thinking about information

00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,600
architecture and how you structure at

00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,300
long before well the internet was even a

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:58,010
thing there is the right to dock slack

00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,460
there's a bunch of books written about

00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,980
it

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:03,560
Donna Spencer's guide I found invaluable

00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,730
and she actually helps run UX Australia

00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,110
so if you want to find out more about

00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:10,460
that that would be a conference you can

00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:13,460
go and check out today Joe actually put

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:16,730
me on the path of I a few years ago at

00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:18,350
another LCA anyway I hope you found

00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:20,600
today interesting I hope you'll go away

00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,100
thinking about information architecture

00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,540
and understanding the challenges it is

00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,070
to get it right

00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:26,470
and the ways that you could maybe use

00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,370
these tools to improve your existing

00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:30,140
documentation you know whether it's for

00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:32,060
internal wiki it's still valuable for

00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:35,900
doing it as well as for external

00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:38,150
customers any general questions do I

00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:39,920
have two seconds for that lawyer you've

00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,660
probably already asked them we have a

00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,460
minute or two for maybe one or two

00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:57,170
questions if anyone has anything else

00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:59,590
they'd like to ask thank you very much

00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:04,190
for that I was actually really liking

00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:06,590
one question I guess is how far up do

00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,610
you because they're creating headings or

00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,650
doing things like that it's about

00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:14,150
creating levels of obscurity up from

00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:15,380
content and you never know where the

00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,440
next manager is going to take this

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:22,790
project so you never know how to kind of

00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:25,510
how far up do you create your headings

00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:28,550
do you have any suggestions or ideas or

00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:31,790
all about what you've only got right now

00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:33,200
and worry about that later like if you

00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:35,660
you know if you know that something is

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,280
coming maybe if you know that there's a

00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,080
new project in the works that's going to

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,310
add a new product or a new tool into

00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,080
your suite then you might sit there and

00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:43,760
and do a little bit of planning in

00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:45,320
advance of that but mostly I'd be guided

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,430
by your users like if you come up with a

00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:53,630
good information architecture so long as

00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:55,220
your overall content is similarly along

00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:56,930
the same lines like if I sit there and

00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,820
I've got a cake shop and I'm producing

00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:59,589
cake shop content and I decide that I'm

00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,239
gonna sell cake

00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:03,999
teens along with my cake shop content

00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:05,950
that's okay if I suddenly start to sell

00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:08,710
cars it's not going to fit into that

00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,969
information architecture yeah so you

00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,769
know if you know you've got a new

00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:12,940
project coming or you don't know but you

00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:15,039
know you've got to do the best you can

00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:17,079
and you know something that was in the

00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,640
earlier slide is revised like it's okay

00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:20,529
to go back and say this is no longer

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,029
working for us we need to rerun through

00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:23,979
those five steps figure out what we've

00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:25,539
got where are our gaps and do it again

00:36:23,979 --> 00:36:27,519
and you know hopefully as you iterate

00:36:25,539 --> 00:36:32,410
over it over a course of years it'll get

00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:36,430
faster and easier good thank you all

00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:40,869
right okay I'm any other questions

00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:44,700
before we wrap great no I'm very good

00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:44,700
