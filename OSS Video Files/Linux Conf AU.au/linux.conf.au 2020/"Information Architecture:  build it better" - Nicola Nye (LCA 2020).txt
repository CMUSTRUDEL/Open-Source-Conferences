Even if you have the best content in the world, a bad information architecture (IA) leaves users feeling frustrated and confused. A good information architecture reduces support load, increases user empowerment and can even drive sales. But what is information architecture? How do you get from bad to good?

This session will explain the basics of information architecture, but then move onto a practical workshop where participants will explore some of the tools of IA: content inventory, card sorting, taxonomies, and user testing. Given an example help site, you'll get to pull it apart and put it back together again, bigger and better, using your brand new IA skills.

We'll finish with a review and a set of resources for you to take your information architecture skills further.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
