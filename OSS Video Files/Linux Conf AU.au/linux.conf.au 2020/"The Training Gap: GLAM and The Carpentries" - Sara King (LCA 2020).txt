As digital collections continue to grow, the appetite to use them in different ways is also growing. However, the speed with which this growth is happening is also leaving some of us behind. There is a skills gap in GLAM and the researchers most likely to make use of these digital collections. At AARNet we are working with our GLAM and HASS colleagues to bridge this gap with training sessions and freely available learning materials made with them in mind. Working with the Carpentries model of teaching foundational computing skills to researchers, we are creating resources that we hope will encourage those with low (or no) computing or data science skills to take the first step. Working alongside Tinker (the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences Data Enhanced Virtual Laboratory) we are encouraging new users, such as librarians, to learn how to use Jupyter Notebooks. In this paper I will introduce SWAN, the new environment for Jupyter Notebooks, and the range of training resources and methods being used to help uplift the community's digital dexterity, encouraging curiosity and confidence along the way.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,759
zoom today so if you were excited that

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,140
she was going to be talking just being

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,640
excited but just be aware that she's

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:38,579
going to be zooming in she won't be here

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:43,979
in physical form what else do I have to

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:47,250
say oh yeah yeah um all of our speakers

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:50,720
today women so that's really cool so we

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,720
just wanted to make you aware of that

00:01:51,170 --> 00:02:01,950
[Applause]

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:04,860
okay so our first speaker is Sarah king

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,030
she's an e research analyst with

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,920
Australia's academic and research

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,900
network provider on it

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:15,030
she's also I believe a an archivist in a

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,650
previous life previous life yeah um

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,980
she's got extensive experience in

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,440
engaging in engaging in engagement and

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,290
training with expertise in research data

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,580
technologies in humanities and social

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,640
science yes and she was part of the

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,650
tinkerer virtual lab which used to be

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,860
called and has devil but then they

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,390
decided that was a scary name and she's

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,810
gonna tell us all about what she does it

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:51,660
on it and how they support glands so

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:52,440
please make Sarah welcome thanks

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,380
everyone

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,799
so here we go my name is Sarah and I

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,630
work at on it a lot of people haven't

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:02,040
heard about it before so I will go

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,530
through it just a little bit about what

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,079
that's about but just to give you a

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,910
background about me I come from a

00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:11,489
background in research and various roles

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,049
in libraries and archives I'm a little

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:16,440
bit nervous talking at a tech conference

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:20,760
I'm very new to this world so forgive me

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,440
if I'm a little shaky but I'd spent

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,380
nearly a decade at the National Archives

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,329
of Australia before moving out into this

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,340
world and I guess I heard an expression

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:31,170
a little while ago that it was some tech

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,209
curious and I think that kind of

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,100
describes me so I don't have a

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:36,510
technological background but I found

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,150
myself in as well because I'm really

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,829
excited about it so after National

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,760
Archives and a bunch of different roles

00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,530
which I really loved

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,569
I went to work for the house devil which

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,010
sounded pretty interesting and exciting

00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:49,109
and it was and I had a really good time

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,599
with that unfortunately that's just now

00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:53,670
finished off but that was the humanities

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,560
arts and social sciences data enhanced

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,470
virtual lab and it was about trying to

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:01,739
pull together some tools and some

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:05,579
methods for Humanities Arts and Social

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,780
Sciences researchers into a particular

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,110
space on

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,180
to kind of break down some barriers and

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,310
I think that's really the philosophy of

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:18,060
what I'm doing in my work it's breaking

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:20,519
down barriers I see myself as a kind of

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,590
translator or a communicator and I want

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,330
to join up these wonderful technologies

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,150
with people who maybe don't see

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:28,919
themselves as tech people so I want to

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:33,440
be that glue in the middle so I'm

00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:36,060
focused on it on all sorry or just go

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,910
hmmm I'm just gonna have to figure out

00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,450
how to see my notes sorry so I'm focused

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:46,860
on hash and glam outreach from the

00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:49,230
Arnott position and I think that's going

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,510
to be really exciting coming into the

00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,520
future because there's a lot of activity

00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:56,100
around in this area but it's not a

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,979
traditional area for our net so it's

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,870
brand-new for us in some senses what

00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:04,530
we're doing but there is actually quite

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,700
a long backbone of support for gland so

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:10,020
I'm going to talk about what we've been

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:12,660
doing in terms of that they talk a lot

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,880
about the pipes arnett which is the

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,660
actual physical network so it's our main

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,940
business is connecting our institutions

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,400
so there's a bit of that around that has

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:28,470
kind of incidentally I guess supported

00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,880
all of these research areas okay sorry

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,010
what we were going to be talking about

00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,900
today a little bit of Arnott and who we

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:36,450
are and then I'll go through what we do

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,370
with glam and then specifically talk

00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,890
about training methods and resources

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,570
which is really my one of the focus

00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,660
areas that I have is trying to

00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:48,060
communicate out some of this technology

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,280
and how to use it to non-technical

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,620
people and then if I'm feeling brave

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,070
enough we'll do a bit of a demo live

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:58,350
demo so we get a given us of stack of

00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,360
slides as part of the this is what you

00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,700
do when you do a presentation with on it

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,470
and I've seen this slide a lot and I

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,560
never really tweaked until I went to a

00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:10,020
different conference where someone used

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,550
this that is actually the fiber so that

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,770
I just thought oh that's pretty lights

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,849
so that's the kind of my connection with

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,409
the world I think talking about the

00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:18,120
priming and stuff from the thing this

00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,770
morning I was like oh this is so true

00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,320
because you your expertise is so

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,670
important

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,920
so a lot of us would look at that and go

00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,590
our nice lights but and on it that's

00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,240
actually the the departs that's what we

00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:31,240
do so we've put together all of these

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,680
beautiful glass cable things and off

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,960
they go and they make the internet and

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,820
all that so on it stands for Australia's

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,000
academic research network it's a

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,010
nonprofit organization that is supported

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,020
by all of the universities most research

00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:46,990
institutions now lots of hospitals

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,780
schools and Glam there are all our

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,360
members and we put them together using

00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:54,610
this great network it's super fast very

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,320
efficient very very cool apparently it's

00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:59,530
what the NBN would love to be but it's

00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,690
never going to happen so that that

00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,730
network is huge and it is really

00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,770
important in terms of providing a very

00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:08,740
very high quality dependable service for

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:11,860
research but we know in Glam that

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,260
researchers are also wanting to have

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,510
contact with the institutions that hold

00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,370
a lot of the Glam data so my interest is

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,250
in how the researchers and the

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:24,700
universities connect up with the glamour

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:27,190
institutions so yeah there's a lot of

00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,870
talk about plumbing pipes engineers

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,460
people would go around digging holes I

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:33,070
work in that company but that's

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,840
definitely not my expertise I'm

00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,430
perfectly happy at the end of the talk

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,650
to put you in contact with people who

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,940
know all those things but one of the

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:41,380
most interesting things that come about

00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,810
and the time that I've been in on it

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,490
which is just a few months is something

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,110
called the indigo cable I'm not sure if

00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,450
you guys have heard of that but

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:52,180
basically they have laid these huge

00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:55,060
cables between Sydney and Perth under

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:59,500
the sea and then from Perth to Singapore

00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:02,500
so now Australia has a network that can

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:05,710
achieve forty nine point eight gigabits

00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:08,500
per second sustained throughput between

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:11,260
Australia and Europe for research data

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:14,470
transfers so they've tested that and we

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:16,390
can get Sydney to London at about 50

00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:18,310
gigabits per second so that's the kind

00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,290
of network that we're talking about if

00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:23,590
you guys understand gigabit per second

00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:26,290
which I didn't until not long ago so

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:28,600
what we put out into the world is this

00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:31,510
high-speed network for universities we

00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:33,729
have a cloud environment called cloud

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,690
store which I'll go into a little bit

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:36,070
more that's

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,260
our net developed in the supported

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,960
service and that is for all of our

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,990
customers and the wider community and

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,900
basically what it is is sink share and

00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,690
store service but within that we've got

00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:52,030
a whole lot of other options like only

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:56,830
office which is that only open source

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:59,620
office suite so basically I knew about

00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,030
Google stuff you know the collaborative

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,830
editing and all of that well this is the

00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,590
non Google version of that if you're

00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:08,410
interested in it we've also got Jupiter

00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,990
lab for Jupiter notebooks we provide

00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,250
zoom if any of you who have used

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:15,820
videoconferencing before that was most

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,860
likely going through on it and we also

00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,050
provide specialist data movement

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,000
solutions and expertise and will I'll

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,430
talk a little bit about that but if you

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,290
have enormous enormous amounts of data

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:27,850
there are other ways to get around

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,700
moving it around and we've got some

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,440
experts who can help you with that so

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,060
hopefully you're all a little glam

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,770
sensitive and you'll appreciate my

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,150
historic photos oh it's good going

00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,770
through the slides I do you have the

00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:43,210
references for them but that's a reading

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:47,230
room in Port Adelaide so what we're

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:50,830
doing at the moment for glam in honor is

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:52,210
quite diverse and go through a few of

00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,670
the different projects that were working

00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,830
on but one of the first things I thought

00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:00,250
I didn't know and I found out because of

00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:03,400
this design how glam members are as

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:06,420
follows which is I think a fairly broad

00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,530
and good representation of a lot of glam

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:11,680
institutions in Australia so they're

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:13,540
currently on our network except maybe

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,390
niña I think there might be some changes

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,770
going on there so if you work does

00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:23,290
anyone here work for any of those

00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:25,870
organisations well if you work with

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,790
anyone who does they may not even

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,500
realize that they're on our net because

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,810
I work for national archives for 10

00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,120
years and I had no idea it's just called

00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:37,779
that internet right yeah

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,209
so what it means though is that they

00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:42,490
have access to some pretty great kit and

00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,559
they probably don't know about it and so

00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,420
I think one of the things that my job is

00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,980
to do is to go around and talk to people

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,499
about what they've got them how they can

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:53,079
access it so for example I would ever

00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:54,639
asked at you do you know about it and do

00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:56,139
you use cloud store and can you tell me

00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,639
anything about your experience if you'd

00:10:56,139 --> 00:10:59,860
work there but none of you do so we

00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,949
won't do that but there that's kind of

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,379
the relationships I suppose that we have

00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:07,629
this is a picture of people fishing for

00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:11,800
trout and that's Sydney University of

00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:12,930
the back so in our projects we're

00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,569
working with a range of different

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:18,970
university libraries and other

00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:21,459
institutions so for some digitization

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,439
and data curation projects we've got a

00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:27,100
project ongoing that's a four year

00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:28,660
project with Anu tinker has been part of

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,670
that our net and landscape for a couple

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,889
of years and I'll talk about that we're

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,769
working with a group called IMAX at uni

00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:38,230
of Newcastle then there's the globe labs

00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:39,579
Network which is very new in Australia

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,889
and we'll talk a little bit about that

00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:44,079
in terms of digital preservations

00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:45,970
there's a group called I was preserves

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,279
coming out of uni of Melbourne and we're

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,079
on board with them there's some really

00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:51,790
interesting stuff going on in video game

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,160
preservation and our Nets joined a

00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:58,209
couple of projects there as well as some

00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,509
digital preservation ideas coming out of

00:11:58,209 --> 00:12:03,309
uni of Sydney anyone remember those card

00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:04,209
files that's how we used to do things

00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:07,449
this isn't it

00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:10,779
so digitization and data curation this

00:12:07,449 --> 00:12:12,550
is a big deal in glam I think

00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:14,350
digitization people have been furiously

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,339
digitizing for years and years and years

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,899
and years and found out they're never

00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:19,660
gonna get anywhere it's still gonna take

00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:24,189
seven hundred years to get it done data

00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:28,389
curation I am pretty sure that anyone

00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:30,100
doing has mmm anyone working with data

00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:32,230
actually spends probably I think there's

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:34,120
Studies 60 to 80 percent of their time

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,749
just wrangling the data you see got

00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:39,490
really really accomplished very creative

00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:41,470
researchers who should be working on

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,299
actual questions and projects he spent a

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,920
lot of time in the depths of working in

00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:46,509
data curation so we're working on some

00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,950
projects to try and speed that up and

00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:50,410
try and create some workflows

00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,690
try and just get that all a little bit

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:55,089
more sorted for people so one of the

00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:57,040
projects that we're doing is called the

00:12:55,089 --> 00:13:01,060
Sydney stock exchange project and that's

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,100
us with the University of sorry the

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,490
Australian National University they have

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,410
a huge pile of Sydney stock exchange and

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:12,190
share lists about 50 years worth of

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:13,810
stuff they have pages hand filled in if

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:17,260
you can see there that's an example of

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:19,680
one of the pages morning a night of the

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:22,690
Sydney ex-jock exchange for 50 years

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,550
they're in the process of digitizing and

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,680
trying to make that incredible resource

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,230
available to people but it's a

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,940
complicated digitization process right

00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,100
because you've got structured data in

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,110
there but you've also got handwriting

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:38,170
it's also a really large amount of stuff

00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:42,370
so it's a hundred and ninety-nine large

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:43,990
format bound volumes of pages that are

00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:46,510
posted up sorry three times a day to

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:51,630
show those stock prices so pre printed

00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:55,000
sheets it's 70,000 high-res pages of

00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,649
digitized material now they had a lot of

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,899
problems try to figure out how to use

00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:01,180
OCR on that so we're part of that

00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:03,310
project it's really difficult to do OCR

00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,010
on structured data as stupid as that

00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,480
sound I don't like the lines I don't

00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,920
know the computers I understand the

00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,120
little dots and so on so we've been

00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,519
working with a few different people and

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,079
trying to figure out how to do that and

00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,899
if they've been using cloud store to

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:21,279
store all those those huge amounts of

00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:23,170
pages on but this corpus if we can get

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,930
this coppers construction to meet the

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,880
the needs of researchers that kind of

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,740
data could be really transformational

00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,240
for a lot of research that people want

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,519
to do in a whole range of different

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,490
areas so in economics history political

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,339
science social science and so on so what

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:41,740
we are intending to do is to collaborate

00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:43,990
so that this be an exemplar for other

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,600
university libraries and other libraries

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,100
who are working with similar things to

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,250
automate and come up with an efficient

00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:54,370
digitization pipeline or process using

00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:56,860
cloud store and our own infrastructure

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,810
so I know for sure because I used to do

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,490
it in my old job if you digitized a

00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,150
bunch of stuff you couldn't put it over

00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:06,850
a

00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:08,050
the amount of butts I guess because of a

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,730
whole range of different problems so

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,779
often we'd just be sending hard drives

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:15,250
around right that's your national

00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,660
collections people spend a lot of time a

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,890
lot of money doing those things and

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,020
they're just posting you around the

00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:22,630
country so we're working on data

00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,490
transfer and trying to understand and

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:27,880
not only understand but help other

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:30,970
people understand how to use better data

00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:34,000
movement operations so using things like

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:35,890
our own cloud I think a lot of people

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,250
don't know about syncing and also

00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:41,350
sharing via the cloud and also something

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:43,210
called web dev which a lot of people

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,910
don't know about but it can be really

00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:48,150
useful so we're about two years in on

00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:51,160
this project they've been using

00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:55,000
transcribers you've heard of that which

00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:58,060
is a tool for transcribing handwriting

00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,370
you can train it to understand that

00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:04,390
handwriting in your collection so that's

00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:06,339
been an interesting process and there's

00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:08,020
a lot of documentation and analysis

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:10,600
using Jupiter notebooks and there's a

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:13,150
pretty well-known

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,430
he calls himself a hack a historian

00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,620
called Tim Jarrett if you're interested

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,320
I would look him up because he's using

00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:23,560
Jupiter notebooks in all kinds of

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,810
different ways to tap into different

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:29,890
collections and he's using his notebooks

00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:33,820
to help this project and one of the ways

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:35,500
he's done that is he's got a in which

00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,290
hopefully I'll be able to go through it

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,209
afterwards he's done a notebook that has

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,459
figured out all of the public holidays

00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:47,950
in that first part of the century that

00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:49,240
these the stock exchange papers work on

00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:51,070
because one of the problems with the

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,050
checking of the data is that there are

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,870
public holidays that create anomalies in

00:16:53,050 --> 00:17:00,190
each of the pages and so he's figured

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:02,170
out how to apply and and because Kings

00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,030
died and things like that in that period

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,410
all of the public holidays like Queen's

00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,059
Birthday King's birthday all it's all

00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:09,370
changed so he's managed to use a

00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,900
notebook to feed into that but something

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:13,630
like that I mean that's just for New

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,689
South Wales but if you've got now access

00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,689
to that in York

00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:19,100
actions in New South Wales and you can

00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:21,199
just apply that over the top to

00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:23,000
different things and you can use that so

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,889
we're creating the kind of data that

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,659
will hopefully be useful for other

00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:29,299
projects

00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:32,620
now tinker tinker is the fancy brand

00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:35,090
name for the house devil and this is a

00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,159
project that went on for a couple of

00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,049
years were experimenting on different

00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:40,730
things and things like transcription and

00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:46,039
data and I was sorry

00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:48,259
text analysis and geo mapping and what

00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:51,559
on it was doing as part of that was

00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:54,470
creating a data curation framework that

00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:56,360
would be accessible to Huss and glam

00:17:54,470 --> 00:18:00,049
workers so people who are not

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,419
necessarily technically engaged or even

00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:04,159
trained but they could come up with some

00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:06,139
collective terms and some knowledge that

00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,289
would be shareable amongst a whole range

00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:11,450
of different people so we have created a

00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:14,269
data curation framework if you go to the

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:16,149
tinkerer site you'll be able to see that

00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:18,889
on there and that's a kind of

00:18:16,149 --> 00:18:20,779
easy-to-read version of perhaps some of

00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:23,110
more technical manuals that might be out

00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:25,100
there and just to help people to

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:27,500
understand it's sort of a conceptual

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,570
model of how different tools and

00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:33,080
standard systems processes and so on can

00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:35,210
improve data curation so that people are

00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,129
spending less time wrangling dirty data

00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,740
and just being able to get clear

00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:42,820
language around it and helping people to

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:45,289
do that so that's one of our other

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,850
contributions something a pretty

00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:50,720
exciting that has happened with the

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:53,509
National Film and Sound Archive is our

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,669
enterprise team designed and implemented

00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:58,820
a data center grade network in their

00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:01,429
offices between a city and sydney and

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:03,500
upgraded that connection to 10g so

00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:06,649
they're running a high speed VPN between

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,019
Sydney and ICT and we've assisted in the

00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:10,759
design and implementation of that to

00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:12,830
help them reach their names because they

00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:14,269
weathered similar kind of institution

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,580
where they were just mailing hard drives

00:19:14,269 --> 00:19:19,490
around of all this stuff so we did a

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:22,850
pilot with them to create that mini

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,139
network for them using cloud storage n

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,970
so that they could store all this stuff

00:19:24,139 --> 00:19:28,340
so it did both digitized and

00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,380
born-digital material

00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,840
could be all transferred and used by a

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,240
networking cloud and take that physical

00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,380
kind of sneakernet

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:42,409
part of the system out and one of the

00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:45,529
things that I'm doing with them is also

00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:47,720
we're going to put on a training session

00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:51,620
for their staff and it'll expand out to

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:54,620
Canberra staff on how to use some of the

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,980
basic Network staff and do put a note

00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,480
book so if you know anyone who is in a

00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,919
cultural institution in Canberra who

00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,490
wants to can I get a little bit more

00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:07,340
technical then let me know now I

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:11,029
mentioned before the glam labs so glam

00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:14,000
labs it comes out of what was called the

00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:16,159
library lab at the British Library so a

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,770
way of getting people to use digitized

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,870
and digital collections in creative ways

00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:24,080
it's about drawing people together

00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:26,539
through digital collections so out of

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,850
that there is now a global network and

00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:30,679
in Australia we have three glam loads

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:33,559
there's one out of the University of

00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,899
Newcastle which is that glam X the DX

00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,090
lab itself sorry the State Library New

00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:39,529
South Wales and in Adelaide we have the

00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,090
North Terrace cultural precinct

00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,039
Innovation Lab which is actually a

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:48,620
combination of the art gallery the

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:50,390
library the history trust and I think

00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:52,070
another one that I've forgotten anyway

00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:55,220
and they're working together to combine

00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:57,919
and join up digital collections for

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:00,350
people to be able to use them and in in

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,390
more creative in different ways so we're

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,659
supporting this community as it comes

00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:07,460
out and develops over the European

00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:09,830
summer I think was in June or July a

00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,020
group of all of different people from

00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:14,570
around the world went to Qatar to do a

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,039
books print and they wrote this book

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,809
they're open a glam lab which is

00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:20,980
available online I can send you the link

00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:24,440
if you like for anyone working in an

00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:27,320
institution that wants to apply some of

00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,289
these digital tools and methods to their

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,630
work then that's a really great way in

00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,940
and it's free online it's from people

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:37,700
who experienced and it's pretty exciting

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,850
so we're hoping to be involved in event

00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,420
in October 2020

00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,860
the geek

00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:46,910
acting this up and helping other people

00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:49,010
start labs in Australia so for digital

00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:50,390
preservation I mean this isn't new I

00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,240
think anyone who's worked in any

00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:57,110
collections in the last 20 years would

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,990
have seen little mini disks come in VHS

00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:02,270
a whole range of different make magnetic

00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,710
data and magnetic carriers this has

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,810
become a bit of an emergency for

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:09,500
collecting institutions we've got a

00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:13,430
deadline of 2025 basically to preserve

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,470
anything stored on magnetic media and

00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,970
then of course there's the opposite or

00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,010
not opposite there's just a continuing

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,480
problem may be anything born digital and

00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:23,600
how do we preserve how do we make sure

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,730
that what we've made now is going to be

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,190
usable in 20 years time it's especially

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,680
around software and just getting people

00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,930
to understand that certain things are

00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,150
going to last forever and digit always

00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:39,320
definitely one of those so there is an

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:41,870
urgency to preserve but it seems to be

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,340
also a lot of stagnation in this area a

00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:47,270
lot of people do I understand the

00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:49,850
urgency so there is a group that started

00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:51,590
in 2018 called Australia preserved if

00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:52,970
you're interested I would definitely hit

00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:56,420
them up because I think it's a really

00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:59,390
valuable and interesting group it's just

00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:01,640
a collective there's no real institution

00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:03,080
behind it necessarily it's has come out

00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,730
of people working in these areas

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,490
understanding the urgency and feeling

00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:10,580
quite isolated and not knowing what to

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:13,760
do in their particular roles so you can

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:16,130
hop onto that link there that really

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,830
just started out of an event in

00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:21,290
Melbourne but they had I think 75 ad

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,610
attendees for the first event with 50

00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:24,380
people on a waiting list so there's

00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:27,110
clearly an interest and a need for

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:30,050
people to get support working in digital

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:32,030
preservation so anna is now involved in

00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,950
that it's all kinds of different

00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,390
organisations lots of different drivers

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,310
but essentially the problems are the

00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:39,170
same and so it's about trying to connect

00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:41,630
people up so that they can build a bit

00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:44,240
of momentum behind I guess trying to

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,220
convince certain elements of their

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,570
institutions I would say the executive

00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,790
probably is the main problem

00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:53,170
it took put some money into trying to

00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:54,630
preserve some of these really important

00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,149
documents of

00:23:54,630 --> 00:24:00,149
you know national heritage I suppose so

00:23:57,149 --> 00:24:01,950
J whether Bern is the main contact she's

00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:04,049
program manager did your preservation at

00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,950
uni of Melbourne they've partnered with

00:24:04,049 --> 00:24:08,190
something called the digital

00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:11,159
preservation coalition and I'll talk

00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,630
about that in a little minute one of the

00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,029
other things that we're working on is

00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:17,759
something about video game preservation

00:24:15,029 --> 00:24:19,350
and emulation I'm guessing there might

00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:24,269
be a few people in here are into video

00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:27,570
games so we are also considering this is

00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:29,129
a priority so the Acme and the Museum of

00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:31,259
applied sciences

00:24:29,129 --> 00:24:33,629
and the NSA are working together to

00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:37,769
collect and preserve particularly

00:24:33,629 --> 00:24:39,779
Australian titles and emulation is one

00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:42,570
of those strategies so we're involved in

00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:44,220
our project with them this example here

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:48,330
is from the Internet Archive

00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:50,639
it's a Commodore 64 great game emulated

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:53,009
on the multiple arcade machine emulator

00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:54,269
so if you're interested in old video

00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:55,710
games you can actually go to the

00:24:54,269 --> 00:24:57,720
Internet Archive and there's a few

00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,580
around there's also a project called

00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,830
play it again and that's a project with

00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,379
Swinburne uni and Acme and we are

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:06,360
working with them as well to support

00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:09,269
their emulation as a service concept

00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:12,000
using cloud to access preserved software

00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:15,480
in digital assets so that's another

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,039
thing that Alex getting involved in and

00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,320
this is just a little bit of information

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,250
about that digital preservation

00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,049
coalition there are a lot of

00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,720
organizations around the world it comes

00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:26,129
out of England but now the National

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,840
Archives of Australia the University of

00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:30,269
Melbourne and Arnett are the Australian

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,370
members and I believe they'll be going

00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:34,950
to be opening an office in Australia

00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:37,019
soon so they're helping organisations to

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:41,759
get value from their digital asset

00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:43,529
raising awareness of those issues you

00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,350
know cultural strategic all of those

00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:49,500
problems around digital preservation and

00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:51,419
and the end goal being about building

00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,529
this big capacity and a workforce so

00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:54,509
that we actually have people who know

00:25:52,529 --> 00:25:57,029
how to do it that there's also good

00:25:54,509 --> 00:26:01,500
practice and and good governance behind

00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:05,549
that so have a look at the DCP so let's

00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,210
have a look at cloud store that image is

00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:09,190
me thinking that wall looks at

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,890
fluffy like clouds and it's in a wool

00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:15,490
store does that help

00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:18,070
so Anna this is our kind of file sink

00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,750
share storage service and all

00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,549
universities anyone who works in the

00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,200
university will have access to this

00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:25,690
doesn't matter if you're a researcher or

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,360
if your professional staff and people

00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:30,760
who work in those institutions before so

00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,549
what it is basically is on it as the

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,799
data connector so we're connecting up

00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:41,919
all of these different groups through

00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:44,169
that the cloud store okay I didn't know

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,980
how to explain it but so we've got the

00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:49,809
user who can connect with HPC but the

00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,640
data can still go through cloud store

00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:54,130
these were the other clouds over their

00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,140
research storage institution

00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:59,110
repositories domain repositories so this

00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:01,390
is where glam ends up right so it's all

00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:03,100
part of this great big network but the

00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,020
trick is with our net two is that that

00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,460
then is connected internationally so you

00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,980
can work with anyone around the world

00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:11,919
using these services so it's basically

00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:14,799
about an ecosystem of different parts of

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,899
the research landscape and connecting

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,520
everyone up together so we're seeing

00:27:16,899 --> 00:27:22,149
cloud stories the main way to move your

00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:25,899
data around this is the way that cloud

00:27:22,149 --> 00:27:30,070
story is kind of illustrated I guess if

00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:31,899
you like if you want to see it it's how

00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,970
the holding things together with the

00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:36,460
core part being research data lifecycle

00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:38,020
because we're the network fair for

00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,029
universities that's how principal well

00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,520
so we're thinking about it in terms of

00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:44,830
how people do research so you would

00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,690
start with your data collection data

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,279
analysis publishing or you'd start with

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,529
the proposal excuse me and then go

00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:52,450
around so in well enveloping everything

00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:54,190
is file centers so if you have access to

00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:57,880
cloud store you can send up to it I

00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:59,950
think is it 20 terabytes you know to

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,539
from someone to someone else and they

00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,950
can also you can give them vouchers and

00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:04,539
they can send that stuff to you so if

00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,630
you're working in with anyone within an

00:28:04,539 --> 00:28:09,669
institution that's on earth on it or in

00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:13,720
the university you can use this system

00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:15,610
and it's very quick it's good only

00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,480
office I talked about before so that's

00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:20,450
that and open source documents and

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,150
spreadsheets analyst

00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:25,130
stuff rocket webdev and think of those

00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:26,900
tools that you would use when you need

00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:29,930
to start thinking about moving around

00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:32,810
big big bits of data sort of drop and

00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:34,820
drag and and that's probably where I

00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:37,400
need to start thinking about where to do

00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,020
a bit more training and then on the left

00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,820
it's just some things that are kind of

00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,950
more for specialists so we've got audio

00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,710
3d things like that so if you're working

00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:48,320
with linguists for example who use a

00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:50,840
huge amount of audio or archeologists

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,030
I'd like to use 3d material and so on

00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:57,280
and something called Swan and I'll talk

00:28:53,030 --> 00:29:01,100
about Swan in a sec so for anyone who's

00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:02,870
used cloud before we've tried to make it

00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,490
pretty accessible to everyone so it

00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:06,620
looks kind of like a lot of other ways

00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:09,020
of doing clouds so you just see your

00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,730
files in a big list but you can organize

00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,650
them a bit with what's been shared with

00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:14,420
you or what you've shared out you can

00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:18,410
have favourites and so on

00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:20,240
and then you can add things move things

00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:22,160
around all of those sorts of normal

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,850
basic things but up the top you can see

00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:26,990
there are a few different options for

00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:29,660
specialists things so that the file

00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:33,350
sender Swan and collections collections

00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:35,300
is about packaging data so if you need

00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,740
to publish data for example that's a way

00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:40,670
of pushing it all in together so it's

00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:42,200
kind of into integral thing that can't

00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,000
be messed with I suppose if you need to

00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,210
move it around for publications and so

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,920
on and that's quite a useful thing for

00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:54,500
Glam I believe okay so the carpentry is

00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:55,940
we're gonna change tack a little bit so

00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,400
I said before that my main were always

00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:00,170
really about talking to people and

00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,150
communicating and trying to get this

00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:04,580
bridge across from the technology to

00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,870
people one of the ways we've decided to

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,990
do that is through something called the

00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:13,750
carpenter ease carpentry is a global

00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:16,100
network of volunteers who trained in

00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:19,910
foundational coding and data science

00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:22,340
skills to researchers that researchers

00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:24,530
thing I think is starting to expand out

00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:27,350
so like me I'm starting to look at

00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:29,090
people who work in the Glen areas

00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:31,130
they're not necessarily researchers but

00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:31,800
they're working with data that may end

00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:35,750
up being

00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:38,790
Serg data so it's all part of a system

00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:42,240
the digital preservation people are also

00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:44,790
using carpentry to start teaching some

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,550
of their things so basically what it is

00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:50,850
is a just a way of running workshops

00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:53,960
that is a little different perhaps than

00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:57,030
some traditional ways of teaching

00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,050
technology I know in my experience a lot

00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,810
of people I know have had quite

00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:02,940
indifferent training experiences when

00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:04,740
learning about technology you might lose

00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,150
your place you don't know what the

00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:08,880
person is talking about there's too much

00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:12,360
technical language it just takes too

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,430
much out of you to learn anything so

00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,440
what they've done is they've slowed

00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:18,300
everything right down and basically the

00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,280
way it works is that your workshop runs

00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,260
at the pace of the slowest learner

00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,540
it's not about appeasing the people who

00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,550
are up the front and ready to go what

00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,740
you do with them is they become peer

00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:31,260
teachers and you start to learn use the

00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:34,890
expertise of those in the room to help

00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:36,090
the ones out who are running behind it's

00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,710
not even running behind because they're

00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:40,350
running the speed right they're the ones

00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:44,100
who are in charge and really what it's

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:45,900
about as well in my world is starting

00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,010
off with a lot of jargon busting so it's

00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,450
actually a lot of talking at the

00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,820
beginning there's not a huge amount of

00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,950
techie kind of stuff but it's using

00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,960
everyone's expertise googling stuff what

00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:57,030
is this what's a kernel what is it don't

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,860
make any assumptions on what people know

00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:01,260
and I heard kernel the first time I

00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:03,510
thought what has corn got to do with

00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,340
anything right so it's a little bit like

00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,380
that man was talking about before what

00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,300
you rely on what you know so I'm talking

00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,190
to people who have no computer or

00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,590
technical background we need to talk

00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,880
about language first so it's a lot of

00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:18,810
that kind of material

00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,560
so the carpentry pedagogy also very much

00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:23,760
hangs off of a code of conduct and

00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,130
literally there is stuff in there about

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,890
no tech shaming I had never heard of

00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:31,740
that concept before but it can happen

00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:33,180
that people will have a go at you for

00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,520
whatever hardware you've brought with

00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:36,900
you if you're a Mac person if you're a

00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,630
Linux president what of that that is

00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,550
absolutely not allowed and a whole range

00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,050
of other things need to be sorted out so

00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,860
everyone has to read that code of

00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,200
conduct and

00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:48,630
made themselves very well in the class

00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,730
including the instructor potentially

00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:52,970
most importantly it's about creating a

00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:56,190
positive learning environment there are

00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:59,010
no stupid questions and actually there

00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:00,780
are no do you have any questions but the

00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:02,790
instructor is always asking what

00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:04,440
questions do you have so it's always

00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:06,660
about creating a very open environment

00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,400
and you need to be able to help people

00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,500
feel very comfortable in what they're

00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:14,730
learning formative assessment is a

00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:16,950
tricky language around basically just

00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:19,350
checking that people know oh wow that's

00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,820
gone really fast what you've taught them

00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,230
so about every five or ten minutes

00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:23,700
you're checking up all the time so it's

00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:26,100
not after the end of a three hour

00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,169
marathon you say hey so how'd you go

00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,330
it's about every five or ten minutes

00:33:28,169 --> 00:33:34,830
you're constantly checking a people up

00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:36,690
with where you are lots of praise lot of

00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,860
talk about that expert blind spot which

00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,809
was really interesting to me this

00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,730
morning talking with a gentleman talking

00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,110
about they're priming because one of the

00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,700
reasons I think I'm in the role that I

00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:46,650
am in is that I don't have a

00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,970
technological background and often what

00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,490
we're doing is we're just working it out

00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:52,710
as we go we're very basic beginner level

00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:55,530
and so I don't actually even have that

00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:57,390
expert to worry about and the other

00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:59,040
thing that we do is live coding and

00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:01,590
that's really important to what four

00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,030
people do what you do the coding as

00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:05,340
they're doing it as well so they're

00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:09,379
copying you they can see when you make

00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:12,060
mistakes and you always use mistakes as

00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:13,740
opportunities so every time you get to a

00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,359
point where something's gone wrong okay

00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:18,389
so what we can learn what can we learn

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,010
how does this help us and and it kind of

00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,179
reduces the sense of panic though a lot

00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:25,490
of people get when they're doing that

00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:27,990
sort of work so what I've done for

00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:30,179
Arnett in terms of carpentry is

00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:33,419
producing train-the-trainer material was

00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:34,919
the spirit of carpentry says it's all

00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:37,169
open source it's all free it's

00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:40,080
accessible to anyone in the world and

00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:41,700
it's all done in a certain format I'm

00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,169
struggling with that format because we

00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,149
need to use github so I've had to go

00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:47,310
back and learn go back I have had to

00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:51,030
learn github and I still don't quite get

00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:52,710
it so if you want any of these links you

00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:56,309
can ask me or

00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:58,109
get them to you somehow the we what I've

00:34:56,309 --> 00:35:01,470
done is an introduced introduction to

00:34:58,109 --> 00:35:03,660
Jupiter notebook sorry that is now in

00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:05,790
what they call the incubator lesson pure

00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:09,990
area in the carpentry so it's not

00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:12,599
accepted park carpentry curriculum but

00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,890
I'm pushed it into that format and at

00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:15,720
the moment it looks like the workshop

00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,640
goes for forty hours or something that's

00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,280
not quite right I've got to fix a few

00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,990
things but I've also got PowerPoint with

00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,670
notes and etherpad which is another

00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,589
thing that is used in the carpentry is

00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:27,690
training so I'm happy to share any of

00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:29,160
that with any of you and we also do

00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,170
something called network know-how and

00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:34,010
data handling which is just another

00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:39,240
carpentry style

00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:41,220
workshop a lot of jargon busting lots of

00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,619
little tiny tips and tricks about how to

00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:46,500
understand how move data moves around

00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:48,270
and how quickly things can be or how

00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,890
slowly they can go and all that sort of

00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,510
stuff so there the two things that I'm

00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,880
working on but I know there's a lot more

00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:55,619
and I have a lot more to do so if any of

00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,270
you have any suggestions on the kind of

00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:00,030
things that could help make things

00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:03,510
easier for glam people working on

00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:06,930
networks and with data then I'd love to

00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:08,609
know about it and so yeah I was thinking

00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,880
I'd do a little mini cloud store demo

00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:13,230
but I did do the static one just in case

00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,619
it didn't work and I think I'm gonna run

00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:18,540
out of time so but hop on to on it you

00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:21,329
can see if you have access or not I

00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:23,549
don't know where your work but yeah

00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:25,109
definitely come and talk to me during

00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:27,270
the break or we can have questions now

00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:29,700
I'm really interested to know what you

00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:34,080
think Thanks

00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:37,240
[Applause]

00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,370
Thank You Sara that was awesome

00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,750
so I'm not gonna ask you if you have any

00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:43,420
questions I'm gonna ask you what

00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,740
questions do you have we are recording

00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:48,070
this session so you will need to wait

00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:49,240
for the mic if you've got a question so

00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,840
I don't know how much of an issue this

00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,840
