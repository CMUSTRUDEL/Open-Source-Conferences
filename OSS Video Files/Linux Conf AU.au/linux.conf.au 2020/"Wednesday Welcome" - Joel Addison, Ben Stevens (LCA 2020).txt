00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,620
is a registration desk we still have

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,330
nothing we have put a few items through

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,570
that but at the moment I think it's

00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:29,830
clean if you need help look for one of

00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:31,660

the buffet will be over there it's in

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:36,250

pull up banner that you should go

00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,490
- if you have any special diet Ruiz and

00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:46,650
you will be catered for if you've told

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:48,330
this our charity raffle is up on our

00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:52,410
dashboard now we've already had people

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:54,600
buying tickets to it and all proceeds of

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:58,050
this raffle will go to the Red Cross for

00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:01,880
their bushfire appeal I'd like to invite

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,880
you up to talk about our first prize

00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,430
thanks that job I succeeded in going the

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:15,720
Alfa long way so I'm the prize is a

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,610
significant part of the open Linux

00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,800
confer you tradition and I reached out

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:21,420
to our Raptor computing systems who won

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,850
the members of the open power Foundation

00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,710
said hey we've got this raffle would you

00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,170
pony up a prize and they very kindly put

00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:29,640
forward one of their little Blackbird

00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,380
workstations I think it's significant

00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,270
with this it's an entirely open hardware

00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:39,840
design and entirely open a software

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:42,240
stack that runs the IBM power 9 CPU AMD

00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:44,490
Radeon WX 400 GPU which is one their

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,720
workstation class - the thing that's

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,040
kind of cool this one it's actually on

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,420
their pre-production one so it's an

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,850
interesting piece of computing history

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,290
in a sense and it has a serial number 11

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,570
so I guess that makes the one louder as

00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,370
well but a really nice piece of play

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,170
circuit and more importantly a really

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,470
really great cause so please please give

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,470
generously
