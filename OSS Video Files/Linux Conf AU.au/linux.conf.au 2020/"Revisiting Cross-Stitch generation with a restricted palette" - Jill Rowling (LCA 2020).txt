Would you use natural colours in your artwork? This brief talk will show a method to create and then use a restricted (sepia tone) palette with an existing python Cross Stitch generator, "Experiment 626" by Katie McLaughlin, to generate a graph for a cross-stitch artwork using natural alpaca fibre colours. This talk will mention some of the good, odd and strange things that happen, and some work-arounds.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

talk about her cross-stitch generation

00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:14,940
thanks Jill thank you now it says here

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:18,630
Peck a farmer yes I have a herd of our

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:23,880
Packers they live near Mount Marsden New

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:28,320
South Wales as about 30 of them I'm a

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,670
cave scientist I can say that I've got a

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,700
ticket that says that I'm a cave

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,149
scientist I've got another ticket this

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:40,079
is a hardware engineer and the fiber

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:44,700
arts is just great fun so let's put them

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:51,090
all together and add any LCA first of

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:53,420
all what is cross stitch some look it's

00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,430
not it's one of those beautiful portable

00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:00,059
little bits of artwork that you can take

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,640
a a grid of canvas and then put these

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,729
little little stitches which is as you

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,380
can see on the cartoon there you built

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:12,299
it up with an X and some people spend an

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,580
awful lot of time with those sort of

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:21,540
things I'd probably do one per year but

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:24,619
on by no means an exceptional cross

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:29,220
stitch er but if I see a library of

00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:31,950
software and it's missing something then

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:39,920
I started to get interested so let's

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:44,450
move on if you went to the LCA in Sydney

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,729
the arts mini conference Katie

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:54,200
McLaughlin gave a great talk on cross

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:56,579
stitch using Python project six to six I

00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,159
would strongly suggest if you're

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,579
interested to have a look at her updated

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,110
talks that she gave in PyCon which

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:10,289
unfortunately I missed seeing last year

00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:12,110
but it explains exactly what her project

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,390
e

00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:20,180
that's apparently how you pronounce it I

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:23,840
H is how you type it and you can

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:26,570
download that you would need in order to

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:31,010
think finish the software install you'll

00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:39,170
need to get a copy of her executable

00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:42,170
which is in Python that's IH and anyway

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,450
during Katie's talk she was explaining

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,880
how she had to spend an awful lot of

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:49,420
time and effort in getting the

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,700
[Music]

00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:58,220
manufacturers colors available in her

00:02:52,700 --> 00:03:02,180
cross stitch pattern during that LCA

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:04,340
talk I foolishly mentioned wouldn't work

00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,660
with a restricted palette because I was

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:12,950
thinking in terms of natural alpaca

00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:19,940
colors of course it would equally apply

00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:23,000
to perhaps some natural colored plant

00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,510
fibers or human hair as you know that

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,489
sort of thing that nevertheless she said

00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:34,730
well suppose you could and she said but

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:38,300
you wouldn't need access to some alpaca

00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,730
fiber now as I have a herd of our

00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:46,790
packers that aspect of it isn't really a

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:50,090
problem now natural fibres such as the

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:51,530
hair in your head comes in you can see

00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,390
around the audience I mean look at me

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,769
we've got some people with light-colored

00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,880
here we've got myself with the gray

00:03:54,769 --> 00:04:00,950
hairs a few dark here some redhead II

00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:05,380
sort of colors and things but under the

00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:10,810
microscope it's all just either

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:17,030
completely clear which is super blonde

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:21,470
or various shades of brown now these

00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:25,060
little brown elements are attached to

00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:30,199
the hair cell as the hair grow

00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:32,750
by it's just as natural process of

00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,719
adding these these colors there's a

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:39,139
single brown little dot looks like a

00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:42,469
tiny little dot under the microscope but

00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:45,349
once you zoom out and look on mass at a

00:04:42,469 --> 00:04:48,080
mass of fibers it starts to take on a

00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:51,770
color of its own so you get these ranges

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:56,620
of black through white shades of gray

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:59,930
Brown and all sorts of various things

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,620
these colors don't fade now the colors

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:06,800
in your clothing may fade but the colors

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:10,250
in your hair and in the alpacas they

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,889
don't fade anyway why else would you

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,779
want to restrict a palette just artistic

00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:19,279
reasons you might want to do a sepia

00:05:14,779 --> 00:05:22,490
tone and there they are not they're

00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:27,879
pretty all the different colors but it's

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:30,259
are all really one color brown that's

00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:32,210
that's a part of our hood that's the

00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:34,789
female hood we've got a male hood with

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:42,830
just the big commercial hood but that

00:05:34,789 --> 00:05:47,360
was when it actually used to rain okay

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:50,990
the alpaca Association has produced a

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,919
shade card of official colors of our

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:57,789
packer so that me as an alpaca breeder

00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:01,310
can theoretically take one of these

00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:05,240
rather expensive shade cards out into

00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:09,560
the paddock grab an alpaca which doesn't

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:16,009
want to be grabbed and compare the color

00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:17,930
on the mid side of the alpaca which but

00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:20,349
at this stage is probably jumping up and

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,349
take on

00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:28,020
as you can see on this shade card is a

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:30,000
number of colors from white or creamier

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,630
really it's not it's not really white

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,880
it's a cream through various sepia tones

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:39,330
there's a black dozen there is actually

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:42,480
a true black the Grays

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:44,820
there's a several grows and and and it

00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,750
was cure color at the end three colors

00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:50,400
they're called Rose gray now between you

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,200
and me that's probably a marketing term

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,970
but it basically means brown with some

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:58,940
white him so I thought well if you look

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:03,810
carefully you'll see that there are

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:06,510
numbers and letters associated with each

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:09,320
of these colors this means we can make a

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:13,860
catalog how do we create an alpaca

00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:17,640
palette first of all I photographed the

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:20,840
swatch card now you would say oh look

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:24,840
just put it on the scanner well no

00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,240
because the bundles was kind of 3d as

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,720
you put it on the scanner it sits up

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,370
above the scanner and yeah it doesn't

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,840
quite work so anyway I photographed it

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:39,360
using a camera I then edited the photo

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,920
using the just says to make the

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,040
black bits black and the white bits

00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,020
white and as I mentioned the white is

00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:49,560
really cream the white hanky was cream

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:53,880
but the card itself was white the black

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:57,020
lettering is black now Katie's project

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,690
six to six uses JSON format for the

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,160
palette I'm looking over there because

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:09,690
for technical reasons I can't see it

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:11,700
here now in it this changed but at the

00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:16,280
moment let's just work with the JSON

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:19,110
format shown below there from to swatch

00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,420
so what I did is to leave the color tool

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,030
in using one of the color tools is a

00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:27,090
color selector tool and you can set a

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:32,790
radius of 21 it seems to work for what

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:34,290
we're doing and average the colors so

00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:35,760
you can see there's a gray

00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:38,370
if you look really carefully you'll see

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,650
that great it's really made of lots of

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,720
hairs just black hair some white hairs

00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,620
it's no grey hairs it's no such thing as

00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,570
a gray hair

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:50,970
these aren't gray hairs they're

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:52,590
blackheads and whiteheads so this is why

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,660
you need to average it it also means

00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:56,730
it's not going to reproduce if I went

00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,200
and redid all my colors I'm not going to

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,570
get exactly the same because I'm not

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,060
going to position my color exactly over

00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,560
the swatch and my copy of the Squatch

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,690
actually I've got two copies of the

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,100
swatches they're slightly different he's

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,530
not going to be the same as if you went

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,530
to the Association and bought yourself a

00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:16,440
swatch there's subtle differences so

00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:20,640
technically yes and effectively it's the

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,860
same practically if you're an artist

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,200
they're the same but if you were going

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,760
to be a scientist and said I really

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,250
really really want to know what exactly

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:34,920
the numbers of colors now this is not

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:39,920
the way to do it where artists so

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,920
there's my attempt to do a medium for

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,280
resetting parts

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,310
specify the names medium form that's

00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,680
what was on that hour pecker swatch

00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,930
there's a code MF 202 that was on the

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,710
swatch there's a hex number which I've

00:09:51,930 --> 00:10:03,060
obtained from and the RGB at the

00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:05,970
same time from so that's the format

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:10,280
that's used in project 66 if you

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,280
download project 66 which you can find

00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,660
you'll get your a requirement for that

00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:18,810
kind of format there's another format

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:25,530
there which is the later version which I

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:29,730
haven't got working have a look at my 16

00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:31,710
colors in my shared area you can see all

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,180
the rest of them I did have a slide

00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,380
which had all of them but Mike said

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,380
every on a fall asleep okay

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:43,860
so I testing testing is always fun I

00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,680
installed project 66 and swapped out the

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,940
supplied short alpaca colors for mine I

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,090
obtained a copy

00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,250
from Katie I had to get help to sort out

00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:56,220
the fight an environment I am not by any

00:10:53,250 --> 00:11:01,640
means an expert Python programmer but I

00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:04,860
can hack around the smells good thing

00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,450
set up the environment thank you so much

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,780
to Mike like for helping me with that

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:11,970
and created some test images now the

00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,820
first test image was with Katie's little

00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:16,200
test image I've blown it up there so you

00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:20,250
can actually see it it's only really

00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:24,450
pixels in size and I had some trouble

00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:26,370
doing my very first paint fills because

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:32,370
good old game oh that's the same as that

00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:35,820
but that's just overwrite it I had a bit

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:41,430
of care and created a test using the

00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:44,340
colors out of my new palette then ran it

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:49,680
with the appropriate parameters to

00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:52,800
produce a very first cross-stitch lookup

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,760
chart so that is a portion of that

00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:01,980
little cartoon that you saw and you can

00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:03,420
see on the left there's color then the

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,100
next one is the number of stitches that

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:09,300
you're required to sit there and stitch

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,670
back and forth the alpaca code and the

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,260
I'll pick a name that's not the name of

00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:16,440
the alpaca that's the name of the color

00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:21,300
of the alpaca yes some of my our Packers

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:23,370
have names now what you might notice on

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,980
there and this is some of the fun things

00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:31,260
is and this is possibly the reason why

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:33,750
66 was deprecated is the there's some

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:37,470
question marks and apparently in later

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:42,270
version if that grayscale handling has

00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:44,460
been fixed I have been told I get errors

00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:48,510
when I compile it but that's my problem

00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:51,210
not yours I'm sure some of you will be

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:53,940
able to just get it all running and be

00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:56,340
perfect but in the meantime I was very

00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,080
happy to see a rendering what you'll see

00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,570
on the right hand side is a cartoon that

00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:04,410
indicates that for

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:05,760
instance those it lays you'll see that

00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:07,350
there's a question right there because

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,750
there is no pure white and our packet

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,180
it's cream remember

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:14,760
so therefore the A's will be in the

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:18,870
chart there is a question mark so if you

00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:21,770
have some floss or some real white yeah

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:24,210
you can use you can render the ice

00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:27,030
everything else the Grays it got

00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:30,950
confused over which is as I said the

00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:32,910
difference between the two projects

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:36,060
everything else was it found a

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:38,430
Calliphora which is jolly good so I

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:41,400
thought has an Excel another example

00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:45,930
from my caving background I'll take one

00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,760
of my pictures and take a portion of it

00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:52,170
that would be kind of a kind of a stitch

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:55,350
able size and see what running it

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:59,940
through it will produce and wow I

00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:02,720
thought that was rather nice certainly

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:07,290
is starting to look more art and less

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:10,590
alpacas in the paddock so um as I said

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:12,270
project 66 is deprecated but if he is

00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:15,360
within limits that may be still useful

00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:18,720
to artists because its program its

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,350
problems were only in the grayscale you

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:26,730
may only have one grayscale or one great

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:29,400
color and all you have to do is look at

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:32,310
the cartoon and and substitute that

00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:34,560
color that you knew certainly possible

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:37,680
to extend a palette you may wish to have

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:42,720
other natural colors which you

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:44,340
photographed and all natural plant dies

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,840
for instance and make up your own

00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:53,280
palette using that idea so have a have a

00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:55,890
real go at the newer version of if you

00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,530
like and I would like to thank Katie

00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:03,150
McLaughlin for creating both project 66

00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:05,010
and it's been a lot of fun but that kind

00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,840
of closes that loop from that question

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,820
asked on the previous LCA

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:14,210
no leaving was a little baby our pack

00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:17,710
owners mammal thank you

00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,710
