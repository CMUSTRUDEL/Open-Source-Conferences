Would you use natural colours in your artwork? This brief talk will show a method to create and then use a restricted (sepia tone) palette with an existing python Cross Stitch generator, "Experiment 626" by Katie McLaughlin, to generate a graph for a cross-stitch artwork using natural alpaca fibre colours. This talk will mention some of the good, odd and strange things that happen, and some work-arounds.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
