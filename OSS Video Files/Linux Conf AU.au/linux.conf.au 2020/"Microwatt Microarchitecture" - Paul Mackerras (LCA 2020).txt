Microwatt is a new open-source soft-core implementation of the Power ISA written in VHDL. It has been developed from scratch in the last six months by Anton Blanchard and others, initially to provide an example implementation to accompany the announcement by IBM last August that it was opening the Power ISA. This talk will examine the microarchitecture of the Microwatt core in some detail and discuss how implementation choices were affected by the specific details of the Power ISA.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/
