Title: "API Standardising for the GLAM Sector - Workshop" - Sae Ra Germaine, Hugh Rundle (LCA 2020)
Publication date: 2020-01-15
Playlist: linux.conf.au 2020
Description: 
	Sae Ra Germaine, Hugh Rundle

https://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/201/

GLAM and cultural are great at making APIs accessible. But are they consistent between institutions? These institutions are great at creating rules but maybe it's time we need to create some with how APIs are created. This is a workshop to come up with some recommended standards for API creation.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

hello sorry - sorry to interrupt your

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,750
conversation or another hi Roman welcome

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,599
back so this session is going to be more

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,119
like a workshop II facilitated

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,949
discussion things so if we could have

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:36,960
everyone kind of a little closer that

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:38,340
would be preferable but you know if you

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,600
did feel uncomfortable that that's fine

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,370
- I'm gonna write some stuff on the

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,890
whiteboard just because that I'd like to

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:53,160
do that and and and we'll do something

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,300
with that later we'll kind of see how we

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,940
weren't sure how many people would turn

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,149
up or you know how this would go so this

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,449
is kind of an experiment and I think

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:06,570
officially this session is 25 minutes or

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:09,240
something and then we've left another

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,790
the the session after this is was kind

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,159
of in case we wanted to continue the

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,810
conversation or hear more from one of

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,080
our previous speakers so we'll see how

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,159
we go we don't want to keep you if if

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:26,909
you all feel like you've had enough say

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,960
yeah let's let's kick off can you show

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,430
our next slide please

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,049
Sarah excellent okay so something that

00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,939
people really really quickly talked

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:43,140
about so fast that you might have missed

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:46,950
it was that the victorian government led

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,420
this work but now about to say the feds

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,630
but I think it's actually sort of all

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,020
the state governments together and the

00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:56,210
one they called Co egg yeah basically

00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:00,149
Victorian government leaders off with

00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:03,740
standards for government departments who

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:06,060
were building api's so array

00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,429
government's building API so that we can

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,110
access their data programmatically and

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,200
that's really exciting a problem

00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,240
had though is that they all did that

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,730
independently of each other so you know

00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,590
this department Apia up works this way

00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:24,370
and this department Xavier works these

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,660
completely differently so the victorian

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,400
government got together and said okay

00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,600
we're gonna have like victorian

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,750
government standard so if you're

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,390
building an API then you kind of have to

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:36,130
do it this way if you're a victorian

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,630
government felon and then other sterling

00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,370
government said wow that's a really good

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:41,380
idea we should have a national standard

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:45,430
now to be honest that's about as much as

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,800
I know about that work that Sarah is

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:58,000
gonna quickly show you she's gonna flick

00:02:47,800 --> 00:03:02,489
to her web browser do just quickly show

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,489
you so there's a website which has the

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,989
Australian Government API design

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:14,200
standard and that is API gov au /

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:16,750
standards so if you want to look at that

00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:20,650
later go have a look at that so I've had

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,940
a quick very quick look through this

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,019
just to see what sort of things that are

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:27,340
standardizing and it was kind of

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:30,760
interesting because after our 2018

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,440
open Glen mini-com I was kind of

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,299
thinking about the discussion we had

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,670
about sort of generous interfaces and

00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:39,130
generous glam and openness and lalala I

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:45,519
was thinking oh wouldn't it be cool if

00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:47,140
we had a glam API standard but I was

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,430
thinking about it like a librarian so I

00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,650
was thinking about it differently to

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,610
hell government's thinking about it cuz

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,380
they're thinking about amorous

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:57,250
technologists so if we just think back

00:03:53,380 --> 00:04:01,000
to the other slide Thanks we've

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,680
practiced this as you can see oh yes so

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,030
what we thought we would do this

00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,660
afternoon is do a little thought

00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:10,060
experiment based on our speakers earlier

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,950
in the day about what sorts of questions

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,100
we might need to ask if we were

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,630
designing an international claim a fee a

00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,030
standard which obviously we're not

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,620
actually doing but so it might be

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:25,980
helpful to think about that

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:28,020
both because who knows somebody in this

00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,880
room might one day get a chance to work

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,080
on something similar to that but also

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,550
kind of helps us think about if we are

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,140
doing some of the work that Peter was

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,700
talking about in particular where you're

00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,930
saying okay well how do we package up

00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,110
the stuff we've got and make it

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,550
available these will be similar

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,470
questions we'll have to think about so

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,380
bonnie was showing you know like here's

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:52,530
some data and you can get it in CSV or

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:54,120
Jason for example many of the same

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,430
questions would be asking here again all

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,980
apply even though that's just getting to

00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,940
a website and downloading a file that

00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:07,440
makes sense so far

00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:08,990
cool okay so since I asked for a

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:15,240
whiteboard and now we have one and we

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:18,830
have to use it so but maybe we would go

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,020
through these questions one by one and

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:25,530
and you can shout stuff out and I'll try

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,820
and run it up so or a frosty you know

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:29,010
this is a pretty small group so you can

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,930
always you can always question the

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,220
question and we can you know ask a

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,000
different question of ourselves if you

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,920
think it's not quite all right so

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,960
Claire's back Thank You Claire so Claire

00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,490
talked about ethical and respectful use

00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,410
of data and some of the things we need

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,110
to think about that so if we were doing

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:51,780
that in a programmatic building that

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:55,740
into an API way what sort of things

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,690
might we need now need to do with that

00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,220
so this is really not a killer question

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,380
partially because I'm not quite sure

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,870
what I'm asking

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,670
ah post-it notes oh this is excellent

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,040
you've all brought it you all brought a

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:10,500
pen of course but and if you didn't

00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,520
here's some done I prepared earlier this

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,860
is fantastic

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,810
alright so um maybe we'll make this a

00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:21,870
little easier you can put on your

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:25,680
post-it notes responses to any of these

00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,630
three questions as long as you remember

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:33,410
which one of your answers relates to

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:33,410
which question so that makes sense

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,100
thank you Donna and Sarah okay so

00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,840
question one is what mechanisms could be

00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,880
built into our Glenn API to help address

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,340
the questions Claire raised around

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,790
ethical and respectful use of data so

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,730
you know for example is there I don't

00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:56,670
know is there a true/false boolean field

00:06:50,730 --> 00:07:00,960
that might be useful around rights to

00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:03,000
view something for example what could

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,580
our API standard do to encourage more

00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,710
interview in the innovative uses of

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:12,840
Glenn data in ways similar to what

00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,190
bonnie was telling us about say you know

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,780
are there ways that we can make it

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:19,050
easier rather than harder for people to

00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,120
do whatever they think of rather than

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,600
only the things that the users that we

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,430
yes the institution have thought of and

00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,470
the third question is are there things

00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,510
we can do around API standardization to

00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:31,860
help reduce the learning curve for

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,780
glamour records and users so that

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,600
Sarah's job is easier so Sarah was

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,770
talking about training people can we

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,150
reduce the amount of training should

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,150
have to do you have a question Donna

00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,770
one at a time it's uh that's up to the

00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,720
room what would you like to them one at

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,660
a time

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,130
all right cool is they this is just the

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,410
order I wrote them in do you feel like

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:01,200
there's a better worm to do first or do

00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:04,760
you just want to get from the top I'm

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,760
seeing lots of shrugs maybe motions

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,860
alright let's start with you because

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,760
that's nice and open

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,760
no pun intended

00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:19,400
say yeah

00:08:51,820 --> 00:09:17,680
okay so we have some dissent here do we

00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:17,680
want to go to that first all right

00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,149
[Music]

00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,630
yeah

00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:34,780
yeah yeah and just that

00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:31,050
that's one collective dhaba exploration

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,160
hold that thought because that's that's

00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,650
on the next slide

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,330
whoa discuss that I deliberately made

00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:58,790
that the last question rather than the

00:12:47,330 --> 00:13:07,550
fist Donna would you like to explain

00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:10,210
yourself oh yeah

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,210
the underpants gnomes

00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,400
[Music]

00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,889
[Music]

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:06,520
some of the libraries throw away that

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,900
Burma Dauterive every day oh I just go

00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:25,520
God that you have any way from the books

00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:30,310
back conversation even terms all of like

00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:30,310
why do we have these systems to manage

00:14:56,929 --> 00:15:09,629
yes that does actually yeah there's a

00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:11,399
debate going on at the moment in

00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:14,339
libraries it's been simmering along for

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,049
a little while but it it might just be

00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:18,540
because I mean contact with more stuff

00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:21,720
but it seems to me that it's gathering a

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,799
bit of steam there's a lot of librarians

00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,199
particularly in public libraries

00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:27,829
questioning so there's there's all these

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:32,239
systems which by default just have a

00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:34,709
field either for gender or if they're

00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:39,329
hold or no one's really thought about it

00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:40,949
a field for sex and usually there's only

00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:42,480
two options that you're allowed in the

00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:45,449
system alright so that's the first

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,679
problem well or is it because that's

00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:47,879
really the second problem the first

00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,699
problem is why you're collecting that

00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:53,489
data in the first place right there's a

00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:55,860
lot of librarians now saying like we

00:15:53,489 --> 00:15:58,639
actually have no purpose for this data

00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,860
plane like we don't care it's just

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,230
somebody who's a member and has borrowed

00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,589
something so you know we might need

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,699
their contact details to contact them

00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:11,069
and we probably need their name so that

00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:12,540
we can be polite and say hello to them

00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:15,869
but like do we need to know what their

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,399
gender identity is now I've I've worked

00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:20,129
with people who feel very strongly that

00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:23,610
we do but the reasons they give me never

00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:25,529
seem to be particularly strong in in my

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,360
view and that's usually around things

00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:30,540
like oh you know we'll help us to know

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,089
someone's using somebody else's library

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,299
card or something like wow it's not even

00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:39,019
actually gonna do that necessarily so

00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:39,019
yeah good question

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,169
there's different kinds of collections

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:37,149
for different purposes right this is

00:18:35,169 --> 00:18:38,710
something that I've been trying to have

00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,570
a discussion with a lot of researchers

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,899
that I work with and librarians and so

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,899
on

00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:46,120
so there are those data that's collected

00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:48,840
for research and there's data collected

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:52,149
for historical archiving and a lot of

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:54,370
people conflate the two like collecting

00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:55,539
it therefore we should archive it for

00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:58,120
all posterity

00:18:55,539 --> 00:19:00,580
when it's they're not really the same

00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,100
thing you treat data that's collected

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:09,669
for a purpose very differently than data

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:11,490
collected for a historical archive so

00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:15,850
into a hundred years into the future

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:18,940
we're digging through an archive and we

00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:21,039
find this you know strange document

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,240
which has got names and numbers and all

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,340
that sort of stuff and it was collected

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,039
for a particular purpose at the time and

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,929
then never looked at but 100 years into

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,000
the future some research arrows going

00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:32,710
what is this and has these great

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,360
insights like Bonnie's just shared and I

00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,789
feel like there's a kind of tension

00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,980
there between we want to like not

00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:41,350
collect stuff because we want to protect

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,850
people's privacy and not be custodian

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,879
zuv potentially sensitive information

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:47,620
but on the flip side we also really like

00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:50,320
digging in the archives and finding

00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,450
stuff out so how do we reconcile that

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,730
yeah I have a good example of that

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:57,549
actually which I kept thinking about

00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:02,200
because I can't decide what my ethical

00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:05,769
position is which is a project that was

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,500
in the news early last year where some

00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:13,300
researchers had gathered up all of these

00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:14,460
library loans records from mostly from

00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,409
[Music]

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,480
mechanics institutes and it was a lot of

00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:21,389
regional libraries Latino they're in

00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,279
gold fields and this sort of thing and

00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:26,620
they done all this analysis of you know

00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:30,170
asking questions like well what did

00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:32,690
butchers read in you know 1870

00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:34,880
which was like really interesting and

00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:38,480
also made me deeply uncomfortable

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,160
because it was exactly the sort of stuff

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,100
that we talk about now it's like oh we

00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,420
definitely can't you know even yeah well

00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,150
throw all that daughter out you know

00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:49,340
that's that's private data now they

00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,660
would argue I assume like oh these

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,480
people are all dead now you know they

00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,880
don't have privacy yeah and it is really

00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,210
interesting but at the same times like

00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:01,429
is it is it ethical even if they're not

00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:04,880
alive anymore like if we can you breach

00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:08,090
the privacy of somebody who's deceased

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,880
and it's it's a really interesting

00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:14,600
question now in that case most of those

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,400
people were of a you know sort of

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,730
British or European background with

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,320
their with but not all um you know it's

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,960
a sort of cultural norms around their

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,910
gets even more complicated if you're

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,280
starting to bring in you know more

00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:30,110
people with more sorts of cultural norms

00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,630
and backgrounds so I don't know what the

00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,650
answers to that but that's but so you

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,150
know that's gonna happen if you don't

00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,309
think about that now how do you feel

00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:40,820
about finding out that your

00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:43,790
great-grandfather regularly went to the

00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:46,250
library and borrowed stuff that's

00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:48,049
completely antithetical to your your

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,540
your family your history and your values

00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:52,820
and that becomes you know that becomes

00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,679
part of genealogical research and so we

00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,419
you know trove is used in ways people go

00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:59,480
back and find stuff so it's like it's

00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:01,850
kind of like we just we just unraveled

00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,559
one thread and now you know you can pull

00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:06,290
it out so should it exist at all

00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:08,570
or not and whilst the people are dead

00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:12,890
their ancestors aren't that's right

00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:15,110
yeah yeah it's um I thought that was a

00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:16,700
very interesting example because the

00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,429
media stories we're really celebrating

00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,490
this is this oh this is so fascinating

00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:24,110
and isn't this wonderful and me and I

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,450
know several of my librarian friends

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,980
were like what

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:33,380
very gay breath because approval for

00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:35,179
this so interesting questions okay um

00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,919
this is great and this is what I hoped

00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:38,410
would happen but we probably should stay

00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,820
in reasonably on track

00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:44,620
to get to some of the other questions so

00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,420
any other issues that our theoretical

00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,390
Glenanne feel I should be thinking about

00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,280
I was gonna say particularly Wendy

00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,810
anonymizing data considering the

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,790
possibility of rain on amaizing it

00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:57,990
afterward which virtually with lung

00:22:54,790 --> 00:23:02,200
intruded all data can be rather easy

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:07,600
save the old fantasy of being able to

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:11,350
identify something yeah oh yeah do you

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:15,940
all know about that that was great so

00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:18,700
some researchers did some did a bit of

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:22,690
that they got a whole bunch of so my key

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:25,930
is the the public transport smart card

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,460
in Victoria they were provided as I

00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,560
understand are provided with this data

00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,320
by the Victorian Department

00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:34,840
transportation or whatever they called

00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:37,080
yeah yeah oh yeah yeah so sorry yes

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,680
everybody was professional

00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,840
everyone was provided with this

00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,310
information and the department was like

00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,030
no it's all cool

00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:48,370
it's de-identified because it it's only

00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:50,590
the number of the color right we we

00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:52,390
removed all of if because you can

00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,920
register your card or or not your choice

00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,330
right so if people had registered their

00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,740
card with their name and whatever they

00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,120
just they didn't include that

00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:03,280
information and they made everything

00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:05,740
else available and some researchers

00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:13,450
worked out that they could combine that

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:16,300
with Twitter history and they could

00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:18,550
identify people who are like 20 all just

00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:22,390
going past Victoria Park train station

00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:24,070
now right and actually could react could

00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:26,890
I rent afire some of this data they've

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,390
actually identify which card belonged to

00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:30,550
a particular person and of course once

00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:33,160
they had done that that could then get a

00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:35,770
history of all of their travel they only

00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,990
they only had to identify one instance

00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:40,450
where okay we're pretty sure it's that

00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,740
card belongs to this account and then

00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,630
they've got the whole travel history of

00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,070
that individual so it was it was an

00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:47,260
example where they the department

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:49,090
thought they'd you know done the right

00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:52,480
thing but

00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:53,289
hadn't quite thought of through my joy

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,820
it

00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:56,679
that's an interesting example because

00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,320
that data would be much less valuable if

00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:00,820
it was truly de-identified if he was any

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,779
kind of there's a whole bunch of things

00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,100
you just couldn't do you wouldn't be

00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:06,730
able to track an individual card which

00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:10,600
was kind of the whole point so a good

00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:15,999
example whoever yard that out all right

00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:20,409
shall we move on what was our next

00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:22,840
question okay so and this is a nice

00:25:20,409 --> 00:25:26,139
broad one what can we do to encourage

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,700
more innovative uses of glam so are

00:25:26,139 --> 00:25:30,940
there things that we can bake into our

00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:32,499
API that are gonna make it easier rather

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:35,889
than harder to do interesting things

00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:38,850
that the the library or the gallery or

00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:44,799
the museum hasn't necessarily thought of

00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:50,289
so who's heard of wiki data so it's a

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:53,230
database for hind Wikipedia what it it

00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:56,950
stores things like Mount Everest how

00:25:53,230 --> 00:26:01,350
tall is it what's the national anthem of

00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:05,769
Australia all sorts of random facts so

00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:08,409
what you can do is link your all of your

00:26:05,769 --> 00:26:11,169
identifiers so if you've got a public

00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:13,990
URL that says such and such as in a

00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:16,029
painting in your art gallery you can

00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,639
then have an entry in wiki dated today

00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:21,789
here's the thing if you actually want to

00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:23,320
go and find the painting you should then

00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:27,549
before be able to query where he did it

00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:30,149
hard to say which museums and which art

00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:33,610
galleries have paintings by this artists

00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:36,909
so if you can start working with other

00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:38,139
open databases shove your data in and

00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:42,429
hopefully everyone else shoves their

00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:44,470
data in hopefully you can then say be

00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:47,249
able to cross link between things a

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,249
little bit more

00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:56,429
open link data yeah that reminds me of a

00:26:53,289 --> 00:27:00,059
project I sort of worked on with the

00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:03,100
South Australian library they were

00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:07,360
gifted or custodians of this vast

00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:09,610
repository of Red Cross data from World

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,919
War one and they wanted to get it sort

00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:14,919
of digitized and cross-linked and stuff

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,929
for you know the whole Anzac glory glory

00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,970
glory hallelujah stuff that was going on

00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:21,249
at the time but that was a real problem

00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,200
the link data and that also fed into the

00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:25,240
location stuff that what a place is

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,539
called now is not what it was then so I

00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,009
think that I think that is would really

00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:31,299
unlock a whole lot of stuff but it seems

00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:39,610
to be a much harder problem than

00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:41,919
everyone thinks it is just as a very

00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:43,749
general comment as a consumer rather

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,619
than as a representative of an

00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:50,769
institution when I'm consuming an API I

00:27:47,619 --> 00:27:53,259
really want raw data and obviously and

00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:54,549
usually an open format and so if someone

00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:57,610
comes along as his oh look we could

00:27:54,549 --> 00:28:01,899
auto-generate like some vendor says our

00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:06,580
API creates Excel spreadsheets or PDF

00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:07,990
reports that's of almost no use to me as

00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:13,110
a developer if you want to develop

00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:13,110
audience you want very raw open formats

00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:29,860
so we talked a lot about consuming using

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,400
data through the API accessing data I

00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:35,250
wonder if we can also send something

00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:41,020
back so that could be something

00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:43,540
innovative API is can do well depending

00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:46,510
on what therefore I can do it both ways

00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:50,080
so I wonder if it could be a way to say

00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:54,700
our just like the example that Claire

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:56,110
gave actually involve people who have a

00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,900
look at the data do something creative

00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:02,200
maybe they can send something back and

00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:03,100
share it again fairly easily through

00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,559
that API

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:09,190
I'll tell the personal story that

00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:10,990
they're happy to share to to add to that

00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,420
landscape around the data set or

00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,730
something I think it's something to

00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:20,820
consider making both ways rather than

00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:20,820
just one way right

00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:34,180
so he putting hand up for a second there

00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:40,270
Katie you were just stitching anything

00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:59,890
else on this documentation it sounds so

00:29:40,270 --> 00:30:02,440
simple there's part of that I would also

00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:06,070
recommend licensing information very

00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:08,470
it's accessible as it could be I mean a

00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:10,840
lot of this stuff would be copyright

00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,970
unknown but if you've generated the

00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:16,240
metadata because you know your catalog

00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:19,960
staff have created it please release it

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:23,800
under probably cc0 even though you might

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:26,910
want CC by if we have to as a developer

00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:30,070
if I'm aggregating 17 different sources

00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,600
the like the attribution is actually

00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:33,070
really really difficult after you've

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,850
kind of aggregated and created that

00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:40,180
measure and so if it's just place names

00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:43,540
or historic place names and kind of very

00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:46,420
very factual things consider CC zero is

00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,100
quite you know it's close to public

00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:52,570
domain as you can kick without without

00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:54,460
it um I think probably something else

00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:56,290
that would be useful is creating

00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,600
something similar to a UNIX pipe system

00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:00,700
with the different data sources so that

00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,620
you're able to connect the individual

00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:05,200
records and come up with a more full

00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,500
story about say what this location data

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,140
in this place means in an easy way to

00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:13,260
expand on that data and add more context

00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,260
to it

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,550
so basically it's it's more or less a

00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:23,470
concept that you've got one input here

00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:25,590
and you can feed that input in that

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:28,960
output rather into the input of another

00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:31,000
system so basically say we've got a

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,550
record that gives this time series data

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,740
on locations of different the same

00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:39,580
people's movements you're then able to

00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:41,539
use that location data is the input for

00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,520
say weather

00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:45,260
so then not only do you have the

00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,940
location and the time movements you've

00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:50,570
also got the weather periods of that

00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:54,559
time gotcha

00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:55,940
so can I just clarify so that we all

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,610
understand what you're saying

00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:02,659
that would be so we were looking at some

00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:06,770
tabular data earlier so you might

00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:09,020
separate out I certain bits of that data

00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:11,330
so that you can combine them so that

00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,100
that can yeah but you see having the

00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:14,900
different systems interact with one

00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,820
another so that it creates say maybe an

00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:19,460
Esther JSON structure so that you're

00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:22,390
able to incorporate data sources from

00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,390
different services

00:32:41,499 --> 00:32:46,249
I'm gonna try and make a mess of this

00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:48,830
but say I want to know everything that

00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:53,179
happened in the township of yield and

00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:56,149
and I want to pipe yielding as my query

00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:57,739
into trove and then everything that

00:32:56,149 --> 00:33:00,259
comes out of trove

00:32:57,739 --> 00:33:03,529
I want to pipe through back into the

00:33:00,259 --> 00:33:10,820
local library in Eldon because they've

00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:13,159
got all the records I think we may have

00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,169
to also be careful not to try and bake

00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:18,529
in every single thing you can think of

00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:21,289
into that when an API may be defined

00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:23,559
more exactly where we were we're trying

00:33:21,289 --> 00:33:23,559
to do

00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:31,659
yeah like this kind of philosophy lots

00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:34,749
of little things that work well together

00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:38,779
what was said before about wiki data I

00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:41,330
think ties in with another tool that I

00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:44,029
really like open refine that you can use

00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:46,940
to movement data will clean up with

00:33:44,029 --> 00:33:48,830
really cool and algorithms to fix

00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:51,409
inconsistencies but also augment that as

00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:53,239
a wiki data is integrated in that it'd

00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:55,369
be great to see other lots of other

00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:59,389
services that have those reconciliation

00:33:55,369 --> 00:34:01,249
services like and this could be one of

00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:03,979
them and then you could do that kind of

00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:06,379
augmentation of data in a in a dedicated

00:34:03,979 --> 00:34:08,839
application that's specialized for that

00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:11,210
and then the processing could be another

00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:13,909
part depending on what you prefer to use

00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:17,990
to process and then visualize or draw

00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:20,690
conclusions you might be maybe out of

00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:22,700
scope the whole piping and joining and

00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:26,139
doing things for an API I don't know I

00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:26,139
don't know I'm just saying

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:36,200
yeah I also like openrefine very much um

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:39,500
and then this is a tricky one but

00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,599
although it's nightmarish to use I think

00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:43,790
you have to have some kind of open

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,540
fields to capture all the other stuff

00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:50,929
that never fits into anything else

00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:53,210
because even though it's awful it's

00:34:50,929 --> 00:35:05,990
still better to have that little side

00:34:53,210 --> 00:35:09,290
annotation that doesn't just on that

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:13,250
like the open licensing a suggestion

00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:16,190
from over there I think with API the API

00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:18,800
itself needs to be really open so you

00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:20,990
know you get a lot of software now we've

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,450
got a note we've got an API you can you

00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:24,950
can query it but there's no you know

00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,480
there's either no documentation you

00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,550
can't interrogate how it works you don't

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:34,150
know where it goes so the the API

00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:34,150
standard itself must also be open

00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:47,170
so one thing that I am not surprised to

00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:49,150
be hearing what everyone's saying is a

00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:52,120
lot of talk about tools because tools

00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:54,640
and api's go together and in any talk

00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:57,100
about standardizing api's we've also got

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,870
to talk about the tools and maybe

00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:01,180
there's a like libraries of programming

00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:03,160
language libraries around the api maybe

00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:06,490
these are our desktop applications to

00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:11,370
help people especially those who are

00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:13,930
less technical and less code technical

00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:17,230
use the data and make this or things

00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:19,960
like open refine and so on so i mean

00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:22,930
it's one of the great benefits of some

00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,830
kind of standards even though like fully

00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:29,940
standardizing it's hard of course but

00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:32,380
yeah the don't neglect the benefit of

00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,940
standardizing api's in that you'll be

00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:37,500
able to have better and more widely

00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,500
useful tooling around those

00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:52,650
I think - there's an issue around equity

00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:55,920
in the sense that we have a whole lot of

00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:58,880
you know the glam sector is very mixed

00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,140
where you have large prestigious

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,290
organizations and institutions that have

00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:07,020
you know lots of funding both in terms

00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:08,460
of private and public lots of resource

00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,590
seeing all sorts of stuff where they can

00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,420
implement something like this and then

00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:15,180
you have your little Local History

00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:19,080
Society or you have your little Regional

00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,660
Public Library and you know if there's

00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,430
not the infrastructure or I don't know

00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,180
community support to implement something

00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:30,300
like this

00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:33,530
you then have absences from communities

00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:37,980
that really actually do need their voice

00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:39,710
projected into that broader sphere you

00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:45,600
get what I mean

00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:47,520
yes so how do we ensure that I don't

00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,350
know whether it's community support or

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,090
whether there's infrastructure or

00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:53,160
whatever it is to ensure that there's

00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:57,300
equity of course across a sector that is

00:37:53,160 --> 00:38:00,270
not not everyone is equal in so so that

00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:03,840
potentially could be so it's that might

00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:05,580
be built into our API community

00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:08,100
infrastructure that's not actually

00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,880
necessarily a technical solution but as

00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:15,150
a there's a mechanism as part of this

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:19,140
concept yeah to make sure that you know

00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:24,170
the little community local history so it

00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:27,660
doesn't have to either not be visible or

00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:30,180
give all their data to some other

00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,620
institution - could you say that cuz

00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:35,270
they can still kind of have some

00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,270
ownership over is that what you mean

00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:41,250
yeah and there's as well as the obvious

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,890
financial side of that which is how

00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:46,020
having open source tooling and so on

00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:50,820
helps with not having to pay for really

00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:54,000
expensive data tools or pay for API

00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,730
access to collections a big part of that

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,210
is also

00:38:55,730 --> 00:39:02,780
training and documentation because there

00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:05,329
will be a big learning curve for

00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:09,140
anything like what we're talking about

00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:11,300
and it's the small groups that have too

00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,660
much to do already that won't be able to

00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,660
learn

00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:21,700
that's an excellent segue so does anyone

00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:24,470
mind if we move on to the next question

00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:27,980
all right so other things we can do

00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:31,040
around this theoretical project to

00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:33,079
reduce the learning curve and and we've

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,990
specifically said they're both for

00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:38,480
people working in the institutions and

00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:40,760
also and users here means users of the

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,790
API so it could be a developer but it

00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,770
could be just a general community member

00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:47,690
who you know it doesn't want to spend

00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:50,050
the next year learning to code but it

00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:53,060
wants to interact with the data somehow

00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:55,730
are there things that we can do with the

00:39:53,060 --> 00:40:01,369
way we set this up to make people's

00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:05,720
lives simpler something that's easy to

00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:10,550
understand as I use the language a bit

00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:12,200
and there's some recommendations in a

00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:15,500
few different places on how to write

00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,210
code or write functions and one idea is

00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,640
to give names that really mean something

00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:23,390
that I actually spelled out and and

00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:25,880
consistent really giving names that

00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:29,390
might be a bit longer to type but not

00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:32,450
using obscure acronyms I think this

00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:36,500
conference is a good example of acronym

00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:40,520
overload will open the door for more

00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:42,319
people and won't scare them away also

00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:46,819
wondering if we can consider something

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:48,910
like obviously English is the lingua

00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:51,400
franca at the moment in

00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:54,460
at least the technical world and

00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,990
probably applies to most parts of today

00:40:54,460 --> 00:41:02,170
as well but can we consider

00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:06,970
internationalization for this API can

00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:09,850
can each one of those no words used in

00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:11,320
the API be translated to in lots of

00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,610
different languages to make it more

00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:15,820
accessible we kind of forget that

00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:17,440
there's a language is around and that

00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:21,700
ties in our thinking all the other ones

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:24,010
ethical respectful and also opening the

00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:27,130
door to more people will obviously bring

00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:30,100
more innovation to interesting uses that

00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:32,920
you didn't expect to see that's great

00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:35,980
Donna don't I'll put you on the spot but

00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:39,310
I'm just thinking about the way the

00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:40,810
Quahog community do that do you know can

00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:43,900
you share anything about that or it's

00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:45,610
okay if the answer's no so there but the

00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:50,010
way the Koha community deals with

00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:57,220
language yeah so I don't I don't know

00:41:50,010 --> 00:42:00,060
exactly how cool hard does it Koha is an

00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:03,370
open-source library management system I

00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:06,490
was originally out of New Zealand but

00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:09,370
it's apparently the most actually the

00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:11,920
most widely used library management

00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:13,270
system in the world which is

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,980
extraordinary because it's in lots of

00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,960
little libraries and it's free and

00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:20,140
anyone can come if you know startup but

00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:23,080
it has quite a high learning curve

00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:25,360
around it but it but for librarians it's

00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,370
great and it has lots of different

00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,340
languages like the the interface has

00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:31,450
been translated into more languages than

00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,460
perhaps most cuz there's no commercial

00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:36,250
imperative but a community says I need

00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:39,370
this in my own language and catalyst

00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:41,230
bless them paid money to get the Maori

00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:43,300
translation done because this is a New

00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:45,460
Zealand based library management system

00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:47,110
but you can go to a Maori library and

00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:50,530
interrogate the library management

00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:52,150
system in Maori and they have a big

00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:53,710
translation you know they have big

00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:55,870
community around each of those languages

00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:58,740
but I think and this is similar in

00:42:55,870 --> 00:43:01,900
Drupal as well is that there is a

00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:02,650
community around that language that

00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,390
works

00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:07,180
the translation and so whenever there's

00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:10,660
a code release there's a notification

00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:12,269
made to say okay go for it go translate

00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,740
the strings here's the new strings

00:43:12,269 --> 00:43:17,019
here's the strings that have changed and

00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:18,369
so that's all well documented so that

00:43:17,019 --> 00:43:20,559
the community has that language

00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:23,259
expertise can then get in there and do

00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:25,299
that translation so I think that using

00:43:23,259 --> 00:43:26,740
open-source systems that have you know

00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:28,529
communities of interest around

00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:31,210
particular language is real key to

00:43:28,529 --> 00:43:35,319
unlocking that challenge I think we're

00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:38,740
in a very you know Anglophone centric

00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:40,240
world in Australia and we need I think

00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:44,579
we need to tap into our multicultural

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,579
communities much much more than we do

00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:53,499
let's gonna say on the pick up on your

00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:58,509
thing about jargon might be a good idea

00:43:53,499 --> 00:44:00,809
to include a glossary or something in

00:43:58,509 --> 00:44:04,690
your API like an endpoint for a

00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:08,559
dictionary to tell people what weird

00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:11,859
words mean and I was also thinking about

00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:19,029
the native innovative uses thing maybe

00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:21,690
you could include references to sources

00:44:19,029 --> 00:44:24,130
where your data has already been used

00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:26,109
potentially so that you could kind of

00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:31,150
discover where other people are using it

00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:33,249
and might kind of lead you to yeah so

00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,599
might lead you to say ah this is what

00:44:33,249 --> 00:44:37,150
other people are doing with your data

00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:44,319
with the data that you're looking at or

00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:47,700
have done in the past the cake yes

00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:49,930
that's that's funny actually because we

00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,180
sort of keep harping on about it but

00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:54,759
that does tie back into the discussion

00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:56,079
we had in Sydney two years ago when one

00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:58,059
of the things we were talking about was

00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:00,220
you've got all of these institutions

00:44:58,059 --> 00:45:02,739
particularly in Australia sort of saying

00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:04,329
this you know with love as people who

00:45:02,739 --> 00:45:08,619
may have worked in some of them in the

00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:10,720
past I'm really good at telling the

00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:12,190
world about you know here's we've got

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,710
this we've got this darkness error we've

00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:16,300
got this collection go and play with it

00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:21,690
and really really bad

00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:24,820
at sort of telling the world about

00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:27,460
things that have been done which tartar

00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:30,990
already which was why

00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:33,760
Bonnie's example of what was it made

00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:34,360
made we still every New South Wales or

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,750
whatever it was

00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:38,860
yeah that hashtag I mean that's that

00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,420
didn't exist at the time we'll have this

00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:43,440
conversation so it's that sort of thing

00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:46,090
would be fantastic

00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,440
yeah said just to support a couple of

00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:49,150
the things that have already been said I

00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,160
think the internationalization is really

00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:53,170
important particularly for languages

00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,540
that are markedly different from English

00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:58,660
like if you can do stuff in Arabic in a

00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:02,080
little bit they will use it if it's an

00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:04,030
English they'll just stop on the the

00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,610
naming and the use of lotteries and

00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:08,530
terminology and stuff I think we need to

00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:11,680
use the terminology that's used in the

00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:13,960
glam sector and not in the IT sector so

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:18,760
for instance one thing that I have

00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:21,400
tripped over before is that owner of a

00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,280
database okay means something very

00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,840
different when you're talking to

00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,540
indigenous people too when you're

00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,550
talking to software developers so they

00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:32,320
the software developers had said oh the

00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:35,080
owner of the database is this and the

00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:37,170
traditional owners went what and I'd say

00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,310
no no no no they don't mean it like that

00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:41,860
they just mean it's the person who

00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:46,050
created the database so yeah it needs to

00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:46,050
be from the other side

00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:55,960
I think it's also to not make

00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:58,810
assumptions that people know what's

00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:01,380
going on beforehand so trying to explain

00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:04,000
to someone what the Health github is is

00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,370
really hard when they don't understand

00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,200
how it all formed in the first place so

00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:12,360
it's trying to remove those assumptions

00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,360
and explain things from the start

00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:20,320
I'm picking up on what Claire was saying

00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:23,020
I think that there would it may already

00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:26,250
exist and if so please tell me but it

00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:31,360
would be really great to have a database

00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:33,640
disambiguation project for glam and IT

00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:35,560
because I there are lots of things where

00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,600
that comes up where the world of

00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:42,010
librarians and archives and and

00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:43,420
databases pre-exists IT yeah but I tell

00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,550
you have this assumption that they know

00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,890
it all about and I feel like there's

00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:50,470
like I've seen this like aha moment

00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:52,420
happens so many times but having some

00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:55,090
like actual saying yes we know we're

00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:57,040
using the same word but it means

00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:58,930
something completely different would be

00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:12,100
really useful does anyone know if

00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:13,750
there's something like that I remembered

00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:16,810
what the other thing was the ability to

00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:20,290
for people to feed stuff back which is

00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:24,750
not just putting information in but

00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:28,270
actually give feedback and actually

00:48:24,750 --> 00:48:30,990
contribute and say hey we need this and

00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:33,940
we want to go in that direction

00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:37,680
our workflows need us to be able to do

00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:37,680
this this and this can you guys

00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:45,830
I mean probably doesn't have a lot to do

00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:48,230
with this standardization per se but I

00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:50,030
believe the tools called postman for web

00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:52,130
AP is and it gives you a way to use a

00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:55,400
GUI without having to know the actual

00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:57,590
query terms to create queries and then

00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,850
you can just copy and paste it so I

00:48:57,590 --> 00:49:00,170
think that would probably be a great way

00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:08,630
to reduce a learning curve for the

00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:11,900
non-technical crowd I'm not technical

00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:13,400
enough now I would chat about that later

00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:16,820
and a very interesting conversation last

00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,140
year um sorry I was running something

00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:23,180
down there for gonna was it the ability

00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:24,740
to R to contribute not not yes you can

00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:28,970
feedback on the project not to provide

00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:30,470
data back to thee yeah and so that sits

00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:33,830
across encouraging innovation and

00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:35,900
reducing the leaning okay yeah it'd be

00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:40,330
nice to be able to sometimes link back

00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:42,650
so if so I'm also interested in music so

00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:45,950
part of part of the thing they've been

00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:48,170
working on is bling all of the artists

00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:51,530
in wicked wicked outta to mythic brands

00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:52,940
org and just making sure that if you

00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:56,000
query one you should be able to get to

00:49:52,940 --> 00:50:00,740
the other and vice versa so if as you're

00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:04,130
developing things about things think

00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:06,800
about what other things are around you

00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:09,740
what other projects have other museum

00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:11,780
that and say I put something someone

00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:15,350
else has got something let's make sure

00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:19,210
that you link to each other and say I've

00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:19,210
got two here what else can I look at

00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:31,240
the following up on browsing as opposed

00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:34,340
to searching and generous interfaces

00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,350
because you don't have a question you

00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:38,060
know that there's a vague area so that

00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:40,370
those links is you know and you follow

00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:48,380
down a rabbit hole so the next link to

00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:52,490
the next discovery or next phase yeah so

00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:56,420
that might mean that you have endpoints

00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:58,550
in your API that are allow you to browse

00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:00,560
I've come across some api's where you

00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:03,220
pretty much have to know like a unique

00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:07,460
identifier to get to the full record of

00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:09,350
something and so yeah

00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:13,460
to that end you'd have to make sure that

00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:15,560
your API kind of catered for that and

00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:18,380
sort of being able to look at large

00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:21,980
amounts of kind of return large amounts

00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:26,450
of records in one go rather than forcing

00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:28,370
you to look at one at a time so an API

00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:33,680
so generous interface don't know is that

00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:35,240
that sounds good that's that's an

00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,700
interesting concept in itself you know a

00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:40,580
whole another workshop about that and

00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:44,810
then just in this realm as well involve

00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:46,790
as many of the standards glossaries the

00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:50,270
asari everything that are out there

00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:52,880
because the more you can chuck into it

00:51:50,270 --> 00:51:55,220
the easier it's gonna be for people to

00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,680
access stuff using that terminology that

00:51:55,220 --> 00:52:00,560
they are familiar with so there's heaps

00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:03,950
and heaps of them out there is C doc CRM

00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:08,440
and and all the ayats are stuff and all

00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:11,830
the other ones yes

00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,830
hold that thought

00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:23,390
um Sara's gonna show us the next slide

00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:25,250
now okay

00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,020
so two questions here and you've

00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,970
actually kind of started already asking

00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:30,350
these questions but because there's a

00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:32,390
massive rabbit holes and kind of

00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:34,990
impossible questions to really answer I

00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:38,900
thought I'd put them on the second slide

00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:42,560
so first one is like is it really

00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:46,300
actually possible to do this and who

00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:49,940
would be the logical organization people

00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:51,980
entity to lead the work there's I can

00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,780
think of a number of possible scenarios

00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:56,540
there I don't know whether any of them

00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:58,970
are realistic and the second question is

00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:01,160
just this may not actually make sense to

00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:08,860
anyone other than me because I know

00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:15,020
what's in my head but if you look at the

00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:16,700
IPA later gum today you reading it my

00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:19,310
reading of it and bear in mind that I'm

00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:23,000
a librarian I'm not really a you know

00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:24,560
software developer but it seems to me

00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,120
that what they're thinking about is more

00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,890
about what I would I kind of think of as

00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,500
data format some transfer mechanisms so

00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:33,170
it's things like okay well your API

00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:35,990
should have an endpoint that's called

00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:38,360
this and when people query it the data

00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:40,610
should come back to them in this format

00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:43,520
and it should be kind of structured sort

00:53:40,610 --> 00:53:46,670
of like this but in terms of what the

00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:48,940
data actually is it's silent on that

00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:51,110
which is appropriate because it's

00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:52,520
standard for a whole bunch of different

00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:54,290
departments to do all sorts of different

00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:57,470
things and their API is have all sorts

00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:58,700
of different reasons for existing so for

00:53:57,470 --> 00:54:01,010
their purposes it's not really

00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:03,620
appropriate to say well you know you you

00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:05,180
must use this metadata schema because it

00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:09,530
there's any number of different things

00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:12,020
they're doing so the question for our

00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:14,030
theoretical glamour if you're a witch

00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:17,060
bonnie kind of asked at the beginning

00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:19,760
quite rightly is like is it even

00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:21,320
possible to create a do a

00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,800
standardization project that's talking

00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:26,780
about metadata structure because

00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:30,920
if you're the National Archives of

00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:33,349
Australia or you're the Rijksmuseum you

00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,869
gotta have very different things in your

00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:38,480
collection and there and you know you're

00:54:35,869 --> 00:54:40,160
gonna be using yeah this is there's a

00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,690
reason why for the xkcd there right so

00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,119
there's there's already all of these

00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:46,880
standards in metadata in the glam world

00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:49,819
do we really need another one or is

00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:53,359
there some way we could create this API

00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:55,579
standard that allows for that that still

00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,869
makes it easy for developers to not have

00:54:55,579 --> 00:55:00,680
to reinvent the wheel every time they

00:54:56,869 --> 00:55:04,400
using you API but doesn't try and squash

00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:07,150
all about glam metadata into the lowest

00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:14,059
common denominator does that make sense

00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:17,420
cool um here's got the Mike a standard

00:55:14,059 --> 00:55:18,680
doesn't have to be like a a form with a

00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,359
whole bunch of fields that are all

00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:23,450
compulsory you all have to fill them all

00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:26,900
out right it's it's a matter of working

00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:28,790
out what are a few overall commonalities

00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:30,980
that are really really useful and what

00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:33,380
are some say like modules that can be

00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:37,190
useful in different sectors and then

00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:40,640
maybe having guidelines rather than

00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:43,130
standards for all but some critical

00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,530
things where I think a lot of the things

00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:48,770
we were talking about ethics and data

00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:50,930
governance are a lot of their more

00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:53,319
standardized Abul things at least on a

00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:56,270
higher level the details will vary from

00:55:53,319 --> 00:55:59,440
application to application but I think

00:55:56,270 --> 00:56:02,540
it is really useful to have both

00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:07,670
standards and guidelines for beyond

00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:09,170
those standards I think that's a really

00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:12,079
good point I'll just lighten happiness

00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:13,970
for this whole thing there's so many

00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:16,549
different cases but when I didn't do

00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:18,890
that I deal with the most he's and if

00:56:16,549 --> 00:56:22,160
we're talking about programming in IP is

00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:23,770
the data needs to follow some kind of

00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,119
structure there's already existing

00:56:23,770 --> 00:56:29,390
recommendations around and one that's

00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:30,950
that I like is the tidy data principles

00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:33,319
which are just three simple principles

00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:35,930
and I can put them on the board affair

00:56:33,319 --> 00:56:38,370
but it's an each row is a record each

00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:42,170
column is a single variable and each

00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:45,590
CEL is one single value and this allows

00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:48,270
to go straight into analysis and and

00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:50,970
handling the data consistently through

00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:54,950
the API so did you say that's called

00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:54,950
tidy tidy data

00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:03,660
good yeah you know obviously it doesn't

00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:07,050
work for everything nested data is gonna

00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:11,210
have to be handled differently but most

00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:11,210
of the data will be in that form

00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:20,880
I've watched archaeologists go through

00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:23,370
this process a couple of things you need

00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,650
to aim towards third normal form but you

00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:28,020
need to have a sensible approach to that

00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:30,420
normal form because you enforce strict

00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:33,630
third normal form people can't cope with

00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:36,540
it and that is important that people can

00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:38,070
actually interact with it in terms of

00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:40,280
the data structure I think it's really

00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:43,470
important but you can make it a superset

00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:47,400
rather than a subset so for instance if

00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:50,190
you got a date

00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:53,010
you make it a date/time field and it can

00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:56,400
take the whole shebang so that if

00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:59,760
somebody has the 25th of August 1945 at

00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:03,450
2:30 p.m. it can all go in if somebody's

00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:08,610
only got 1953 then that's fine because

00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:13,140
it's within that but yes that somebody I

00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:16,310
knew who tried to create a an

00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:19,920
application for field recording for just

00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:21,630
ran into exactly this because how do

00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,120
Pete how do archaeologist record in the

00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:28,170
field one of the standards as many as

00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:29,730
they are archaeologists and a thing that

00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:31,590
was so flexible that you could just

00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:34,040
structure it according to what your

00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:34,040
needs were

00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:45,220
this is a question is there such thing

00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:46,660
as a space-time field like we talked

00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:48,940
about date time I know the difference we

00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:53,109
had date field and date time but the

00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:56,710
idea of codifying fit you know like

00:58:53,109 --> 00:59:02,950
geolocation plus time so point in time

00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:12,339
so it's like the space-time is cept they

00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:14,079
kept separate if you scroll on the

00:59:12,339 --> 00:59:16,119
timeline it interactively changes what

00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:18,640
you see on the map if you zoom on the

00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:21,190
map it shows if you click on something

00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:23,109
on the map it shows on the timeline so

00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:28,569
you can you still keep the field

00:59:23,109 --> 00:59:32,710
separate and geo geo reference field and

00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:36,609
a date/time stamp but you can link them

00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:38,109
together so that they you know if if it

00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:40,240
was at a particular time on a particular

00:59:38,109 --> 00:59:44,230
day so you can model things changing

00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:47,589
over time the progress of a volcanic

00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:52,650
eruption down the slope or the changes

00:59:47,589 --> 00:59:52,650
in pottery styles over time in place

00:59:55,810 --> 01:00:06,400
and say with the first question actually

01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:08,500
no not the first question yeah the

01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,300
second part of the first question like I

01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:13,630
was kind of assuming that that would

01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:17,350
have to come from pretty high up so

01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:20,680
presumably people like alia and whatever

01:00:17,350 --> 01:00:23,350
the equivalents are I'm a librarian toy

01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:32,790
and you know about libraries sorry

01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:34,990
they say the museum and Omega a mugger

01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:37,270
it would be really good if someone like

01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:39,880
national library I guess got got behind

01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:42,220
it I can't imagine it coming from

01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:46,990
government they wouldn't really care no

01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:48,670
and I thought but on the on the second

01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:50,650
part I was thinking about this I was

01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:53,460
kind of anticipating that you might go

01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:56,470
there say that's good

01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:59,830
there's things like open API standard

01:00:56,470 --> 01:01:02,590
which is pretty universal I think and

01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:04,840
which use by things like swagger for

01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:07,590
defining API so humanly you would want

01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:10,390
to fit inside something like that and

01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:13,900
occurred to me that you would use

01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:15,760
existing standards for describing things

01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:21,210
where they exist if you could possibly

01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:23,950
convert them somehow like favorite mark

01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:29,740
but RDF or RDA

01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:31,450
sorry for for describing an a a CRT for

01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:33,130
describing library stuff and I'm pretty

01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:36,900
sure there would be similar Stan that's

01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:41,500
the other stuff which he could somehow

01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:47,410
convert to sort of Jason or whatever and

01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:51,040
use that as your standard I was actually

01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:53,590
gonna go thinking about that um coming

01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:57,120
from the library perspective one thing

01:01:53,590 --> 01:02:00,040
that librarians are very good at is is

01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:03,910
quantifying data structure probably to

01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:05,680
the point where there is no flexibility

01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:07,870
in data structure and we're not exactly

01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:09,029
known for lot like except for all of the

01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:11,039
free text fields right

01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:12,419
right and then you can have as many of

01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:15,719
those as you want and there can be

01:02:12,419 --> 01:02:17,699
absolutely no consistency whatsoever but

01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:19,799
I think one of the things that needs to

01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:22,140
actually happen especially you know for

01:02:19,799 --> 01:02:25,079
sustainable data and by sustainable I

01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:28,049
mean future proof is to actually start

01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:30,449
to ignore data structures to a point

01:02:28,049 --> 01:02:32,969
just where obviously we have consistency

01:02:30,449 --> 01:02:37,919
and we have structure but we're not so

01:02:32,969 --> 01:02:41,089
rigid that we have big volumes for set

01:02:37,919 --> 01:02:44,400
volumes that explain how we need to

01:02:41,089 --> 01:02:45,989
describe a metadata and we don't have

01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,169
things like mark they hang around for

01:02:45,989 --> 01:02:50,759
about 40 years too long or they say I

01:02:49,169 --> 01:02:52,439
tell you which is still very used

01:02:50,759 --> 01:02:53,819
etcetera so I think I think part of the

01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:56,279
problem as well when you're looking at

01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:58,619
these sort of things is that data

01:02:56,279 --> 01:03:00,630
structure is good but it's only good if

01:02:58,619 --> 01:03:04,189
you have the flexibility to change it

01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:08,329
when you need to or before you need to

01:03:04,189 --> 01:03:08,329
because we're about 50 years to life

01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:28,380
anyone else answering the first question

01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:34,890
what could we do to make this actually

01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:36,869
happen and who would lead the work if

01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:40,500
two things come to mind and one is we

01:03:36,869 --> 01:03:42,540
should just start and the other is that

01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:44,880
what from what you just said is perfect

01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:49,800
as the enemy of the good I think trying

01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:52,560
to do that thing that librarians do so

01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:53,940
well and get exactly what this needs to

01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:58,500
be and exactly how it's going to work

01:03:53,940 --> 01:04:00,060
means it'll never happen and I'm sort of

01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:02,280
you know I kind of just had this aha

01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:05,160
moment where work came flooding into my

01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:07,319
brain and I'm in the open innovation

01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:09,750
labs at Red Hat one of the things we do

01:04:07,319 --> 01:04:12,119
is we start with a discovery day get all

01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:13,920
the right people in the room and say

01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:16,260
what is it that we're we're trying to do

01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,819
together and you sort of start there and

01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:19,800
you go well what do we have and how can

01:04:17,819 --> 01:04:22,859
we start and it's very kind of organic

01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:24,480
and because that's just an ideas day to

01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:26,040
get to where you you know what it is

01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,170
that you're trying to do together you're

01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:30,240
designing some kind of future project

01:04:28,170 --> 01:04:33,210
and that's sort of how you start that's

01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:35,790
your first step and so I think that's

01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:37,770
something that needs to happen and you

01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:39,300
know who would lead the work well you

01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:42,690
know who wants to lead the work who

01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:44,339
wants to be in that room and then you

01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:45,900
know where's a place that that could

01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:48,210
happen and could it be virtual could you

01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:50,190
start with with online discovery where

01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:53,849
you know you say this day this time this

01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:55,170
place maybe 24 hours so that lots of

01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:58,710
people from different parts of the world

01:04:55,170 --> 01:05:00,960
can participate or some organization

01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:03,030
like Kaval that has a nice room could

01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,880
say hey who's available can come and

01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:07,500
let's have a day where we you know flush

01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,990
it out and like have a conversation like

01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,859
this but make sure that we've got like I

01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:13,349
think I said up there we've got

01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:15,390
librarians and cultural custodians and

01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:18,329
software developers and data scientists

01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:20,280
and API developers in the room to kind

01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:22,170
of throw around some ideas and you've

01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,250
got people who go actually I've tried

01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:25,349
that and it doesn't work for these

01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:27,690
reasons someone else can award about X

01:05:25,349 --> 01:05:30,210
and you have this whole other explosion

01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:34,130
that's to me how you make it actually

01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:34,130
happen also money

01:05:39,329 --> 01:05:44,739
um if I can just give an example there

01:05:42,519 --> 01:05:46,900
is something called hearest that a

01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:51,039
friend of mine developed and it's called

01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:53,549
hearest because it is that the first

01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:58,599
thing that works that is good enough

01:05:53,549 --> 01:06:01,809
without being perfect and it's he

01:05:58,599 --> 01:06:05,650
designed it well he started as in order

01:06:01,809 --> 01:06:08,470
to do kind of bibliographic software but

01:06:05,650 --> 01:06:13,359
then it grew into just a database to

01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:14,680
support researchers and he was working

01:06:13,359 --> 01:06:18,700
at the University of Sydney at the time

01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:21,549
and it spread from there and when I was

01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:24,579
helping out with some of the user

01:06:21,549 --> 01:06:27,130
support they were like five hundred and

01:06:24,579 --> 01:06:29,920
something uses all over the world all

01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:32,289
using this database so I was gonna say

01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,849
he would can lead the work can be the

01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:35,380
community because he started out doing

01:06:33,849 --> 01:06:36,640
something and then somebody said oh I've

01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:38,920
got this great project and that would

01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,019
almost work can you make it do eggs and

01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:44,470
then somebody else said yeah and can you

01:06:41,019 --> 01:06:47,289
make it also do why and it you know and

01:06:44,470 --> 01:06:49,599
his thing has so it comes with some

01:06:47,289 --> 01:06:52,569
stock entities there's people there's

01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,400
organizations there's various things

01:06:52,569 --> 01:06:55,569
like that that have stock fields and

01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,180
then beyond that you can do what you

01:06:55,569 --> 01:07:00,759
like and the other thing that I would

01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:03,239
relate to this is do have people who

01:07:00,759 --> 01:07:06,279
have actual projects that they want

01:07:03,239 --> 01:07:13,749
because that will make it actually run

01:07:06,279 --> 01:07:16,359
somewhere and drive it and sometimes the

01:07:13,749 --> 01:07:19,359
best way was something this big and

01:07:16,359 --> 01:07:24,309
complicated and nebulous and scary is to

01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:27,700
start small pick one concrete useable

01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:31,180
little corner of it and start there and

01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:33,460
see where it takes you and maybe this is

01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:35,920
also like a good situation where you

01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:38,589
could get kind of little working groups

01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:41,559
in a few of the different sectors that

01:07:38,589 --> 01:07:44,530
are working on their own little concrete

01:07:41,559 --> 01:07:53,200
piece and then just staying

01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:56,260
discussion with each other this is

01:07:53,200 --> 01:08:00,460
probably evil - Claire don't beat me out

01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:02,230
for this one is is this is there one

01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:09,940
that already exists that we should just

01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:12,550
colonize well it's interesting you say

01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:17,650
that because Sara and I were talking

01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:19,450
about this last week and I think mmm the

01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:22,359
biggest problem with getting something

01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:23,710
like this off the ground in Australia is

01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:29,859
that we have this wonderful thing called

01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:32,470
trove right and a lot of like not just

01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:34,270
libraries a lot of glam in memory

01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:36,339
institutions or you know whatever you

01:08:34,270 --> 01:08:38,680
want to call them have sort of gone wow

01:08:36,339 --> 01:08:40,390
this Tribune's infrastructure is pretty

01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:46,150
cool and all the research has known that

01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:48,790
it exists already and so the the sort of

01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:50,350
de facto national standard for a fer is

01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:51,759
is like just get your data into trove

01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:55,210
and then everyone can just use the trove

01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:57,520
API so that's like good but it's also

01:08:55,210 --> 01:09:00,670
bad because it means that everyone's

01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:02,470
relying on the national library and the

01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:04,839
constraints they're under and the

01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:07,150
funding and it's the National Library

01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:09,759
that's making the decisions it's not the

01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:13,450
whole community of potential users and

01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:14,680
data owners and so on so I mean I don't

01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:16,420
know what the answer to that is but it's

01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:19,120
sort of it's it's an extra little

01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:21,540
complication if we're staying thinking

01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:24,730
about doing this here you know you know

01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:28,930
in a way even though I think it's crazy

01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:30,880
that the the way the u.s. sort of system

01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:34,540
is structured with a sort of heaven

01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:36,400
National Library but don't really in

01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:40,779
some ways it's a something like that is

01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:43,680
kind of easier because there's there's

01:09:40,779 --> 01:09:46,839
no one who's the although in haven't the

01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:54,870
digital Public Library of America which

01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:54,870
is kind of based on on how trove works

01:09:56,750 --> 01:10:02,250
don't want to pencil you ask look okay

01:10:00,449 --> 01:10:04,280
what's in my view the biggest thing

01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:08,820
that's missing from the from a trove API

01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:13,829
is a community governance mechanism it's

01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:15,239
it's a national library project and you

01:10:13,829 --> 01:10:18,210
know I have a huge respect for the

01:10:15,239 --> 01:10:21,630
National Library but I have no formal

01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:24,889
input as you know as someone who who has

01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:28,800
made stuff that uses the the trove API

01:10:24,889 --> 01:10:31,020
they've surveyed me but I have no formal

01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:39,179
mechanism to input into the development

01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:41,369
of that project and yeah that's right so

01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:43,320
exactly so if you're if you're a user of

01:10:41,369 --> 01:10:46,260
the trove API and you're like ah

01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:49,409
wouldn't it be cool if it did X the only

01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:51,809
way you can get it to do that is to run

01:10:49,409 --> 01:10:53,520
an email to the national library and say

01:10:51,809 --> 01:10:55,849
it would be really awesome if you added

01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:58,860
this to your API and then they're

01:10:55,849 --> 01:11:01,829
massively overworked and under resourced

01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:04,559
trove team well you know add that ticket

01:11:01,829 --> 01:11:06,960
to their huge to-do list and then

01:11:04,559 --> 01:11:08,849
somebody in the National probably some

01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,940
committee in the National Library will

01:11:08,849 --> 01:11:14,480
decide based on their own priorities

01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:14,480
whether to do that

01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:36,650
into the federal side of things with

01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:39,440
government unfortunately well it depends

01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:42,220
I mean if you look at I mean someone's

01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:45,650
trove is an excellent example is because

01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:47,300
trove was was as I understand it trove

01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:48,680
has never actually originally on any

01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:52,220
kind of that we thought like there

01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:55,550
wasn't some you know National Library

01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:57,710
strategic plan that was create trove

01:11:55,550 --> 01:12:01,520
right it was sort of a few staff members

01:11:57,710 --> 01:12:05,090
who sneakily sort of did it because they

01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:09,650
thought it would be cool and then it

01:12:05,090 --> 01:12:12,470
kind of became popular enough that it

01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:13,670
had to become a formal formal thing that

01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:17,540
the National Library did because it was

01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:19,910
it was really populist so even in that

01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:21,860
respect I don't think there's like this

01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:23,420
legislation around how they get funded

01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:24,830
and how there's they're stuffing lives

01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:26,900
up but there's there's nothing stopping

01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:29,290
them saying actually we don't want to do

01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,290
this anymore

01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:35,720
yeah so so that's a good that's a good

01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:46,840
suggestion you know maybe we just kind

01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:46,840
of take over trove yeah

01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,960
yeah

01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:03,160
so yeah thinking about it

01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:06,150
internationally there's basically

01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:10,150
there's the trove API there's Europeana

01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:13,870
and there's DPLA which is in the States

01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:19,180
probably you'd want to you'd want to do

01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:23,110
it with one of those um I'd say invade

01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:26,620
wiki data so your data is it no online

01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:31,440
database it's reasonably freeform so it

01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:34,420
has references to molecules for science

01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:38,920
and all sorts of other specialist

01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:44,650
interests and it's it's sort of becoming

01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:47,860
the universal way to query things random

01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:51,190
things that are across things so so if

01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:53,050
you're interested in arts or if you're

01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:56,200
interested in libraries or something

01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:58,690
you'll you'll be able to say whatever

01:13:56,200 --> 01:14:02,340
the universal API for library is this is

01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:05,260
a person these other things have

01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:08,200
information about this person everything

01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:13,840
else should link to that to say I need

01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:16,630
some information this is I need your

01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:18,940
entry in the database that represents

01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:21,970
that if it doesn't have it you can

01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:24,070
easily suggest new features and it'll

01:14:21,970 --> 01:14:27,550
all be added to make them possible so

01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:31,000
it's not it's not as it's not a strict

01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:34,030
thing it's more of a free-form and able

01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:36,310
to adapt sort of model and easier once

01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:39,460
it's got an identifier and you've linked

01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:43,480
your stuff to them you can then use it

01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:49,930
as the universal meeting point for

01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:52,930
everything on the note of trove can't be

01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:55,990
open sourced I think that's a very

01:14:52,930 --> 01:14:58,870
relevant thing to think about for the

01:14:55,990 --> 01:15:01,150
idea of standardizing api's for our glam

01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:03,730
institutions because trove as a whole

01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:07,360
can't be open sourced but maybe parts of

01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:11,220
it can so of course this is a really

01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:13,970
really hard problem especially where

01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:17,310
sensitive and private data is concerned

01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:20,130
and how to exactly make the data

01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:22,620
ownership and the constraints around

01:15:20,130 --> 01:15:27,240
access work is is definitely a hard

01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:31,800
problem but not all of the aspects of

01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:33,900
the API necessarily need to reside with

01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:37,320
the people who manage the actual data

01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:43,590
itself right so there can be multiple

01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:45,300
levels involved and whether yeah exactly

01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:48,030
how that will work I don't know but I

01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:50,100
think that's something to think about

01:15:48,030 --> 01:15:51,950
when we're looking at this as like a

01:15:50,100 --> 01:15:54,540
whole system

01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:56,640
what parts can we separate out from

01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:58,710
those who have ownership and

01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,800
responsibility for the actual data and

01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:04,350
what can be made more open while still

01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:15,540
satisfying the constraints of that data

01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:18,630
custodianship I think I'm missing some

01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:22,050
fundamental understanding about what we

01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:25,230
mean by an API standard as opposed to an

01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:28,800
API and as opposed to the data we're

01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:32,130
kind of sucking in and pushing through

01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:34,680
is this a standard to me as something

01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:38,190
that sets up you know it's separate to

01:16:34,680 --> 01:16:41,340
all of those things but it guides how

01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:44,340
those things should be created and

01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:46,050
interoperate right so I think that's the

01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:47,550
thing is we've got to kind of kind of go

01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:51,480
back with what we're talking about with

01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:56,550
a standard is an agreement that this is

01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:59,310
how we want to work together sort of yes

01:16:56,550 --> 01:17:01,050
I probably missed some vital information

01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:02,610
the beginning of that we're gonna have

01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:04,350
to wind this up in a second but just to

01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:07,050
answer your question in terms of what I

01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:11,550
was thinking out you've got say you've

01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:16,340
got a you've got an endpoint right it's

01:17:11,550 --> 01:17:18,849
like and you've got say you've got trove

01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:23,440
anyway blah blah blah

01:17:18,849 --> 01:17:25,840
so that's standard okay so the National

01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:27,179
Library has an endpoint on their API and

01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,949
it's called

01:17:27,179 --> 01:17:33,520
you know it's got this URL structure and

01:17:29,949 --> 01:17:36,790
when you ping that endpoint you're going

01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:38,710
to get data back in a particular format

01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:42,730
and it's going to be structured in a

01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:46,030
particular way and then at the here

01:17:42,730 --> 01:17:47,530
under library I'm going to implement my

01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:52,360
own API but I'm going to use the

01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:54,760
standard so at my domain name I'll have

01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:57,219
an endpoint that's structured exactly

01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:59,139
the same way and then you'll get data

01:17:57,219 --> 01:18:00,639
and it will be different it'll be data

01:17:59,139 --> 01:18:02,560
about a different thing but it will be

01:18:00,639 --> 01:18:06,480
structured in the same way and so if

01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:10,540
you're writing a Apple something then

01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:12,460
you can easily just plug in a different

01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:13,750
library and you'll you know you're gonna

01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:17,949
get the data in a particular structure

01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:20,770
in a particular way so we talked a lot

01:18:17,949 --> 01:18:26,409
about trove but also like koha has a

01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:27,849
bunch of api's yes but your hair is a

01:18:26,409 --> 01:18:31,329
library management system it's not going

01:18:27,849 --> 01:18:33,599
to be good for cars or galleries or

01:18:31,329 --> 01:18:33,599
whatever

01:18:45,150 --> 01:18:49,540
I'm gonna throw it here and then we're

01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:54,100
gonna wind up didn't mean to have the

01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:57,780
last word but um flipside argument to

01:18:54,100 --> 01:19:00,880
that would be this is extremely hard and

01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:03,430
it shouldn't really matter what the

01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:05,340
structure of your API is as long as as

01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:08,140
you said it's extremely well documented

01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:11,980
shouldn't really matter as long as you

01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:16,380
can understand how it works

01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:16,380
doesn't really need to be standardized

01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:37,000
all right I think that's imbue tafoya

01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:40,180
night to end on why are we wasting our

01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:44,020
time structuring all this data to throw

01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:46,470
it out there um that's an excellent

01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:49,630
question okay so Sarah and I are gonna

01:19:46,470 --> 01:19:52,240
record this I'm gonna take a photo of

01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:53,710
the whiteboard and then off write it up

01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:59,830
in some semi structure but not too

01:19:53,710 --> 01:20:01,810
structured way if you're on Twitter you

01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:05,470
can continue the conversation using the

01:20:01,810 --> 01:20:07,090
go glam hashtag I'll probably write a

01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:11,310
little blog post at some point the next

01:20:07,090 --> 01:20:14,830
week kind of doing a bit of a summary

01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:17,200
and I'll also be putting through a

01:20:14,830 --> 01:20:19,330
proposal for next year at the next LCA

01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:21,280
to continue this conversation on it and

01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:22,570
I think there's some good stuff that we

01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:23,950
can do and there's other conferences

01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:29,620
that we can sort of do a little meetups

01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:30,010
along the way as well yeah that'd be

rest of the conference if you're not

01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,980
convinced other glam people to come to

01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:39,590
this because I think it would be nice to

01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:41,240
get a diverse set of ideas not just

01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:42,590
technical people and not just some

01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:47,510
people that we've dragged along with us

01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:50,420
but you know be nice I thought I want to

01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:52,220
share and I think the the go glam mini

01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:54,950
conference is awesome

01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:59,420
and here come share our gratitude to the

01:21:54,950 --> 01:22:01,250
record a realization we had at the

01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:04,280
education mini conference a long long

01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:05,840
time ago is that teachers were never

01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:10,250
going to come to the education in many

01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:13,700
conferred LCA so LCA people need to

01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:17,420
start going to glam events if we want to

01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:19,100
mix and interact more with with people

01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:20,120
who are in the coalface underground

01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:23,540
world and I think that it's that

01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:29,750
cross-pollination sense is is worth

01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:31,750
thinking about well we're hoping to have

01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:35,180
a few but there is there's a vallah

01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:40,520
conference in February which you and

01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:42,590
Katie are actually running but there's

01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:45,020
also the violet tech camp that runs

01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:46,850
every two years that gives an

01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:48,200
opportunity for a bit of

01:22:46,850 --> 01:22:49,220
cross-pollination and learning about

01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:52,340
open source and learning about

01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:55,750
technology in libraries and anyone in

01:22:52,340 --> 01:22:57,890
the glam sector so there's those sort of

01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:59,690
stuff happening and there's also a new

01:22:57,890 --> 01:23:02,780
cardigan that's doing some cool stuff as

01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:04,380
well so we might put together a list of

01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:06,300
things to follow and play

01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:09,260
is to go to and all that sort of thing

01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,710
and we can keep a calendar going maybe

01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:13,560
that's a good idea

01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:16,139
cool all right cool thanks very much

01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:18,090
