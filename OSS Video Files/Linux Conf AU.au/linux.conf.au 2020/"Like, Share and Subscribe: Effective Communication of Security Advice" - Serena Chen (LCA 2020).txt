For everyday people, security advice is confusing, boring, and ever changing. In response, we’ve developed what essentially are superstitious habits — theatrical, security-flavoured actions that we repeat in hopes of protecting ourselves from “the hackers”.

There are two big problems here. First, how do we effectively communicate relevant security advice to non-experts? And secondly, is that advice even persuasive enough to encourage real behavioural change? What kind of advice should we be conveying, and to whom?

In this talk we cover why everyday people don’t follow security advice. To help us come up with some solutions, we introduce concepts from behavioural design, psychology and medicine. And I put the theory to the test by trialing some unconventional ways of communicating security to the masses.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

ah good morning everyone

00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,350
we've got Sarina Chen coming up so I'd

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,520
like you all to join me in welcoming her

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,340
to the stage

00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,340
[Applause]

00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,310
I am going to unmute myself can everyone

00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:22,580
hear me

00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:26,710
yay okay cool hi hello I'm Serena and I

00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:29,180
work at the intersection of security and

00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,250
design

00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,020
before we start I'd also like to pay my

00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,480
respects to the elders of the ugambi

00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:37,670
people both past present and emerging I

00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,980
acknowledge that these lands were never

00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,960
seeded these lands were stolen and that

00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:45,589
we benefit from colonial violence at

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,000
this gathering today I'd also like to

00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:50,239
acknowledge that these words are

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,790
meaningless without real action real

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,900
work and sacrifice from those of us who

00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:59,839
benefit from the in Justices thank you

00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,809
for having me today in this talk we're

00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:07,159
going to take a break take a step

00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:09,860
outside of our tech industry and today I

00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,290
want to equip you with some tools and

00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:14,690
ideas to help you communicate security

00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:18,049
advice to the people who you love in

00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:20,060
your lives but firstly I would like to

00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:24,850
introduce you to someone who I think is

00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:29,180
pretty cool this is my dad

00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:30,409
my dad is pretty cool yeah he's got some

00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,920
pretty sweet Sunny's there but it is

00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:37,009
actually my dad um he had a stereo

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,570
startup in the 90s he has a degree in

00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:40,509
aerospace engineering my dad is

00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,340
literally a rocket scientist

00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:46,549
my dad is smart and he knows about

00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,950
computers in the 90s he introduced me to

00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:51,799
this like brand new startup and we

00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,600
geeked out about how it only took like a

00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:58,729
tenth of a second to complete a search

00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:04,789
and it was a big deal it's good time but

00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:10,100
this is his operating system and this is

00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:11,170
his internet browser we've just made it

00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,220
through the holiday season

00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:16,550
congratulations everyone we're 30 other

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:19,250
side but chances are you have probably

00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:22,010
gone and seen your loved ones and

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,560
performed your annual duties as their IT

00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,410
support

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,940
and chances are you probably saw some

00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:33,790
pretty scary practices for us in tech

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,430
and especially a few are in security

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,980
it's super easy to get stuck in our

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,560
bubble and just forget about the outside

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:44,950
world security professionals in

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,930
particular isolated like a bubble within

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,910
a bubble living in a very different

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:54,100
world everyone else but security the

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:57,430
tiny island their security is something

00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:01,269
that everyone deserves everyone deserves

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:05,830
security but not everyone gets security

00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:08,380
do they security is hard I probably

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,410
don't have to tell you that in our

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:14,050
industry we have such a huge spectrum of

00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,810
problems to deal with from the super

00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:20,230
complex to the frustrating frustrating

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:22,030
and downright named and it can be

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:25,269
overwhelming to look at like all these

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,800
different levels of problems and so when

00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:29,670
we're faced with something so massive

00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,860
it's easy for us to just cut our losses

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,480
so that's what we do we focus on the

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:38,140
people who are doing the right things

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,329
and we say to people like my dad if

00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:46,630
you're doing the wrong things like using

00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:50,560
Windows XP can't help you sorry security

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:53,230
is hard and people are bad edit so sorry

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,420
we can't help you but are not helping

00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,670
these people we are giving up on the

00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,640
vast majority of users of the Internet

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,609
these are your uncles and auntie's your

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,590
grandparents your parents your friends

00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:10,480
these are also your work colleagues your

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:14,920
bosses and CEOs so what if we didn't

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:18,250
give up no one chooses to be insecure

00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,260
what they're choosing is connection to

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,930
their families to their communities

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,690
tools and resources that might help them

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:28,090
solve a problem and yeah sometimes

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,260
they're indulging in the possibility

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:31,500
that they might have won a thousand

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,500
dollars

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,229
everyone all the time are trying to make

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,270
the best decisions they can with the

00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:43,560
information and resources that they have

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:46,500
and everyone deserves security and yes

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,650
security is hard but what if people

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,340
aren't bad at security because it's hard

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:55,650
what if security is hard because we're

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:59,629
not engaging the majority of Internet

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:02,250
users on what good security practice is

00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:04,710
when there's a persistent and systemic

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,289
problem it would do us good to look at

00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,659
the whole ecosystem that funnels and

00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:12,629
contributes to that problem so if we

00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:15,870
were to zoom out of our InfoSec tech

00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:18,000
bubble the reality is that we live in a

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:21,240
world where people don't really think

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,849
about their digital security which means

00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,069
they get used to the lack of security

00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:29,159
and privacy in their lives which means

00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:32,759
they will consume take and not demand

00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:37,050
security and privacy or when there are

00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:39,270
developers making all of our products

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,340
we're not thinking about security and

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,440
even when we are thinking about security

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:47,150
we're not surrounded by enough people

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:51,180
who also think it's important and

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:54,060
security experts stuck at the bottom of

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:58,860
the cliff thinking how did it all get so

00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,990
bad so today for a little while we're

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,529
going to focus on the people who are not

00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:07,319
us I'm going to introduce you to some

00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:09,479
new mental models frameworks and new

00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,610
ways of thinking and I want to show you

00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,279
how we can help our friends and family

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:17,069
with their personal security and how we

00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,289
can take inspiration from design from

00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:21,690
behavioral psychology and the public

00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:24,960
health sector to really mend the

00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:27,029
security of our ecosystem we'll take a

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,219
closer look at who I mean when I say

00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:32,069
everyone else what are their needs what

00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:33,839
are their lives like well re-examine

00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:37,139
what kind of advice we should be giving

00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:42,029
them and finally we'll dive into how we

00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:43,830
can communicate that advice so who are

00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:46,650
these people

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:49,379
in researching for this talk I

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:52,770
interviewed six people who specifically

00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:55,440
do not work in Dec and we talked about

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,150
their everyday digital usage what they

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,159
cared about what they didn't care about

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,710
and what their current security

00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:04,169
practices were like during these

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:08,099
interviews people started falling into

00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:09,870
two main categories the first group of

00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,759
people are those who don't really know

00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:14,370
what good security practice looks like

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,560
and it's embodied perfectly in this

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:20,509
research paper comparing the intuitions

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,310
of security experts and everyday people

00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:25,259
while the experts emphasize things like

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,990
keeping your system up-to-date or like

00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,629
multi-factor or everyday folks think

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:33,479
more about antivirus and password

00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:36,810
rotations and like not going to any web

00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:38,610
sites you don't know and we all have

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,310
these people in our lives we know them

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:45,000
well we fix their computers when we go

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:47,400
home that's cool but the second group of

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,460
people I think is less talked about and

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,669
quite interesting and they are perfectly

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:57,479
embodied by my friend Sally this is

00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:58,219
Sally Sally's up to date with her latest

00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,050
software

00:07:58,219 --> 00:08:03,659
she knows that using passwords as

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,930
reusing passwords was bad and she knows

00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:09,120
about to affect OAuth Sally is actually

00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,599
pretty well clued up about good security

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,620
practice but there's just one problem

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:18,060
she doesn't do any of them I know I

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,159
shouldn't do this but I cycle through

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,639
two or three passwords for all of my

00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:25,349
accounts I know that password managers I

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,680
just haven't gotten around to it yet

00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:31,349
seems like a big time investment I've

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,779
been meaning to change my passwords but

00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:37,829
my current password system is just so

00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:41,539
memorized the things that Sally said to

00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:47,459
me really resonated maybe because Sally

00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:49,920
is me or was me the quotes that you just

00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,839
saw there were real quotes from the

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,839
interviews that I did I didn't just make

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,050
them up but I did use to do all of those

00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,560
things

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,420
so in our second group of people they

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,700
generally know what to do they just

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,110
haven't done it yet and I'm sure there's

00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,480
quite a few people sitting in the

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:12,100
audience today who maybe fall under this

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,540
group I certainly don't for a long time

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,060
so from our research we've come out with

00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:20,360
true rough personas and two main

00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:24,519
problems to solve what should we be

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:29,570
doing and how should we be implementing

00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:31,790
so what advice did we give for a lot of

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:34,399
people security is a static non

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:36,260
fluctuating State something that can be

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,600
achieved by downloading the right

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,240
antivirus using the right kinds

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,019
passwords implementing the right system

00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,390
and never thinking about it ever again

00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:50,180
but in reality security is an ever

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:53,500
moving target it's less like having a

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:57,320
vaccination and more like exercise

00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:59,660
security is like exercise there's always

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,310
room for improvement it needs to be

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:05,470
personalized to the individuals needs

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:08,839
and it needs to be habitual and ongoing

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,730
let's break this down further in

00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:14,000
security there is always room for

00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:17,180
improvement all skills in life are built

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,899
upon progressively no one's perfect from

00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,410
the get-go

00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:23,690
if you don't usually run like me it

00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:29,240
would be silly to suggest that I run a

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:30,980
marathon tomorrow I would die likewise

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,950
if you don't usually think about

00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:36,110
security then you - if keys and password

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,870
managers are probably not the best next

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,959
step for someone instead we can take

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:44,779
baby steps have you got all software

00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:47,690
just accept the next update see how it

00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:49,760
goes do you use the same password for

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,579
everything how about you just change

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,470
your email password and go with that for

00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:55,910
now

00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:58,089
you've got unique passwords but like

00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:02,269
they're all and like this complex

00:10:58,089 --> 00:11:04,100
floating formulas in your head try a

00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:08,100
password manager let me show you how it

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:11,040
works the perfect is the enemy of

00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:13,230
if we suggest behavior that is wildly

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,910
different from what someone currently

00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,180
does then they're probably not going to

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,670
do it and not only should this behavior

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:24,329
be incremental it should be personalized

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:26,130
to the needs of that person so I want to

00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:28,370
equip you with some tools to gauge the

00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:32,180
different needs in everyday conversation

00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:35,220
let me introduce you three sliders

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:39,329
technological capability privacy needs

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:41,220
and likely adversaries when someone asks

00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:45,120
you for advice these are some rough

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:47,430
elements to consider like what's their

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,040
comfort level with technology

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:53,160
are they unfamiliar with tick then we

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,990
can recommend the familiar so you can

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,170
store your passwords in the browser or

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,410
in a notebook rely heavily on your

00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:03,060
smartphone and here are some into end

00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:07,649
encrypted chat apps they work exactly

00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:09,509
the same like your other apps do they

00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:12,240
sit at the other end do they program

00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:14,160
with a magnetized pin well then we can

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,380
suggest customization we can try some

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,850
new stuff we can talk about all the

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,350
different password managers out there

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:21,300
and we can talk about all the different

00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:23,490
ways they store things and communicate

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,829
things and sync things we can talk about

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:29,190
all the different u2f keys out there and

00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:34,170
try new stuff you are allowed to tell

00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:37,680
them about PGP what are their privacy

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:40,170
needs are they in hiding then you can

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,329
tell them to be a minimalist so turn off

00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:45,829
location permissions go through them

00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:49,019
with their privacy settings introduce

00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:53,100
compartmentalization and do regular

00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:56,579
follower and friend pairings I feel like

00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,839
most of our community really focus on

00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:00,300
people towards the left end of the

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,439
spectrum and we sometimes forget that

00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,439
there are people out there who actually

00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:06,529
like me to be visible

00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:08,750
they could be activists they could be

00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:12,810
journalists they could lead movements

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:15,329
they could be Instagram influences they

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:18,209
exist so for these people we can

00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:19,980
recommend obfuscation so removing

00:13:18,209 --> 00:13:21,330
metadata and information and the

00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,839
backgrounds of photos

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:27,870
use scheduling heavily to hide their

00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:32,640
daily activity patterns and separate the

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:34,980
public and private personas and lastly

00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,680
you can make a rough threat model like

00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,890
who are there likely adversaries is it

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,630
just random looking to make a quick buck

00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,760
for that you can lean on generic

00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:48,510
protections like unique passwords and

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:51,720
app based 2fa they'll get you there are

00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:55,430
they're defecting spy for that you want

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:59,760
to recommend specific specialist advice

00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:01,880
don't take advice from me introduce them

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:07,470
to someone who knows what they're doing

00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:09,690
seek professional help but the point is

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:13,079
try and put yourself on these scales

00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:16,079
where do you sit where do your friends

00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:18,930
and your family set how would the advice

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,800
that you give yourself defer to the

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:25,079
advice that you give to them if you'd

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,610
like to practice that empathy muscle and

00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,890
transport yourself into the shoes of

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,690
different people the open Internet tools

00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:33,120
project have compiled a really cool

00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:37,230
range of different persona profiles to

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,510
read through ok the third quality that

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:42,990
our advice has to be is that it needs to

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:45,149
be ongoing in habitual we want to lay a

00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,130
path for progression so that even

00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:50,520
advancing to the next stage can be a

00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:52,560
reward in itself basically what we need

00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:56,610
something we need something that's like

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,190
a couch to 5k for security a program of

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:03,300
slow but steady improvement where each

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:06,000
step is accessible from the last maybe

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,640
week one you just put a passcode on your

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,190
phone and that's totally achievable and

00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,529
you don't have to do anything else week

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,800
two you just do one more thing week

00:15:13,529 --> 00:15:19,110
three one more other thing and so on and

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,630
so on until you get bitter and bitter

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:27,269
until you have a really really solid

00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:29,699
personal security set up so to make

00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:31,980
security advice effective we have to

00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:35,040
make it incremental personalized and

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:39,360
habitual cool

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:43,020
so now that we know what to say how do

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,680
we say it first I'm going to give you

00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,430
the bad news

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,610
tell sell and shame does not work which

00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:53,400
is fine until you realize that that's

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,740
what we literally do all the time we

00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,260
tell people what to do we sell them on

00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,420
why they should do it and then we shame

00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:04,290
them when they're not doing exactly what

00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:07,380
we want them to do just telling someone

00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:09,630
what to do is not enough this is idea in

00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,210
behavioral psychology called reactance

00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:14,040
theory and it's the idea that if you

00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:16,440
instruct someone to do something

00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:20,040
it harms their feeling of free choice

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,800
and free will and to protect themselves

00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,530
from that often they'll either ignore

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,450
your instructions or they'll just do the

00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:30,510
exact opposite of what you told them to

00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:34,670
do and they just like to try and regain

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,670
the feeling of autonomy and control

00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:39,810
direct instruction harms that feeling of

00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,610
autonomy this is why when your parents

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,350
told you to go clean your own you might

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,630
respond by chucking all your toys on the

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,700
floor

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:51,030
the antidote to this is to lead by

00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:53,910
example so hey this is what I do

00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:56,670
and I would recommend it to you this is

00:16:53,910 --> 00:17:01,220
how I set up my passwords and this is

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,220
the app that I use for 2fa I'd rate this

00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:07,800
secondly selling people on what they

00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,990
should do is also not enough 9 times out

00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,550
of 10 people know why they should be

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,199
doing what they should be doing like

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:15,900
they know that using the same password

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,430
might get their accounts hacked they

00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,860
know they should put a passcode on their

00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:22,560
phone but there might be other factors

00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:27,900
social cultural factors that they have

00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:30,600
to negotiate first a really good story

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:33,390
that I like is this public health

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,310
project in southwest Sydney that aim to

00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:40,500
reduce smoking in Arabic speaking

00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:43,560
communities and selling people on the

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,510
idea that quitting smoking was good for

00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,190
you didn't really work because everyone

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,160
already knew that smoking was bad for

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,590
you and

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,330
fact it was often sharp point of

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:56,160
conflict in families and social

00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:58,660
gatherings so this group of researchers

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,520
developed a project where they ran and

00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,820
tested a whole bunch of different ad

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:07,360
campaigns to get people to quit smoking

00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:08,890
but one in particular stood out so

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,420
through their research they discovered

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:13,420
that there was as cultural norm between

00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:16,060
guests and hosts where it's polite to

00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,440
offer your guests a cigarette and really

00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,230
rude if you were to refuse that

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,060
cigarette there was a lot of motivation

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,160
for change but they were missing the

00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:28,360
ability to navigate the social situation

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:30,430
social situations so what the project

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:33,430
did was they ran these radio ads in

00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:36,310
Arabic in the form of this like mini

00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:39,430
soap opera they didn't mention any of

00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:42,430
the health risks they just demonstrated

00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:46,420
ways for guests and hosts who politely

00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:48,010
declined cigarettes and this became one

00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,440
of the most successful ads in the

00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:54,180
campaign's history just by giving people

00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:58,030
a socially acceptable out from smoking

00:18:54,180 --> 00:19:03,430
so give people successful examples to

00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:05,320
emulate for example you're at an office

00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:10,030
and a colleague wants to print something

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:13,000
but does not have their computer hey

00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:15,130
Caitlin can I use your computer to print

00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,470
something sure thing what do you need to

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:20,530
print oh just something from the server

00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:22,180
hey what's your password it's real long

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:25,290
and complicated it's probably better if

00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:32,520
I just come over and type it okay thanks

00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:37,000
awkward situation avoided shaming people

00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:39,850
lastly also doesn't work which might be

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,280
surprising because the tech industry

00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:46,330
delights we delight in shaming other

00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:49,180
people we have a pervasive culture of

00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:51,490
shame we assume people are idiots not

00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,400
worth our time and belittle them at

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:56,680
every opportunity and we like revel and

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,390
the stuff we make Twitter accounts with

00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,190
people who post photos of their credit

00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:02,200
cards

00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:06,340
we laugh at people getting their

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,960
passwords scanned on IRC and I'm totally

00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:10,330
guilty of doing this like I've laughed

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,880
at all of these things just before

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:17,620
Windows XP wasn't a problem it was a

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:20,350
punchline so one of the people that I

00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,630
interviewed had inadvertently downloaded

00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:26,400
some malware while they were trying to

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:28,540
pirate Dobby reader we've opened them

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,510
they seemed pretty chill about it like

00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:34,090
they didn't seem fazed and they said are

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,310
they fix it within a week and I was like

00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,500
okay that's interesting

00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:42,460
how'd you fix it and this is what they

00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:46,020
told me I googled it and kept installing

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:53,830
antivirus programs until one worked

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:56,380
great horrifying this culture of shame

00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,830
means that instead of coming to you

00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,520
someone who is a technical expert

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,380
instead of coming to you for help

00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,940
they're going to ask Google and they're

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:07,420
going to keep downloading random

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,430
programs until one sticks that's

00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,200
horrifying

00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:13,050
they said they downloaded like four or

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,100
five programs before one worked

00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:19,780
what were the other four or five

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:22,300
programs doing I have no idea so how do

00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,910
we combat this cultural shame well we

00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:28,120
can start by treating every mistake as a

00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:31,660
learning opportunity and there is always

00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:34,300
an xkcd for everything I try not to make

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:36,520
fun of people for admitting they don't

00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,800
know things if I make fun of people I

00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,870
train them not to tell me when they have

00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,400
moments when they had those moments and

00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:46,930
I miss out on the fun of teaching them

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,450
so next time you see something real

00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:50,500
silly instead of thinking what idiot

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:54,430
would do such a thing

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:58,510
try asking hey can I show you a better

00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:01,300
way to do this so this is what we can do

00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:03,850
to be be a bit better we can veer away

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:07,300
from our culture of shame slowly slowly

00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:10,510
but surely we can try and show don't

00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,920
tell and give people scripts to navigate

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:16,180
awkward social calm

00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:18,970
conversations Telcel and shame does not

00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,550
work but Sarina

00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:24,250
you might say you are literally telling

00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,470
us what to do you're telling us what to

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,270
do you're selling us on why we should do

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:31,840
it and you're shaming us for shaming

00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:38,950
other people you are reverse shaming how

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:44,200
dare you which is fair so let's walk the

00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:46,060
walk so I ask myself okay what is

00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,270
something that has significantly changed

00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:51,490
my behavior in my own life and when I

00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:54,160
first wrote this talk the only thing I

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:57,340
could think of or those I don't know if

00:22:54,160 --> 00:23:00,580
you know the specific genre of YouTube

00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:02,500
video that's like self-care bullet

00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:04,900
journal very pesto

00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:06,280
like Marie Kondo your life video some

00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,890
people are nodding most people or not

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:16,210
it's it's a good time it's like you know

00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:18,190
chill videos and that kind of video has

00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:21,370
significantly changed my behavior like I

00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:27,670
journal now I have a skincare routine

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:30,040
what is that but seriously like when I

00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,990
look at YouTube vloggers they embody a

00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,570
lot of the principles that I'm talking

00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:37,210
to you about they show they don't tell

00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:39,330
they give people a choice to opt in or

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:42,130
out they don't make you watch this stuff

00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:45,730
often they show their mistakes and their

00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:47,620
imperfections the outline routines and

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:49,750
give people steps and scripts to follow

00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,600
and there's lots of different

00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:56,950
personalities so you can follow one that

00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:59,560
is personalized to you could it be that

00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:01,780
YouTube the home of conspiracy theorists

00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:04,860
and Beauty vloggers is the perfect

00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:09,100
format to communicate security advice

00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:14,110
well I guess I don't know until I find

00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:17,980
out we have now reached the embarrassing

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:21,550
part of the talk so I made our YouTube

00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:23,860
channel this is a real screenshot I

00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:26,470
thought hey I'll conduct an experiment

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:29,560
and I'll do this thing

00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:38,050
this was in the summer of 2018 and yeah

00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:39,850
I made some videos they were okay the

00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:43,660
experiment lasted about three months

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:47,470
because it got too hard YouTube takes a

00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:51,910
long time and a lot of effort I have a

00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:54,490
newfound respect for youtubers now but

00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:56,890
what else was really interesting was

00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:00,030
that as I was making these videos I

00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:03,160
immediately fell back into the habit of

00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:04,960
Telcel and shame like I basically just

00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,150
made videos that tell people what to do

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,270
which is why they were not very

00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:13,330
successful I think the most successful

00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:18,630
video I have is like me emptying out my

00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:23,020
conference bag before key week on sure

00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:25,090
but I learned some things too and the

00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,070
hard thing that I learned was that to

00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:30,700
really reach out and connect to people

00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:33,670
requires vulnerability it requires like

00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:38,170
a degree of vulnerability that I was not

00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:41,590
prepared to go to on a public public

00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:43,570
platform like YouTube and I guess that's

00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:45,820
a paradox of personal security right

00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:47,260
like the people who are most into

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,040
personal security the people who are

00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:53,290
doing all the right things who are doing

00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,570
who are like the experts they are also

00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:58,180
the people who do not want to reveal

00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:03,210
their personal security set up for their

00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:05,680
own security so like your average person

00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:09,610
doesn't really know what to do they

00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:12,730
can't ask but some other stuff happened

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:15,130
after this little experiment - when I

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,810
started my channel my friends and

00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:19,150
colleagues started asking me the

00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:21,880
security questions and we started

00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:24,040
talking about it and eventually I

00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,630
remembered where I sat on those three

00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:33,280
sliders and I got over myself and I

00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:35,860
showed people my real setup like I show

00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,810
people this massive Trello board I have

00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,250
with every single account that I could

00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:41,260
possibly track down

00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:43,450
how I organized them into different

00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,790
hierarchies what I did

00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:47,410
true then systematically reset the

00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:50,080
password on every one of those accounts

00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:53,200
and put them into my password manager I

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,860
showed people how I log in using my you

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,650
be key and how easy it was but most

00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:01,780
importantly I was honest about how hard

00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:05,080
it was like this was not easy this was

00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:10,180
not fun this was boring and it was work

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:12,670
but that was okay because as it turns

00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,560
out a lot of them were already clued up

00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:16,570
about what to do a lot of them had

00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:21,010
already heard about the things that I

00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:24,220
was going through and it was seeing

00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:27,580
someone they knew in meatspace

00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:30,250
do the good security that allowed them

00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:32,370
to take that final leap to their next

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:34,800
step of what they needed to do and

00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:37,780
eventually that was the thing that

00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,570
actually changed behaviors not like my

00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:44,470
weird three-month stint as a youtuber

00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:46,570
but being vulnerable this sounds

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:50,080
completely counterintuitive in a

00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:53,740
security talk but if we want to increase

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,510
the security of everyone we need to

00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,630
start being a little more vulnerable

00:27:55,510 --> 00:28:00,250
with each other so don't be scared to

00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:03,340
tell people and the ways that you failed

00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:06,730
in the past how you screwed up how it

00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:10,960
made you feel what did it teach you how

00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:13,240
did you try and fix it sometimes all

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,570
people want to hear is that they're not

00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:19,210
stupid for finding it hard that they're

00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:22,270
not idiots for not getting it perfect

00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:26,620
the first time and that seems like a

00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:28,930
small ostomy all right in summary this

00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,680
is almost over everyone deserves

00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:34,650
security I think we all agree moving on

00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:37,780
but the culture of shame and dismissal

00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:40,000
means that we caused an ecosystem of

00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:43,990
people who don't think about security

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,500
and that makes it hard for us so when we

00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:51,040
give advice make it incremental make it

00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:54,000
habitual and make sure it fits people's

00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,000
personal needs

00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:59,260
shaming people has really horrific

00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:03,860
consequences but we can fight that by

00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:07,130
seeing mistakes as opportunities leading

00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:11,000
by example and giving people a script to

00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:13,640
follow I guess like my whole talk could

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:17,690
just be summed up with just like be nice

00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:20,330
to people it won't make the scope of our

00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:23,510
problems any smaller or the world any

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:27,559
less on fire but you'll be amazed at how

00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:31,120
far just being nice and helpful and open

00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:33,520
to people can get you good luck and

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:40,900
thanks for listening

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:46,070
[Applause]

00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:47,960
feel free to Hickel me I'm not sure if

00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:54,140
we we're yesterday at yesterday's

00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:55,490
keynote the experts about priming yes

00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:58,520
yeah that was great

00:29:55,490 --> 00:30:01,160
and I guess it goes a little bit into

00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:04,340
like prom like this idea of priming and

00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:07,220
you know behavioral economics and I was

00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:11,990
wondering when we look at that if that

00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:15,050
could help to make people do the right

00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:20,059
choices in the securities fair yeah

00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:22,130
yeah I think this is like a very nation

00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:23,929
untapped kind of way of thinking in the

00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:27,679
security industry which is like instead

00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:29,000
of saying don't do these things don't do

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,650
these things instead we can think about

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,380
okay well what do we want people to do

00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:36,740
and how can we make the the most secure

00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:38,840
path the easiest path and the kind of

00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,010
like default path the path that you kind

00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,540
of stumble into if you weren't even

00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:46,190
thinking and you're just secure well no

00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,570
that's a lie it's it's not a new kind of

00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:49,280
way of thinking but I think it's

00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:51,290
definitely a way of thinking that's

00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:54,290
experiencing a resurgence now which is

00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:56,679
quite good yeah yeah that was a great

00:30:54,290 --> 00:31:00,200
hook that's really good

00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:03,670
any more hickel's how was your day how

00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,670
is everyone's doing

00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:10,550
hey-ya thank you very much i I've got a

00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,500
lot out of that talk I feel good

00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:15,500
particularly as I work with a much older

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,390
workforce so I suppose very guilty of

00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,470
the sitting in the technical aspect and

00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,510
everyone else is sitting somewhere else

00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:23,720
and and it's not a question so do

00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:26,450
apologize but I what you said about

00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,220
shame really resonated I was recently at

00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:30,280
a different course and I thought it was

00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:32,390
important it might benefit someone here

00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,100
the person doing the present

00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:36,140
presentation you know there was the

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,220
conversation we're fishing and and you

00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,870
know everyone has a good chuckle about

00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,980
it and the person directed because

00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:43,160
they'd know these people are victims

00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,420
yeah they're not they they're not to be

00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,490
laughed at they haven't anything wrong

00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,020
they have victims here that really

00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,880
resonated with me I was like oh this is

00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:52,310
really good idea so what you said about

00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,140
shame I was really impressed by and

00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:55,940
treating them like victims rather than

00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,670
trying to shame them I think makes a lot

00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:00,740
of sense yeah or even like less so like

00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,930
victims but more like you know this

00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,300
could have happened to any of us fishing

00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:07,240
like we like to pretend that we're smart

00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:15,020
we work in tech we know what's up but

00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:17,840
fishing is what gets every one Hey yeah

00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:20,360
yeah and it's like you know we laugh at

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,520
the the really kind of obvious fake

00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,790
phishing attempts but there are there

00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:28,880
are some really clever ones out there

00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:31,010
yeah exactly

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,770
no that's the thing is that like most

00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:36,440
the time people aren't stupid we're just

00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:37,330
busy we've got other things to think

00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:43,070
about

00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:46,229
yeah yes

00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:48,440
hi thanks Serena looking towards the

00:32:46,229 --> 00:32:50,729
future do you have any predictions I

00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,469
think I want something like a personal

00:32:50,729 --> 00:32:55,049
firewall that would stop me from doing

00:32:52,469 --> 00:32:56,639
stuff like a super app I'll I'll buy

00:32:55,049 --> 00:32:58,799
that but it's like a business bottle

00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:00,330
it's probably really hot out there so

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:05,089
what's your prediction for the future

00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:09,059
and on this topic of personal security I

00:33:05,089 --> 00:33:12,450
don't have any predictions because the

00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:17,599
future is a scary thought right now but

00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:21,210
what I hope to say is I hope to see the

00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:23,099
industry moving away from essentially

00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:27,839
like a firewall kind of thinking where

00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:29,729
you know you just get told no and like

00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:33,599
in so many companies the security team

00:33:29,729 --> 00:33:39,479
is the team that says no and the kind of

00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:41,700
culture that that what happens is that

00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:43,529
it becomes like an us-versus-them like

00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,269
the internal like development and

00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:47,609
engineering team versus the security

00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:49,349
team here a team says no the engineers

00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:52,049
say yeah but we want this and how do we

00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:54,359
get it through and that's that's like

00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:59,489
the opposite of what we want so instead

00:33:54,359 --> 00:34:02,899
of like a kind of firewall kind of model

00:33:59,489 --> 00:34:07,049
I'm hoping that we move towards more of

00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:09,359
a collaborative environment where it's

00:34:07,049 --> 00:34:12,629
like here's the security team would say

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,389
here is how you can do what you want to

00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:17,339
do in this very specific room yeah yeah

00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:20,520
and I'm hoping that like for personal

00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:22,500
security it'll be more like this is just

00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,589
the default like this is just what you

00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,149
do and it's it's not something you have

00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:29,149
to think about all the time it's not

00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:32,700
something that you have to be a security

00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:36,359
enthusiast to do it's just like you know

00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:40,429
everyone gets a Yubikey so for your

00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:42,899
figure 16th birthday also I don't know

00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:44,669
like it just becomes like the default

00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:46,470
where people can slouch into good

00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:49,549
security and don't worry about it

00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,549
I hope this

00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:59,520
yeah yeah hi there

00:34:55,950 --> 00:35:00,690
as you had a YouTube channel on the

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,220
internet and everybody knows that

00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:05,760
reading the comments on the Internet is

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,680
horrifying and scary I guess I figured

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,200
that you might have a lot of advice on

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,000
how like a script to deal with people

00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:16,230
who tell you that you are doing your

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,790
security wrong or not enough since you

00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:19,740
have drunk from the firehose of the

00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:21,390
world of internet comments so that when

00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:23,670
I go along and I want to share my

00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:24,990
experiences without the people and then

00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:26,370
you know I mean a ring without the

00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,780
technologists and they're going to tell

00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:30,210
me that I'm doing it wrong or

00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:36,590
inadequately how would you deal with

00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:36,590
those kind of situations I don't know

00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:49,590
you don't know me honestly like I would

00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:52,860
just shrug it off in another time I

00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:54,720
would have maybe gotten into like a very

00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:59,280
in-depth argument of why my particular

00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:01,860
setup is particularly how it is but I

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,920
think I've learned that that's just a

00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,210
waste of time and like that's the thing

00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,590
with personal security right is that it

00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:15,270
is so personal to the specific person

00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:17,640
and it's kind of like I think someone

00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:20,460
mentioned in a talk the other day like

00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:22,080
writing using a notebook like a physical

00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,860
notebook as a password manager and it's

00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:28,620
like a lot of people would say that is

00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:30,780
that is so bad that is so insecure it

00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:34,740
doesn't have a I even have a lock on it

00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:37,110
it's in plain text but honestly like it

00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:38,100
works for that specific person if that's

00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,930
what they're used to

00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,660
you know they know how to work a pen and

00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:45,510
paper they know where it is in the desk

00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,770
drawer then it's fine and unless you

00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:54,140
know someone's going to break into their

00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:54,140
house so teach to their own yeah

00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:03,740
this reminds me of something I remember

00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,300
I used to be a lifeguard in the

00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,940
first-aid responder and one of the

00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:11,780
things we learned was that in an

00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:16,160
accident the one who's causing an

00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:19,700
accident is also a victim should be

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,760
treated as as part of being a victim and

00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:25,010
and and treated in this in this problem

00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:28,370
and I guess what I'm what I'm trying to

00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:32,540
say is that even if we see people who do

00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:34,880
shame they are part of a wider of their

00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:39,950
environment too and I guess what I'm

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:42,860
saying is we can probably apply the same

00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:46,550
principles you mentioned in your talk to

00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:48,290
to those who shame as well yeah I mean

00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:50,690
like like I said before like I've

00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:52,100
totally engaged in that kind of culture

00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:55,160
and that's just kind of like the default

00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:58,040
of of what you do when you're in take it

00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:01,130
was just like it's kind of like I'm

00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,080
signaling to everyone that I understand

00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,660
how tech works by making fun of this

00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,760
person that doesn't understand and I'm

00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,790
trying to like tell everyone that like I

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,080
belong here that you know I am one of

00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,080
you and that's okay

00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:20,810
but also like I don't know when it comes

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,400
to discussions around like changing

00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:24,260
culture and changing how people behave

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,840
and like the whole like human psychology

00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,550
behavioral thing it can sound really

00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:32,150
daunting and it can sound really scary

00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:39,350
and hard and what we fail to recognize

00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:42,110
is that sometimes just being the seed to

00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:43,580
that behavior change is enough like you

00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:46,700
don't have to change the minds of

00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:49,220
everyone you just you you can just be

00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:52,670
that one person that goes oh that's a

00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:54,920
shame hey can I show you how I do this

00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:57,830
and like sometimes that's enough that's

00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:04,190
enough to turn the kind of vibe of the

00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:06,760
room if you will yeah is everyone

00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:06,760
hydrated

00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:19,690
yeah uh I just like I want to join me in

00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:21,430
thanking Serena and as a token of

00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:25,380
appreciation for everyone at LC I'd like

00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:25,380
to thank you thank you

00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,520
shout out to Caitlyn for I'm doing the

00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:35,200
back and forth

00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:39,800
