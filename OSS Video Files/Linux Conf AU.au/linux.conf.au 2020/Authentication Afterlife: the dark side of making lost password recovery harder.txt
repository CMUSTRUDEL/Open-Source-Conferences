Title: Authentication Afterlife: the dark side of making lost password recovery harder

Historically authentication was by username and password, perhaps with email as a password reset flow.   Users often wrote down their passwords (particularly older users), and possibly they only had a few passwords and it was pretty easy to try all of them.

Modern times have proven that passwords, particularly reused passwords, are insufficient security for any slightly valuable account.  So lots of people are using password managers, randomised passwords, and 2FA (hardware tokens, TOTP, etc).  Some accounts also require an additional authentication flow (email, SMS) for "new device" logins.  "Security Aware" users are using randomised answers to security challenge questions, perhaps also stored in their password managers.

This "security improvement" has a flip side: it's gone from being unlikely users will forget their passwords or get locked out, to being more likely users will lose access to their accounts through loss of 2FA or additional authentication paths (eg, phone number, or email), and more likely that users will struggle with lost password recovery.   And there's a darker side still: if the user is incapacitated, or has passed away, often someone else close to them will need to act "on their behalf" with those accounts (for legitimate transactions, send out notifications, or just to archive the account), and will likely struggle to gain access to them without the original users full set of password manager / 2FA / etc.

How do we balance the need to improve authentication security, and reduce the simplicity of malicious account takeover, with the need for there to be a way for legimate account use by bereaved family members, or other trusted associates?   There are no easy answers here, but considering the questions is important.

gentlemen and you can't say that anymore

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,960
nowadays can you what what is the

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,360
general instruction nowadays folks

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,519
everyone everyone thank you everyone

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,139
welcome to the second talk of the

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,490
afternoon I'd like to introduce you to

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,230
Ewan who's going to be talking to us

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:26,099
about authentication half life thank you

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:30,900
in thank you so some of you might be

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:34,350
aware of the Twitter account tabletop

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,110
summit scenarios bad things early it was

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,360
started by Ryan big Egan about was three

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,170
or four years ago and was quite active

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,930
for a while

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,710
seems to die down but the general idea

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,780
is to post some sort of scenario that

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,719
you can just consider like sitting in a

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,399
meeting room something like that that

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,890
might be based on something that

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,140
happened relatively recently so you can

00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,129
consider in the same sort of priming

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,320
that we were talking about in the

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,879
keynote earlier what would you do in

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,330
this scenario if this actually happened

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,400
to you I've structured this talk around

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,750
a number of tabletop scenarios none of

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,680
them appeared on that particular account

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,840
but idea was inspired by that account

00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,400
what I'd like you to do is consider them

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,020
quietly you're welcome to talk about one

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,700
is C or Twitter or something like that

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,159
but during the presentation we're not

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,780
going to discuss them hopefully there

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,770
will be some time towards the end where

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,320
we can have a little bit of discussion

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,290
about it but just come along for the

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,630
ride the other thing that I should warn

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,640
you about is some of these are based on

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,820
very recent events some of these are

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,430
based on personal loss disaster and

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,020
those kinds of things so if you're in a

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,130
place where you don't want to be hearing

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,899
about that right now it's going to be

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,420
very triggering by all means feel free

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:52,259
to leave the room it's being recorded

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:56,670
you can come back to it later so here we

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,930
go first scenario very topical I'm going

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,860
to read it out just to give you a little

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:04,290
bit of time to process it and also to

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,570
make it a little bit more accessible so

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,489
the scenario is there was a fire it was

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,819
a really big fire it took out your main

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,760
computer and your backups fortunately

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,980
you're in the cloud everything

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,030
on line but you don't issue remember

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,530
your passwords because they were all

00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,099
saved on your computer and it was

00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:29,569
logging you in anyway so how do you get

00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:34,849
back into all your accounts just give

00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:36,079
you a moment to think about that okay so

00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:39,200
while you're thinking about that a

00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:42,260
little bit about me I'm mighty

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,030
consultant I'm based in New Zealand I've

00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,390
done a lot of networking a lot of system

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,159
and a lot of elements been doing lots of

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,480
online systems for a long time I've

00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:53,209
always ended up being very secure

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,379
adjacent because of online systems and

00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:58,970
early on but never really security if

00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:00,290
you're interested in following along

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,030
there's a link to the slides there I

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:03,440
also tweeted that out about 10 minutes

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,840
ago so if you scroll back in the Twitter

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,280
history on the LC a twenty20 egg you

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:14,150
should be able to find it it's all along

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:17,510
sorry the historical solution for how do

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,949
I recover everything is you have some

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,900
device that you can get email on

00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:23,930
possibly it's your phone possibly its

00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,280
computer you borrowed or as I saw last

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,900
week when someone was trying to do this

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,540
you went down to the computer store and

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,329
you bought a Chromebook in order to try

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,919
and recover things so you go to each

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:36,620
website you click on I forgot my

00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,060
password it's in to an email you click

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,310
on the link in the email you choose a

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,290
new password leather ensign or page

00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,859
you've real gravity recovered all your

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:49,340
accounts that's not such an amazing

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:52,760
solution these days because if it's that

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,970
easy anyone who gets access to your

00:03:52,760 --> 00:04:00,739
email can recover access to all of your

00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:05,329
accounts so how do you deal with that

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:07,699
problem you ask for - if a or some other

00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:10,250
additional security step when you're

00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:12,500
resetting your account you make sure

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,930
that users can actually only change one

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,359
account factor authentication factor at

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:20,810
a time so it makes it a little bit more

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,930
difficult so let's move on to our second

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,930
scenario

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,600
so I'm reading that out and for the

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:34,590
record you need to log into an account

00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:37,350
on a new device you have to vein on all

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:40,260
of your important devices but you're -

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,960
if a device your phone your token

00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,140
whatever it is isn't along the working

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,490
or maybe you left it behind certainly

00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,590
heard stories of that and last week as

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,480
well as people leaving their 2fa behind

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,920
and asking your friend please when you

00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,490
get on the plane can you bring this with

00:04:52,920 --> 00:05:02,760
you how do you recover in that kind of

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:05,190
situation so the official answer for

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,050
most sites is you have some sort of

00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,850
recovery token if you go to OTP isn't

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,500
working then you go into recovery codes

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,030
which they gave you at the beginning and

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,130
I'm sure you all printed them out and

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:21,300
put them somewhere really safe I do this

00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:22,680
but maybe not everyone does or there's

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,940
some other within two-factor

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,870
authentication maybe they have your

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:30,060
phone number and they send you an SMS

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,620
maybe to some yuba key security token or

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,610
something like there's some other way

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,650
that you can recover in that situation

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:40,440
if you've left everything behind chances

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:47,220
are you're looking at some sort of

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:51,750
recovery code so third scenario life is

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,260
getting worse for you your bank was

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,720
stolen

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,670
it contains your main computer your

00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,630
phone and all the 2fa tokens that you

00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:05,220
own can the person who stole that now

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:08,400
impersonate you how do you recover

00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,410
access to your accounts faster than they

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:17,460
can get into them so that you can lock

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:23,400
them out so looking at the impersonation

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:24,990
part if you're getting SMS 2fa or you've

00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,640
got some sort of app so it's since you

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,000
were code or something like that to

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,930
login

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,240
does that come up on your lock screen

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,870
that's that's really convenient but

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,030
[Music]

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:41,010
it's convenient for everyone that

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,920
basically means that someone who

00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:45,480
physically has your phone now has the

00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,690
authentication codes they don't have to

00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,850
enter anything else so it's to FA but

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,040
it's to FA for a physical device that

00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:57,150
maybe you might not have control over

00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:00,750
any longer dis definitely a trade-off

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:03,180
there like everything in security it's

00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,560
quite convenient especially if you have

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,990
to login to a whole lot of things that

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,820
have to of a or or something like that

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,380
quite convenient you don't have to enter

00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,890
the passcode or whatever on your phone

00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:16,560
every single time but it does depend on

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:18,180
what your threat model is and are there

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,710
people that might be able to grab your

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,210
phone off your desk do you know where

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,580
place where people might do that to you

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:30,510
are you in a house where people might do

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:32,100
that to you so in this kind of recovery

00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:35,040
of scenario obviously you're racing to

00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,930
reset things reset your passwords you

00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,820
have to login to a bunch of things and

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,950
invalidate whatever login tokens might

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,600
exist for a bunch of applications that

00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,160
evictions thought about this when you

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,750
reset your password all the existing

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,820
login tokens that are in validators

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,810
anyway all your devices get logged out

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:53,120
that's quite useful so maybe you do

00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:57,780
remember your passwords

00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,060
maybe not you - if a the other common

00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:06,480
scenario for dealing with the situation

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:10,800
is recovery questions what is your

00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:12,570
mother's maiden name there's always a

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,740
small choice of questions though

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:19,550
bouncers always end up being reused send

00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:24,150
sometimes they're not particularly

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:26,880
secret in my case my mother's maiden

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:29,130
name is my first name guess what I don't

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:34,050
use as the answer to that security

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,830
question so the obvious solution and for

00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:39,930
a lot of people in the security

00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:42,030
community is you randomize it but do you

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:44,390
remember exactly what you randomized it

00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,390
to you

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,420
it's not an idea or security question

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,700
answer if you don't have a way of

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:56,880
retrieving it when you've lost

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:59,670
everything or maybe it's even more

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,080
complicated someone in that area

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,779
suggested to me that's actually the

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,850
encrypted version of a security question

00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:06,990
which maybe it is the encrypted version

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,930
of Siri question

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,040
the trouble with sites recording the

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,279
encrypted version of the security

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,870
question is now you have to remember the

00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,670
exact capitalization and punctuation

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:21,000
that you use to answer the security

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:23,250
question even if you're talking to

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,690
someone on the phone in the helpdesk or

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,149
whatever you have to give them the exact

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,120
capitalization maybe you don't remember

00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:32,010
that or if you do maybe you put it in

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,029
the same password store that was on the

00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:38,339
device that you'd lost so we do you

00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:44,130
store those answers difficult problem

00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:46,410
possibly not publicly on Twitter the key

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,880
point here is that from a security point

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,250
of view what you have is you have

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,790
multiple alternate authentication

00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,440
methods you might need to use some of

00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,690
them in combination and in certain

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,010
scenarios but even when you're doing

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,970
account recovery you're still

00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:05,510
authenticating yourself there's a

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,560
primary method that you use every day or

00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,300
whenever you're logging in on a new

00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,850
device if you leave yourself logged in

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:16,110
everywhere and there's at least one

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:18,510
backup authentication method but all of

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:19,980
them our authentication methods all of

00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:25,890
them need to be thought about as if

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:28,770
they're all syndication business just

00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:32,130
weeks came past while I was preparing

00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:37,620
the talk and strike me is really really

00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:39,510
out what the report says is changing

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:43,649
your password every login is easier than

00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:45,209
remembering your password and deviants

00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:49,829
response to that is sometimes that our

00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:51,660
errors did users are always going to use

00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:53,100
the easiest authentication method from

00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,079
their point of view of resetting their

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,490
password is the easiest authentication

00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,110
flow that you've given them

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,680
reset the password every time especially

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:04,770
if there any login occasionally I've

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,410
also seen some sites that have cottoned

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:10,170
on to the idea of email authentication

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,029
of login you go to the site you enter a

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,520
username they send you an email you give

00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:17,010
the email you click on the link carry on

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,140
that's exactly the password reset flow

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,490
for a lot of sites they're doing a

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,029
password reset instead of storing

00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,830
passwords maybe it's okay for a kind of

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:28,410
one-off throwaway kind of thing where

00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:32,190
the security doesn't matter but it's not

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:33,450
ideal for high security particularly if

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:38,520
someone gets access to your email

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:40,110
account so users and attackers are both

00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:43,380
going to use the easiest authentication

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:45,990
method and at least from the point of

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:48,180
view of an attacker the authentication

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:51,180
methods could include call up the help

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,649
desk maybe you don't like phones but

00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,420
someone in taking you might be quite

00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:57,930
comfortable calling up someone and

00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:00,839
socially engineering them or potentially

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:02,790
even going in to see a counter staff

00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,470
person and some random location and

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,700
saying oh my god I've lost my phone in

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,130
the sim is gone I need to buy a new

00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,050
phone and this was my phone number if

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,600
they're convincing enough and the person

00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:16,800
on the counter isn't security trained

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,630
enough they could work some of you might

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,260
remember the story from about eight

00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:26,279
years ago it was one of the first

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:28,260
stories that happened to met Helen who

00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:32,310
was a reporter for white who wrote about

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:35,430
it in Wyatt in the space of about 45

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:41,550
minutes someone basically took over his

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:43,740
life by guessing something calling up a

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:46,170
help desk social engineering the last

00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,910
four digits of a credit card using what

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:50,190
they administer social engineer to call

00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:53,310
up another help desk getting other

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:56,070
things reset and then basically find my

00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,360
device wipe things etc etc if you

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:03,060
haven't read it it's well worth reading

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:04,680
to consider what actually happens met

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:08,339
situation was obviously worse because at

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,350
that point he didn't have a new 2fa but

00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,840
recall the slide earlier what happens

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,340
as indication methods bypass to FA what

00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,230
happens if calling the help desk in

00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,690
convincing them you really argue and oh

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:21,510
my god the waters is just ending and you

00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:24,000
have to get in now is sufficient to

00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,410
bypass the two if a requirement suddenly

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,030
you have known too if a little

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:31,910
syndication past it's the easiest path

00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:34,560
for these hackers so key point here is

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:37,460
recovery from lost credentials when you

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:46,680
have to a face it up should be harder

00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:50,240
really should be harder but if it's too

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:54,050
hard you can potentially end up losing

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:57,000
access to her account permanently this

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,920
story from 2014 which I found while I

00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,840
was looking for the Met horn story is

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,940
someone who'd read the metro and story

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,410
and gone I'm like oh that's terrible I

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,670
could lose everything I should put to it

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:11,040
hey on everything and then not taking

00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,570
care of the fact that now they had this

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,800
extra security that would potentially

00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:18,750
lock them out as well I figured whether

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,870
that's another reporter or someone

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:23,460
similar but but brushing into 2fa

00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:25,830
without understanding all the

00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:30,270
implications of what do you do next

00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:32,790
is potentially a problem on their front

00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:35,900
I would really recommend having a look

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:39,510
at github too if a recovery guide I

00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:41,220
literally will read recovery guides for

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,530
what happens if I lock myself out

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:45,120
at a bunch of sites they're vastly more

00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,770
useful than the privacy policy that ins

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,240
worse and we can change this at every

00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,800
time or the terms conditions that the

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,160
endless and we can change this at any

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:55,500
time it gives you particularly the good

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,330
one it is excellent I had another look

00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,330
at it while preparing this talk and they

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:02,220
have a whole bunch of options beyond the

00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:05,400
the early version which is if you lose

00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:09,810
your to a phase and it's a terrible

00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:12,000
problem but it's your problem they have

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:14,370
a bunch of options that are worth

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,960
looking at for design ideas like if you

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,250
have any society associating well you

00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,870
could have the count then potentially

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,000
you could use that as part of proving

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:22,410
who you are they have the recovery codes

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,190
they have questions they have other

00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,199
accounts you can associate worse that

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,370
if you pre associated them you can use

00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:31,240
that other account to prove that it's

00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:32,949
you and so on it's also worth looking at

00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,589
from the point of view of if someone is

00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:37,569
attacking you here's seven different

00:15:35,589 --> 00:15:45,100
options potentially they could use to

00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:49,810
prove that they are you so let's have

00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:52,540
another scenario to consider suppose

00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,250
you're someone who really knows a lot

00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:57,699
about security and you have this really

00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,870
security conscious founder and they

00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:00,100
started the business in the last ten

00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,689
years so of course they use the cloud

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,399
for everything and to FA for everything

00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:06,310
and it's curious really important so

00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:08,829
they lock everything down in the

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:11,139
business got bought out so they decided

00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:13,449
that they didn't really like working a

00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:15,279
big corporate they we're going to leave

00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:16,360
and do another startup and obviously

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,860
they're really security conscious so

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,850
they wiped all their devices is their

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:24,490
winter and then one of those cloud

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:26,379
providers face illustrations that if you

00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:29,980
don't agree to the terms and conditions

00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:31,930
from the original account by the end of

00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:36,959
the week everything's going to go away

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:36,959
so what are you doing

00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:46,090
in an ideal world there's a shared

00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,710
password stall your whole team has

00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,940
access to achieve login to there you

00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,560
find the cloud provider entry you

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:54,480
entered the Recovery's okay and that's

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,480
the - if a everything's great

00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:05,050
hopefully hopefully everything is great

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:09,339
but maybe not into the recovery token

00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:10,990
and it isn't accepted try all of them

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,550
none of the may accept it they all got

00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:14,470
invalidated by their security conscious

00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,650
person it was like I can't leave this

00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,650
behind

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,709
or maybe you discover that cloud

00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,030
provider isn't in the past we store

00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:23,410
because it was weather first one set up

00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,540
and it wasn't like a shared password

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,800
stores personal founders password store

00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:32,560
and it was on their laptop and they wipe

00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:34,510
their laptop and oh dear potentially you

00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,950
discover none of the security answers

00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,830
work any longer they will go change as

00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:40,710
well they got randomized or who knows so

00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:44,170
how do you recover on that scenario

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,370
maybe you contact the helpdesk contact

00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:50,520
your account manager their cloud

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:52,810
provider depends on how big you are

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,160
maybe you ask for help on social media

00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:55,540
I've certainly seen a bunch of people

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,820
begging for help on social media when

00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:58,990
they've been look terrible things and

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:00,790
sometimes it works sometimes someone

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:03,460
knows someone inside their company and

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,630
they can help a lot of that becomes a

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:07,330
whole lot harder if you know actually

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:09,640
paying for the service if it's a free

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:11,260
service maybe they've minimized the

00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,820
whole helpdesk support here kind of

00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,470
things that's all your own problem if

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,090
you're paying for service you probably

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,650
have an Account Manager you probably can

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:22,180
talk to someone who might be able to

00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:25,870
help so how do you mitigate that problem

00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:28,360
and have role based authentication have

00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,920
multiple admins personal accounts get

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,500
them all of the same levels as they can

00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,780
all agree to these things or if you have

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,430
to have a shared account make it a role

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:40,690
accountant NOC account not

00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:43,300
founders name try and store all of the

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:46,390
TFA recovery token some essentially not

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:50,500
on the founders laptop but how do you

00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:52,750
order them and in particular how do you

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,789
order that regularly how do you discover

00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,889
that those winners here

00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:59,019
answers from three years ago and someone

00:18:56,889 --> 00:19:00,519
decided to change them all those weren't

00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:02,559
the recovery tokens and someone reset

00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,509
the password and retook the two FA and

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,789
now all those tokens have changed

00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:09,909
there's a whole time to take time of use

00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:11,979
kind of issue here and what if you're

00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:16,059
the organisation is buying their company

00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:20,109
how do you audit that practice how do

00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:21,549
you do - you and diligence on there so

00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:23,469
just before I move on I'm doing just

00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:27,339
going to repeat that trigger warning

00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:34,359
about bad scenarios involving death in

00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:37,989
case anyone wants to look away sorry our

00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:40,449
fifth and last scenario a close relative

00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:42,099
or a close family friend suddenly passes

00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:44,409
away you're asked by the family to

00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:45,879
assist with their digital affairs your

00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:47,259
first step is to log into all the

00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:48,909
theatres online accounts and figure out

00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:51,129
what to preserve what to close what

00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:52,899
needs to ruin huge what needs to be page

00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:59,199
as the bills are turning out etc etc

00:19:52,899 --> 00:20:00,819
what do you even start the obvious thing

00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:03,190
is start with what you know maybe you

00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:05,009
know the social media accounts maybe you

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,149
know their email try and get into those

00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:09,279
go through the whole password reset

00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:12,279
process as much as you can start

00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,959
building an inventory of accounts from

00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,629
personal experience doing this for

00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:18,429
friends and also family members it's

00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:21,359
going to take months it's probably going

00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:24,849
to take years to complete

00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,999
it's just ongoing and you're going to

00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:29,379
find out about accounts by surprise

00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:31,690
suddenly you get this email a year later

00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:34,690
that such and such as due for renewal or

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:36,519
something like that and sometimes you'll

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:42,609
find out when they threaten to delete

00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:46,779
data like Flickr Flickr got bought by a

00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:49,509
very small privately owned photo company

00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:51,190
which is family-run they had costs that

00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:53,529
were wildly exceeding what they had in

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:55,149
mind and not enough income and one of

00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:56,829
their plans was to massively reduce the

00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:58,690
storage and suddenly everyone's accounts

00:20:56,829 --> 00:21:01,209
we're going to be reduced to a thousand

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,039
photos and less they were paying they

00:21:01,209 --> 00:21:05,829
caused a bit of controversy or more

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,320
recently last few months Twitter plan to

00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:12,220
delete a bunch of inactive usernames

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:14,050
I personally logged into a friend who

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,660
had passed away their Twitter account in

00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:19,470
order to agree to the Terms of Service

00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,470
updates in order to stop that

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:27,070
so Marin has a very interesting point in

00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:29,350
response to Twitter scenario she says I

00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,870
think Gates is one of the places were a

00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:34,810
design and development which focuses on

00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:37,120
a single user falls down how do you

00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:43,180
capture dying in a user story or a

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:44,890
customer journey so having been there

00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,860
done that in this family scenario in a

00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:50,650
couple of couple of instances you won't

00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,330
have access to their cell phone and one

00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,710
of my cases the cell phone was literally

00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:56,590
in a different country and I was trying

00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:57,730
to help anyway or if you have access to

00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,170
the cell phone you have exits of the

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,790
lock screen the things that pop up on

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:01,750
the lock screen like these amis codes or

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,080
something like that you might have

00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:08,020
access to those anything that someone

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,880
told you that you in advance that you

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:12,450
thought just in case this will be really

00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:16,300
obvious I'll totally remember you won't

00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:17,680
sorry you just won't remember and you

00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,940
might have it not have access to their

00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,910
password store if your password was

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,140
really super lock down you probably

00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,620
don't have all the bits needed to

00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,540
authenticate to it so in that instance

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,470
saved logins and their email client or

00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:34,870
something like that they're really

00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:36,870
really useful my suggestion here is to

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:40,300
consider your own personal threat model

00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:41,800
if you losing access to your account in

00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,230
some scenario is a bigger risk than

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,870
iridium breaking in or someone in the

00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,370
house getting exists your account may be

00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:51,910
you should be optimizing for

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:56,260
availability or at least some sort of

00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:59,770
recoverability people laughing at

00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:01,540
password notebooks but honestly in the

00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,760
scenario of a family member passing away

00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,850
a password notebook was absolutely

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,350
invaluable because you can go through

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:15,190
the pages you can find the accounts and

00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:20,170
the passwords that are likely to be in

00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:21,970
use and it's quite easy to go through

00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:23,350
that process and the way that

00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:30,039
encrypted past all you might not even

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:32,679
have access to so if you keep physical

00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:34,360
records in some safe place not a post-it

00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:36,309
notes on your monitor maybe but a

00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,230
notebook first looked in a drawer then

00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:43,379
you know one king DX is to analyse there

00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,379
in your house that's potentially better

00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:47,559
otherwise you're back down the password

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:51,220
reset minor

00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:52,809
lion my suggestion is consider in

00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,159
advance how you're going to recover from

00:23:52,809 --> 00:23:56,470
A to F a device that's temporary

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,990
unavailable maybe you're traveling maybe

00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:02,169
you left it behind as I said earlier I

00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:04,090
saw this this week maybe you've

00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:05,799
permanently lost her my food of someone

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:09,009
who had an uber key that will syndicated

00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:11,440
a bunch of things and after several

00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:13,570
years it eventually broke off their

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,029
keyring and dropped somewhere in who

00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,259
knows fortunately they had another new

00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:20,529
bequite it was indicated the same

00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:22,240
accounts but even sorry maybe it's

00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:24,460
broken maybe it just doesn't work

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,409
anymore maybe your answers to all of

00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,830
those scenarios are the same maybe your

00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:31,120
answers to those scenarios are different

00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:34,809
at least think about how you're going to

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,210
convince a helpdesk that you were you if

00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:40,419
you're going to encrypt all those

00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:42,730
security questions needs thinking about

00:24:40,419 --> 00:24:44,559
and if you're gonna make those answers

00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,830
really obvious there also needs thinking

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,830
about

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,310
so is this some sort of equivalent of a

00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,640
digital power of attorney even in case

00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:00,290
of emergency break glass and can you

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,360
document that in a way that you loved

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:04,780
ones will understand or someone trying

00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:08,180
to help when you can't will understand

00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:10,760
and that respect I would recommend

00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:12,860
having a look at the kauai con talk by

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,200
Laura Bell about exactly the scenario

00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,730
she had a number of people who were

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,920
retired that she was attempting to help

00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:25,760
and their security needs were somewhat

00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:27,110
different so in summary you don't have

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,660
one authentication yet they said you

00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:32,480
have several indication methods they use

00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,940
either completely alternately or in

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,110
combinations to prove who you are the

00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,080
weakest one is going to be the one

00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,910
that's attacked but you might find

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,960
yourself facing the strongest

00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:45,710
combination and prepared at a time you

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,050
weren't expecting

00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,290
so maybe consider optimizing for

00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:53,410
availability or at very least

00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:56,540
recoverability have a look at those

00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:59,060
recovering from two if a loss guides as

00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,620
you're signing up figure out what your

00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:02,060
plan is whether you're going to print

00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:08,300
things out we're going to store them

00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:12,200
those kinds of things so we have a few

00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:15,200
minutes for questions I'm also open to

00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,230
short answers to any of the tabletop

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,570
scenarios if anyone has answers that

00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:23,120
they'd like to share answers and

00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:25,160
questions should be about a tweet links

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,370
a sentence or two so everyone gets a

00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,370
chance

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,360
I earn a few other people watch this

00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:39,549
talk but how do I get every service that

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,169
I've ever used to also watch this talk

00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:45,549
and think about their own recovery

00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:48,429
mechanisms indeed and that's the reason

00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:49,750
I wanted to give this talk I have wanted

00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:51,309
to give this talk for a couple of years

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,650
because having gone through the

00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:55,539
scenarios within the case of my friend I

00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:58,900
started about three years ago when he

00:26:55,539 --> 00:27:00,910
passed away on this process of how do

00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:04,450
you even deal with that I spend a lot of

00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:07,210
time going I am my friend I would like

00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:09,039
to reset my password and if you've just

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,770
had someone really close to you pass

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,840
away it's not a fun experience I drew

00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:16,390
the line at actually talking to people

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,820
and saying I am my friend I would say I

00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:21,220
am the system in of such-and-such or

00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,320
something like that but it's just not

00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,330
considered Mirren's point in that tweet

00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,919
a little bit earlier is really important

00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:29,559
a whole bunch of services need to

00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:31,990
consider not just dying but people were

00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:34,530
in compare sedated hospitalized someone

00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:42,789
has to take over for a period of time

00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:44,740
the question behind you have you come

00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:46,960
across any examples of people putting

00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:50,950
the error break in a case of fire

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:54,580
details in the ER world I personally

00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:55,960
haven't it's not a bad idea I probably

00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,460
wouldn't put them in a will I would

00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,919
probably put them in something like a

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,140
living power of attorney so the idea of

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,900
a living power of attorney is and I have

00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:06,520
one for my mother is that in case

00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,929
someone is hospitalized or something

00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,210
like that can't make their own decisions

00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:12,039
there's a process where you can start

00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:13,690
acting on their behalf and their best

00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:15,640
interests and that's the sort of

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,320
scenario where you do at least put

00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,600
details of go to such and such a lawyer

00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,270
and get them to get this envelope out

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,010
and this will give you more access Laura

00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:31,360
bells talk also goes into their kind of

00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:33,610
scenario hi your your comment about the

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,730
mother's maiden name as a horrible

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:38,169
horrible security question from personal

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,130
experience if you put random characters

00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:41,260
in there

00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:45,540
the bank will happily except it's just

00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,540
random information as an answer yep

00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:51,490
so then the validation if the validation

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,770
is a person it's relatively easy and

00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:56,710
it's the person but yes you've got the

00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:58,360
right answer on us and putting please

00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,340
don't use the social security question

00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:03,610
he knows the answer that doesn't work

00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:07,270
either no on something slightly

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:10,750
different if you're if anyone here is

00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:12,880
going through the process of trying to

00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:16,630
get passwords if you're the executor for

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,179
someone try and get a list of their bank

00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:22,720
accounts as well from personal

00:29:19,179 --> 00:29:25,419
experience some people have a lot of

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:29,250
bank accounts if some people that can be

00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:32,530
quite confusing and I watched my father

00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:38,080
spent four years trying to find all of

00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:42,790
his father's money so yes a list of bank

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:44,350
accounts is also in that same respect to

00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:48,309
the earlier question about powers of

00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:51,010
attorney and so on I have seen people

00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:52,600
keep a document possibly with your

00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:55,570
lawyer possibly in the house somewhere

00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,730
secure which is here's my insurance

00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:01,419
company here here of the bank accounts

00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:04,360
here's the stockbroker borrow two pages

00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:05,679
with a detail absolutely invaluable if

00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:10,419
you're trying to help someone in this

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,710
kind of scenario I think we're about out

00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:12,160
of time so this will be the last

00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:18,100
question

00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:19,750
yep hi unfortunately this year I tell

00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,730
you I'm actually think about a lot of

00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,880
this because I was close to dying before

00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:27,790
receiving a liver transplant in June and

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,880
I did a lot of what you said but now

00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:32,890
thinking about it now I probably should

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,380
have at least run my wife through like a

00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,030
dry run oven because I had like a

00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:40,150
password manager everything was saved in

00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:42,760
there I wrote down the the encryption

00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:44,590
key for the password but I don't think

00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,230
I've actually showed her how to actually

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:49,210
use it yeah so that might be something

00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:53,290
to think about if you have your password

00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:55,480
manager which I do if you haven't shown

00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:57,250
someone else how to do that and they're

00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,810
going to need to take over will they

00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:01,360
even be able to figure that out

00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:02,980
under time of stress when they need to

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:07,020
get into accounts and keep on paying the

00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:09,610
bills or whatever it is so thank you all

00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,500
those slides are online if you want to

00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:13,330
have a look at it the last few slides

00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,650
repeat the tabletop scenarios if you

00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,650
want to go through them somewhere else

00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,500
