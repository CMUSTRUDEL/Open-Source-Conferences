Consider these two cases: Volkswagen was caught out having written software code that allowed their cars to cheat emissions tests. Uber also developed software (called 'greyball') which allowed them to cheat law enforcement officials trying to crack down on ride-sharing. The difference between them is that Volkswagen software engineers went to jail, and Uber software engineers didn't. Why? Because one is a car company, and one is a software company.

Most industries have had what we might call an "oh no" moment. It's those moments that encourage industries to become better regulated, in order to prevent further disasters. The IT industry has had many moments that could be considered consequential enough to encourage better regulation, but the changes have never been made. Because the industry has avoided effective regulation for so long, it is possible that we are hurtling towards a disaster of epic proportions, one that we haven't even managed to conceive of yet.

In this talk, I will go through some historical examples of disasters leading to regulation in other industries, and the measures that were put into place to mitigate the problem. I will also address some of the major moments from the IT industry that should have prompted regulation, and haven't. Finally, I will discuss ways that IT professionals can blow the whistle on potential disasters before they happen ... without losing your job!

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

the room alright so we are rolling I'll

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,690
start a minute early because I feel it's

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,519
probably not even a minute early anymore

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,049
because I feel like we can't fit any

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,519
more people in anyway so it's not like

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,949
anybody's going to turn up late and if

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,199
they anyway I'll stop blabbering thank

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:24,779
you so much for coming to the security

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:26,789
identity and privacy mini conf it's Erin

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,449
at the frontier in blue shirt waving and

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,160
knitting and I ran this last year I was

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,040
great fun we come back and done it again

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,570
and I'm very happy to say that the

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,670
community came out and brought in a lot

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,010
of CFPs we got more CFPs than we could

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,020
fit in which for organizers like us is

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,460
great because it means we've got lots of

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,289
good quality content to choose from

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,610
unfortunately for you it means you don't

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,870
hear all the good quality content

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,210
because we only have so many hours in

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,309
the day but I think we've we've come up

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,809
with a pretty good lineup for the day I

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,550
know there are other mini comps going on

00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,289
so pick and choose whichever talks you

00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,969
want to go to but we've got a bit of a

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,680
story flowing through the day where

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,019
we'll start off with some of the impacts

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,990
of security and privacy and flowing on

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,939
through ways you can look at addressing

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,979
those and and then finish off the day

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,350
with a bit of a I don't would you call

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,150
it a motivational talk will you murder

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,119
back there is gonna be closing our event

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:23,369
tonight probably more up more of a deep

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:24,869
D motivational talk from beginning so

00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:27,630
hands up if you know Lana already or you

00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:29,100
at least recognize her hair if you know

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,360
Lana in any way whatsoever you'll

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,829
probably understand that it's not

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,720
unusual for me to have a store whether

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:35,970
or not I should read her bio and for her

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,329
to say here read this one instead so I'm

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:41,159
totally prepared Aaron would also like

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:42,420
me to point out which I'm sure you'll

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,610
notice yourselves because we're all the

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,869
Stute in this room the fantastic way

00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,040
that Lana has managed to color

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,970
coordinate her hair and her shoes I

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,770
think we probably need to find a prize

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,710
futures for that as the most coordinated

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,119
speaker of the day so Lana Brindley has

00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,040
been playing with technology since the

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,759
summer of the 80s when she got eaten by

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,079
a grue she's been writing since she

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,700
could hold a pencil and is currently

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,799
writing technical documentation for

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,119
Susie after spending many years hanging

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,520
around the OpenStack community and

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,990
generally making a pest of herself

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,000
Vala enjoys going to technical

00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,500
conferences to talk about stuff that has

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,540
been buzzing around in her brain for too

00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,270
long and also to make sure she leaves

00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:23,830
the house from time to time while she

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,680
isn't generally a technical pessimist

00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,450
she reads IBM and the Holocaust Reaper

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,400
she read IBM in the Holocaust recently

00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,320
and has been looking a technical

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,860
development with an AI with the weary

00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,820
high ever since she's fairly certain the

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:42,310
future robot overlords will be benign

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:53,010
mostly we hands together Falana thanks

00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:59,890
very much can everyone hear me okay

00:02:53,010 --> 00:03:03,700
excellent so this little story starts

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:05,670
with the American son of German migrants

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,790
his name was Herman Hollerith

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:12,220
he was born in 1860 he got a degree in

00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:18,190
engineering and he went to work in the

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:19,750
US Census Bureau in 1879 stay there at

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,800
that time the census was just a head

00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,810
count

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,820
they didn't collect any real data on the

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:29,140
population and they run it every ten

00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:30,460
years so as it was they went it was

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,140
taking them many many years to actually

00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,660
collect the data and get it together

00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,220
before the next census ran and the big

00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,440
problem at the time was it's going to

00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:40,210
start to take more than ten years so the

00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,440
last census wouldn't be finished before

00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:45,580
it was time to do the next one of course

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,320
these days we would call that

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,840
overwhelming technical debt but they

00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,250
didn't have a name for it so young

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,890
master Hollerith was a bit of a bright

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,630
spark he said there ought to be a

00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,900
machine for doing the purely mechanical

00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:02,350
work of tabulating and he set out to

00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,810
build one by 1884 he had a prototype and

00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:08,890
the US Census Bureau used to the

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:10,810
machines at for the 1890 census so the

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,400
data now I'm not going to use my laser

00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,070
pointer so I'm hoping you can follow my

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,450
instructions the data is first encoded

00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:19,480
on the punch card of the pantograph

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,130
which is down here on the right then

00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,020
operators load the card into the

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,090
tabulator up here on the left so it goes

00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,219
into the Swede sort of see a bit of a

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,930
slots there

00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:30,580
pins dropped down onto the card and

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,050
where there's a hole the pin drops

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,590
through into a little pool of mercury

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,909
which completes the circuit the circuit

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:40,810
increments one of the dials on the top

00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:43,479
there so each dial on the machine for

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:45,939
the census represents one character

00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:49,349
trait age gender state that kind of

00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:52,180
thing the operator records the data

00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:54,039
removes the card and puts it into the

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,449
sordid drawer and just see it sticking

00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,759
out of the corner there it's basically

00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:58,180
just a cabinet put it into the sort of

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,000
drawer

00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,250
reset the tabulator ready for the next

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,639
card according to the US Census Bureau

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:10,659
history site operators could process 80

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:14,770
cards a minute this way that's 8 0 cards

00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:17,020
a minute because Hollerith was a bit of

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,360
a smarty pants he didn't sell the

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:23,110
machines to the government he leased

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,249
them and after a bit he managed to lease

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:26,469
them to all sorts of government

00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:28,089
departments all around the world and

00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:31,210
that was great because it kept the money

00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:33,240
rolling in in between US censuses to

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:35,919
handle this he created a company called

00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,460
creatively the Hollerith electric

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,259
tabulating system over the next few

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,180
years Hollerith company found other

00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:45,639
companies that were making quote

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,979
machines things like employee punch

00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:50,199
clocks weighing systems and they merged

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:54,189
into a partnership called the computing

00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,930
tabulating recording company or CTR the

00:05:54,189 --> 00:05:59,139
company became International Business

00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,479
Machines in 1924 and the companies were

00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:05,949
finally all merged became the IBM we

00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:07,960
know and love today in 1933 anyway I

00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:10,240
have a whole other talk that I could

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,669
give on IBM corporate history because

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,500
some things one other things I also have

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:17,110
an MBA which qualifies me to actually

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,240
talk about that stuff unlike this and

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,039
the short version of IBM corporate

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,069
history talk is that Thomas J Watson

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:28,300
became IBM chairman in a ridiculously

00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:32,560
dodgy deal in 1914 while he was in jail

00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:34,719
and he remained so he remained chairman

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,649
he didn't remain in jail he remained

00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:39,940
chairman until he died in 1956 because

00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:42,460
this guy was so

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,310
oh gee he didn't like writing things

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:49,590
down and I mentioned that only because

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:52,360
it becomes important later in the story

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,670
these are some early IBM machines made

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,250
by the German IBM subsidiary called de

00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:59,650
home AG these machines were called the

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,110
DA home AG collar SD eleven tabulator

00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,570
and sorter got the tabulator on top and

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,730
the sorter this is the modernized

00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,360
version of the of the wooden cabinet we

00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:12,100
saw down in the corner in the last slide

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,870
there originally used primarily in banks

00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,760
to process account transactions

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,370
calculate compounding interests that

00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,410
kind of thing and most interesting to

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,660
the government of the day the German

00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,520
government of the day is to

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,700
cross-reference bank account numbers to

00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:34,480
census data I will remind you where in

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:36,190
Germany in 1935 you know when you see

00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,320
pictures of people who've been in the

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:41,680
concentration camps and they have a

00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,870
number tattooed on their arm that number

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,620
connects the human being to the punch

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:50,560
card for one of these machines so I'd

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:52,919
like to give you some facts in Holland

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,419
they had extensive Hollerith

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,090
infrastructure was very well organized

00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:58,570
they're quite advanced by the end of the

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:01,180
war

00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:05,080
seventy-three percent of Dutch Jews had

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,550
been killed in France they didn't have

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,600
very much holler at the infrastructure

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,000
there was actually a competing company

00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:14,680
that was of course incompatible it was

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,590
disorganized they didn't have a huge

00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,040
amount by the end of the war only 25

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:22,270
percent of French Jews had been killed

00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:25,120
because there are the factors I'll admit

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,370
that in short though without this

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,380
technology the Holocaust would still

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,260
have happened don't get me wrong it

00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,419
would not have been so well organized it

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:38,740
would not have been so well planned it

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:41,110
would not have been so well executed of

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,969
course I'm sure you all know about the

00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,580
Nuremberg trials that happened after the

00:08:42,969 --> 00:08:47,890
war we remember those for the Nazis that

00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:51,700
were tried and found guilty for war

00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:53,310
crimes in the main trial there were 12

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,310
more trials

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,459
between 1946 and 1949 I don't know about

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:02,060
you but I didn't learn that in school

00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:05,100
those trials covered 177 people

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:09,899
physicians judges military personnel

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:13,410
civil servants and industrialists people

00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:15,499
like Gustav Krupp the crop company

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,850
provided Panzer tanks to the Nazis

00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:20,579
interestingly it didn't flow that

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:23,370
company down very much you probably know

00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:27,329
them as ThyssenKrupp now and they make

00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:30,389
elevators so you would expect knowing

00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:31,829
this that senior IBM officials would

00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:36,529
have ended up before the Nuremberg

00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:38,610
trials just like mr. Krupp joke's on you

00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:41,490
then your own burg trials were pretty

00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,319
unique they had to be conducted in four

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,800
languages more or less simultaneously

00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:48,360
and this has never been done before

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,069
would anyone like to take a guess at who

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,350
provided the computing power to make

00:09:50,069 --> 00:10:00,600
that happen

00:09:51,350 --> 00:10:03,389
anyone know try again Ivo very well done

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,069
thank you okay so the completely

00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:06,779
unrelated reasons I actually happen to

00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:09,959
be in urine burg around about the time I

00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:11,970
was writing this talk I took the

00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:13,680
opportunity to go to the documentation

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,480
center and the Nazi Party rally grounds

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,189
took me about three hours to go through

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,809
the museum it's extremely moving I

00:10:17,189 --> 00:10:22,430
highly recommend it to anyone if you

00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:24,449
happen to be in Nuremberg or close by

00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,959
fascinating really good tour really

00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:29,990
enjoyed it

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:32,009
IBM was not mentioned once I was looking

00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:35,309
so now I'd like to have a short mental

00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:37,980
health break and Ben may like to do some

00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:40,470
do some honors for me say take a deep

00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,290
breath everybody breathe in breathe out

00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,149
let all the Nazis go we're gonna we're

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:49,429
gonna move on from the Nazis a little

00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:52,499
bit would anyone like some candy yes

00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:54,510
excellent got somebody here down the

00:10:52,499 --> 00:11:08,500
back nice work

00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:14,610
everyone breathing again please please

00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:18,940
repeat it we have a winner

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:23,560
hey excellent awesome let's move on

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:25,150
fewer Nazis I promise okay hopefully

00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,210
what you've picked up so far is that

00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:31,360
Hollerith was a brilliant young man who

00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:34,480
solved a very difficult problem it is

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,510
not Hollerith fault that his technology

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,600
was used to murder people in world war

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:42,850
ii it's also not his fault that no one

00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,230
was held responsible it's also not his

00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,930
fault that we seem to have collectively

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,740
forgotten about it the point I would

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,180
like to make is that throughout history

00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,300
technology has been used in some pretty

00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:57,640
horrible ways so now I would like to

00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:03,910
take a look at some more historical oh

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:06,040
no moments Alfred Nobel I'm sure you

00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:09,760
recognize his name he was the guy who

00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:13,930
invented dynamite he also owned a large

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:18,280
weapons manufacturing plant so Alfred's

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:20,950
brother died in Kon in France and a

00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:25,990
French newspaper got confused and wrote

00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:29,260
an obituary for Alfred it was not and I

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:32,890
loved it so much it was titled The

00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:35,740
Merchant of death is dead and it had

00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:38,290
this wonderful line in it dr. Alfred

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:41,230
Nobel became rich by finding ways to

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:46,810
kill more people faster than ever before

00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:49,900
so Alfred read this obituary for himself

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:54,250
had what is technically known as an Ono

00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:56,110
moment and completely secretly went on

00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,740
to establish the Nobel Prize with his

00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:02,800
personal fortune hilariously he decided

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,330
not to tell anyone about it so we all

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,950
got a wonderful surprise when he died

00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,950
for real and we opened his will

00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:13,000
Otto Hahn got the Nobel Prize for

00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:15,580
chemistry in 1944 for working out a

00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,050
nuclear fission the prize should

00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,760
actually have been given to him along

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,850
with his two colleagues at the top here

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,720
that's Lisa Meitner and Fritz Strassmann

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,430
unfortunately the other two had to leave

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,420
Germany in a bit of a hurry a couple

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:30,220
years earlier later on of course that

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,590
technology was used to bomb Nagasaki and

00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,200
Hiroshima in the entire world had an Ono

00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:40,480
moment and now we have ethics committees

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,860
in chemistry eugenics was the practice

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,210
of sterilizing portions of the

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,030
population in order to stop them

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:49,630
breeding Hitler was obviously a big fan

00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:51,220
but I promised fewer Nazis so let's talk

00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:55,570
about when it was a bit of a big deal in

00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:57,820
the u.s. 33 US states had sterilization

00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,620
programs in place it was against

00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,630
mentally ill people disabled people

00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:04,570
alcoholics people living in poverty and

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,730
people deemed to be promiscuous who as

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:10,600
far as I can tell by reading the reading

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:12,940
the history was mostly black women some

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:16,600
reports say that around 65 thousand

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:19,630
Americans were legally sterilized during

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,950
the first half of the 20th century that

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,190
turned out to be a bit of an oh no

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:26,290
moment for biology later on of course

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:29,110
the World Health Organization it was

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:31,180
created in 1948 and it was the first

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,280
specialized agency of the UN which I

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,610
think speaks to how important the world

00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,800
thought it was it's its mission is

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,110
really multifaceted and I went through

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,060
its mission document to try and find a

00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:47,740
nice single sentence line that sort of

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:49,390
summed it up to address the underlying

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,620
social and economic determinants of

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,180
health through policies and programs

00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,770
that enhance health equity and integrate

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,780
pro-poor gender responsive and human

00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:59,260
rights based approaches if I can

00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,340
summarize that for you it's don't let

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,030
your government kill you and tell you

00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,030
it's good for your health

00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:08,560
in a similar vein there have been some

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,290
great drug failures thalidomide is

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,910
probably the one most people know of it

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,500
did make the idea of having some better

00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:17,530
oversight or medicines seemed like a

00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:19,900
good idea the leader made was sold over

00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,329
the counter from 1957 all around the

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,279
world

00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:24,049
it was recommended to pregnant women to

00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:27,110
alleviate the symptoms of morning

00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:30,529
sickness unfortunately it also created

00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:33,379
horrific birth defects about 40% of

00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:35,839
children died when they were born after

00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:38,119
their mothers having falooda made those

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,549
who did survive were missing the long

00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:44,660
limbs many of them yeah I know right

00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:46,129
court cases were brought against the

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,980
manufacturer all over the world

00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:52,059
including a class action in Australia

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:54,199
that actually only was finalized in 2012

00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:56,059
the u.s. food and drug administration

00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:58,459
already existed at the time of

00:15:56,059 --> 00:16:00,470
solidified but the thalidomide cases

00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:02,089
strengthened its ability significantly

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,189
and there was actually a whole bunch of

00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:06,619
other laws including here in Australia

00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:10,040
that were strengthened as a result of

00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:11,629
this alittle mind cases we didn't let

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,189
too many bridges collapse before we

00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:15,470
decided that civil engineering could use

00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:16,999
some regulation that's the National

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:20,209
Society of Professional Engineers which

00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:22,850
was established in 1932 for a in America

00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:24,470
anyway and it only took one plane flying

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,449
into a building to establish that maybe

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:29,029
we shouldn't let people take box cutters

00:16:26,449 --> 00:16:33,439
on planes I'm hoping you can see where

00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:36,290
I'm going here people very rarely come

00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:39,709
up with new ideas new inventions new

00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:43,009
technology with the intention of killing

00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:46,639
or hurting people it's the unintended

00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:48,499
consequences that cause the problems it

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,139
is also however those unintended

00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:52,790
consequences those are no moments that

00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:55,819
mean we end up with better regulation

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:59,329
better laws and our society actually

00:16:55,819 --> 00:17:00,799
improves as a result of that so ethics

00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:02,980
committees and government oversight is

00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:07,370
not going to stop bad things happening

00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:09,230
no I am a bit of a realist they do help

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,789
prevent them though and what they do is

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,850
give us some kind of recourse when the

00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:16,579
worst happens

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:21,370
but anyone like some candy take a breath

00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:21,370
breathing in breathing out Oh relax

00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,390
[Applause]

00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:38,309
oh I think I'm glad I'm up here

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,309
[Music]

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:47,549
[Music]

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,380
[Laughter]

00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:06,350
excellent

00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:11,290
okay ready to move on I want you to

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:13,490
consider these two cases Finster

00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,920
Volkswagen was caught out having written

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,840
software code that allowed their cars to

00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,560
cheat emissions tests I'm sure you

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:23,240
remember uber also developed software it

00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,010
was called grey ball allowed them to

00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,740
cheat law enforcement officials trying

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:30,050
to crack down on ride-sharing the

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,360
difference between these two cases is

00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:34,640
that Volkswagen software engineers went

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,390
to jail and uber software engineers

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,210
didn't

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:43,610
why because one's a car company and

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:45,980
one's a software company we all know

00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:47,330
Facebook and other startups tend to like

00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,660
to use the phrase move fast and break

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:53,180
stuff in IT we talk about innovation a

00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:56,300
lot we talk about thinking outside the

00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:58,100
box I'm sure we've all had a project

00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:02,630
manager who was urged us to think

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:04,460
different or challenge paradigms it's

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,730
all great and I am NOT suggesting that

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,100
we should stop creating

00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,660
trying to solve difficult problems I

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,730
don't think we should stop building new

00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,410
things don't think we should stop

00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:18,680
thinking up interesting ways to solve

00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:22,730
old problems but what happens when we

00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:29,510
like Alfred Nobel before us step back

00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:31,520
from what we've created and go I know in

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:35,450
my opinion IT should have had its own

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,940
own moment back when IBM technology IBM

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,820
provided the computing power that made

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,410
the Holocaust possible but not only did

00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,230
it go

00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:47,380
unpunished we've collectively forgotten

00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:49,270
about it in the 80 years since so

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:54,220
there's there's never actually been a

00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:55,960
public reckoning for that so the first

00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:58,090
part of this talk we were looking at

00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,510
some examples of ohno moments that led

00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:03,150
to real change the next part of this

00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:06,550
talk I'd like to look at some IT

00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:12,730
innovation some IT innovations that

00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:14,500
haven't led to real change this machine

00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,920
here was a medical device used in the

00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,990
1980s it was they treated cancer with

00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,390
radiation we still do this very much but

00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,940
not with this machine it was called the

00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:28,120
ferric 25 it was the third version of

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:30,460
this particular device the previous two

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,470
devices had hardware interlocks in them

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,660
so if the machine did something that

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:37,450
could potentially be dangerous it would

00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:39,760
blow a physical fuse that meant a human

00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:43,360
being had to go to the cupboard get a

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:47,370
new fuse out install the fuse go back to

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,370
the machine reset it and start again

00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:54,640
this version went to software control it

00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:59,290
was written entirely in assembly by one

00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:02,530
guy who it seems didn't quite know what

00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:08,230
he was doing and later on couldn't be

00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:09,790
tracked down we've all been there it

00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:12,670
turned out that the software he wrote

00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:16,000
had a race condition when you selected a

00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:18,940
mode it took eight seconds for the

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,220
machine to move into that mode if you

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,800
tried to select anything else during

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:26,980
that eight seconds the machine would

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,590
ignore it it would not move into the new

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,050
position so you would end up with the

00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:35,560
Machine physically set up for one

00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:40,990
operation and the beam set up for a

00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:43,530
different one this literally cooked

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,530
people

00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:51,729
being treated treated for brain cancer

00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:54,700
reported a bright light and the sound of

00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:59,259
frying eggs and he died three weeks

00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:02,519
later I know right

00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:02,519
incidentally they settled out of court

00:22:04,109 --> 00:22:08,619
cars are increasingly being driven by

00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:11,109
software rather than physical mechanisms

00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:12,609
and this is often referred to as drive

00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:15,249
by wire or a fly-by-wire I'm sure you've

00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:17,109
heard of it of course replacing physical

00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:19,839
connection with software can sometimes

00:22:17,109 --> 00:22:21,999
have interesting consequences and one of

00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,899
these is neatly demonstrated by Toyota

00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:27,369
in the early noughties in the u.s.

00:22:24,899 --> 00:22:29,799
coupler drivers had reported sudden

00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:33,519
unintended acceleration which is the

00:22:29,799 --> 00:22:37,570
technical term and in 2007 model lexus

00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:39,459
es350 which is one of those toyota

00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,589
investigated they determined that the

00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:43,619
floor mats were to blame the accelerator

00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:45,669
was somehow getting caught in the mat

00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:47,679
everyone brought their cars back had

00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:51,070
their floor mats replaced under warranty

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,869
and they nice toyota promised to make a

00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,429
couple of other modifications to prevent

00:22:52,869 --> 00:22:56,559
this from happening but they wanted to

00:22:54,429 --> 00:22:58,119
wait for the next major redesign so they

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,929
kept going with this model for a couple

00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:04,119
years interestingly at this time in

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:06,369
their corporate communications they

00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:10,629
ceased writing anything down it's funny

00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:12,700
how that always happens isn't it anyway

00:23:10,629 --> 00:23:15,549
so this design was used in the car for

00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:19,239
another couple years until a guy driving

00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:22,149
a 2009 model lexus es350 with his family

00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:23,849
in the car drove off the highway into an

00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:26,469
embankment and killed everyone on board

00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:28,959
this got a whole lot of news coverage in

00:23:26,469 --> 00:23:30,399
the u.s. at the time because a family

00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:32,739
member in the backseat had managed to

00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:35,109
make a 9-1-1 call which got onto the

00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:37,059
news now that's a youtube video it's

00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:39,009
actually a still of the youtube video i

00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:41,259
was intending to originally to play it

00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:42,729
it's about 25 seconds long and i

00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:45,700
listened to it and i felt ill so I

00:23:42,729 --> 00:23:47,489
decided not to this talk is traumatic

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,589
enough as it is

00:23:47,489 --> 00:23:54,149
it's on YouTube if you really want to

00:23:50,589 --> 00:23:54,149
bit up to you

00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:00,050
so them in the emergency call the man

00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,000
states that the accelerator is stuck and

00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,370
that the brakes won't work which is

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,770
probably your first clue

00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:09,880
so Toyota recalled more vehicles and you

00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:13,760
guessed it replaced the floor mats

00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,200
problems continued in 2013 a court ruled

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,050
that the problems were caused by

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,460
problems with the drive-by-wire system

00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:21,950
basically the runtime stack of the

00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,080
operating system was not large enough so

00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:26,240
the stack would grow too big overflow

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,290
overwrite data and that caused the

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:34,010
acceleration in the end though no single

00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:35,780
cause was ever identified if you talk to

00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,580
people about it now you do the rest the

00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,530
amount of research I have done on this

00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,770
you will find most people still blame

00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:44,930
the floor mats

00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:47,780
you might recall IBM's Watson

00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,580
that's ibm's watson the a the machine

00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,320
learning program not the wartime

00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:54,530
chairman for the record we've moved

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,060
forward in time ibm's watson beat a

00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:59,360
couple of smart humans on Jeopardy back

00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:01,190
in 2011 we also had google's ml program

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,000
alphago that managed to beat the go

00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:07,220
champion in 2015 then in 2018 an AI

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,620
system that Amazon was used to using to

00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:12,680
select resumes turned out to be sexist

00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:16,700
to the surprise of absolutely no women

00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:18,620
working in IT from all that we're now in

00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,130
a place where super convincing deep fake

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:24,500
videos more or less commonplace

00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:26,060
BuzzFeed created this deep fake video of

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:29,090
President Obama that went a little bit

00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:31,910
viral a few years ago and of course deep

00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:34,850
fake porn has been around for many years

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:36,230
and I don't want to understate the

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,860
damage that that is caused to

00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:42,200
individuals but I do wonder what happens

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:46,460
when a deep fake video of President

00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,870
Trump declaring war goes viral I do

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:52,400
think we've got some danger ahead on

00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:53,990
that road the completely unrelated

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,870
reasons I looked in for killer robots

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:58,430
seeing a few years ago I couldn't relate

00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:02,390
that story if anyone wants to know later

00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:04,880
on this is super tricky because the

00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:07,160
technology being used for for automated

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,419
weapons systems are also used for things

00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,580
like self-driving car

00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:12,739
aeroplanes medicines surgery and even

00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,029
peacekeeping operations because after

00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:18,200
all if you can drop a bomb you can drop

00:26:14,029 --> 00:26:20,659
an aid package in this case this was in

00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,249
South Korea South Korean University went

00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:24,109
into partnership with an arms

00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:27,129
manufacturer to develop autonomous

00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:30,619
weapons and what ended up stopping them

00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:32,559
was a a bunch of universities getting

00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:34,279
together to sign an open letter

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,929
incidentally that open letter was

00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:37,159
started by an Australian academic which

00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:39,830
I think is something we should be proud

00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:41,989
of but the open letter threatened to

00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:45,470
boycott the South Korean University

00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:48,289
involved South Korean government didn't

00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:50,570
intend to step in the UN didn't intend

00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:52,970
to step in and as it is we don't

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,369
actually know that the research has been

00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:57,019
stopped the Chancellor of the South

00:26:55,369 --> 00:26:59,539
Korean University wrote a lovely letter

00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:02,590
that said it had been I'm sure he was

00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:06,769
being honest but the weapons

00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:08,119
organization that was funding it I don't

00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:10,580
know but they could be quite happily

00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,109
moving along I wouldn't be at all

00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:15,009
surprised if they've waived chunks of

00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:17,869
cash at various academics to be honest

00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:19,999
it is all speculation of course I have

00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:22,070
no idea but that's kind of the point I'm

00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:24,799
trying to make there's no oversight

00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:27,019
there's no regulation there's no

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:32,149
repercussions and there's a massive

00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:33,769
amount of money this one since the first

00:27:32,149 --> 00:27:35,450
time I gave this talk has been picking

00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:37,850
up pace in the in the mainstream media

00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:39,049
and I'm sure you've heard about it so

00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,730
I'm not going to repeat all the finer

00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:42,139
details but I'd like to take a look at

00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,679
the software angle which the mainstream

00:27:42,139 --> 00:27:47,299
media seem to be missing so just to get

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,249
you up to date Shin Ji Young is a

00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:52,580
Provost in province in northwest China

00:27:49,249 --> 00:27:54,799
it is the primarily occupied by the

00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:58,129
weaker people who are the largest Muslim

00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:00,350
group in China in Houghton which is the

00:27:58,129 --> 00:28:02,029
capital of Xinjiang there is a police

00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,190
station every 300 meters or so they're

00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:05,659
kind of cute they look like this they've

00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:07,129
got lounges in the bottom and a place

00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:08,389
you can charge your phone so you can

00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:11,539
just sort of chill out at the bottom of

00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:13,129
the police station if that doesn't sound

00:28:11,539 --> 00:28:17,659
like a police state to you I'd like you

00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:20,239
to wait for the next bit every citizen

00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:22,180
has an identity card and you move

00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:24,760
through checkpoints around the city

00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:27,820
at a checkpoint police will scan your

00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,530
card they will take a photograph they

00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:32,140
will take your fingerprints and they

00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:33,610
will perform an iris scan you also need

00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,470
to unlock your phone and pop it into a

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,470
cradle where your data is downloaded for

00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:39,850
later use

00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:43,800
that's not just for the people they're

00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:46,330
suspicious of it's for everyone

00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:49,600
there are four or five checkpoints every

00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:51,820
kilometer and as citizens move through

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,970
they move through them many times a day

00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:57,070
just going by their daily business the

00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:59,140
roads are lined with polls with cameras

00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,970
which are watching pedestrians but

00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:04,870
they're also performing pattern matching

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:07,810
between drivers and licensed plants so

00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:11,020
if your Weger and you have done even a

00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:12,940
relatively minor infraction such as say

00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:15,970
calling your relatives who live outside

00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:18,060
china you will get sent to one of

00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:21,640
hundreds of thousands of re-education

00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:26,050
camps which until very recently did not

00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,370
officially exist no one really knows how

00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:31,120
many people are in the re-education

00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:33,340
camps ABC about six months ago we're

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,550
saying two million it could be many more

00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:38,650
we don't know of course locking up

00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:43,150
minority groups for no reason is nothing

00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:45,070
new by no means a new thing but I think

00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:48,910
the way technology is being put to use

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:50,440
in this case definitely is so I bet the

00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:53,590
people who invented facial recognition

00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:58,810
have had several ono moments over many

00:29:53,590 --> 00:30:00,190
years at least in part to China in that

00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:02,560
same vein you might have also heard a

00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:04,030
Palantir they're the company that use

00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:08,650
what they call quote Minority Report

00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:10,420
style predictions about crime originally

00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,730
developed for the Pentagon they used it

00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,290
to identify terrorists in Iraq but the

00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,330
technology has now been imported to

00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:18,040
downtown Los Angeles where it is being

00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,200
used to lock up brown people before they

00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,880
do anything wrong

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,880
incidentally if you google for Palantir

00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,510
you don't get any images so you have a

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:32,980
Minority Report still you're welcome

00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:34,630
point is it's not just China finally I'm

00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,039
sure you remember the two Boeing crashes

00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:39,190
that happened last year

00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:41,350
the 737 max story is interesting because

00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:45,909
it's not just a software failure it's

00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:47,409
also a documentation failure I am fully

00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:49,629
aware that I am going to oversimplify

00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:51,369
this so I'm going to apologize to all

00:30:49,629 --> 00:30:55,059
the the aircraft nerds in the audience

00:30:51,369 --> 00:30:57,039
I'm sure you exist but basically what

00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:59,979
happened here is they bolted some big

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:03,940
engines onto a small plane that's my

00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:06,340
interpretation that wasn't what caused

00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,399
the problem though what caused the

00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:12,519
problem was in the software that managed

00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:17,859
how the aircraft handled the bigger

00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:20,080
engines the chaser to that shot is that

00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:23,159
the documentation wasn't clear on what

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,499
to do when their software kicked in so

00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:28,779
the consequences of this while they were

00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:31,149
not particularly Swift they were

00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:34,119
decisive so you've got to give Boeing

00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:36,669
that a 737 max haven't flown since

00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:40,570
there's two accidents my primary concern

00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:42,759
on this is twofold first will they just

00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:46,330
bolt more software patches on to fix the

00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:48,039
problems or second what changes are

00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,629
being made to ensure that the software

00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:53,200
they write is less problematic in the

00:31:49,629 --> 00:31:54,970
future and we have our final mental

00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:02,139
health break so give out the last of

00:31:54,970 --> 00:32:03,909
Chuckies maybe do you feel anxious about

00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:05,679
the chocolates people do I need to

00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:07,270
remove the chocolates from this talk if

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,210
I give it in the future

00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:18,549
[Laughter]

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:21,580
we went up the back here I think I think

00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:30,970
there's still some left I don't want to

00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:42,190
take these home seriously I don't own a

00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:43,809
look at you sir good let's move on last

00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:46,330
last summer in the last stretch guys

00:32:43,809 --> 00:32:48,610
have nearly made it so while the

00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:50,740
increasing mainstream media awareness of

00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,960
personal data and the nefarious purposes

00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:55,480
that we can put it to has been very

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,029
heartening recently I'm not sure that

00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,279
Cambridge analytic and reviews into eber

00:32:58,029 --> 00:33:02,710
are enough to be considered an Ono

00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:05,860
moment that will actually change

00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:07,360
anything I was heartened to Cutler

00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:10,480
months ago to see a couple of

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,340
responsible technology organizations pop

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,350
up in Australia highly recommend you go

00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:18,369
and check them out and support them so I

00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:20,379
do think it might be starting everyone

00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:22,330
involved in technology development has a

00:33:20,379 --> 00:33:25,210
part to play before a product goes on

00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:27,730
sale project and program managers set

00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:29,679
the scope to find project software

00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,009
developers write the code quality

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,720
assurance tests software and hardware

00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:38,470
documentation writers explain it sales

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:41,379
goes out there and sells in all of us in

00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:43,179
our day to day jobs are in the position

00:33:41,379 --> 00:33:46,240
of poking at products that we don't

00:33:43,179 --> 00:33:49,450
fully understand in order to work out

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,240
how to make them work how to improve

00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:56,440
them and how to discuss them with our

00:33:52,240 --> 00:34:00,610
clients I say we should expand that

00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:03,639
thinking just a tiny bit how can I use

00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:05,320
this product to do harm how could I use

00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:09,190
it to discover things about people that

00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:12,119
I really should not be discovering can I

00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:14,260
use this social product to stalk my ex

00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:16,809
what about someone who said something

00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:20,859
nasty about me online what can they find

00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:23,590
out about me using this product can I

00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:27,310
use this platform this API this plugin

00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:31,390
this app this feature to do something

00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:36,250
that as reasonable moral human beings we

00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:37,750
feel just a tiny bit bad about it's also

00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,470
important to think about using it in

00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:43,080
conjunction with other technologies

00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:46,120
recognizing someone's face is one thing

00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,800
when you combine that with GPS locations

00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:49,990
government databases and purchase

00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,360
history you have a completely different

00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:54,370
problem

00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:56,260
you also have the answer to why I don't

00:34:54,370 --> 00:35:02,110
use supermarket loyalty cards anymore

00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:04,540
a point I would also like to make here

00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:07,180
is that it's not just about ethics it's

00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:08,380
not just about individual humans doing

00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,140
the right thing

00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,730
it's about legislation and it's about

00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:17,220
punishment for companies that do the

00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:21,190
wrong thing it's about enforceable

00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:23,980
accountability if I can give you one

00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:27,850
piece of advice don't read your

00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:30,240
marketing departments hype if you do

00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:35,050
read your marketing departments hype

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:38,740
don't believe it nuclear fission has

00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:41,140
saved millions of lives are used in

00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:43,750
cancer treatment it's provided light and

00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:45,580
power to billions it's made surgery and

00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:48,130
even vegetables safer through a

00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:50,920
radiation that's what the marketing

00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:52,890
department want you to hear it also made

00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,690
nuclear war a real possible threat and

00:35:52,890 --> 00:36:02,230
the marketing department is unlikely to

00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:04,630
mention that so question things raise

00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:08,140
bugs talk about it with your development

00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:11,980
team and your manager until software

00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:16,150
engineering has a real honest-to-god Ono

00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:20,560
moment and the ethics board with actual

00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:22,990
legal teeth is born you individually

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,420
each one of you is at the forefront of

00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:28,530
technology that hurts and technology

00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,530
that doesn't thank you very much

00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:38,950
Thank You Lana we do have about nine ish

00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,660
minutes for questions if anybody has any

00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,860
please do wait for the microphone though

00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:46,750
so we can capture the questions for the

00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:49,810
camera thanks thanks my question is

00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:51,040
about I guess moral provenance you know

00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:53,140
where there's such a thing as fair trade

00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,780
coffee should we be considering

00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:58,390
technology choices that don't have the

00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,530
profits of people that have benefit from

00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:01,510
the suffering of others in their

00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:03,430
provenance as well like should we just

00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:06,160
boycott IBM full stop and build our own

00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:08,440
or like what do you think about that

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,030
idea I love the idea of labeling I think

00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,070
labeling would be a great word as

00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:14,260
someone with a child who has food issues

00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:16,000
labeling is great right labeling is

00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,590
awesome if we could work out a way to do

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,160
that for software and hardware that

00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:21,580
would make my day

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,140
honestly as far as boycotting I don't

00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:26,970
know I find boycotts especially with

00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:29,220
technology incredibly hard to to even

00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:32,320
realistically understand how that works

00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,300
I've I tried to deagle many many years

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,109
ago and completely failed clearly as you

00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:39,820
can see it's difficult it's difficult to

00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:42,220
boycott large companies especially large

00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:44,619
companies like Google Facebook Weber

00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:46,359
my job I haven't I haven't used uber yet

00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:49,810
I've managed to avoid that one so far

00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:52,359
but yeah just boycotting IBM is probably

00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:54,490
not realistically a thing any of us

00:37:52,359 --> 00:38:03,430
could do as much as I would like to say

00:37:54,490 --> 00:38:04,660
yes yeah today this is a question I've

00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,130
been thinking about recently that

00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,190
relates a little bit to your talk and I

00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:10,480
just like your answer to it given that a

00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:11,680
lot of this stuff obviously we're

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,940
talking about ethics and you're

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,340
definitely talking about history and

00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,920
learning from history which of the

00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:20,230
letters in stem involves a subject that

00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:26,700
would cover any of those ideas I don't

00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:29,350
know can we make the ear fix look I mean

00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,820
without wanting to toot my own horn too

00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,670
much I've spent a lot of time at

00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,770
university I've got several degrees and

00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:38,410
every single thing I have studied has

00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:40,510
had an ethics component and I am while I

00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:42,790
don't have an IT degree I have an

00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:43,599
Information Systems degree I'm

00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,339
absolutely

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:50,859
an IT degree would have had an ethics

00:38:45,339 --> 00:38:52,269
component to it as well okay it might

00:38:50,859 --> 00:38:54,819
depend on which university you're at the

00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:55,930
point I'm making is most degrees of some

00:38:54,819 --> 00:38:57,670
description will have an ethics

00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,349
component and I think that is the way we

00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:01,569
need to think about ethics it touches

00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:03,339
every single thing we do touches every

00:39:01,569 --> 00:39:07,619
single interaction we have with another

00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:09,699
human being so our lives intersect in

00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:26,349
interesting and sometimes unexpected

00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:28,029
ways I agree but what I'm saying is yet

00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:29,619
true but I don't think we can treat X as

00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:30,299
its own subject separate to everything

00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:32,890
else

00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:34,539
ethics is a component of absolutely

00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:36,190
everything we do and we need to treat

00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:40,709
ethics as a component of everything we

00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,709
do we can't just go out and study ethics

00:39:45,959 --> 00:39:51,549
sorry I'm trying to work out where the

00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:54,160
question is yes excellent I got a

00:39:51,549 --> 00:39:56,680
question have you looked at the ACM and

00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:01,299
I Triple E code of ethics they updated

00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:03,430
it last 2018 and I think that to me it's

00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:04,930
a very I mean it's a gold standard for

00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:07,390
how I thik should be yeah

00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:10,390
they are modeling not entirely after the

00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:12,789
medical fraternity but I think that's

00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:14,529
got good basis for you to consider I

00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:16,719
mean if you absolutely yeah I absolutely

00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:18,309
agree and the more people are on board

00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:20,799
with that the more what I'm saying is

00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:23,319
about enforceable enforceable

00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:27,160
accountability though we can't force

00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:28,660
anyone to abide by standard and we can't

00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,789
punish anyone if they fail to live up to

00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:35,049
that standard so that's sort of the

00:40:30,789 --> 00:40:37,059
point I'm trying to make as developers

00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:39,999
one of the things that we can influence

00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:42,839
is licensing but in the free software

00:40:39,999 --> 00:40:46,150
world many of the licenses we use

00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:47,920
intentionally don't restrict how people

00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:50,170
can use the software that it is made

00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,999
under those licenses should we be

00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:55,059
questioning that and should we be

00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:57,200
looking to change it yeah look um that's

00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:59,240
probably a topic for Karen Sandler or

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:02,720
one of the software Conservancy people

00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:05,920
to talk about yeah licensing needs work

00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,920
I'm not a lawyer

00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:18,859
Ilana thank you it's obviously an

00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:22,010
emotional talk for you and one of your

00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:24,130
points is that we as members of the

00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:26,960
community can take this forward and

00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:31,069
participate ethically to drive change

00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,380
but how do we impact unwashed around as

00:41:31,069 --> 00:41:36,349
the wider community the rest of the

00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:39,020
world because not not everyone has our

00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:40,700
perspective you know worry what are your

00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:43,069
views on how we move this forward

00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:45,829
outside of this room I don't know

00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:50,390
education I really don't know I wish I

00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:52,579
had no I don't I really don't know or

00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:54,799
like I guess that's why I give the talk

00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:57,349
I'm not a security person I'm not an

00:41:54,799 --> 00:42:01,490
ethics person this isn't my day job I'm

00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:03,049
a technical writer but it mattered so

00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:06,500
much to me when I started understanding

00:42:03,049 --> 00:42:08,329
it it like I said in the bio it's

00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,220
buzzing around in my brain and I had to

00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:13,700
get it out somehow and this seems like a

00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:15,650
good forum so yeah I don't have any

00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,420
answers I mean I wish everyone had just

00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:18,589
shut off Facebook and oberon all the

00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,930
rest we could just get on with our lives

00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:22,609
to be honest but I mean I still get

00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:23,869
dirty looks from people so yeah I

00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:25,000
couldn't find you on Facebook yeah

00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:27,890
that's because I don't use it

00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,180
mind you I do use Twitter everyone based

00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:30,410
me on Twitter and I probably shouldn't

00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,049
be using that either if I'm going to

00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:35,030
live up to my own ethics so it's so

00:42:33,049 --> 00:42:36,619
problematic on so many levels and as an

00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:39,339
individual it's really freaking

00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:43,460
difficult I wish I had answers I'm sorry

00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:44,930
hello hey I was very fortunate to hear

00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:53,599
one of the first versions of this talk

00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:55,309
many years ago it's a great talk but in

00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,349
that time since you first presented it

00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:59,869
that was before Cambridge analytic

00:42:57,349 --> 00:43:02,119
before the boring stuff before the Weger

00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:04,190
stuff started coming out what do you

00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:06,770
think it has to take before we do have

00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:08,940
that software or technology I know a

00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,740
moment I don't know

00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:12,540
I wish I knew and I guess that's

00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:14,070
probably why I needed to write the talk

00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:17,070
is to try and work out if there was a

00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:18,780
thread there's a and there is a thread

00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:20,370
that you can follow through history says

00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:25,200
I don't know where that what the next

00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:28,050
logical step is like I said I am the

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,000
first time when the we get entered the

00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:32,100
talk it wasn't in the mainstream media

00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,600
at all I found a single economists

00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,070
article on it and I actually carried

00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,320
that magazine around with me to prove

00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,760
that it was a real thing it has reached

00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,860
the mainstream media it's been all over

00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,330
the ABC for several months now so

00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,890
definitely go and read more about there

00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:45,800
are links in that if you go to that

00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:50,340
document there are links there two more

00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:52,050
and I'm I'm excited that they've

00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:54,510
reporting it I'm excited that you can

00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:55,650
say the plight of the Weger in Australia

00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:57,330
now people know what you're talking

00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:59,280
about right that's good we're not

00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:00,990
talking about the technology aspect of

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,220
it at all we're talking about it as

00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:04,530
concentration camps it's obviously a

00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,970
terrible and I'm not saying not and we

00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:07,410
shouldn't be we should be reporting on

00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:09,060
it but we're not looking at how

00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:13,980
technology is being used in this and I

00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:15,930
think China as China's lot to answer for

00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:19,050
in terms of the way they use technology

00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:21,240
and the way that Alibaba and ten cent

00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:22,380
and all those are in implicated in the

00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:24,920
way they use their technologies where

00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:27,120
they spy on their on their citizens and

00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,800
while no they're not a democratic

00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,290
country and I guess they can run their

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,330
country any way they like I think it's a

00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,670
lesson for us who do live in democratic

00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:37,770
countries to be very wary about what's

00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:39,570
going on and the way that technology is

00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,920
being implemented I wish I knew what the

00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:42,450
oh no moment was going to be because

00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,230
according to me it should have been IBM

00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:49,460
but again back in the 1940s and it

00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:49,460
hasn't happened so I'm still waiting

00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,250
well we're going to draw us a close

00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,180
we've we've come to the house

00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,620
all right I'm sorry but there is

00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:58,800
actually a woman who would like to ask a

00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:02,280
question can we please have can we chase

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:06,290
it understand a lot of questions from

00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:10,110
folks thank you very good presentation

00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:13,470
the the ethics I think is catching up in

00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:16,230
the academic world and the oversight as

00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:18,360
well the problem now is the research and

00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:20,430
development in big enterprises and

00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,400
there's no oversight there black spots

00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:24,109
but obviously like that

00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,990
yay again I know that there are some

00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:28,820
voluntary ethics committees and things

00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:30,470
coming in at some of the bigger software

00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:31,970
companies I think Google has one

00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:34,580
Facebook's talked about it not sure

00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:36,619
what's going on there but they're

00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:38,630
voluntary and they're internal and it's

00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:40,580
like the company looking after itself

00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:43,040
and I imagine there's going to be a fair

00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:44,240
bit of our she'll be right mate except

00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,900
probably the American version of that

00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:51,170
but um yeah I don't know I I do think we

00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:53,599
actually need an ethics board which can

00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:55,099
work as maybe as a UN subcommittee or

00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,839
something that can work internationally

00:45:55,099 --> 00:45:59,150
across borders and can actually punish

00:45:56,839 --> 00:46:01,580
people when stuff goes wrong because if

00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:04,240
we can start locking up uber people who

00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:07,490
kill people then that would be great

00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:10,600
thank you very much

00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,600
