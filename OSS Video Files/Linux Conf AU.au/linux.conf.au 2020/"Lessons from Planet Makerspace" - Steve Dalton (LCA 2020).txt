In 2011 I embarked on a project of creating a Makerspace on the Gold Coast.

At the time there was a massive lack of tech community in my new city and it was our original intention to create a "clubhouse" where fellow geeks could come together and form friendships and connections through hacking together. Simple hey?

What I didn't expect though was the massive outpouring of need for EDUCATION, from all ages and all levels. We were regularly mobbed by parents, teachers and even Universities begging for free help with their projects and even just wanting us to build it for them. All this while we were still finding our feet and battling with membership fees, making rent, committee member churn  and all sorts of other local politics! Baby sitting and freeloading strained us to breaking point!

This talk is the story of our space, but also how we eventually reached  equilibrium. We can now sustainably help people learn in a way that helps them to help themselves and build good learning and collaboration habits. I'll share some of the techniques we have learnt the hard way and tips & tricks that you might also be able to use in your own world.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:07,710
hi everyone my name is Steve Dalton my

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,139
details are on there if you want to talk

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,790
to me on Twitter I'm a local go coaster

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,620
so I'm really really happy the fact that

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:16,680
Linux confers finally come to my city

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,480
and I get to actually travel sleep in my

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,070
own bed and actually go on the tram and

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,650
come here and have a reasonably normal

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,300
life while being an LCA so thanks for

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,670
coming to our city and welcome you all

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,099
here I'm also a volunteer so you might

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,859
see me around doing things so I'm

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,410
talking today about something I started

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,700
some time ago here on the Gold Coast

00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:38,190
it's been a bit of a labor of love it's

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,090
called the Gold Coast tech space so tech

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:46,829
space is make space stroke hack space

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,840
that started around sort of 2011 prior

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,420
to 2011 we were kind of hacking around

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,180
that --gc luck was around and actually

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,039
these two guys on the front here were

00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:58,829
there before me even so you were the

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,629
precursor and I guess me coming to LCA

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,699
when I first started coming to LCA which

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,270
I think Steve was the one who told me to

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,970
go so have you to think and me going to

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,439
LCA really triggered a whole lot of

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,670
things in my community and when I came

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,860
back to the Gold Coast

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,930
I really saw like a huge vacuum and I

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,369
was like there's nothing going on on the

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,540
Gold Coast and I could see all the

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,210
things that you guys were doing in your

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,060
cities and I felt very sad about that so

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,250
few of us decided we wanted to basically

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,290
have building we wanted to have a place

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,360
to call our own and we had this kind of

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,579
naive view back then that it would be

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,229
just a place we could all hang out we

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,930
could just get care and we had our place

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,360
and we would have great internet and we

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,950
could just do whatever we want and it

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,360
didn't quite work out that way I have to

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,630
say there was a lot of things I happened

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,270
over the years lots of failures lots of

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,189
ups and downs and one of the big things

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,590
that really happened very early in the

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,049
days of tech space was that idea of us

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,640
having our little kind of guys Club just

00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,000
hanging around was just never going to

00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,579
happen

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,229
a lot of our sponsors who were giving us

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,610
money to get going wanted us to do

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:04,710
things they wanted us to actually get

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,479
involved in education and a lot of

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,090
people that came to us were just

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,530
desperately hanging out for education so

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,480
everyone would take came between my

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,069
education and I guess the number one

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,590
group of people that came to us

00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:18,120
the very start were parents so we had a

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,340
lot of parents on the Gold Coast just

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,290
really like desperately trying to find

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,549
something for their kids to do really

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,720
wanted to get them involved in

00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:26,970
technology and they weren't really

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,860
getting anything that they need it at

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,299
school at the time it's changed a lot I

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,400
have to say in our schools are doing an

00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:34,829
awesome job but back then it was really

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,269
there was a real vacuum as the schools

00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:38,129
were also coming to us people were

00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:40,319
knocking on our door and asking us how

00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:41,819
the hell do we do this stem thing based

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,250
on what the last speaker was talking

00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:46,829
about we had universities coming to us

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,420
we were doing 3d printing and no one had

00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:51,480
done 3d printing back then and it was

00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,310
like sci-fi so this guy down the bottom

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,709
trifid hunter who some of you might know

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,870
who was very early in the RepRap days

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,389
and I'd seen the RepRap at Melbourne and

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,950
it was actually all of that early 3d

00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,659
printing the expired mate if it was

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,760
awesome here at his first 3d print here

00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,109
which actually was all wooden he

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,599
actually had a few parts he printed

00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:11,790
himself and he was super kind he came

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,260
down to the Gold Coast as she came up

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,269
from the Gold Coast she was living in

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,400
northern New South Wales and showed

00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:20,129
everyone this 3d printer and for these

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,139
kids coming to a little science fairs

00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:23,940
this was like full-on sci-fi they were

00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:25,980
like they had they just didn't never

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,410
seen anything like this before so 3d

00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,599
printing was a big inspiration so we had

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,250
universities coming to us asking about

00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,660
3d printing and then we never see them

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,120
again and then a few months later we'd

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,340
hear some new story about some uni first

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,220
3d printed X and we'll are those were

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:43,109
the guys that came to see us and we also

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,629
had a lot of companies coming to us and

00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:47,639
kind of joked but there was spies but

00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:49,829
people would go all those those are the

00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,510
tech space guys go and see them and we

00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,129
would get a lot of free consulting give

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,620
a lot of free consulting to companies I

00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:58,109
have to say but it's just what happened

00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,879
we did a lot of tech mentoring myself I

00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,530
was giving career advice like every week

00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,750
people were coming to me asking me how

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,389
do I find a job it's very hard to find

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,940
tech jobs and the Coast then and he's

00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:11,790
always still today actually in a lot of

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,310
ways we did all sorts of activities with

00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:17,250
kids we did minecraft clubs we did

00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,949
workshops we did Lego Arduino Linux

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,989
install fests programming through lots

00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:23,729
of 3d printing as I said did a really

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:26,159
interesting class which was electronics

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:27,690
for mums which was for mum so you wanted

00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:29,490
to help their kids and they had no

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:31,520
what they were doing and so we gave like

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,460
mums very basic electronics knowledge

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,230
and we did a whole lot of all our

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,730
discovery workshops with the kids we

00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,500
really had a strong emphasis on

00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,820
show-and-tell so the end of the

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,350
workshops the kids would actually have

00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,600
to show their parents before they could

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,190
be taken away what they'd built and I

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,380
sort of occurred to me that wasn't

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,670
happening for a lot I could see the

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,140
parents it's the first time they'd seen

00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:54,420
a lot of the things the kids were

00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,850
working on so we repeated that you know

00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,430
it's quite a success but for doing all

00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,350
this we had a massive Burnette we were

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,550
all just working so hard on this a lot

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,920
of us were doing this instead of our

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,670
jobs we're just so sucked into it we had

00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:10,200
a big burner the space itself was making

00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,760
no money we're losing money I was

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,240
subsidizing it myself out of my own

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,190
pocket

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,710
we're losing members who had all sorts

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:20,040
of conflict around people within the

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,740
space and space war must fail actually

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,960
through doing a million things and doing

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,740
them kind of half-baked so what I'm

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,110
actually going to talk to you about

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,520
today is not all the failures but just

00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,620
some of the really good things I think

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,050
have popped out of this which I think

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,000
might be useful they may not have done

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,620
Elysee and so I'm just going to go

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,620
through a few of them now if that's okay

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,420
so the other thing we did do before I go

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:48,750
into those we did event so I ins not

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:51,000
even looking at the screen and so we did

00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,290
quite a lot of barcamps we barcamps over

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,150
the years and I've been involved in the

00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,340
Sidney Barker before I moved here so

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,380
that was something I repeated again and

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,720
again every year and those are still

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,490
going they're not as big as they used to

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,200
be but if you haven't heard of what I

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,410
said anyone not heard of what a bar

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,870
campus so bar camp spicier a known

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,760
conference where you can go and throw

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,500
any idea up on the wall so it's kind of

00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,070
like a smaller version of LCA with no

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,890
schedule and whoever turns up turns up

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:23,340
and we build an event out of it and a

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,450
lot of fun one of the good things I got

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,370
out of it was just the amount of people

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,500
who came to the bar camps over the years

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,270
we've got a good rotation of people and

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,180
it got me it's kind of know almost

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:35,070
everyone in my city so as a result now

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,350
good or bad I get people coming to me

00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,539
all the time for intro so I that kind of

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,760
knows everyone which can get a little

00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,080
bit tiresome at times but I learnt met a

00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,750
lot of people through barcamps

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,550
I think I knew you before BarCamp I in

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,660
but you iEARN came to a lot of our camps

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,669
all the way down from Brisbane and

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,590
blessing so thanks for that are you and

00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:54,000
you told lots of people about it as well

00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,860
so that was really good this one was

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,590
great we had there all the Doctor Who

00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,940
stuff along one of our members is now

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,820
unfortunately can't come to the space

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:05,880
he's quite unwell makes a lot of Doctor

00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,860
Who things and he made this Dalek so

00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,660
yeah lots of events science fairs we did

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,000
go car shows we'd a lot of meetups

00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,039
we stood all most of these meetups where

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,039
things like Robot Wars which were just

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:18,539
people who wanted to run these robot

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,710
events and didn't have anywhere to do it

00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:22,590
and they would just show up and run

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,580
these events tech guru ourselves we're

00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,380
quite interesting to actually want to

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,789
start these again because we've got so

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,010
much stuff in our heads is all this

00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:31,289
technology and we just lay it all that

00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:34,200
and do this big swap meet or people

00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:35,490
could come and buy things and something

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,990
we do every year around Christmas time

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,970
when we want to get away from our

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,070
technology we do like a board games

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:43,260
night where we don't bring any tech long

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,450
and we play board games just feel a lot

00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,030
of fun so to the things that have worked

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,110
well for us so and I should have this on

00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,600
this screen here so I'm just going to

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,700
stand here so we have an open night

00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,620
every Wednesday and it really isn't open

00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,720
night it's totally open anyone can come

00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:58,979
you don't have to be a member and that

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,620
kind of comes with good and bad

00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:03,870
sometimes we have very strange people

00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,600
turn up but that's fine we just everyone

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,919
is welcome and anyone who's moving to

00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,060
the city a lot of people come to the

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,840
Gold Coast and they don't know what's

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,260
going on here

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,990
and they will Google tech Gold Coast and

00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:18,560
usually they find us so lots and lots of

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:21,990
new people come by on a Wednesday and

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,550
meet make friends so we have a lot of I

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,140
guess I'll call it hacker fellowship

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,460
people who just don't know anyone and

00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,810
that was what they were there that's

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,910
what happened to me when I first came

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,039
here I knew no one so I thought well

00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,690
I'll start a group so hopefully lots

00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,820
that I've helped lots of other people do

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:37,530
what I wanted we have lots of interstate

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,900
and overseas guess Gold Coast is a

00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:41,700
holiday destination and a lot of people

00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,589
come to the Gold Coast and they there

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,730
again they'll Google what's happening on

00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,680
the Gold Coast tech

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,110
so this lady on the right here Brenda

00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,610
she's from the boomtown accelerator in

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,170
Atlanta and she just showed up the one

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,570
day me and my son were doing video

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:56,070
and she just showed up and said I just

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,140
found you one the way of body doing and

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,150
we had a made a nice little connection

00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,670
with those people now we have a lot of

00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,220
people from the US who are from various

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:09,930
different places who just find us and

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,490
drop in and we do lots and lots of Show

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,250
and Tell people showing off their

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:17,100
projects on a Wednesday night and we

00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,840
help each other but one of the things we

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,460
don't do is we don't do people's

00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,900
projects for them so we have lots of

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,730
people that come to us they've stopped

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,740
coming recently because I think we've

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,990
started to get quite confident in the

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,720
way we talk to them but lots of people

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,820
came to us without trying to do any of

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,920
their project at all wanting us to build

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,590
their project for them so we've had a

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,390
massive pushback on that now and we've

00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:41,730
taught everyone it's ok to say no to

00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:44,160
people and how to actually challenge

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:46,770
those people and this is a big recurring

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,660
theme for me is challenging people when

00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,860
people come with a project they don't

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,300
know how to start give them a little

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,380
challenge something they have to start

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,690
something they have to come with

00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,940
something even if I sell bond a kit or

00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,180
give them some electronics and they go

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,800
away and they come back the next week

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,420
I'm happy with that even if they come

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,360
back with only 1% of it done in the next

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,980
week they've done more than zero so I

00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,050
really try and challenge people and

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,760
we've kind of taught everyone who's a

00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,130
regular member of our place now to do

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,050
that with people to not give people an

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,730
easy ride and just say I want you to do

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,040
my stuff and I'm going to watch you so

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,170
there's no spectators and we have plenty

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,060
of copies we have very random droppings

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,560
I've lost count of the amount of people

00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,150
that have liked for petrol motion

00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,910
machine ideas I don't know if you have

00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:32,040
those in your places I've quickly caught

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,440
on to the whole perpetual motion thing

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,420
with a few key questions and generally

00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,860
we don't see those people again but we

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,710
have a fair share of those people on the

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,630
coast I have to say and we just have to

00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,790
recognize those people and not let them

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,260
waste their time too much so that's the

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:47,760
open lights Wednesday night if you are

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,500
on Gold Coast on a Wednesday night and

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,360
you want to go somewhere it's a really

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,930
nice welcoming group we're in my Jaguar

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,550
in the old post office the other thing

00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,890
that's been really really successful for

00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,910
us a tech space is this idea of the

00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,570
online/offline

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:05,550
and when we first died a tech space my

00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,720
big passion was I and after

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,040
seeing what was happening a linen scone

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,959
for money I said everyone needs to be

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,149
face to face we all need to get face to

00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,370
face with each other online too much and

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:17,610
then I was partially right but actually

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:19,080
quite wrong I think the online theme

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,459
which has come back in the last few

00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,560
years with us it's been extremely

00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,510
important for us where our open night

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,620
but if you just rely on just one night a

00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:30,570
week you lose you lose the momentum so

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,519
we have everyone in tech spaces on slack

00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,110
and I know slack is maybe an ugly word

00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,149
and open source confidence but it is

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,820
very accessible for everyone so everyone

00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:40,680
who comes to tech space gets to jump on

00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,260
slack even if they're not a member we

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,240
give them a login and we have about 300

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,040
or so people on the slack there so like

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,440
stops I mentioned it to you Steve you

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,860
can jump on and find locals you don't

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,870
have to be coming on the Wednesday night

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,820
and we capture people that come to tech

00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,470
space via this thing called the chicken

00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,550
will the check-in it's actually a

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,019
checking device but someone

00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,600
mispronounced a chicken in the one day

00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:05,970
so we call it chicken and members all

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,040
Tager an NFC card on here and they get

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,050
to they can open the door outside but

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,339
they can also check in and say how long

00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,620
they're going to be at the space and

00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:15,120
members can see how long people are

00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,430
going to be here so they can find

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,250
friends but also guests that come to the

00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,779
space get to tag onto here too they can

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,910
either type in their email address or

00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:26,010
what's really nice is go cards work on

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,050
the same frequency as our NFC cards so

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,670
they can tap that go card and then that

00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,740
becomes their little identifier in

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,079
future they ever become a member the go

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,760
kart can't open the door so the check-in

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,529
links them into slack and then they get

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,130
a login into slack so then we kind of

00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:43,440
complete the circle I guess and we do

00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,089
have a few people who are remote members

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,190
some people have come from the US and

00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:48,690
they want to carry on as kind of virtual

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,820
members and they hang around their slack

00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:52,980
so we've got one guys quite active who's

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,510
in San Francisco Bay Area and he pops up

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,670
all and then occasionally he visa

00:12:54,510 --> 00:13:00,510
straight visits Australia because he's

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:02,490
Australian and he will pop up in real

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:06,180
life maybe once a year but otherwise

00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:08,190
he's on slack and if you are running a

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:10,110
hack spice and you want to do slack and

00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,060
use some of these things I would highly

00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,550
recommend have a look on connecting up

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,350
calm die you this is the Australian

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:19,050
version of TechSoup if you're familiar

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:21,420
with it so it's a way of nonprofits

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,750
to get free stuff and you can get free

00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,709
unlimited slack if you're a non-profit

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,660
along with a whole lot of other things

00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:30,510
some of its not so useful but the slack

00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,580
has been really good for us so it's like

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,260
we have a lot of integrations in slack

00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:36,180
we have it integrated to all the devices

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,940
and things we have around our space so

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,040
when the door opens we get to know who

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,560
who's at the space and how long they

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,810
going to be there we your membership

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:48,899
registrate renewals are all done through

00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:51,000
slack have lots of bots built into slack

00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,500
which is been good so that online

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,130
offline being I think has been quite

00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:57,600
magical for us all I have to say on that

00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,769
so yeah it's someone just post I just

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,060
went on the slack this morning and

00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:05,040
someone had been a yesterday where were

00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:07,220
laser cutting flowers out of some

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,660
material I'm not sure what that is

00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,920
anyway the other thing that worked

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,050
really well for us is something called

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,490
hacker grant so this kind of came about

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,959
by accident we've got given a whole lot

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:19,380
of money from Queensland government to

00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:20,970
run events and we it was supposed to be

00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,260
for buying food and things like that

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,420
every week for our meetups but you can

00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,640
only eat so much pizza and we had so

00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:28,170
much pizza and we were going to actually

00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,209
get to the end of year and not spend the

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,770
money and have to get the government was

00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:33,870
saying please please spend the money we

00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,880
don't want you to give it us back so we

00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:38,190
formed this thing called hack grant and

00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:40,220
hack grant basically we were using our

00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:42,540
spare money that we had left over a

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,589
recurring problem at a space was people

00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,000
would come along with really great ideas

00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:46,170
and I would say well why aren't you

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,060
building in there's like well I don't

00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,980
have the money and so what we did was we

00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,149
took away that excuse it was quite

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,790
interesting we need to acquire that

00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:55,560
excuse people would do it then or not so

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,270
we gave them there to pitch their

00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,470
project that's a rider little pitch of

00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:01,470
anywhere between a hundred and two

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:03,300
thousand bucks and they receive half the

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,610
money at the start and then build the

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,070
project and they have to give us a

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,449
status report on the slack and I

00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,890
encourage them they use a little project

00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:13,260
management tool even if it's just a

00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:16,019
little Trello and the idea is they help

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,329
each other and then the end of the six

00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:19,589
weeks we did a demo day and one of the

00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:21,720
really really important things that I

00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:23,610
loved about hacker grant is they have to

00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,920
write a report the blog post or do a

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,329
video on it some sort of content

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,279
otherwise they don't get the rest of the

00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:31,170
money so this is forced people to

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,970
actually write up their project and this

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,740
was as some people actually would

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,949
we'll go the 50% not to write the

00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:40,259
projector people are so unhappy about

00:15:37,949 --> 00:15:42,600
having to write documentation but the

00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:44,009
people that did write them up they got a

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,509
lot out of it they actually still on our

00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:49,379
website we still have things on a

00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:51,089
YouTube channel and I did one myself as

00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:53,670
well just to show that I could do it too

00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:56,129
so I sort of mucked in there too so yeah

00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,810
no content no cache and we yeah we did

00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:59,670
have some people that didn't take the

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,259
rest of the money we did two hacker

00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:02,639
grants we want to do more of these but

00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,680
we just kind of ran out of a mint and we

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,939
will do it at some point first I didn't

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,290
have a theme the second we actually got

00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:09,870
a bit of sponsorship from my friend at

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,879
Zurich and we did a like a workplace

00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,709
where on this theme so you see over here

00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:16,050
that's young James is actually volunteer

00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:18,629
here in the next room this he was

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:21,509
showing off his gaming workstation he

00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:24,930
did for workplaces to be able to relieve

00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:27,689
stress break times and this is actually

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:32,699
a hydroponic system for growing salad in

00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:34,050
a in a work cafe a cafe area I could do

00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:36,930
strawberries and lettuce and things like

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,490
that and we did a big event the demo day

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,980
this was a really fun one I was actually

00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:42,629
on my 42nd birthday and it was on my

00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,360
birthday's 25th of May which is also

00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:47,579
geek Pride Day and also towel day if you

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,649
know towel day and so they did me a cake

00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:51,839
with the whole don't panic hitchhikers

00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:53,610
guide 42 thing on so there was lots of

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,860
sin things came together on that night

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,420
but we had a lot of fun with that so how

00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,519
could grant I'm gonna try and get that

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,930
going again but that was it was just

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,939
fortuitous we had this little block of

00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:04,890
money from the government which allowed

00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:06,150
us to do this but it actually really got

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:10,400
a lot of people completing their

00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:13,049
projects hello for time Orion 22 cool

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,730
this is nothing we do on Saturdays now

00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:16,770
this is kind of I guess cut back a

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,510
little bit it was a big thing when we

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,520
first started but we still keep it going

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:24,539
every two weeks we do this thing called

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:27,059
kid hack and this is for all sorts of

00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:29,340
ages of kids and it's the guys still

00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:31,320
here from the last hook-nosed know so

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,700
you're saying I think 14 for soldering

00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,520
you were saying well we've actually had

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,200
we do quite a lot younger than that for

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,559
soldering and I know I've heard our

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,570
instant similar things and we do quite a

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,310
bit of soldering and electronics with

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,500
the kids

00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:49,920
and there's a current different levels

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,270
of people that come along I guess the

00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,090
kids that really don't know what they

00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,710
want to do we have a lot of donated

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,900
equipment that's given to us we have a

00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,640
boneyard and we just get them to tear it

00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,160
apart and have a lot of printers

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,870
printers are always coming in and we

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,790
have an e weigh station just down the

00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:07,860
road from us but before we put it in a

00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,960
way so we get the kids to just go wild

00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,400
and pull things apart and one of the

00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,930
things I've been encouraging them to do

00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,370
is try and salvage something from

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,240
everything they pull apart and put it

00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,980
back together

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,240
into something so their common one when

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,910
printers is usually we get a stepper

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,380
motor and some LEDs very simple solve

00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,300
them together they can spin the sold

00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,920
stepper motor and they can see the LEDs

00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,600
light up that's something that can

00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,370
easily do in you know an hour or two

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,380
they can take something home I know it

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:34,440
looks kind of stupid but they've they've

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,700
achieved something some of the kids who

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,890
are newbies are we getting them to build

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,480
things before the finish you're talking

00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:43,110
about Salvage this is one of the early

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,790
salvage projects this is a bottom half

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,530
of one of these spider BOTS and we put

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,230
one of our doing our kits on the top and

00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,060
it's this is like four years old and I

00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:54,090
just found it the other day and it

00:18:51,060 --> 00:19:07,740
actually still works shouldn't do demos

00:18:54,090 --> 00:19:10,050
but I think it still works okay it's not

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,840
gonna work there anyway did work when it

00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:14,790
put it on anyway doesn't mean anything

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,040
it's got a little again you want it's

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,950
got a motion detector in here anyway

00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:27,290
that was one of a random project from

00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:29,640
bits we got from the junk shop yeah so

00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:33,120
yes we the other thing we get them to do

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,950
is build kits and for the the newer kids

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,650
we can kind of give them good kids

00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,720
they've got good instructions so we've

00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,150
done quite a lot of the evil mad science

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,490
kits this is a more complicated one a

00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,140
lot of soldering in this but some kids

00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,940
just love soldering so I give them a

00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,130
really big challenge it's really well

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,510
documented and everything's really well

00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,750
labeled you can only put all the parts

00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,460
in one way around so there's not really

00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,830
anything can do wrong there's actually a

00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,250
555 timer

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:03,260
Norman 555 timer is this is a 555 timer

00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,480
indiscreet electronic so it's all

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:08,240
individual transistors what's really

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,480
cool about this is you can probe that if

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,039
you really want to know how a 555 works

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,500
you can probe that with a multimeter at

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:19,159
all the different sections and this

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,990
one's all to and it also I'm gonna see

00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:23,269
if the demo gods also just still work

00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:27,289
okay it's good at altar and you can make

00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:29,899
a your flash faster or slower but five

00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:32,330
five five s is literally 555 projects

00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:36,080
you can do with the 555 say that when

00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:37,940
you've had a few so that's a good one

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,350
and this is another kit we did which is

00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,019
really good this is one of John Roxas

00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:46,669
once this is the LED coop and put that

00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:49,610
on later if anyone wants to see it not

00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:51,590
sure what happened there okay this one I

00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,990
built one myself but this isn't the one

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,760
I bill this is one my son's friend

00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,980
Mitchell bill and he'd never sold it

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,169
before ever before he's on the autistic

00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,539
spectrum he's got a very high attention

00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:04,039
to detail a very good math student but

00:21:02,539 --> 00:21:05,990
it never touched a soldering iron before

00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:07,340
there's a lot of soaring in there if you

00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,110
want to look how much soldering is in

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,389
there and he did the whole thing in like

00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,639
an hour and a half and literally worked

00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:16,340
first time and I've never seen any

00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:17,510
laughing like that in my life before but

00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:19,309
if you wanna have a look at that is

00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,590
there's every single point there's lots

00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:23,990
of soldering this is RGB as well it's

00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,519
not just one color so yeah he's he's

00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,230
amazing he hasn't done an electronics

00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,179
now he has no interest in Medtronic seni

00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,559
more I still know the kid but he just

00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:32,690
came along one day and said I want to

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,950
solder and he just went crazy on there

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:40,760
so that was a good one but well

00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:43,669
documented that was good yep okay so my

00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:46,130
final flying hacker band kid hack yeah

00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:48,380
more intermediate kits that intermediate

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,760
kids they normally have a project

00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,200
they're stuck on a school and they want

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,450
some help and that's a bit more of a

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,190
deeper thing we also have these really

00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,289
really cheap Chinese kits that we got

00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:59,929
off eBay the costs like nothing they're

00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:02,059
like 50 cent kits or a dollar and they

00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:04,010
often like an electronic dice something

00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:05,240
like that often the instructions are

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:07,669
really bad you might have to go and

00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,559
research and look online but there's a

00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:12,000
really good challenge for people we also

00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,900
got donated a lot of old dick Smith's

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,309
you know where the old Dick Smith

00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,049
electronics kit some of them were in a

00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:17,790
bit of a bad state you might have to go

00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:19,350
and get some extra parts and work out

00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,510
had instructions work so quite a lot the

00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:24,480
kids have made those and then we have

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,950
bigger projects such as bigger builds

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,540
that kids are working on over a long

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,190
period of time and we have some

00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,410
long-term kids have been coming for many

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:33,059
many years who just keep coming back and

00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,270
some of those kids are now grown up into

00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:38,460
adults two of them are volunteers at

00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:41,429
this conference which is quite good so

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,840
James and John next door and so these

00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:44,400
kids are growing up and they're kind of

00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,650
sticking around which is quite nice to

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,210
see how they've developed one of the

00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:49,470
things I like to do with the kids I

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,900
haven't been gonna kid hack for a while

00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:54,360
but I talk a lot about safety Electrical

00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,950
Safety with them I had a really bad

00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,480
electrical shock when I was about six

00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,770
years old I should blow a big hole in my

00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,200
hand how you can show you the skin

00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:02,910
grafts if you want so I show that to the

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,309
kids but we do have a bit of a serious

00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:07,140
conversation about safety I don't take

00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:09,030
that lightly and things like soldering

00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,650
irons we do try and be safe with them

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:12,360
over the years we've only had some very

00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:15,150
very minor little burns and we have like

00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,500
safe first day kids everywhere and the

00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,900
other thing that kids get really stuck

00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,520
with is buying stuff so a lot of kids

00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,040
come they bought all this stuff on eBay

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,500
and they go I want to make a drone and

00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,730
it's like it doesn't work so we'll sit

00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,620
them down and show them how to purchase

00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:29,850
and research read data sheets and

00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,429
actually understand how to buy things

00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:33,809
and that's an important thing I think a

00:23:32,429 --> 00:23:35,820
lot of kids who their parents aren't

00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:37,410
taking technical they don't have to do

00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,650
that and they'll just randomly buy stuff

00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:44,220
oh you know my slides I'm going to

00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:46,590
finish on a lock of missiny no I'm

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,510
I kept it short so this is a challenge

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,040
so too much challenging before this is a

00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,140
challenge that I really like that I've

00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,299
used quite a bit and actually is this

00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,250
with all my employees as well my I have

00:23:54,299 --> 00:24:00,030
an intern program I run with the Gold

00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:01,590
Coast TAFE and I like to set them and

00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:04,410
challenge to see how they approach that

00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:05,850
challenge and this is called the MQTT

00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,590
challenge and I've given you the link

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:09,030
there you can borrow it I haven't put

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,390
any license on it but just steal it if

00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:14,429
you want to and I get them to write and

00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:17,660
mqtt client it's anyone here not

00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:19,919
familiar with anyone familiar with MQTT

00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:22,320
yeah it's kind of probably a half-off

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,540
I'm guessing so MQTT is a really cool

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,470
lightweight networking protocol used a

00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,610
lot in IOT

00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:31,710
and it's Message Queuing actually worked

00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:34,100
on the original mq in the early 90s for

00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,270
IBM it was the first ever MQ project so

00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,630
mqtt has a little bit of a place in my

00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,580
heart

00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:40,830
so I'll get them to write it in five

00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,990
languages a client and I insist they do

00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:45,390
it on Linux they don't have a Linux

00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:47,760
machine I'll give them an old laptop and

00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:49,860
say install Linux with no instructions

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,240
and they have to go and do that and they

00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,100
can choose whatever destroy whatever

00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,830
they want and that's quite entertaining

00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,600
to watch them do it for date but what is

00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:59,100
important for me it's how they approach

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,429
the problem do they come back and ask

00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:04,200
for help and how they go about it they I

00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:06,059
encourage them to use language version

00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,630
managers if they can just to get into

00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:12,090
that good practice and yes so things

00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:16,500
like pi m and RB m from those sorts of

00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:17,909
things and they have to check in all our

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,169
code and together so if they don't know

00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:21,330
what git is they have to go and learn

00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:24,750
what git is and I have to share that to

00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:26,789
me and I get them to use either my mqtt

00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,380
broker or a broke on the internet or

00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,450
they can also install their own broker

00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,450
and then I give them a bit of a stretch

00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:34,890
goal they can build a GUI if they won't

00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:37,590
get them to experiment with the QoS and

00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:39,690
all sorts of things so the the challenge

00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,250
here is not really what the code quality

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,429
is like or anything like that actually I

00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,809
do look at the co quality but it's about

00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:47,669
how they approach the problem and it's

00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:49,169
also giving them an appreciation of open

00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:51,360
source libraries when they use different

00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:53,070
version different languages they will

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,530
often see very different styles where I

00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:57,780
open source libraries so it's to give

00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:00,030
them that mindset of there's not one way

00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,169
to write something and for some

00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:03,390
languages there might be two or three

00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:05,909
implementations of the MQTT library so

00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:09,179
it's about trying them all seeing which

00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:10,710
one's work best and building an

00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:11,700
implementation around it so that's I was

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,860
just going to end on that with the

00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,780
challenges and that's been a really good

00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:17,549
thing for me I've used it in the in the

00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,409
tech space but also in my own business

00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:21,809
so and when people come to me with

00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:23,100
nothing give them a challenge so I'll

00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:25,320
end on that if anyone will have a

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,720
question happy to try and answer your

00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:35,669
question or we can move on from there

00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:37,620
anyone have a question excuse me okay um

00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:38,730
so you mentioned right at the beginning

00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,190
about

00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:43,230
everyone gets a card mm-hmm from the

00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:45,450
beginning and that the card opens the

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,390
door yeah we don't give to our access to

00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:50,010
people until they've gone through a an

00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,960
induction and they have to be a member

00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:55,500
for a pain member for at least three

00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,410
months okay cool I just yeah just one

00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,780
you just our general Bab salutely not

00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:02,310
yeah that's the card is really just to

00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,600
get them in the system so it can contact

00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:06,140
them and then when they do get a door

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,590
access they've got one my taxes but yeah

00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:18,290
that would freak people out yeah and

00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:18,290
yeah someone right at the back

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,919
so Chris here has created a group of his

00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:34,370
own in melbourne called mesh melbourne

00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:36,010
eastern suburbs cool and he was

00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:37,880
wondering how you found the space

00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:39,590
because he's having trouble at the

00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,840
moment finding a good question that's

00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:44,900
really hard the space initially for us

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,850
we found a big industrial space and we

00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:49,010
ended up we had big vision for the place

00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,870
we actually go commercial rent

00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:53,750
we actually had money from Lina's comp

00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,980
soul in Australia red heart the council

00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,390
gave us money we've got money from

00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:58,880
Griffith University I think we had about

00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,710
five sponsors but we actually really

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,659
struggled to make rent in the first few

00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:04,850
months and it was actually way too big

00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:06,470
for us so over the years we've we

00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,870
actually moved to another commercial

00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:11,450
property after that and in my first

00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:13,940
slide but we can't get back to now

00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,559
you'll see I said I didn't really dwell

00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:18,110
on this but we were homeless for quite a

00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:20,179
few times and we really flipped and

00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:21,950
flopped around until we actually I'm

00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:23,990
threatening to apply as the council

00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,760
actually stepped in and said we don't

00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:27,950
want you to close we'll find you a

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,490
building and we got some space in the

00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,809
community center or a very cheap rent so

00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,250
if you have community centres or if you

00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:35,450
have the council I'll go out to your

00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:38,210
castle I don't know what your case was

00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:40,100
like personally I've made really good

00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,450
friends with a counselor she's not my

00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,549
counselor but we have a good

00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:45,440
relationship and he has really fought

00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:48,440
very hard for us and he I call him that

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,419
patron now even though it's not official

00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,340
because he's really recognised we were

00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:53,990
doing a very good thing so we are

00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,730
currently in a council building it's

00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,169
actually an old heritage building that

00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,850
they used to have a library in it and

00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:00,590
they were closing it down and the

00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,880
council saw a vacuum and they didn't

00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:04,520
want to just close the library and leave

00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,429
it empty so they've put us in there so

00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:10,640
yeah I encourage to reach out to your

00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:12,530
local government but in the early days

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,590
we paid quite a bit of money and we

00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:16,940
ended up quite out of pocket actually I

00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:18,770
put in several thousand dollars of my

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:21,860
own money it's quite hard to get going

00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:23,960
but yeah that's my best suggestion but

00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,400
also we use crowdfunding as well in the

00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,169
early days to pay for some of our

00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:31,159
equipment we did a crowdfunding campaign

00:29:27,169 --> 00:29:34,370
and lots of ways to get cash but these

00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:37,170
days make spaces so well-known and that

00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:40,000
you can create such good

00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:41,530
good things happening I think government

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,970
starting to notice that and if you can

00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,240
maybe form a partnership with the school

00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:47,320
or some sort of other educational

00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,240
establishment near you then that might

00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,400
be a good way to there's probably a

00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,230
million different ways to cut it I'll

00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,720
just end on one thing there is a hacks

00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,970
based association in Australia it's not

00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,440
formal formally set up yet but we've

00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,600
been trying to set it for some time and

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,450
all of the hack spaces and make spaces

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,820
in Australia on that group it's a slack

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,680
again and we all try to help each other

00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,780
and there's quite a lot of material on

00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,370
there on how to get a space so if you're

00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:15,460
interested we can add you to that group

00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:18,840
might be useful you can ask me

00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:18,840
afterwards yeah so

00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:30,560
hello again I am because you mentioned

00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:33,470
the kid focus do you have people in the

00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,750
space that have all the blue carts hey

00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:38,240
what kind of stuff yeah yeah the people

00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:40,040
on Saturdays have blue carts people who

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,570
come usually with their parents you

00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,040
don't need a blue card for that so we

00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,110
have a lot of people who used to come

00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,850
when we did the workshops in the early

00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,770
days the parents would always stay with

00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:50,270
them and then we realized there was this

00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:52,040
whole tried surfing thing which we had

00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:54,500
no idea about and we all went and got

00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,610
blue cards and yes we always have that

00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,530
yeah okay

00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:59,120
Yoshi's wondering cuz at our space we

00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:01,220
don't have that and so we always make

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,680
need the parents to be around I notice

00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:05,750
often like kids are contacting me

00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,250
outside and it's kind of like oh I'd

00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:09,440
love to come but like you know my

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:11,450
parents are they aware about you where

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,610
Adelaide odelay so I'm guessing there's

00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:16,400
a similar system down in South Australia

00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:28,370
yeah I think it's not it's not hard to

00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:30,500
get yeah in South Australia there is a

00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,330
working with children criminal check

00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:44,090
that can be done and it's free for

00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:46,220
volunteer organizations as well as is a

00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:48,110
pleasure don't need too much further

00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:49,820
than that because that's basically what

00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:52,070
we do in the fire service is just that

00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,630
check and that's enough if you're like a

00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:55,130
local community group usually they used

00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:57,710
to be a letter from like the secretary

00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,910
of the group that's what we do and then

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:01,160
there's a police check and it's like

00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:04,360
takes like a week and a half and you get

00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:21,710
I think he gets renewed every two years

00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:23,780
no no it's not it's nice yeah it's not I

00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:26,750
guess it's not a great brilliant system

00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:30,020
but it's a system they have right yeah

00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:31,550
yeah cool any other questions you can

00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:34,610
catch me anytime during the conference

00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:36,910
I'll probably be walking around it thank

00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,910
