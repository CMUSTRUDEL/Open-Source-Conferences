In 2011 I embarked on a project of creating a Makerspace on the Gold Coast.

At the time there was a massive lack of tech community in my new city and it was our original intention to create a "clubhouse" where fellow geeks could come together and form friendships and connections through hacking together. Simple hey?

What I didn't expect though was the massive outpouring of need for EDUCATION, from all ages and all levels. We were regularly mobbed by parents, teachers and even Universities begging for free help with their projects and even just wanting us to build it for them. All this while we were still finding our feet and battling with membership fees, making rent, committee member churn  and all sorts of other local politics! Baby sitting and freeloading strained us to breaking point!

This talk is the story of our space, but also how we eventually reached  equilibrium. We can now sustainably help people learn in a way that helps them to help themselves and build good learning and collaboration habits. I'll share some of the techniques we have learnt the hard way and tips & tricks that you might also be able to use in your own world.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
