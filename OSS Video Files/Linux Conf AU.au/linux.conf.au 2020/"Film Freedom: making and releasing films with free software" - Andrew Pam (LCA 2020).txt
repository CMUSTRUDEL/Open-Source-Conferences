Film Freedom is a documentation and development project to make filmmaking with free-software and releasing via free culture funding models more accessible.  It currently includes the following development projects:

KitCAT: the Kit for Creative Arts Teamwork, is a virtual studio system and client which connects the TACTIC studio DAMS and Project Management suite to popular filmmaking and creative software packages.

Lib-Ray is a project to create an alternative to DVD and Blu-Ray for fixed-format releases, using only free-licensed software and open formats, without encryption or region-coding.

Lunatics! is an original animated science-fiction story about the first permanent settlers on the Moon. This is an independent, free-culture, open-movie production, made with open-source software, especially Blender. Regular updates and support are through Patreon.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
