Title: "The Art of the Linux Desktop" - Simon Lees (LCA 2020)
Publication date: 2020-01-14

Pretty much everything that has ever been designed is some form of balance between form and function, from modified car's to architecture to clothes and even user interfaces. In the modern age of material design, Visual Design Group's and Human Interface Guidelines this balance has very much shifted to be in favor of function over form, an interface that looks good is still important but looks always seem to play a distant second to usability. 

The purpose of this talk is to explore what happens when you flip that idea and rather then focusing on creating user interfaces that are primarily usable instead focus on creating user interfaces that are works of art with a lesser regard as to how easy they are to use.

Fortunately this idea is nothing new, in the late 90's Raster founded the enlightenment desktop inspired by the artistic user interfaces of the games he played growing up, he brought these concepts to the desktop.

The advancement of graphics hardware in the mid two thousands lead us to the world of fish tanks inside cubes, wobbly windows and painting fire on the screen. Not because there was any real need or use but because someone could. Sadly since then the world of the Linux desktop has tried to go all professional and many of the fun interesting things have been lost.

In the last year or so I have been working on reviving some of these old themes for Enlightenment with a hope to get people creative about UI development again for fun. As well as showing off some of the things above from the past this talk will discuss how you can go about managing changes in large numbers of themes for new versions through using version control and scripting to automatically change the color of icons etc.

Over the years I have done some theming for various different Linux desktops and I will also spend some time covering what is and isn't possible in various desktops.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:10,469
how's it going my name's Simon firstly

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,450
this is not a talk about openSUSE this

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:16,770
is just the only slide template that I

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,560
happen to have say quick about me

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:24,660
I'm from Adelaide I've been using Linux

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:27,840
since 2003 ish I've been contributing

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:30,269
for openSUSE for eight years I started

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,910
out packaging the Enlightenment desktop

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:36,350
and then somehow somewhere along the way

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,340
I ended up being a suzer employer but

00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,290
probably more relevant to this talk

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,090
here's one of the things that I've

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:48,020
always enjoyed and loved about Linux is

00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:51,510
being able to customize hack modify

00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,789
whatever I'm doing way back in my first

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,149
days of computing I remember was either

00:00:53,789 --> 00:01:02,219
Windows 95 or 98 where you could inject

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:04,589
HTML into your home folder and do cool

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,189
little things and that's where I started

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,090
and somewhere I found Linux and

00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:15,150
eventually discovered you can change

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:18,150
basically everything and that's what got

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,280
this talk started um I started playing

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,689
with themes probably 10 or so years ago

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:27,750
and from that I kind of led me to think

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:31,740
start thinking about often we make user

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:34,020
interfaces to be a functional user

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,630
interface but what if instead of trying

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,299
to make a functional user interface we

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,500
give the function of a user interface

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:45,630
far less importance and we try and make

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,689
a work of art an interactive work of art

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,200
instead and so I've been thinking about

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,579
that for years and that's what's kind of

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,470
spawned just talk and we'll probably get

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,450
back onto this form versus function

00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:01,710
thing throughout the talk as an ongoing

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:04,350
thread so I thought we'd start this talk

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,990
with some history we're going to start

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,080
in the 90s there was people doing

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,849
computer art before that it said graph

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,450
and in the 80s there was demo groups

00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:18,359
I was like this big then and someone

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,569
else can probably give a far better talk

00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:25,090
about that who was there at the time so

00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:29,980
we're gonna start in the 90s and in the

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:33,819
90s there was a guy called raster and he

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:36,489
was sick of the boring Linux user

00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:39,370
interfaces of CDE and whatever at the

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:42,189
time and he saw his games and his games

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,980
had pretty menus we have like leaves and

00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:47,950
stuff down the side and he thought why

00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:52,000
can't I have my desktop look as cool and

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:55,120
as pretty as some of the games say here

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,299
there's a couple of random game men used

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,730
to get from that area to get you excited

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:05,379
there is a it's surprisingly hard to

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:07,590
find game menu pictures on Google and so

00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:12,669
I didn't find many but here's a couple

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:14,470
it's a personal favorite of mine and so

00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:17,500
from that you can kind of get the

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:19,569
artistic element and him being a

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,949
software engineer he got about it and he

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:22,989
started doing it and he created the

00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:26,799
environment desktop and eventually

00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:29,229
around 2000 we were at enlightenment 16

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,620
now one of the great things about open

00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:35,079
source is it is still in it is still

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:39,699
possible to run enlightenment 16 on a

00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:41,260
modern rolling release laptop and so

00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:44,609
that's what we're going to do another

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:47,970
great thing is I found this archive of

00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:51,340
170 different enlightenment themes from

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,019
the very late 90s early 2000s and I

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,750
thought it would be fun to have a look

00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:58,000
at that now for anyone interested in the

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:02,019
technical details we're using Analects

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,799
x11 program called cipher it allows you

00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:10,750
to create a x11 window that you can run

00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:13,680
a desktop inside of your desktop and so

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:19,889
if I move the mouse to the right spot

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:23,020
here we have a 16 with one of the more

00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:24,600
basic something theme that I picked at

00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,020
some point

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,730
but if we come down to themes if it goes

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:35,370
all the way over there I can't read it

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:41,540
but that's okay there's a there is a lot

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:46,080
and I figured that this one kind of

00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:50,550
shows the shows the kind of vibe this is

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:55,920
probably will get we'll go back to them

00:04:50,550 --> 00:05:00,870
in a minute once I launch the menu over

00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:06,840
here I can read it there's like an about

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:09,900
window some settings and this is all the

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,860
kind of when you think about the

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:18,570
equivalent of the day was Windows 98 or

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:21,630
gnome and KDE one here we are doing a

00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:24,750
fair bit and I'm not sure how this will

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,120
go I have a I pre picked a list of nice

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,640
themes but I can't read most of them

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,150
from here so we might do some random

00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,150
ones as well

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,580
ether den was one on my list this I

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:56,030
guess was the default theme for a 13

00:05:45,580 --> 00:06:06,350
which came and it's this was a default

00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:08,990
theme and so as you can see people were

00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:10,880
able to take this the other hard thing

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,560
here is I don't have a mouse and to get

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,560
the right menu you need to middle click

00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,450
no I'm good

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,860
now this next one really is worth Joey

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:40,820
um can anyone see a beer stash e

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:46,550
somewhere over there now this if you

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:53,390
thought that one was great but this one

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:54,710
gets truly good weird no yeah well when

00:06:53,390 --> 00:07:03,560
you have a look at the men when you have

00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:06,380
a look at the mediation and this is

00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,620
getting on to the concept of this talk

00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:12,260
is why don't we just do things for fun

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,640
because we can do things for fun not

00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:28,310
because anyone would actually want to

00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:32,500
use this but it gets even better

00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,500
weird it has to show

00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:53,150
I think that says that whoa okay this is

00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:59,880
a OS X from the day style theme I

00:07:53,150 --> 00:08:03,980
believe all right let's live risky and

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,980
let's just pick something at random so

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,900
you set out to create a user interface

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,660
we or I talked it where you had the

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,700
freedom to go and make whatever you

00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,980
wanted and if you wanted to make crazy

00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:36,290
video game style your eyes that's what

00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:41,250
you could do and that is in 16 and if I

00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:42,660
do this right back here all right that

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:49,830
is the list of themes we were going to

00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:53,190
go through so I know arch openSUSE still

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:55,530
have 16 packages these slides have the

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,290
link to all those themes so go have some

00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:03,630
fun start it up and run up for yourself

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:06,600
and so after the 90s we come into the

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,730
2000s and in the 2000s there was a

00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,360
couple of things happening this theming

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,550
and skinny continued to grow some might

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,850
say in a more polished professional kind

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:22,050
of way but there are some cool things

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:24,660
and it was not just a Linux thing there

00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:28,860
was even crazier people using Windows XP

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:32,700
and Vista who did DLL injection in order

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:35,850
and about crazy screen skins one such

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,280
example is this one which i think is

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:44,940
actually a Windows XP theme believe it

00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:47,190
or not that got ported to Nome and I was

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,870
rather delighted when I was running this

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,690
talk the other day and found that

00:09:48,870 --> 00:10:03,680
someone has recently ported this theme

00:09:51,690 --> 00:10:03,680
- GDK 3 and XFC so for all year 2000

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:19,970
and so this is and you got some nice

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:23,800
menus and stuff like that and we come

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:26,090
back to the slides that is that theme

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,900
that is where you get it if you're only

00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:32,450
modern xfce you can try it it's good fun

00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,700
the other thing that happened is 3d

00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,050
graphics got better which meant we

00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,230
didn't just need to create needlessly

00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:41,720
stupid cow menus we could start to

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:44,870
create other needlessly stupid things

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,750
like 3d animations now I have been

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:50,570
tempting that desktop gods and the demo

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:56,980
gods a lot today but one thing I was not

00:10:50,570 --> 00:11:00,680
willing to do is to swap desktops mid

00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:04,400
talk and so soon as this to run comp is

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,290
still works on xfce but to do that you

00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,720
need 3d graphics which means the last

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:11,750
trick didn't work and say I'm gonna have

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,340
to run up a video for you which I forgot

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,340
to prepare sorry

00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:34,560
I've done I have done poorly there I'm

00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:42,690
sorry there is now a video running

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:53,730
behind that slide but I suspect that if

00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:55,649
I come down here and now I try here we

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,570
can watch your lovely video compares

00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,649
it's the same thing you notice there

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,010
with companies we don't get the last

00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:08,279
window borders but we started to get

00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:09,990
these cool pop-up things you could you

00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:12,209
could nicely move between different

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:16,440
desktops some of these features that

00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:18,899
comp is introduced are kind of useful I

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,580
used to use the desktop wall it worked

00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:30,380
great we'll get there

00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:32,040
here you go we have our wobbly windows

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:37,860
yeah that's next

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:40,680
there's your fish tank let us three

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,839
dienes and our there's that's a very

00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,700
functional Mouse old Tubber but I

00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,760
believe that in a second when I find the

00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:52,730
key binding in this video it might even

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,800
start - there we go now it's raining and

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,880
eventually when you've got too much rain

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:12,779
you might one the windscreen wiper to

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:18,690
turn on eventually and in a second you

00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:22,050
might even just start to snow and it's

00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:23,370
snowing all around the fish tank you

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:28,620
could actually put a snow dome inside

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:31,310
the tube as well but or we can be going

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,310
to hyperspace with the Stars

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,310
and

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,699
and now we're gonna scroll through not

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,220
sure how well you can read them but

00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:48,980
beyond the things I did there is this

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:53,180
whole list of cool things that if you're

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:56,180
a running mate or xfce and at least on

00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,160
openSUSE it works out of the box and I'm

00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,490
guessing other destroyers it probably

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,040
does too

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:04,180
so if you want some nostalgia you can

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,180
also go and play with that

00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:24,500
so that was companies in the 2000s

00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:29,740
I've lost my notes uh and so I thought

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:32,329
it would only be fair that in 2009 2010

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:36,560
one of my one of the earlier themes are

00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:38,949
modified was this one one of the

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,970
downsides of some of these old things is

00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:47,329
that wallpaper is like 1080 by something

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:49,160
and now we have nice big monitors and

00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:53,089
there's no way just to get these nice

00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:59,980
old papers but there that was a theme

00:14:53,089 --> 00:15:02,420
that I was working on around 2010 and

00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,360
we'll come back to there in a second but

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,819
then we get into the tins and in the

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,329
last ten years everything kind of got

00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:13,699
much more boring material design became

00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:16,310
the thing everything became flat which

00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:19,939
if you like me and you work by

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,589
recognizing visuals and shapes looking

00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:24,769
at 20 of the same color icon does not

00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:26,240
help you and say and the other thing

00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:28,480
that happened is tablets came around and

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,579
everyone tried to be a tablet desktop

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,380
even though no one does that now and so

00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:38,089
things got done back and scour back and

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:40,069
so one of the things I've missed in the

00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:42,079
last ten years is we're no longer making

00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:44,569
these crazy fun things for the sake of

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,180
making crazy fun things so we should do

00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:50,930
more of that again and so much so that

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,670
I'd like to proclaim that some people

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,530
say the year of the Lynx desktop is yet

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,210
come and we'll be sometime in the future

00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:59,000
I would like to make a bold prediction

00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:02,990
that the year of the Linux desktop was

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,760
actually around 2010 2011 when you could

00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:08,000
still do all these cool things in all

00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:11,750
the desktops as opposed to only some of

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,240
the smaller ones now but there was some

00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,640
stuck stuff that's been cool from an art

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,100
perspective in the last 10 years

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,430
Sarge and mine had a lot of great themes

00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:25,010
and that's become more mainstream if you

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:27,890
use a Samsung phone now there is a theme

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:29,270
store there is a ton of cool themes it's

00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:33,080
very hard to find many screenshots of

00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:37,880
them on Google but tried a couple that's

00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:41,240
a nice some form of artistic this one's

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:45,290
verging on the flat but it still has

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:48,620
some artistic merit and then you get

00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:53,090
some crazy ones like this way there is

00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:55,670
if you go through this Samsung store you

00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,660
can find some cool funky things but we

00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,150
haven't been doing as much of an in

00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:02,140
Linux and that is disappointing and that

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:07,720
is something I think should change so

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:11,570
next I want to take a bit of a segue and

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,670
one of the themes that comes through the

00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:16,630
ages is people like popular culture

00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:21,710
references in their themes in everything

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:26,050
I'm going to start this is not a new

00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:29,720
thing if we come back to our a 16

00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:32,740
there's a theme here it's hopefully even

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,740
over this side somewhere

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,720
I'm men in black Fame

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:44,140
[Laughter]

00:17:48,100 --> 00:18:01,300
there's a the Chloe's maybe it's very

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,470
hard to use this dogs but so popular

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:10,600
culture it's been happening since the

00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:17,170
2000s I must say that I too am guilty of

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:20,590
this now is where this talk starts to

00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:22,900
get into the realms of really risky for

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:29,770
demos let's see if I can change my

00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:37,660
desktop theme this is in London a 23 ish

00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:40,380
I still make themes for it once upon a

00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,380
time as a joke

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:48,030
well it has not changed the wallpaper

00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,840
I made this Hello Kitty thing of which I

00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,190
probably should have included the

00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:55,050
screenshot because it doesn't have the

00:18:50,190 --> 00:19:03,720
wallpaper she's poor planning on my

00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:05,130
behalf but it's nice and pink yeah we

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:11,180
don't want to use the same wallpaper you

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:11,180
know so another issue one might have

00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:17,190
asked me about this one again later but

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:21,600
another issue that one has when shipping

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:23,790
themes is licensing so to make this

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,860
theme in any way licensable and so

00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:29,180
people don't get grumpy with me it does

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,180
not include the Hello Kitty wallpaper

00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:40,470
but another example this is

00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:45,110
Enlightenment's terminal suppose you

00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:47,660
want to change its theme so you have a

00:19:45,110 --> 00:20:09,590
Pikachu

00:19:47,660 --> 00:20:11,030
I need to do something but yes fish is

00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:19,250
too good as a shell and it's time

00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:20,810
completing everything it's it's slightly

00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,270
breaking in a previous version the light

00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:24,800
when the bell rang the whole thing

00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:27,620
filled up with lightning but someone

00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:47,660
wanted an cut and so I believe that that

00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:53,840
is in here as well and of course if you

00:20:47,660 --> 00:21:00,110
want to highlight things now coming back

00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:02,600
to our slides something that we are not

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:06,880
running today oh there's the video those

00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,880
playing balloons slides let's get

00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,510
something that we are not running today

00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:14,120
of course that was deeply popular is

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:16,280
Hannah Montana Linux where we had a

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:24,050
whole Linux distro dedicated to popular

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:26,510
culture and so from here we are going to

00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:31,520
wind things back to the slightly more

00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:35,360
serious so you see a lot of cool desktop

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,520
setups and screenshots konkey is an

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,740
incredibly configurable system manager

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,380
we'll look at that in a minute if you

00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:45,560
want to have cool settings things konkey

00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:48,710
is your friend if you want to be lessons

00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,480
extreme in your daily artistic endeavors

00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:53,150
there is a wonderful program called

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,400
variety and you give it a couple of

00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:58,070
sources and it will download a wallpaper

00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,630
for you every five minutes and change

00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,549
your wallpaper every five or ten minutes

00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,739
say if you're like me and get

00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:05,239
or looking at the same thing every day

00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:09,559
it'll do that it works through most

00:22:05,239 --> 00:22:12,470
desktops that's worth checking out here

00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:14,269
is a screenshot of conky you can see it

00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:18,019
on the left over there that's a pretty

00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:20,539
default setup here is one of my old

00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:23,059
screenshots and you can see we've got

00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:28,429
conky over here providing those curly

00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:29,869
CPU memory and swap the xfce theme I

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:34,220
showed you before also has a conky phim

00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:35,899
it looks incredible but the download

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,179
mirrors this morning we're not liking me

00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:41,299
and I didn't get that image and so you

00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:44,239
might be asking well if I wanted to make

00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:50,029
my own seem that is probably going to be

00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:52,549
heaps of work but in reality in a lot of

00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:55,460
places you can just change a few are a

00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:57,259
few pictures and you can have a vastly

00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,659
different theme and you can learn as you

00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:02,359
go that's kind of what I did and so I

00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:04,429
thought I would inspire you all to go

00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:07,129
create some crazy themes because Linux

00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:08,690
needs more creative themes and so I

00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:13,700
thought I'd talk briefly about how one

00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:17,690
might do that on Qt and KDE it's a bit

00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:19,309
harder unless you know C++ one day I'm

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,440
going to use C++ there are two crazy

00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:24,409
style but basically you're limited to

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,019
two colors and changing having said that

00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:29,210
I've seen some reasonably cool KDE

00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:31,639
screenshots in the last few days so

00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,139
there are some base themes that you can

00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:38,779
mess with the colors and have something

00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:40,820
that'll look quite nice gzk and gnome is

00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:43,039
if you've done any web development

00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:49,309
that's quite simple it uses a series of

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:51,889
images and style sheets and it's not

00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:55,460
that hard to pick up then coming through

00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:56,659
to enlightenment as you saw we can do

00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,960
all sorts of crazy things with alignment

00:23:56,659 --> 00:24:04,730
that has downsides the biggest downside

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:07,940
for in one is that themes are tens of

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:10,369
thousands of lines of code which makes

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,470
approaching them and starting them very

00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:15,110
hard to do originally when I started

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,669
doing this talk I was

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,830
I started writing this talk to motivate

00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:22,070
me to finish a project I've been working

00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:24,649
on that makes it easier to create themes

00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:26,559
just by changing images because I needed

00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:29,149
some motivation to actually go and do it

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,860
unfortunately for me that just led to me

00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:33,230
getting sidetracked writing this talk

00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:36,260
and those themes haven't progressed very

00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,190
far yet but if you speak to me at the

00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,549
end of the conference they might have

00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:44,960
got further but there are still some

00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:52,899
things I can show you so let's come back

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:52,899
to the Settings panel say for example

00:24:52,929 --> 00:25:02,720
you are missing out on the full

00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:05,620
experience because live demos are

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,620
breaking the same selector

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,850
enlightenment is a great desktop when

00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:16,820
something is broken you can just reset

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:22,400
the whole thing if it crashes you just

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:33,800
reset it it will recover and say this is

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:57,350
theme number one this could be premature

00:25:33,800 --> 00:26:01,220
into my talk that's concerning I have

00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:02,780
now completely broken the laptop which

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,960
is unfortunate

00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:08,000
oh here we go you can't see it hang on

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,680
if I if I took if I turn around this

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,750
death see that white box there that

00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:17,960
white box there is telling me that in

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:20,510
Lonmin is crushed but but it gives me

00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,150
two options i can press f12 to log out i

00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:27,740
can press f1 to recover and generally

00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:29,540
pressing f1 to recover will actually do

00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:34,430
something useful don't know why that

00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:37,580
don't know why that we still have some

00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:43,820
slides they kind of there you just seen

00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:45,920
the next two so here we have the new

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:49,970
theme now the only difference between

00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:53,840
this theme yeah let's test the demo gods

00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:55,730
again well I just oh we might just leave

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,990
this theme I think I'll come back at the

00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,520
end but the only difference between this

00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:03,260
theme and the theme I show you at the

00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:08,960
end is like four images so here it's

00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:15,920
fire in this you can see this is the

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:18,410
other thing but if I do like if I play

00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:21,250
some magic and get thanks everyone under

00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,250
how that nyan cat theme

00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:31,490
so

00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:44,130
and London's file manager has its

00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:44,130
moments

00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:57,980
but if we come back over

00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:06,250
to here that is the wrong it's a nice

00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:09,040
blue that's the next so if we come back

00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:14,590
over here most of most of what you're

00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:17,020
seeing here is just these various images

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,880
that are the wrong ones and like a

00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:21,550
square with a bit of a gradient or a bit

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,940
of a grain with a book background most

00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:27,850
themes are pretty easy and simple and

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:29,200
I'm running very much out of time which

00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,580
matter means I made this talk to you

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:36,280
long so I'm gonna cover a couple of

00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:38,200
little things very quickly imagemagick

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,660
is an awesome program if you've never

00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,730
heard of it if you have a collection of

00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:44,890
blue icons that you would like to be

00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:47,110
read or a collection of green icons that

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,970
you would like to be blue you can use

00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:51,340
these scripts and you can

00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:53,590
programmatically change the whole thing

00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,840
so for someone like me who uses

00:28:53,590 --> 00:29:01,720
enlightenment steam that normally just

00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:06,100
has everything blue with scripts and you

00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:10,170
can change a lot and we're in the last

00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:12,430
minute we will try and get into that so

00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:18,370
making things play a nicely together I

00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:20,860
have found that if you use GDK and you

00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:23,620
tell KDE to use the GDK - theme which is

00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:25,060
listed there you will can generally do

00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:29,230
some weird things and have you all the

00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:32,230
applications looking roughly useable and

00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:34,360
we're gonna I've changed my mind we're

00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:38,140
going to finish with a collection of

00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:43,540
slide shots I found this is a theme that

00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:45,250
I'm going to port going forward this is

00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,440
the in London theme that really got me

00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,040
into enlightenment got me heading in

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,860
this direction

00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,150
it's called grunge it is also a theme

00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:54,280
I'm going to port for fun because I

00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:56,260
think it captures that artistic yes and

00:29:54,280 --> 00:30:00,550
now quickly coming through the last

00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:03,250
couple this screenshot is here for

00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:05,650
nostalgia I don't know if you can read

00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,760
in the about box but it has a myspace

00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:11,630
reference tool band

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,610
and so that's giving some and then we

00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:17,840
have a nice neon team here that

00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:24,550
someone's done there's a this is another

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:27,830
cool artistic there's a very blue ouch

00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:30,440
desktop if you like having lots of

00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:32,420
terminals you can make your terminals

00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:37,420
look pretty or you can make your

00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:43,010
terminals look even prettier and finally

00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:46,160
I think this theme is probably the one I

00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:47,330
found from the modern 2010 era where

00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:49,340
someone has actually gone and made

00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:51,530
something artistic and beautiful instead

00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:53,030
of plain and boring and we should do

00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:54,980
more of this and go create more themes

00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:57,650
if people are interested in more details

00:30:54,980 --> 00:31:00,260
on how to create themes let me know I

00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:02,120
can help you if enough of you are

00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:04,460
interested maybe we can have a mini

00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,850
confident and finally I know that says

00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:10,130
openSUSE but I'd like to thank Sousa

00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,240
because they sponsored my travel I'd

00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:13,370
like to thank you all for coming and

00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:15,820
that's it I don't know if we've got time

00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:15,820
