MARS is an external kernel module, forming the backbone of 1&1 Ionos geo-redundancy over long distances, and is in production for years on thousands of servers for millions of hosting customers and petabytes of data. It is also in production for background migration of mass data (hardware liefecycle and load balancing). This talk explains its fundamental working principles, and differences to DRBD. MARS wants to go kernel upstream in the next few years. There will be much room for Q&A.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
