This talk presents a short introduction to "Docs As Code" as an approach for developers to create and manage project documentation. The majority of the talk is dedicated to showing a small demonstration project that provides a practical overview of how Docs-As-Code can work.

At the end of the talk attendees will have some practical suggestions on how they might implement Docs-As-Code on their own projects.

Tools discussed include:
* Sphinx
* GitLab CI/CD Pipeline (and other GitLab features)
* Docker
* GNU Make
* Various text linting tools
* Pandoc
