When developing any kind of software your primary constraint is the interface offered by your operating system kernel. The interface is managed and abstracted by the run-time within which your program operates. This talks looks at how operating system and kernel design can affect the design of a language run-time, what features and components are necessary in a run-time to develop software, and how existing design choices in kernel, run-time, and language design affect the ability to write portable software and the future development of programming languages and kernels.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
