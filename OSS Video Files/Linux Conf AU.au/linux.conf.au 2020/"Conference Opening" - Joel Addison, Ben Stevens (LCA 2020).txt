00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,590
play didgeridoo continuously for a long

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,260

QT held hotel at Surfers Paradise and

00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:55,430
the reason that our professional and

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,840
speakers have go cards in their swag is

00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:01,910
so that they can get to these events

00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:03,800
easily we have got five stops on the

00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,990
tram to get there the light rail comes

00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,140
every seven minutes it will get you

00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,610
there easily and we will have our

00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:13,510
volunteers at the appropriate points to

00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,510
direct you through there

00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:20,990
the speaker's dinner is invitation-only

00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,850

00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,320
Tuesday of evening from 7:00 p.m.

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:28,130
and it'll be at the skyPoint observation

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:30,290
deck at the top of q1 so q1 for those

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,630
interested if you walk out side the

00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,340
Convention Center and look to the north

00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,040
you'll see a rather large building with

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,230
a very pointy spike on it it's quite

00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,550
tall and you've got a wonderful view of

00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,050
all of the Gold Coast and the

00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:47,600
surrounding areas all the way back into

00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:49,130
the Gold Coast into land so that is also

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,600
that is three stops north on the tram

00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:56,840
line and we will again have volunteers

00:20:50,600 --> 00:21:00,080
posted and finally the penguin dinner so

00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,760
an annual tradition at the conference is

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,310
our conference dinner no one as the

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,900
penguin dinner if you are wondering

00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,610
because there have been a few questions

00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:10,090
about of why the penguin well the

00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:13,760
penguin is the mascot for Linux our

00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:16,120
namesake so penguin dinner will be

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,280
actually in the room directly behind us

00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,320
so if we go out these doors and around

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,270
to the other end of the arena that whole

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,100

00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,650
accommodation and getting to the

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,810
conference itself with the tickets so

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,700
I'd like to thank Google again for

00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:40,040
helping to support us with that so

00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:43,250
please join in the charity raffle this

00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:46,460
year as we have put out already is going

00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:49,690
to go to the Red Cross and it's going to

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:49,690
assist their bushfire appeal

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,830
the fires that have been affecting

00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,230
Australia recently are devastating and

00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:04,140
while I have not been directly affected

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,700
it's been very hard breaking watching

00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:08,580
what's been happening around the rest of

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,770
the country we've actually had a number

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:12,450
of attendees and speakers pull out due

00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:15,690
to this due to being affected directly

00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:19,770
and we want to help them out as best we

00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:22,770
can so we will be sending all proceeds

00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:25,440

respond to that reasonably quickly you

00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,950
can also visit the registration desk

00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:25,240
registration is open all week from 8

00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:26,920
a.m. or you can find a volunteer with

00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,800
the hand on the back of their shirt the

00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:32,920
hand logo and they should be able to

00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:35,530
direct you to where you need to go for

00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,830
first aid speak to a volunteer and we

00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:42,270
will contact the conference venue all of

00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:44,850
the security staff are first responders

00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:53,500
if it is a life-threatening emergency

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:54,760
please call triple zero looking out at

00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,710
the audience at the moment I can see a

00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,570
number of you on your favorite social

00:26:56,710 --> 00:27:00,520
media websites so this is probably

00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:02,770
completely useless information to you

00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,650
but I know that there will be able

00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:07,390
plenty of people tweeting about us and

00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:13,300
so on so if you don't really know our

00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:14,740
hashtag for the week is LCA 2020 if you

00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,540
are including other people in your

00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:19,300
photos please make sure that you do have

00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:21,130
permission to use that photo because

00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,540
some people will not like you taking

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:26,220
photos of them and then posting them

00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,220
publicly so please keep that in mind

00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:34,870
so one of the things we often do here is

00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:37,659
sort of get a level of interests or

00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:40,870
gauge how many people have been to these

00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:42,610
events before so I want to see who here

00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:45,120
is coming to the conference for their

00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,120
first time

00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:56,929
a huge welcome to all of you it's going

00:27:54,769 --> 00:28:00,139
to be a fun week we hope you enjoy all

00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:01,999
the schedule as you all saw there are a

00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:04,190
lot of people who are not here for their

00:28:01,999 --> 00:28:06,529
first time so if you have any questions

00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:09,049
please go and find one of them and

00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:11,029
pester them and say what should I learn

00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:12,849
about what can you tell me about the

00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:17,869
conference and they will be very happy

00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:19,249
to share that knowledge with you one of

00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:22,009
the things that's been said a number of

00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:25,070
times that LCA is this thing called the

00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:27,499
PAC manual you'll see people in groups

00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:29,659
around at in the hallway track at

00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:33,349
morning tea and so on if you're standing

00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:36,349
in a circle just leave a gap like a Pac

00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:38,330
Man someone else can then come and join

00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:39,950
you in that circle and they can then

00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,460
learn more about what you're talking

00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,649
about

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:50,779
learnt and more about the conference and

00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:51,710
so on morning tea will be served at ten

00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:55,999
past 10:00

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:57,619
I believe it no yes it is on the

00:28:55,999 --> 00:29:00,979
conference schedule I believe it's ten

00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:03,220
past ten I pull request welcome for that

00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:03,220
information

00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,960
so you still have about half an hour to

00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:09,600
wander the venue explore the grounds

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,200
soak up the Sun with sunscreen on

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:17,970
ideally and registration will still be

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:20,660
open so thank you very much please enjoy

00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,660
