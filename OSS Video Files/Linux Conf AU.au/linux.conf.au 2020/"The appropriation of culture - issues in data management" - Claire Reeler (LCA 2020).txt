The technical challenges attendant on managing data in the GLAM sector are interesting and recent developments in open source software amenable to meeting these challenges are opening up new vistas of possibility for those wishing to assist GLAM institutions (which UNESCO refers to as "memory institutions") in meeting these challenges. The sector itself has become interested in the possibilities of openness - both in the software and the data, and champion the F.A.I.R. principles, which can safeguard humanity's heritage for future generations. Whilst the technological possibilities provide heady visions of future science-fiction-like scenarios where people immerse themselves in wholistic experiences, drenching their senses in vivid augmented realities; there is a concomitant growing awareness of the ethical constraints which must be managed.  Terms such as data sovereignty, data colonialism, cultural appropriation etc. reflect recognised risks and awareness of the interplay between our technological solutions and potential concerns, particularly amongst the indigenous custodians of culture, can assist in cementing strong, long-term relationships between all parties as we walk together into this exciting future.
This presentation aims to provide an overview of ethical considerations for data management in the GLAM sector, with a view to promoting constructive debate on strategies for integrating ethics into technological solutions. Awareness of these issues can also assist each of us, as individuals, to deconstruct aspects of the potential for appropriation of our own lives and to question where humanity as a whole is heading. The heritage of humanity is a concern for all of us and we each contribute to our joint legacy in ways we might not yet realise. By working together we can promote a positive future for humanity as a whole.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

Hey welcome back to go glam generous and

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:10,220
open galleries libraries archives and

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,220
museums it's time for our next speaker

00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:17,039
so our next speaker is clear ruler clay

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,510
has a pretty amazing

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,609
background she did her PhD in

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,320
archaeology and was the first arts

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,570
doctorate at the University of Sydney to

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:33,030
have an online database accepted as an

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:34,140
appendix to her PhD thesis so that's

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,880
pretty cool

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,440
Clara's work with indigenous groups in

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,540
many parts of the world as well as with

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,040
museums and other organizations in the

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,489
glam sector and she now works at

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,800
catalyst IT Australia helping out with a

00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:49,140
range of different things

00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,850
apparently clays also secretary of the

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,800
Australasian chapter of the computer

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,579
applications and quantitative methods in

00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:02,300
archaeology so she's going to tell us

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:07,710
all about appropriation of culture and

00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:10,700
you know ethical glam tech stuff so

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,700
please make a walk

00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:30,210
there you can vote people who are the

00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:32,850
traditional owners of this area I'd also

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,250
like to say thanks to our net for

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:39,390
providing the Wi-Fi that we all enjoy at

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:41,550
the conference right so as he said I'm

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,180
going to be talking about issues and

00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:48,180
data management and focus a little bit

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,970
on some of the ethical issues that I

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,850
feel sometimes get forgotten in the glam

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,350
sector around the sort of stuff so I was

00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:00,740
quite pleased to find this picture that

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:03,240
says big data is watching you yeah it is

00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,310
okey dokey so when we think about issues

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,050
and cultural heritage data management we

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,830
used to thinking of like the stuff on

00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:14,670
the far left over there huge volumes of

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:17,130
data in archaeology we often have lidar

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,100
data 3d rendering all that kind of jazz

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:24,000
so quite large volumes of data to deal

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,640
with file formats everybody's got that

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,440
old piece of research that's in some

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,390
funky format that you're not really sure

00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,080
whether you can read anymore and what do

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,930
we do with it

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,880
or somebody's retiring and you discover

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:40,170
they've got all these three quarter inch

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:43,110
floppy disks with all the notes on it so

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:46,170
those are all very real issues as is the

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:48,989
continuing issue of storage but I want

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:52,860
to jump across to some of the stuff on

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:56,790
the right which is kind of comes out of

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:59,640
the increasing need to enhance visitor

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:03,530
engagement and online delivery of the

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,580
data and these are issues around those

00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,180
subjects there which we're going to look

00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:11,190
at in more detail and so I apologize to

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,390
any of you who do know very well the

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,130
definitions of what I'm going to cover

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,830
but I've discovered that surprising

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:21,209
people don't so I'm just going to cover

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:23,400
everything anyway I first wanted to

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,560
mention that there is actually a very

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,269
strong connection between the glam

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,760
sector and open source and that comes

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:34,049
right from the top with UNESCO who in

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:37,400
2015 were recommending strongly the use

00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:40,010
of open source software and X

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,620
encouraging people particularly software

00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,450
and hardware developers to extract data

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,299
and content from proprietary

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,239
technologies and instead go to open

00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:51,879
source and the reasons around that were

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,530
the ones you can see on the left that

00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:57,950
it's generally regarded as more secure

00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,409
and it's more future proof if you are in

00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:04,220
a proprietary system and the vendors

00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:06,109
decides to stop supporting it bang you

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,120
know you're kind of left floating with

00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:10,519
all your data in something that nobody

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,190
else knows anything about whereas at

00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,250
least with open source solutions you can

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:21,799
somebody else can pick it up and help

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:23,900
you out and a lot of this has led to the

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:27,530
glam detector I've put an example there

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:30,080
from the very popular website of the

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:32,510
Tate Modern gallery which receives

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,130
millions of visitors a year and their

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,160
actual physical visitor numbers have

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:38,750
also grown hugely as a result of their

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,900
admittedly very engaging website and

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:44,599
this is led glam organizations to look

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,370
at the software as the service kind of

00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:50,690
options and the use increasing use of

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:52,130
the cloud so one of the first things we

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:54,380
want to address is the idea of data

00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:56,840
sovereignty the definition is there it's

00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,169
basically making sure that data stays

00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,240
within national boundaries and that

00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:04,760
means that the servers holding the data

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,110
are actually physically located within

00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:11,120
those geographical boundaries and then

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,250
it's got a side issue of whether or not

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,440
the hosting company is under obligation

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,699
to handover that data to foreign

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,979
governments or not and under what

00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:21,409
circumstances and it all revolves around

00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:23,590
this court case that you may have heard

00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:27,199
of Microsoft versus the United States

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:29,120
it started in 2013 when the US

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,000
government issued a warrant for some

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,539
email which was on datas Microsoft

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,479
data's that were actually in Ireland and

00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:40,669
Microsoft said that their warrant didn't

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,729
cover the data because it was in Ireland

00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:46,430
and they took it to the district court

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:48,919
the district court judge ruled that a US

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:52,330
warrant has no territorial limitations

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:52,330
which is lovely

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,200
Microsoft appealed to the US Court of

00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,540
Appeals you overturned it and found for

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,780
Microsoft the US Department of Justice

00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:07,780
then appealed to the US Supreme Court

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:09,280
about this case there were similar

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,530
things happening in other areas at the

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,690
time as I say they they were also trying

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:17,200
to force Google to hand over some data

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:19,720
in 2017 this went on for years as this

00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,570
kind of stuff does and basically

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,330
everyone was stalling for time while

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:28,480
they managed to get this Act passed and

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,820
the lawyers just had such a fun time on

00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,590
that day they thought they were just so

00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,410
cool because they called it the

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,880
clarifying lawful overseas use of data

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:41,110
cloud Act

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:45,070
I mean how sweet is that which basically

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:48,700
says that it's the country under which

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:50,950
the company is or is you know the

00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,240
jurisdiction that the companies in that

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:56,050
matters doesn't matter where the

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,630
physical data is stored so a new warrant

00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,320
was then issued under that act and

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,870
Microsoft then complied with that

00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,720
warrant having had the situation

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:08,970
clarified now in this instance the whole

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:12,490
hoo-ha was about drug trafficking emails

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:15,940
but obviously as we all know sitting in

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,800
this room that could be anything okay if

00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,140
you're using Gmail it could be your

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,640
email it could be any of the data that

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:27,870
you store there so if you're using AWS

00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:31,840
yes the servers may be in Australia but

00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:33,490
AWS and the states may be lent on so

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,590
there are implications it's worth at

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:38,590
least knowing there's often not a lot we

00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:42,880
can do about it but it's least worth

00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:45,160
knowing the circumstances now I

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:50,710
personally prefer the term memory

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:52,210
organisations to glam institutions so

00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,170
what does this mean for our memory

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,180
organizations

00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:58,810
well there's increasing use of cloud

00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:01,830
hosting and software as a service if

00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:04,140
you're going to be storing that data

00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:06,910
with a

00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:09,240
hosting provider that is foreign-owned

00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:12,250
especially based in the u.s. be aware

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,590
what that actually means most the time

00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:18,250
it's fine but if the US government

00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,770
decides then you know they may have to

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:23,320
hand it over

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:25,300
also when we're working with researchers

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,910
yeah we often want to send some data

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,910
over to a subject matter expert in a

00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:33,010
different country that's then leaving

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,900
the jurisdiction of Australia and going

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,930
into a different jurisdiction be aware

00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,460
of that you may not have any control

00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,719
over what happens to that data once it

00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,750
goes you may trust that person

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,890
absolutely they are just doing their job

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,580
but it will be physically sitting

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:53,800
wherever and also implications for

00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:55,870
long-term data storage obviously they

00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,160
are people who will have perspectives on

00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,440
this and I just put some pictures up

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,880
there of them because while we're making

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,640
all these grand decisions about where is

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,340
during our data something I'm going to

00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,380
come to is the question of who are the

00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:14,110
stakeholders in this and who actually

00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:17,170
owns the data right then I came across

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:19,270
this concept of data colonialism now

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,970
we've all heard of colonialism we all

00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:25,180
know what that was around and generally

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:27,790
regarded as not one of history's finer

00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:31,270
moments and there's some arguments about

00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:34,600
whether it's ended at all data

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:37,270
colonialism takes that a step further so

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,910
there's a definition of colonialism at

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:43,030
the top there standard definition I love

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,160
that picture to me that picture you know

00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:47,260
you don't need to explain colonialism

00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,210
when you've got that picture Winston

00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,540
Churchill's

00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:59,400
memoirs of his trip to Africa right

00:09:52,540 --> 00:10:01,510
there okay so what's data colonialism

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,240
basically anyway where there's an

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:06,510
asymmetric power relationship and where

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:12,250
people are dispossessed of their data

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:14,260
hello social media right so the argument

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,640
that's been made in these papers and I

00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,590
strongly urge you to

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,340
read some of these papers on the subject

00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:23,680
if you have any interest in this area we

00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:27,640
are all in the process of actually being

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,970
colonized right now because companies

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:34,780
like Facebook and all the other big

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:37,210
social media platforms do whatever they

00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:43,120
like with our data and they don't always

00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:46,510
ask us as we know Facebook got into a

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,390
lot of trouble for doing experiments on

00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:52,870
people what happens if I put only

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,400
negative comments and things if I feed

00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,200
through only the negative stuff onto

00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,730
somebody's feed how does that impact

00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,390
their medical health they were running

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:03,640
all these sorts of experiments on the

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:04,930
average user because they argument is

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,820
when you sign that License Agreement

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:10,710
that's 12 pages long and who reads them

00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:13,240
anyway you agree that they can do that

00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:15,100
and of course we don't have to go into

00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,190
the whole saga of Cambridge analytics

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:22,570
and influencing elections and all that

00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:25,140
kind of jazz so in lots of ways a lot of

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:29,290
the stuff we do every single day

00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:31,090
think about that process this is why I

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:33,730
call it the appropriation of culture

00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:35,920
because our data is actually being

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:38,140
appropriated by these companies for

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,990
their own purposes and as we know

00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,150
companies are not people if you do a

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,910
psychological assessment of companies

00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:49,240
they generally come out as a psychotic

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:51,700
so these are not organizations that are

00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,680
going to make fluffy friendly decisions

00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,500
that are in your best interests no it's

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,570
all about the bottom line and what they

00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,360
can do with that and sometimes they seem

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,460
to run on a bit of a kind of power trip

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,060
hey we've got a list what can we do with

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:11,860
it so there's actually implications for

00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:14,980
all of us in this as part of the

00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:17,050
Facebook License Agreement you agree to

00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:21,250
share copyright of any images you upload

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,840
onto Facebook with Facebook so they then

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,830
have copyright of everything that's in

00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:29,180
there worth bearing in mind especially

00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:31,640
if you're working with cultural heritage

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:35,540
to data especially if you're dealing

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:40,070
with indigenous data a lot of the people

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:42,590
who have a relationship with those

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:44,240
images may not be thrilled that the

00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:48,590
copyright of that image is now sitting

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,110
with the US company location services we

00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:54,980
all know that you can now you know track

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:57,530
who's where I've actually had this

00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,330
conversation with my kids because we

00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:02,330
were using Google Maps to navigate at

00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:04,160
some point and my daughter asked me but

00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,650
mommy how do they know where the cars

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,940
are and I said no sweetheart they don't

00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:10,790
know where the cars are they tracking

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,100
the Android phones that's how they know

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,570
what the traffic's doing so now they

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:16,370
actually know that now when we're coming

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,110
up to an intersection and it's red on

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:23,420
the map they go look there's lots of

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:25,700
Android phones ahead basically our lives

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:28,070
are becoming more and more digital and

00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:31,160
there are huge ethical implications

00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:34,370
around that which we're only starting to

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,790
kind of think about in small ways they

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,110
need to be bigger discussions about this

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,080
because I'm an archeologist and because

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,730
I talk a lot about the spreading of

00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,740
humans across the world in exchange of

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,750
human genetic material between different

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,760
parts of the world and and how we're all

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,890
related and we're all anatomically

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,440
modern humans Eve always asking me who

00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:56,510
have you done your DNA analysis and

00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,610
found out who you're related to I would

00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:01,700
love to I think that stuff is brilliant

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:03,830
I think it's just fantastic I do not

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,350
trust any single one of those companies

00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:15,590
to look after their databases properly

00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:18,860
so no similarly digitally born works a

00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:20,570
whole new range as we heard a little bit

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,950
already this morning I'm here we're sure

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:25,340
we will hear some more a whole new range

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:27,620
of issues the UN is actually now talking

00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:30,980
about the need to preserve the carrier

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:33,560
as well as the data so there's a whole

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:37,460
range of stuff around that so basically

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:39,860
how can we avoid the impact of the

00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,980
appropriation of all most data on our

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,620
lives and

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,640
you know we don't want to get to that

00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,470
dystopian future that we've read about

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,610
in all those books where we don't

00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:53,220
control anything anymore there are

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,570
further implications for organizations

00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,010
particularly ones that deal with

00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,600
cultural heritage better particularly

00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:01,230
those that deal with indigenous cultural

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,420
heritage data we don't want to further

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:05,270
the process of colonialism many of the

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,070
indigenous people who have entrusted

00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:11,250
items of cultural heritage to our

00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,980
organizations have had very negative

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:17,550
experiences of colonialism we don't want

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:21,830
to continue that we want to show that we

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:24,810
respect the data that we hold and curate

00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:27,180
we also want to be respectful of the

00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,400
privacy of the visitors so whilst we

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,180
want to have that funky fantastic new

00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:35,190
website that's going to make our

00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:38,730
organization the hottest thing on the

00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:40,620
web this year we can do that while still

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,170
remaining respectful of the people who

00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,870
are visiting that site and we need to be

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:50,130
aware that yep colonialism is still

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:54,120
going on just in different forms so ask

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:58,200
questions you know where will the stuff

00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:01,650
be hosted where is my data actually

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:05,040
going when I do this particular project

00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:06,840
or when we do this thing and what could

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,540
possibly happen to it start thinking

00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,430
about worst-case scenarios you know you

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,290
don't want to discover that actually it

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,360
showed up in a cool case on the other

00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,660
side of the world when you didn't know

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,380
that it left the country and this is a

00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:24,210
quote from Ben Dekker I years back there

00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,030
is no cloud there is only someone else's

00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:29,550
computer and we need to be very aware of

00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:34,350
that when we're making plans to store

00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:39,000
our data and yeah when we're putting

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:40,700
stuff on social media platforms so let's

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:46,680
look at the question of ownership

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:49,350
because there's often an idea that sure

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,750
the original owners of the cultural

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,710
heritage stuff in museums or art

00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:55,110
galleries or

00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:57,810
the other institutions were the people

00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:01,080
who made it but now they've given it to

00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:02,690
us to curate and if we take a photo of

00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,770
that that's got nothing to do and then

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:10,440
really they might not think that okay

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:14,700
I've heard aboriginals people speak at

00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:17,820
conferences about experiencing a level

00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:20,220
of shock that actually almost physically

00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:23,430
incapacitated them when they walked into

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:27,360
a museum storage area and saw all of

00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:29,730
their people on the shelves okay there

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:33,080
are cultures for whom the objects are

00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:35,940
not separate from people the objects

00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:37,970
absorb the part of the personality of

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,740
the people they become people themselves

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,150
those objects in their view need to be

00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,940
treated with the same respect as we

00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:47,280
would treat a human being and so it's a

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,140
very visceral shock to them when they

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,050
see people just casually tossing stuff

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,150
in a bucket or you know throwing it out

00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,700
of a cardboard box or whatever

00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:57,900
similarly you can't just waltz up to an

00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,350
indigenous person take their photograph

00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:03,240
in many cultures that's not cool they

00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,610
feel the same way about the objects if

00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,470
they open their social media feed and

00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,360
see a picture of a necklace that

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,490
belonged to one of their grandparents

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,860
that can be a really shocking thing for

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,530
someone like that so those are issues

00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,300
that we need to be aware of they would

00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:22,830
see that they have a level of ownership

00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:25,190
in any of the data that is produced from

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:27,810
any of the cultural heritage information

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:30,450
there isn't the same sort of separation

00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:33,020
that we make so over here we have an

00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:36,120
Aboriginal elder telling the story

00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:41,880
related to the pigeon in this particular

00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,920
area of land that story is part of that

00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,300
land the rhythms of the story actually

00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,600
represent the landforms

00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:52,500
in that area if we record that story

00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:55,650
we're recording that land in their

00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,710
format that those people will still feel

00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:01,650
connected to and we need to show respect

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:03,750
for that as I've shown here just because

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,000
the fact we put it in an in a display

00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,920
case in a museum with

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,460
I'm saying what it is doesn't distance

00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,990
it from people necessarily which is

00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,880
great it's great that they still feel

00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,100
connected to those objects we need to

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,080
work with that and we need to find ways

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:21,840
that there can be a positive experience

00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,610
very only involved because there are

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,530
lots of ways that once we start working

00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:28,770
together we can actually get to a whole

00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:32,090
new place that we didn't realize with a

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:35,880
lot of advantages we didn't see before

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:39,540
and there's just some questions to think

00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:44,880
about who does own the data the person

00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:48,200
analyzing it the person whose heritage

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:52,880
it comes from the broader community the

00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:57,540
colonial organization or people that are

00:19:52,880 --> 00:20:01,230
holding onto it the youth who are going

00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:03,300
to need it in future generations the

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:07,350
organizations that are actually doing

00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:10,950
the day-to-day curation all the social

00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:13,170
media platforms on which it said maybe

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:17,310
there's a little bit of everybody in

00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:20,040
there very similar to this is the whole

00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:21,570
concept of access and dissemination so

00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,670
as I said if you casually take a photo

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:26,640
of a cultural heritage object and share

00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:28,710
it on social media that is actually a

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,690
process but might need some negotiation

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:34,770
particularly if it's suddenly sharing

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:37,770
copyright if it's going to end up in a

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:40,560
law court if it's going to end up being

00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:43,920
discussed by lawyers completely out of

00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:45,780
everybody's hands how are indigenous

00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,510
people going to actually interact with

00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,490
all that stuff that we put online over

00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,590
there we've got a young chap from Brazil

00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,360
who's come into a computer center to

00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:57,900
look up something that's of relevance to

00:20:54,360 --> 00:21:00,780
him we've got students we've got people

00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,750
in the community working on projects how

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:08,310
is that data going to be used who by and

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:10,680
in what circumstances and when we think

00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:13,230
about these ideas of ownership and

00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:17,100
access and dissemination of cultural

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:19,140
heritage data we want to be very sure

00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,590
that we manage security appropriately

00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,860
and

00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:25,020
when we're managing data security and

00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:27,360
issues around that we're thinking of

00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,960
this chap down here okay

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,150
the hacker who's trying to get to stuff

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,289
we forget about Mandy in accounting who

00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,870
might have the right to delete

00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:39,840
everything because that's part of her

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:42,419
job to clean up stuff and she's not a

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,130
hack as she has no evil intent she just

00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,620
sees a whole lot of files labeled my

00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:51,750
file number one two three and she goes

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:53,669
what the heck's that gone you know think

00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:55,049
about who has access to it under what

00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:58,470
circumstances so you can change it he

00:21:55,049 --> 00:22:02,700
can delete it he can get to who decides

00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:05,270
how it's stored and for how long and who

00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,620
needs to be part of that conversation

00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,960
perhaps you actually need to get the

00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,980
indigenous people in to actually start

00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,659
talking about these issues what would

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,490
they like to be involved in you might be

00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:20,850
surprised in some of the things they

00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,770
might like to be involved in and it's

00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:25,080
all about building up a relationship of

00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:28,649
trust because once you actually start

00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,899
working with people our fellow humans

00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:33,179
and you sit down and you demystify the

00:22:30,899 --> 00:22:35,250
whole process and you become humans just

00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:37,890
working together it becomes a lot easier

00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:41,730
to trust even if you've had several

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:45,600
hundred years of being shafted by people

00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:47,250
in government organizations you can

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,779
actually discover that there's just a

00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:52,710
human being sitting on the other side of

00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:55,220
the table and then those relationships

00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,870
of trust can actually lead to as I said

00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:03,779
whole new directions for projects and

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:06,720
places to go okay long term planning it

00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:09,390
is abundantly clear to anyone working in

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,880
the area that we are in a climate that

00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:14,370
is changing and that our long term

00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,760
planning needs to include provision for

00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:20,240
things like floods and bush fires and

00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,980
even something that we never plan for

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,330
coronal mass ejections major solar

00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,760
flares there was one that happened in

00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,289
the 19th century which if it happened

00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,780
today would take out absolutely all the

00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:32,260
electronics we have so just stop and

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:37,900
think about that for a moment

00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:40,360
I want to stay awake a very first

00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:43,210
problem there actually is water because

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,440
there is no supply of water to any of

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,340
our cities that doesn't rely on

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,830
electronics

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:52,900
so after that point society starts to

00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:56,530
break down really fast ok so we used to

00:23:52,900 --> 00:24:00,340
planning for disaster events we also

00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:02,500
need to plan for working with people

00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,860
over the long term so our long-term

00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,960
planning might need to include lots and

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,510
lots of discussion it might need to

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,430
include actually talking to indigenous

00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:14,050
people who have a relationship to the

00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,810
cultural heritage stuff that we look

00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:19,060
after and ask them about

00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,860
which bits of data they want to be

00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,240
involved with how they want the

00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,680
management of that data and the

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,730
dissemination of that data to be

00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,370
undertaken what they're happy with

00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:34,440
seeing how they want that to work for

00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:36,910
their community and start a dialogue

00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,310
they also want to often keep interacting

00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:42,340
with that material and that can be very

00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:43,990
powerful often we have stuff that sits

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,890
in shelves and nothing happens with for

00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,270
a long time and there might be

00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,240
communities that actually want to keep

00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:52,420
using that and keep it alive and that

00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,980
can be really easy way to foster these

00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,900
relationships there's a lot of people

00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:58,440
access to actually use that material on

00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,880
a regular basis

00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,290
and then I just quickly wanted to run

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,230
through a couple of things I found in a

00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:07,360
very interesting paper on the general

00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:09,370
public's expectations in this case it

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,890
was to do with museums but one of them

00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:15,280
was an art museum so it crosses over a

00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:18,280
range of institutions about leaving

00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:20,890
comments so this was comments in books

00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,260
visitors books and also online comments

00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:26,470
and it's really interesting because it

00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,760
shows a cross-section of society of the

00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:30,220
sorts of information that people are

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,620
prepared to share which is quite

00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:34,240
interesting in terms of how we look

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:39,100
after the privacy of the people visiting

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,270
our organisations so interestingly and a

00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,230
lot of people were willing to leave

00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,820
their name but

00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,870
really care about reading the name of

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:48,150
somebody who is leaving a comment for me

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,410
they're really interesting one is age

00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:53,080
because there you've got very high

00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:55,059
percentages both are people wanting to

00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,220
know the age of the person reading the

00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:59,320
comment and being willing to leave it

00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,660
themselves

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,160
and that leads into a whole discussion

00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,600
of how would you collect that

00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,540
information because there's a whole lot

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,429
of privacy stuff around collecting

00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,200
information around age it can be as

00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:13,210
simple as when you're leaving a comment

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,850
type in your age and if the person wants

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,679
to lie yay you know they want to say

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:21,010
they 12 they want to say they 64

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,720
whatever who cares it doesn't matter we

00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,400
can keep that separate from a user logon

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,160
area where we might actually need to

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:30,160
know more detail about them perhaps the

00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:31,960
actual year of their birth keep it to a

00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,600
minimum when we're trying to get this

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:37,840
information if we can store the minimum

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,630
amount of information if you want to

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,220
have it automatically generate the age

00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:44,890
just or the year you don't need to know

00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:47,799
the exact birthday it solves a whole lot

00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:51,669
of issues down the track if that when

00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:57,330
that data leaks out so interesting

00:26:51,669 --> 00:27:01,299
patterns there next how long should the

00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:05,980
comments be kept there's a high

00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:08,380
expectation of indefinitely okay that

00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:10,510
means that there's a lot of onus on us

00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:12,790
to actually look at storing this stuff

00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:16,179
if the public's expecting us to keep

00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:17,830
that stuff long term how long do you

00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:21,760
think they're actually kept is now

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:23,770
separated out between whether it's an

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,929
indigenous format or not so people

00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:27,270
expect that if you just leaving rough

00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:29,500
notes they're going to be checked out

00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,900
whereas if it's in digital if it's a

00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:37,419
digital comment they they really expect

00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:41,380
it to be kept and then what's done with

00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:44,860
those comments pretty much everyone is

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,990
okay well not everyone but a large

00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:51,040
number of people are okay with those

00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:52,510
comments being used on the website which

00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,890
is really interesting for those of us

00:27:52,510 --> 00:28:00,620
looking at websites for these

00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:03,440
organizations so as we can see that 29%

00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:07,970
say it's absolutely fine with no caveat

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:10,940
and another 59% if it's anonymized so

00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:12,950
that's massive on the other end of the

00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,470
scale the thing that everybody doesn't

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:24,110
want to happen it's printed on a mug and

00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:27,740
sell it in the shop and finally do you

00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:30,559
have notices around what is going to

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,710
happen to that comment overwhelmingly

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,149
yes okay people want to see if you're

00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,539
collecting comments what are those

00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:40,190
comments going to be used for and if

00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:41,659
there was a comment that if there was a

00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,130
notice telling you exactly what that

00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:45,080
comment is going to be useful would it

00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:51,169
put you off from actually making a

00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:52,669
comment answer is mostly known so it's

00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:55,960
all about collaboration it's all about

00:28:52,669 --> 00:29:01,159
working together we work with a lot of

00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:03,559
different bits of society we've got the

00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:06,500
organization's themselves the the memory

00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:09,440
organizations we've got the technology

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,169
experts that come in to help we've got

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,870
the indigenous people whose cultural

00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:17,539
material might be in that organization

00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:22,010
we've got the broader community that we

00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:24,529
want to engage with that information so

00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:28,750
this is what we need to consider what

00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:31,690
data do we actually need to collect

00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:34,250
where and how are we going to store it

00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:37,820
what sort of access do we need to allow

00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:41,110
and that may differ by the groups that

00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:43,730
we're dealing with and we need to know

00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:47,690
when they'll need access and what

00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:50,899
purposes and who do we actually need to

00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:54,730
consult with and this might be a broader

00:29:50,899 --> 00:29:54,730
range than we used to

00:29:55,389 --> 00:30:00,559
my watchword on that is like a lot of

00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,149
other things if you're going to do

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,730
consultation early and often

00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:07,399
okay the earlier you get people involved

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:08,570
the more transparent the process the

00:30:07,399 --> 00:30:10,340
more they

00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:12,440
believe that you're actually trying to

00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,970
do something real if you call them in

00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,070
and say we've got this entire project

00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:18,169
that we spent 20 million on and it's

00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:20,779
going to roll out next week and we just

00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:23,360
want your okay they're like why am I

00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:24,919
even here okay if you sit down and you

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,389
say hey we want to do something really

00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:28,880
great with this stuff and we know that

00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:31,519
you guys are connected to the stuff that

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,289
we've got here have you got any thoughts

00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:37,639
you've probably got them on board from

00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:39,250
the beginning be aware of what's

00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:42,799
happening with your own personal data

00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:45,889
okay this is not just a process that

00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,299
happens out there somewhere it happens

00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:48,889
to all of us all the time every time

00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:49,909
we're on that phone every time we're

00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,470
talking about what we're doing every

00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:53,299
time we're looking at social media every

00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,159
time we're sharing stuff every time

00:30:53,299 --> 00:31:00,139
we've got that little location thing on

00:30:55,159 --> 00:31:03,590
on our phone it's happening to you and

00:31:00,139 --> 00:31:06,110
yeah build these long-term relationships

00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:07,820
because the more you have that long-term

00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:11,450
relationship the more stuff you're going

00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:13,730
to be allowed to do as I've said there

00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:14,990
there are Aboriginal groups that I know

00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:16,580
of who working closely with

00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,710
archaeologists that they've worked with

00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,480
for a very long time that they are

00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:25,519
actually allowing those archaeologists

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:28,519
to take samples from the skeletal

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:33,169
material in their areas to run genetic

00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:35,330
studies on the ancestry of those groups

00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:40,070
which is something you would think would

00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:42,860
be entirely impossible given the very

00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:45,230
strong feelings about deceased persons

00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:46,669
in a lot of Aboriginal cultures and the

00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,519
very strong taboos against going

00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:51,080
anywhere near any of that material it's

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,490
just mind-boggling

00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,379
that they would actually get to the

00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,970
point where they trust someone enough to

00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:58,100
allow them that level of access to

00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:59,539
conduct that analysis and that's what

00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,820
can happen if you just sit down and talk

00:31:59,539 --> 00:32:04,460
and you actually get people on board and

00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:06,919
build those relationships so ask you

00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:09,320
might be surprised by the answers and

00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:11,960
then very quickly I just wanted to whip

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,610
through an example and to bring it into

00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,230
something in the real world it's easier

00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:17,170
to relate to this is a project that I

00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:19,990
worked on when I was in Bahrain

00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:24,070
and it was a nomination for a world

00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:27,100
heritage site and we built up a database

00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:31,450
that was very interactive for people to

00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:32,920
use had maps and timelines and linked a

00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,320
lot of the information that we were

00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,450
dealing with in the nomination so that

00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,000
it was then accessible for people to use

00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:42,040
and as a result people were able to

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,110
actually interact the locals who lived

00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,790
in those houses that were part of the

00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,990
world heritage like way to actually

00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,940
interact with their own history they

00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,230
were able to add to it and bring out hey

00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,690
I've got a picture of my grandfather who

00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:54,910
lived in this house let's add that and

00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:58,510
so we actually added the chap and his

00:32:54,910 --> 00:33:00,010
grandfather and actually start to give

00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,110
information and interact and that

00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,250
brought a feeling of ownership so the

00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:05,170
local people felt like they were

00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:10,710
actually part of that process that was

00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:12,790
going on and finally acknowledgments I

00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:15,600
really do believe that the traditional

00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:20,110
owners of the country have had enormous

00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,030
amount of patience and that we would do

00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:26,380
very well to start honoring their

00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:28,210
patients I'd like to thank catalyst for

00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:32,110
sponsoring me to be here

00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:34,330
and I try to use public domain pictures

00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:37,510
wherever possible and acknowledge we're

00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:39,550
not and then to my colleagues all of us

00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:45,690
are struggling to get to a more useful

00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:45,690
