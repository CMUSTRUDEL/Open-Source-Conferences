As an evangelist, community leader and consultant in the Internet of Things space, I have strong opinions about how IoT can improve our lives.   

Thirty years after its publication, Donald Norman's seminal book "The Design of Everyday Things", which examined how the tiny usability touches in everyday items matter so much, remains relevant and important. In fact, Don just last year wrote that the technology industry badly needs to re-focus on the true meaning of Human Centered Design, observing that despite his decades of advocacy, the same kinds of design flaws continually recur.

We are just a handful of years short of the centenary of the publication of Modern Architecture pioneer Le Corbusier's maxim "A house is a machine to live in", yet our architecture remains stubbornly steam powered.

My position is that we ought step back and critically reexamine the shape and detail of our workplaces and homes. The great labour saving devices of the 20th century freed us from much physical drudgery, but significant cognitive burden remains. I will examine, in the abstract and concrete, how much cognitive load is imposed on us by our environment. It has been written that a modern human makes 30,000 choices every day.

For example, why are our light switches placed for the convenience of builders, not inhabitants. Why do so many of our labour-saving appliances require us to spend so much time monitoring and pampering them. How often do you stumble about in the dark fumbling for a light switch. Wouldn't you prefer to discover the failed refrigerator or flooded storeroom before the contents are ruined?

Join me for an imagination of how Living In The Future could truly be better.

okay welcome everyone to our next talk

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:11,460
in the docs Minicon for today we've got

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:13,710
Christopher Biggs presenting the

00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,900
Internet of everyday things IOT in the

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:24,990
future of domesticity please make them

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:27,029
feel welcome thank you and thank you

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,720
very much for falling for my clickbait

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:33,570
title so the title that I advertised was

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,130
the awful design of everyday things and

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,829
that's what we're going to talk about is

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:41,190
how design and documentation and

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,960
software interact and this is the

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,480
documentation mini-com so I'm going to

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,710
present the first part of this

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,969
presentation trying to convince you that

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,480
you shouldn't need to write

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:53,460
documentation you have to write dokgo

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,000
anyway we'll look at how not to make it

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,789
a waste of time this is a quote that

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,070
went dirt ages viral back in the 20th

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,080
century when Douglas Adams used it in a

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,030
newspaper column and Douglas was

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,710
paraphrasing artists and technologists

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,380
bran Ferren when he wrote that

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,460
technology is stuff that doesn't work

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,619
yet and bran was making the point that

00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,770
when things just work we stop calling

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:23,130
them technology nobody calls chairs

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,840
technology despite the quite remarkable

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,360
amount of engineering expertise that

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,630
goes into them because they almost never

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,259
go rogue for no visible reason rather

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,799
unlike computers technology to propose

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,119
another definition is stuff that needs

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,060
documentation because it doesn't make

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,520
sense and a lot of the time that's

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,770
because of inadequate design so let's

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,140
look at how the awful design of everyday

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,890
things is one of the Wellsprings from

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,110
which our need for documentation flows

00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:58,320
can you believe it's 2020 we are now

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,090
past the years in which many of those

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,659
science fiction futures that we grew up

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,299
with were set Bladerunner that was last

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,640
year same for the running man same for

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,420
akhira remember snow crash the post

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,470
cyberpunk Bible that was five years ago

00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,620
we are living and I say

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:21,030
is often with unrestrained Glee in the

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:23,460
future but really what we're literally

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,560
living in by which I mean our homes and

00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,570
our workplaces is largely the same

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,530
funny-looking caves that we lived in a

00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,730
century ago

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:34,590
welcome to the Roaring Twenties again

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:38,370
take a look at this officing open-plan

00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:42,030
tall windows big flat desks so modern

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:45,900
that's 1919 here we are in the present

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,610
day it's barely different take a look at

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,370
this stainless steel marvel of modern

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:55,560
kitchen design not really all that

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:57,390
unlike this scene from 1915 we are just

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,850
a couple of years short of the centenary

00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,010
of the publication of modern

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:05,070
architecture pioneer le corbusier's

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:08,310
Maxim that a house as he put it is a

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,860
machine to live in in the last century

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,670
industry has moved from steam to silicon

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:17,180
household lighting from gas to LED

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:20,280
personal transport from horse-drawn

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:22,530
horse-drawn tram to the Tesla yet our

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,800
living machines our horseless carriages

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,840
at best it's now 30 years after the

00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,150
publication of Donald Norman's seminal

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,580
book the design of everyday things from

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,800
which I stole my title and this book

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,220
examined how the tiny usability touches

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,709
in everyday items matter so much it

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:42,750
remains relevant and important and Don

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,239
wrote in 2018 that the technology

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,420
industry badly needs to refocus on the

00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,980
true meaning of human centered design

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,590
observing that despite his decades of

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:56,790
@cthe advocacy the same kinds of design

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:59,010
flaws continually recur and this is a

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,510
book that as an IT student in the 90s I

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,840
was encouraged to track down and read

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:06,330
which I did and I reread the 2013

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,850
expanded edition when I was planning

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,799
this talk of year or so ago and dipping

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,480
into into it again last week made me

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,760
realize that I probably ought to read it

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,709
every year

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,810
Don spends most of the first chapter of

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,370
his book talking about the difficulty he

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,030
and his friends have had with opening

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:25,230
doors and the content of affordances

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,210
even without the sign we

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,010
understand from the shape and position

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,890
of the hand order this is a door that is

00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:34,740
supposed to be pulled not pushed here we

00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:37,200
are 30 years in the future still saying

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,680
apologetic signs on doors explaining how

00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,340
to use them this is the oven in my

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,920
office

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,500
it's a benchtop unit with two hot plates

00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:50,310
on top and a dual element oven it's got

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,970
four simple dials yet they compare pain

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,380
multitudes of fail here we see the

00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,350
function dial there's a symbol there

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,630
that donates the large hot plate on top

00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,000
only one of those two positions actually

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:05,640
activates the hot plate on top the other

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,950
one refers to the light above it which

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,510
lights up when the hot plate is on the

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,370
other symbols around the function dial

00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,810
are for various combinations of the

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,880
roasting grilling and rotisserie

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,600
functions of this oven don't ask me

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,100
which is which because I simply cannot

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,430
remember I have to keep the manual for

00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,500
this oven on the desk next to it every

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,340
time I want to cook something because I

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:31,410
just it does not make sense to me take a

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,970
look at that temperature dial you can

00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,940
can you tell what temperature it is

00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:38,070
indicating it does have a pointer it's

00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,770
very sleek and black on black and even

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,450
by feel it's hard to work out what

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,460
temperature you've set and I cooked by

00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,140
field sometimes when I'm using an oven I

00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,960
just twiddle the temperature gauge until

00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,820
I see that the thermostat light go out

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,860
and I know okay that's how hot it is

00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,300
right now but that light near the

00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:58,410
temperature dial that's not the

00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:00,630
thermostat it indicates that the right

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,000
hand hook blade is on the right hand hot

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,890
blade for some reason has its own dial

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,240
unlike the left hand one which it shares

00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:11,340
with the oven now there's a reason why

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,200
these controls probably made sense to

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,140
the designer but it's not going to be

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,600
obvious to the user even an experienced

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,000
chef and that's something we often

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,010
forget much of the time the user is

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,080
going to be meeting a product with more

00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:28,140
intelligence but far less familiarity

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,240
and context of the designers imagined

00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,100
for those of you who've blissfully

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,639
forgotten this is what televisions look

00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,379
like once upon a time

00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,479
and I think if you wield one of these

00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:40,060
down to the fabulous LC a childcare

00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:42,370
service and constituted and consulted a

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,349
reference six-year-old they would

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,689
understand how to adjust the volume and

00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:48,400
change the channels that is once we

00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:50,110
explained to them that a channel is kind

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,449
of a bit like a YouTube playlist with

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,310
the audio events stuck on and they got

00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:56,080
over the horror that there were only a

00:06:54,310 --> 00:07:00,270
handful of these channels to even choose

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,560
from and research with actual children

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,949
however indicates that this avocado

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,409
terror here is entirely inscrutable to

00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,330
modern children my youngest child is 12

00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:11,979
starting high school in a few weeks and

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,229
she just got her first iphone and handed

00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:16,000
down through a chain of siblings and she

00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:17,469
adores FaceTime and will spend hours

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,259
talking to her friends but you would

00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:23,020
have no idea what to do with this but

00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:24,849
grown-ups were the same - in the 1930s

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,800
it took a detailed campaign of

00:07:24,849 --> 00:07:29,620
advertisements demonstrations and user

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:34,439
guides to teach the first owners of dial

00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:36,789
telephones how to dial documentation

00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:39,009
here's a ten-year-old dishwasher from my

00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:41,139
kitchen it's practically identical to

00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:43,569
the 20 year old one that it replaced and

00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,159
if you want you can go to Miele today

00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:48,089
and buy a new model with exactly the

00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:51,009
same control arrangement do not want

00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:54,039
it's tiny little three digit display he

00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:56,919
dispenses gems like f11 which is short

00:07:54,039 --> 00:08:00,190
for fault number 11 which is short for

00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:01,779
the council has not maintained their

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,789
water mains and have instead turned down

00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:04,719
the pressure to stop leaks and there's

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:07,120
not enough pressure to run the

00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:09,990
dishwasher once again required the

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,990
manual to figure that out

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,000
here's another model in the range that

00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:18,060
has 20 hole characters or so of screen

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,979
that it can give a little bit more info

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,039
but when people say why would you want

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:25,779
an Internet dishwasher this is why

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:31,509
explain what's wrong message me when

00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:33,399
you're done message me when you run out

00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:34,570
of water pressure or give me records of

00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,890
the water pressure that I can take to

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,870
the council when I complain

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,719
remind me to clean the filters every so

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,699
often but I've worked in appliance

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,750
companies I know that every company has

00:08:42,699 --> 00:08:46,490
an engineer whose job it is

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,870
to work out how to save five cents by

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:53,149
taking one part out of that design I

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,920
want to tell them to stop it's not

00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:57,199
ethical you're harming people you're

00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,410
killing the planet by producing rubbish

00:08:57,199 --> 00:09:02,660
products that barely work if you really

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:06,170
want to see me cry ask about light

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:08,120
switches I know you have that one switch

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,560
in your house that you can't fathom I've

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,019
lived in the same house for twenty years

00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,819
and I still can't work out the three

00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,949
light switch is in front of my inside my

00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:20,240
front door so what do we do

00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:22,009
documentation sometimes documentation is

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,199
the wrong answer the underlying problem

00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:27,319
here is a failed to failure to practice

00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:29,629
human centered design this is

00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:31,310
electrician centered design it was

00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:33,259
cheaper to run the wiring for four

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,509
lights to one place than to do what

00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:36,310
would work best for the residents over

00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:39,379
the next century

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:42,110
once again Don Norman goes on a tear

00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:45,379
tear here too he talks about how over

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:48,199
75% of industrial accidents a rule too

00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:50,600
became an error he tells in the revised

00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:52,279
edition of his book about a fatal Air

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,610
Force jet crash that was ruled to be

00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:58,100
human error a second investigation found

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,439
that the first investigation had arrived

00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,649
at the verdict of human error because

00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:05,629
the pilot failed to pull out of a dive

00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:07,579
truth except that they slightly glossed

00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:09,889
over the fact that the reason the pilot

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:13,250
failed to pull out of the dive was due

00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:16,189
to being unconscious from hypoxia due to

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:17,899
the design of the helmet and that really

00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:20,240
makes me wonder what happened last week

00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:25,300
with the tragic airliner incident in

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,259
Iran was it really an solely human error

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:32,089
welcome back to light which is a bit

00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:33,500
after I calm down okay breathe it's

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,360
gonna be the future soon though

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,449
the things that make us weak and strange

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,610
can be engineered away I want you to go

00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:43,610
out of this talk and look at the world

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,379
with fresh eyes pay attention to the

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,170
frustrating interactions you have with

00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:51,050
technology and imagine a different

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:54,050
future and I think a lot about what kind

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:56,660
of future I want to live in on the Left

00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:59,380
we have Star Trek and this is not a Star

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:02,029
Trek set this is actually somebody

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,430
which says in the future whenever we

00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:06,500
wish to do anything we pokin a menu on a

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,020
screen or we come back command a

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,980
disembodied computer voice tea Earl Grey

00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,660
hot in the Star Trek future the computer

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,149
becomes an unavoidable presence in our

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:20,060
lives everything we do is mediated

00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:22,430
through it on the right we have a still

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,490
from the 1984 production of Frank

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:30,200
Herbert's June directed by David Lynch a

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:32,029
problematic book a widely ridiculed and

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,920
regarded as terrible movie

00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:35,930
nevertheless it is a spectacularly

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:42,589
beautiful film to look at and you can

00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:43,839
turn the sound down if you like I'm sure

00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:46,670
you've heard of the Internet of Things

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,770
it's on my business card it's on the

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:52,459
front of my building but the name I

00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:55,459
think faces the wrong way yes the things

00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:58,040
talk to the Internet but they exist to

00:11:55,459 --> 00:12:00,110
talk to us to carry us into the future

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,380
the Internet is just one of the

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:05,029
resources they use to do that so I'm

00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,440
going to do a quick search in a place on

00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,920
the rest of this talk and I'm going to

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,930
use the term human centered technology

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,360
so I give you my three laws of human

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,160
centered technology machines must

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,589
cooperate for the benefit of humans

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,050
machines must communicate and obey

00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:23,450
instructions machines must be as simple

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,279
and reliable as possible and if you

00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,709
squint they look a bit like Asimov's

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,510
laws of robotics and that's not really

00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:31,310
prepared found that's just me having

00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:33,589
some fun but as I'm oh I've got to

00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:36,200
retcon in a 0th law so I'm going to do

00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:38,480
that too machines must be beautiful or

00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,240
invisible and that's the difference

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,880
between the June future and the Star

00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,800
Trek future if we invite machines into

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,990
our living rooms our bedrooms and our

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:52,370
bathrooms they can't look like truck

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:54,680
parts 60 years ago we imagine flying

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:57,170
cars and robot cleaners and robot

00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,480
Butler's we didn't get that but we got a

00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:02,540
relationship with machines that is in

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,959
some ways even closer Rosie the Jetsons

00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:08,209
many mechanical housekeeper is here but

00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,020
she's the Roomba she's Alexa she's in

00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:10,880
your TV

00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,530
using your air conditioner we live

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,020
inside the machines now

00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,810
and when I say machines I mean computers

00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,430
and when I say computers I really mean

00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:22,010
the software that is eating the world

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,720
and when I say software I really mean

00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:27,110
the thought that goes into the software

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,670
which is to say design and when when

00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:34,160
ever design fails there is documentation

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:36,200
so let's look at what how we're doing

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,710
about upskilling the robots that we

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,060
inhabit now apparently we're taking the

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,770
only good piece of design in the

00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,800
traditional light switch it's tactile

00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:47,690
nature and replacing it with a smooth

00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,490
featureless plate that if you happen to

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,260
touch it in the right place probably by

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:55,040
mistake it might do something but you've

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,570
no idea what here's a better way leave

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,300
the lights which is where they are and

00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,160
add intelligence to the bulbs these ones

00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,310
can be still be controlled from the

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,530
original switch but also from household

00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:10,070
panels remote controls voice assistance

00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:12,680
from your smartphone but bulbs bulbs are

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:15,820
so last century in fact bulbs are so the

00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:18,800
century before that bulbs are a thing

00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,960
because of that need once upon a time to

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,630
protect filaments within a vacuum or a

00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,060
nitrogen atmosphere filaments that

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,460
aren't even there anymore because the

00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:31,190
light emitting diodes are awesome we

00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,530
cram them into bulbs with a heat where

00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,270
they heat up and fail because of

00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:37,850
obsolete constraints they're much

00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:39,970
happier spread out and much more

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,350
pleasant to live with that way too we

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,360
installed it strip lighting or as

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,270
replacements for fluorescent tubes and

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,240
we can do much more with them which can

00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:53,150
be complex which can lead to

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:55,280
documentation and other crimes here is

00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,960
the page of my phone for controlling my

00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,090
home appliances okay

00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,410
make that two pages because I bought

00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:02,330
some smart light bulbs and they were

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,600
great so I went back to the same store

00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:08,290
and I bought four more of the same brand

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,290
which use a different app

00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:14,759
the current state of our insulated out

00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,720
home robots is pretty much a full-on

00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:18,120
dumpster fire

00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,399
nothing can interoperate because

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,129
nothing's documented painstaking reverse

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,449
engineering has managed to alleviate

00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:31,850
some of the misery but really only some

00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:34,350
our shining future is right now at the

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:37,439
level of usability of an alarm panel

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,999
which is basically zero hook they've

00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:41,579
crammed some documentation inside the

00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:44,339
cover there because the design failed so

00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:46,350
hard there's a 300 page manual somewhere

00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:47,939
but don't let the resident see it or

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,240
they might not pay for the technician

00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:53,249
call-outs mrs. Borden design and this is

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,279
documentation used as a weapon of

00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:57,870
oppression please don't do that put a

00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,449
link to the documentation on the device

00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:04,769
put the documentation in the device if

00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:09,059
that's possible Bluetooth USB whatever

00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:11,220
QR code make it possible to find the

00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:12,720
documentation even if you don't know

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:16,920
anything because you just bought a house

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,199
that's full of gadgets and the previous

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:23,100
owner threw it all out so let's imagine

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,290
a less awful security panel you can

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,110
design it disarm it from your phone when

00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:31,319
you're outside it message to use your

00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:33,629
picture when intrusion is detected it

00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:35,790
starts recording from 30 seconds ago

00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:37,649
whenever something untoward happens if

00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,660
you forgot to harm it's the future you

00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:41,899
have a fire and pull your car over do

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:45,620
the thing keep moving

00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:48,540
documentation dude oh you have a phone

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:52,259
make the documentation available on

00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:54,779
mobile devices it's what people are

00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:56,720
going to be almost certainly using when

00:16:54,779 --> 00:17:02,939
they're trying to figure something out

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:04,980
so imagine your future home your oven

00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:08,850
has a remote colomac camera temperature

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,319
alert all your appliances message you to

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,659
announce when they're done or when

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,370
something's wrong your washing line

00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:16,439
tells you if it's raining and more

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,270
importantly your neighbor three blocks

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:19,390
away washing line tells your washing

00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,860
line to tell you that it's

00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,950
raining over there and you've got two

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:25,180
minutes to get your washing in did I

00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,640
remember to shut the front door

00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:29,860
again pull over papi at your phone yep

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,480
all good keep moving but you didn't even

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,260
need to do that because your house knows

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:36,730
when nobody's home and locks itself up

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:40,530
what is the future office in all these

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:43,780
futures by the way are happening now

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:46,540
your elevator plans the fastest route to

00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:49,600
the desired floors and sorts people and

00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:51,670
in two separate elevators your reception

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,930
box welcomes you welcomes visitors and

00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,870
pages of the person that they're here to

00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:58,600
see your meeting rooms know when their

00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:00,580
next booked your climate-controlled air

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,710
conditioning system actually works and

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,630
it knows about the particulate levels

00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,900
outdoors and those whether it's safe to

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:09,130
open the vents or whether it needs to

00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:11,130
accelerate its filter planning because

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:15,190
half the planet is on fire

00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:16,380
and when deliveries come to a loading

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:21,400
dock

00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:23,620
that's announced through to the

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,820
appropriate person okay how are we doing

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:31,450
for time and we get about 10 minutes

00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:34,360
okay we will open the sealed section

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,590
then because we have a bit of time so

00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,950
there are three things I want you to

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:41,460
take away last month I was at ddd

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,300
brisbane and i watch my friend enrique

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,920
sketching on his iPad

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,020
he mentioned he's using a particular

00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,900
drawing program I won't name names and I

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:51,700
committed that I'd heard if they just

00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,290
added animation there's a feature to

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,630
this drawing happenes yes he said in

00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:57,370
about 20 seconds he sketched out six

00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:58,930
frames of a simple animation and ran it

00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,760
in front of me and it was fabulous

00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:02,860
so when I got home I pulled out my iPad

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,110
and I was going to try it I couldn't

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,600
find the future had IRA misremembered

00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,550
what product he'd used I checked the app

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,200
description yes it's there is announced

00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:13,210
as a new feature how do I access it

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,490
couldn't work it out check the

00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:18,130
publishers website no information on how

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:21,790
to use their program besides a series of

00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:24,790
blog posts announcing new releases and

00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:26,970
this is the thing the very first thing

00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:30,980
you need to consider how does a new user

00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:33,739
discover your interface

00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,970
second thing to think about is you users

00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,350
are not stupid they're intelligent

00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:38,779
they're perceptive

00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:41,269
after all they chose your product but

00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:44,149
they don't necessarily have context or

00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:46,070
experience nor the domain knowledge that

00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:49,340
you have your product must be

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:51,739
understandable it must help people

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:56,539
understand it now in the mobile age this

00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:59,090
does become more difficult because the

00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:03,259
interfaces don't have as many ways to

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:07,380
discover as many ways to seek help as a

00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:08,619
desktop computer would do so

00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:13,100
[Music]

00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:15,409
documentation comes back again right a

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,090
tutorial not just a video I don't want

00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:19,429
to scroll through a 40-minute video

00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:25,730
sorry Josh to find out how to use the

00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:27,710
one feature I can't fathom maybe make

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,720
maybe include a transcript that's

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,179
searchable that's it it's a fabulous

00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,039
feature test your product on beginners

00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:36,080
documentas we need to cultivate

00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:38,600
beginner's mind to set aside our

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,929
privileged context and ask ourselves

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:44,539
will this make sense to a newbie create

00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:46,220
an imaginary friend who is a time

00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:48,559
traveler from a previous century perhaps

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,389
bent along or Queen Victoria or your

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,330
great-great-grandmother explain it to

00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:56,330
them can would they be able to use your

00:20:53,330 --> 00:21:01,879
product do what people expect

00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:05,809
if you don't know watch them think back

00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:08,720
to that oven if I am totaling an orb

00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:10,570
that I expect to cause the light to go

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,249
on and off because most ovens have a

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:17,480
have thermostat feedback then that

00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:19,159
feature needs to be there so here are

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,919
some questions you should be asking and

00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:23,749
asking yourself to support the stages of

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,389
action that a person goes through when

00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:28,460
they're learning anything and in

00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:30,619
particular a computer program what do we

00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,950
want to accomplish how do I discover

00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:36,679
what's possible what are the alternative

00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:39,289
action sequences is a feedback saying no

00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,619
don't do that you should do this what

00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:44,210
can I do now what's how do I help the

00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:49,130
user build a conceptual model

00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:50,900
of what they are interacting with how do

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:54,110
they do what they want to do their

00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,820
affordances are buttons touchable

00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,680
feelable are things that are supposed to

00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,230
be swiped some he'll saying swipe me

00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:03,080
things that are supposed to be tapped

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:05,830
saying tap me does a door say pull push

00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:09,080
or pull by the orientation at its handle

00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:11,390
what happened signifiers if you did

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,240
something you must know there must be a

00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:19,240
way to know that you did it what does it

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:23,630
mean which is to say mappings how does

00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:27,140
the thing that you do become reflected

00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:31,130
in the output and is it okay have I

00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:32,690
reached my goal and something that

00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,920
became clear to me when I was talking to

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,480
Savannah

00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,880
a former tech writer in the registration

00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,030
line is the act of writing documentation

00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,210
is the act of UX review to confirm that

00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:45,230
a product supports these needs

00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:50,150
documentation or rather the thought

00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:51,770
process that leads to documentation

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:54,920
whether or not you personally write the

00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:56,930
documentation is part of design it is QA

00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,120
for your design and I want you to think

00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:01,880
about whether your documentation happens

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:10,880
in the part of your development where it

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:14,330
can deliver that benefit so to recap the

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:20,720
key points a house is a machine to live

00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:23,150
in and our software is joining with our

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,170
hardware is joining with our environment

00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:30,770
to be a inescapable soup in which we

00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:32,900
float so if you build software today you

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,790
are building a future that we are going

00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:41,720
to be stuck with for a long time pending

00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:45,250
climate disaster and we need to be

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,960
friends with the machines imagine

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:53,950
technology that's easy to use not just

00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,950
easy to build the people who are

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,150
you are serving other users the people

00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:02,670
who are going to be living with these

00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:05,390
things as part of their lives and there

00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:08,520
is more to design than just blue LEDs

00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:12,240
the future is here if you look around

00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:14,010
you can see some great examples of good

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,260
design and some great examples of bad

00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:20,340
design and whenever you're searching for

00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:22,470
documentation I want you to ask what

00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,170
could I have done to avoid having to

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:28,080
write this documentation so thank you

00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:30,690
for your attention I hope you enjoyed my

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,970
clickbait I am here all week

00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:35,760
and I look forward to continuing the

00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:38,960
conversation throughout that week and in

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:48,059
the five or so minutes we have remaining

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:48,059
[Applause]

00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,830
great talk thank you are you not arguing

00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:09,660
against innovation here like this is

00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,340
that skeuomorphic design thing where

00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:12,930
it's like we have to just keep repeating

00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,210
what people already know and like we

00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:16,620
can't do anything new because like you

00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:18,630
know we've got to keep it like what

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,700
people are already familiar with there

00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:22,740
there is a set of rules there is a

00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,330
conceptual model that is going to apply

00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,650
to almost anything you build so if

00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:27,930
you're building an oven there are things

00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,130
that oven users are going to know there

00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,870
are things that having users are going

00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,580
to expect and if you're building a

00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:34,020
disruptive revolutionary oven you're

00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,790
probably going to want to violate some

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,650
of those things but you need to do it

00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:40,220
clearly and you need to signify that

00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:42,720
you're doing it and you need to

00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,520
understand what rules you're violating

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,380
in order to break them good and hard in

00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,640
a way that is not going to have

00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:52,140
unintended consequences I think about

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,920
this whenever I go to a bathroom in

00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,630
particular at conferences you see all

00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,490
kinds of weird sinks and tap

00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:01,170
arrangements and stuff and I have this

00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,490
theory that you should never shake hands

00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:13,440
with an architect because they clearly

00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:15,530
do not wash we have another one over

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,530
here

00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:28,990
you mentioned that it is like like the

00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:31,670
example you posed sort of hinge sort of

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:35,600
heavily on the fact that it's the future

00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:37,700
everybody's got a phone I don't know how

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,090
many times I've had my freakin Samsung

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,680
just die on me because the battery sucks

00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:44,420
do you think that to some degree there

00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,230
should be sort of traditional controls

00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,890
as a fallback

00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:51,920
when you know just the sort of fancier

00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:54,590
stuff just kind of fails yes yes there

00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,590
are and I guess yulian security

00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:59,690
applications there are there are things

00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,160
that failsafe and fail usable and there

00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,050
are things that fail dead

00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,760
so there are door locks that I would not

00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:06,500
use on an escape door because the

00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,540
failure mode is lock the damn door

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:10,310
and there are door locks for example

00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,690
where you can still continue to use the

00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:14,570
key I have one on my front door people

00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,950
always ask me that very same question if

00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,330
you use your phone to open your front

00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,260
door what happens if your phone's flat

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:26,300
and I tell them I use the key yeah I

00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:29,500
suppose that's the only caveat all right

00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,500
