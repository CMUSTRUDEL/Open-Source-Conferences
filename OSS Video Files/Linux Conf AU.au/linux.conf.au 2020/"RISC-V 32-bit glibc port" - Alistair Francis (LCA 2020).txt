A talk about the RISC-V 32-bit glibc port. This will include details about the 64-bit time_t problem and how RV32 is going to be the first 32-bit architecture with a 64-bit time_t. This talk will also discuss what the current progress of upstreaming is, what is left to be done and why it has taken so long.
