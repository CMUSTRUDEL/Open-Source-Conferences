GStreamer is flexible a multimedia framework used to build various different sorts of systems that deal with audio and video.

One aspect of the framework is the infrastructure for implementing synchronised media playback across devices. This finds use in various scenarios ranging from video walls to synchronised media displays to multiroom audio systems.

This talk will explore the GstSyncServer library, which provides a flexible, high-level API for building such systems. This will include examples of how it could be used, the design of the API, how it may be used to implement custom synchronisation mechanisms, and areas where contributors could get involved.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
