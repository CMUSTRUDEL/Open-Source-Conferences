Linux developers must know the basics of licensing. In particular, developers will encounter issues, questions, concerns & discussions about Linux's license, the GNU General Public License, version 2 (GPLv2) throughout their careers. This tutorial gives the most basic introduction to GPLv2, the basics of its history, how it perceived both within and without the Linux community, and what managers, executives, & legal departments will ask developers to do about licensing. Most importantly, the nuances of GPLv2's requirements for "scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable", which are often more complicated for embedded systems, are carefully explained, as are the known additional permissions available beyond GPLv2 for Linux. Successful students will be ready to converse intelligently in licensing conversations in their companies and in the community.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

[Applause]

00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:06,810
so so I really appreciate being allowed

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:10,260
to give a talk about licensing licensing

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,990
to a technical mini Kampf it is very

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:16,859
kind of the organizers to let me do that

00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,900
and I generally feel that developers are

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,670
at an unfair disadvantage because

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,859
lawyers are constantly telling you that

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,470
you don't understand the legal issues

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,779
you can probably learn enough pretty

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,429
quickly possibly even from this talk to

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,560
understand the legal issues at least

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,680
about linux's license better than most

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:39,480
of them do now you shouldn't hold that

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,280
over them use it as mechanism to engage

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,960
them in conversation and push back when

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,520
the lawyers of their company are telling

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,410
you to do something that doesn't really

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,300
make sense to you you can say no to your

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,850
lawyers a lot of people don't realize in

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,629
a business the lawyers are not in charge

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:57,239
they are there as advisors to advise the

00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,289
business people primarily so convincing

00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,820
the business person is the more

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:01,620
important thing because they can tell

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,860
the lawyer yes we hear you but we don't

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,070
care now why should you as an engineer

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:12,390
developer care about anything to do with

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,369
legal issues I like you started my

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,710
career as a software developer and

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,970
assistant minister ATAR which dates me

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,290
because this admins don't call

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,740
themselves anymore they all say they

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,270
work in DevOps but I like to do cool

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,509
things with computing - I'd rather spend

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,970
most of my time doing that and in fact I

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,310
got into free software because I thought

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,350
proprietary licenses were in my way it

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,540
stopped me from being able to do cool

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,490
things with computing so I would like

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,680
them to get out of my way I would like

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:46,350
the GPL sometimes they even get out of

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:49,470
my way but it's the value of the GPL

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,149
that makes Linux free so what I want to

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,189
do is give you enough information so

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,920
that the license doesn't get in your way

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:58,140
and actually is a tool to you to help

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,119
assure your software freedom that your

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,710
your user software freedom and so forth

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,570
and perhaps you can learn enough that

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,869
you can teach other developers at least

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,000
the basic information so the reason I

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,819
put this quote from Harry Potter up is

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,180
because lawyers act like going to law

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,010
school was like going to Hogwarts

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,349
that anybody who doesn't have a law

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,360
degree as some sort of muggle and they

00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:21,010
don't understand anything but as Harry

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,049
says every great wizard was just a

00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,810
student at one point the only thing you

00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:28,390
can't do without a law degree is

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,120
represent someone as a lawyer you can

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,730
learn everything that is there in a law

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,290
school the books are not exactly freely

00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:37,239
available but they're there the

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,220
information is out there I'm not a

00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,019
lawyer I can't give you legal advice but

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,659
generally speaking I know a lot more

00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:45,790
about most copyright issues than most

00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:47,980
lawyers unless they're a like lifelong

00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:54,519
copyright specialist so you can get to

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:56,500
that point as well so I want to give you

00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:58,989
the ability to ask intelligent questions

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,389
to be able to figure out how to explain

00:02:58,989 --> 00:03:04,299
the software side of how it interacts

00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,530
with licensing so let's this some of

00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:06,609
this is really basic information I know

00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,230
there's already some people in the

00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:09,370
audience who know things about legal

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,319
issues so I'll go relatively quickly

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,700
through this part and if you have

00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:14,650
questions at the end feel free to ask

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:18,190
them if there was a missing piece

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,180
somewhere in there so you get this thing

00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,459
go out of software license you've

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,620
probably heard of that before

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:26,109
so to put it in sort of a you know sort

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,579
of generalized terms to get a license

00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:29,620
means you've gotten some set of

00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:31,989
permissions perhaps with requirements

00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:35,940
that you also have to meet conditionally

00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:39,220
to be able to receive those permissions

00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,049
proprietary licenses are usually really

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,530
focused on forming a business

00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:47,250
relationship with you as a customer or

00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,780
user so they have some sort of

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,849
contractual arrangement between you and

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,620
the company for example when you use

00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:55,180
Google services you contract with them

00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,849
to give them all your data about

00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,919
yourself for any purpose they would care

00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:02,319
to use it for and for that you get some

00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,940
zero cost proprietary software I don't

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,739
like making that deal myself but that's

00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,400
basically how most proprietary software

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:11,739
licenses are structured a free and open

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,510
source software licenses can be treated

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,849
as contracts as well but they're

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,699
primarily the legal mechanism that they

00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:20,409
primarily rely on to transfer these

00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:22,200
permissions and requirements around is

00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:24,730
under copyright

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,140
so when you look at a proprietary

00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,850
license it's gonna be thought of as a

00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,200
contract first in a copyright license

00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,730
second when you look at a free software

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,500
license it'll typically be looked at as

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:36,520
a copyright license first and a

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,290
contractual arrangement second so from

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,580
the point of view of the legal system

00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,050
and this is actually well

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,360
internationalized through a thing called

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,070
the Berne Convention on copyright

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,740
software in that it is a series of

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,600
textual statements that you write it is

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,070
governed by copyright in any country

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,420
that has signed the Berne Convention on

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,650
copyright which is nearly every country

00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,960
certainly every country in the

00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,280
industrialized world so everything

00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,170
that's in texts can be governed by

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,210
copyright and therefore software at

00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:05,730
least the primary legal system that ends

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:09,010
up governing software is copyright so

00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,720
copyright was invented primarily for

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,330
books because those were the first

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,680
things that were ever put in print ever

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,690
distributed and copied and distributed

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,090
around the world so there's a lot of

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,610
biases in the worldwide copyright

00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,760
systems thinking in terms of books for

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,800
example back in the US they ask you when

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,780
you submit a work for registration of

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,480
copyright in the United States you send

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,300
the first 25 pages in the last 25 pages

00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,880
of the work I have been debating for 20

00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:38,770
years with the copyright license to

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,210
operate a sorry copyright registration

00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,580
office in the US and with every

00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,950
copyright lawyer I meet what exactly is

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,470
the first 25 pages in the last 25 pages

00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,790
of a software program no one knows the

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,280
answer yet and the copyright

00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,470
registration library of congress who

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,450
runs in the united states has not given

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,960
any guidance whatsoever on this question

00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:01,630
after at this point forty fifty years of

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,560
software existing this is the book bias

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:07,360
showing itself but the other parts of

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,180
what governs for books fit pretty well

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,850
with software they govern the copying

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,979
modifying and distributing of works

00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,290
under copyright and a book is a work

00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:19,540
just like software's and work and we

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,940
have pretty good working understandings

00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:26,470
of what it means to copy modify or

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:29,039
distribute a work of software copyright

00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,330
by default in Berne Convention countries

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,099
turns all these permissions by default

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,960
if you get a copyrighted work and you

00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:35,409
don't have any permission you don't get

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,179
a life

00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:40,629
with it you have no permission to copy

00:06:37,179 --> 00:06:43,029
modify or distribute the work in most

00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:45,610
countries you get something called

00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:47,080
a bundle of fair use rights or fair

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,789
dealing it's called in some countries

00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,459
where you're allowed to at least do

00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:53,619
things like look at the work and make

00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:56,379
use of it and so forth but you really

00:06:53,619 --> 00:06:57,789
don't have a permission to do any type

00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:01,119
of modifications or improvements or

00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:03,399
changes so ultimately what a license is

00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:05,499
supposed to do is it if it's gonna be

00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:07,179
free software just today at the very

00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:08,800
least you are allowed to copy modify and

00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:11,589
distribute and every free software

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,300
license does that the question is should

00:07:11,589 --> 00:07:16,839
a free software license do more than

00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:19,239
that I tend to like license that do a

00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,679
little bit more than just give you

00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,839
permission to copy modify and distribute

00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:25,419
to work and that's why I like these

00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:30,279
things called copyleft licenses copyleft

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:34,719
is a policy framework that uses

00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:38,949
copyright to advance certain policy

00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:40,360
goals of software freedom so a copyleft

00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:42,579
license will do the same thing every

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,409
other Foss license will do it'll first

00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:46,569
give you permission to copy modify and

00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:49,509
distribute the work and then it will add

00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:51,339
conditional requirements that you have

00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:54,069
to do when you engage in those

00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:55,839
activities and all of those requirements

00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:59,889
if it's a well-structured copyleft

00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:02,469
license should be focused on assuring

00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:04,089
the downstream users have the freedom to

00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:05,709
copy share modify and distribute the

00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:08,669
works as well that's where we get this

00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:11,079
share and share alike idea with copyleft

00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:13,929
so this is a working definition of

00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:15,550
copyleft that was originally from

00:08:13,929 --> 00:08:18,699
Wikipedia I made some edits to this

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,079
myself for copyleft org but it's pretty

00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,689
much the version that you see on

00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,349
Wikipedia and my favorite word in the

00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:28,089
entire definition is that word strategy

00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:30,939
because I think a lot of people think of

00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:34,089
copyleft as some sort of moral cause on

00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:35,769
itself copyleft is merely a tool is a

00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:39,479
tool that I have seen to use well it is

00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:42,129
a tool that I have seen abused badly but

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,680
when it's used in the way it was

00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:49,960
intended it's a tool to advance software

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:55,970
freedom not a goal unto itself per se

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:58,940
so the good news is - I'll get to that

00:08:55,970 --> 00:09:02,150
later is a implementation of copyleft

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,650
copyleft is a specification GPL is a

00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,830
simplemente GPL is one of its

00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:09,230
implementations

00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:10,820
generally speaking the copyleft idea can

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,520
be applied to any type of copyrighted

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:16,580
work the GPL is specifically a copyleft

00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,400
written for software so it has a bunch

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:20,720
of detailed rules which are mostly

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,520
technological in nature not legal in

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,430
nature although they're embodied in a

00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,200
legal document to assure that downstream

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,180
users have the freedom to copy share

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,339
modify and improve the software and that

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,110
most importantly they can make effective

00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:35,570
use of those freedoms that they actually

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:37,820
work that is not a theoretical question

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,500
that they can modify and reinstall and

00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:44,320
improve the software but they actually

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:49,100
have the clear path and means to do so

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,750
so the goal of copyleft basically is to

00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,790
make sure everybody who gets a copy of

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,920
the program has the standard for

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:59,120
freedoms of free software that's its

00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:00,520
goal so as I mentioned all of these

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,740
fossil Ison's there's a primarily

00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,240
copyright license so to apply the GPL to

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,890
a program you copyright the software as

00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,230
it turns out that happens automatically

00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:12,080
when you write software by the way in

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:14,060
most countries if you write software and

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,730
are employed to do it your employer

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,560
holds that copyright not you when you as

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:20,180
a side point when you go to get a job

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,830
the first thing you should ask them

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:24,920
after you get a really great salary

00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:27,140
which you all do is Linux developers you

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,880
should tell them I really want to keep

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:35,060
my own copyrights and that's not

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:37,610
negotiable then you are the one deciding

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,630
to put it under GPL by the way one thing

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,980
you should be willing to give away is

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,630
you'll promise to GPL everything you

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,260
write as part of your job under your own

00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:49,730
copyright so you use the GPL to grant

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:51,200
those key freedoms the requirements

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,490
they're added by the GPL prohibit

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,680
anybody else to take away those freedoms

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,900
so when you look at the GPL you find the

00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,490
phrase provided that appearing a lot in

00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,770
the license because it says you can do a

00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,180
some sort of activity like modifying

00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:05,960
distributing copying the software

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:09,450
provided that you do some B which is

00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,980
design that B is designed to assure the

00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,790
next person that gets the software has

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,590
the same ability to do a that you did so

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,930
there's basically two classes of

00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:22,710
copyleft there's strong copyleft like

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:25,380
the GPL which is a copyleft license that

00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:28,350
attempts to maximally use the copyright

00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,990
system to defend software freedom I'm

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,450
not sure both Jeremy Allison and Michael

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,860
Meeks I think came up with this example

00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:37,290
independently they called the GPL like

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,090
judo because apparently I'm not a

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,440
martial artist but in Judah one of the

00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,170
goals is to use the aggression of the

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,880
opponent to change the direction and

00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,220
push back on it it's exactly what strong

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:52,620
copyleft tries to do more copyright

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:54,780
pushes controls and and powers onto the

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,730
world the more copyleft uses those

00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,260
powers to push back and make sure that

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:01,140
they're always used to defend software

00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,150
freedom so it's gonna go as far as it

00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,800
can this is why this derivative works

00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:07,020
argument comes up all the time because

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,910
people say the GPL doesn't tell me what

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,710
a derivative work is and our answer

00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,450
always is well copyright law in the

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,490
various jurisdictions that you are in

00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:17,400
talk about derivative work combined

00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:20,430
works works derived from the program all

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,470
those sorts of things and whatever your

00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:25,440
copyright system says is a derivative

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,760
work GPL covers that and Laurie said why

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,500
don't you define the GPL it said because

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,690
we want to go absolutely far as we can

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,300
go in any jurisdiction because that was

00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:35,190
the whole point of strong copyleft by

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,280
contrast weak copyleft

00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:41,040
is actually more complicated because

00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,380
weak copyleft has inside the license a

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,510
bunch of technical details of certain

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,980
types of things even if the copyright

00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,130
system would call it a derivative or

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,440
combined work or a modified work you're

00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,700
still allowed to do the LGPL which

00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,650
everybody has their own idea of what

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,270
they think the LGPL says I find very

00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,380
very few people actually read it because

00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,800
if they did they would never use the

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:04,260
license but it has these detail

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,910
requirements of a work that uses the

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,710
library versus a work based on the

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,890
library and those are again primarily

00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:12,780
technical software focused rules that

00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:14,610
you have to follow and when it fits the

00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,890
definition of a work that uses the

00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,900
program you can make that code

00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:21,750
somewhat proprietary and if it's a work

00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,160
based on the library then you have to

00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:30,720
release it just as you would with the

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:32,640
GPL so the primary place where GPL hooks

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,010
on to things is in the right to modify

00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,970
because it ties into this derivative

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:40,770
work thing the idea is to allow people

00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,870
to make private modifications as much as

00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:46,170
they like and then tie it to

00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:48,360
distribution so the key GPL requirements

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,880
come up when you do both when you modify

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,220
then distribute that's when you really

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,480
have the strictest most detailed

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,400
requirements of things you have to

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,230
follow under GPL this seems very

00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,910
reasonable to me because we're now

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,340
engaging in two different things that

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,740
are governed by copyright modification

00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,500
and distribution and you got the

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,550
software for absolutely zero cost

00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,370
contributed by millions of people all

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,350
over the world developed for decades at

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,270
this point great software and all you

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,550
have to do is if you happen to engage in

00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:19,260
modification and distribution you have

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,180
some requirements you have to me it's a

00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,190
pretty reasonable bargain

00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:27,270
I know it's amazes me that most people

00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:29,310
don't comply with the GPL so the GPL

00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:31,800
section 2 is where most of this happened

00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,540
this is the beginning of section 2 this

00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,460
talks about changes by the way most

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:38,370
people never follow that but it's rarely

00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:41,160
enforced but it is technically you do

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,930
have to do that kind of marking which by

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,690
the way means that if you don't do it in

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,040
the code you probably might have to ship

00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,300
to get repository with it if you're not

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,320
going to make marked changes in the code

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,580
just saying but the key Clause that's

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,280
most interesting this is kind of the

00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,660
core copyleft cause the core place where

00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:02,610
it talks about the derivative work thing

00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:05,610
is this section 2b and it's the GPL b2

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,320
is so clumsily worded because it was

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,390
written in 1991

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,340
iving GPL v3 is much better worded in

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:14,730
this regard the number of times people

00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:17,250
look at that phrase at no charge and

00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:19,260
been confused about whether you can make

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:22,320
money with the GPL so plead with GPL

00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:25,590
software I that phrase is referring to

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,960
the license can't have a fee but people

00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:29,510
get confused by that so this is kind of

00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,590
the central derivative

00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:34,310
cause I don't wanna get too much into

00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,870
that until later but I do want to talk

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:40,190
about the derivative work question in

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:43,130
general so ultimately when you're making

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:45,200
modifications of software and you want

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,100
to make a derivative work the GPL says

00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,160
you have to release it

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,630
I often glibly just tell people well if

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,800
you GPL everything you never have to

00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,480
worry about what's a derivative work and

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,710
what is it because it's only if you want

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,410
to make proprietary software that you

00:15:54,710 --> 00:16:01,070
ever have to ask this question so people

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,420
have to do risk analysis my view is is

00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,700
why do they want to test this boundary

00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,350
in the first place I am truly

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:09,280
flabbergasted the number of companies

00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:11,180
that are constantly testing this

00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,730
boundary and they're doing it mostly

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,410
with Linux Linux is the place where the

00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,180
boundaries of derivative works are being

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,410
tested more than not just any other free

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,800
software any other software in the world

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:24,470
is where it's being tested because

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,390
companies they really like making

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,770
proprietary stuff I don't understand it

00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,690
but they do and they want to take Linux

00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,880
and put the Briery stuff in it and they

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,980
want to get away with something the

00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,020
extent to which Nvidia spent their

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:40,730
entire existence trying to get away with

00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:41,810
things is is it's just it seems silly to

00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:43,550
me

00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,960
you shouldn't usually certainly there's

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:46,910
a whole section in the copyleft guide

00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,130
that talks about the various different

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:52,190
rules and legal decisions about

00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,360
derivative works around the globe it's

00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:55,730
worth reading it's worth asking your

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,980
lawyers to read it I think that unless

00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,650
you're Nvidia unless you're a company

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,900
that's obsessed with circumventing the

00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,459
GPL hurting free software these

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,680
derivative work questions are just not

00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:09,650
going to come up so much the other thing

00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,959
that's also true under the GPL is you

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:14,780
can always remove the copy left of

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,940
software if you're unhappy at the

00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,070
outcome so a lot of people have always

00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,839
thought then oh if somebody violates the

00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:23,180
GPL we've got them we get all their code

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,100
that's not true they always have the

00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,630
option to remove it in fact if you've

00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:29,150
heard about the VMware case that we

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:32,390
worked on for basically ten years the

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:34,760
ultimate resolution we got which was not

00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:38,980
ideal for us was we got them to remove

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:41,270
the Linux code from their ESXi product

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,410
that was an option for them we would

00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:45,840
have rather that they just GPL DES

00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:47,340
I product because they based it on Linux

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,960
and in fact it didn't work without all

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,730
of the entire scuzzy subsystem from

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,500
Linux so it could boot up but it

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:55,950
couldn't read a harddrive so I don't

00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,480
know how useful that is but they shows

00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,570
note we're gonna rewrite all that Linux

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,130
code that we we stole ten years ago

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,300
we're just going to rewrite it that's

00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,090
what they did and that's how they came

00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,680
into compliance so removing the GPL code

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,940
is always an option so even if you make

00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,200
a mistake or your company makes a

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,940
mistake with regard to derivative works

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,950
they can always just stop using Linux

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,240
now people often say that's a glib

00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,910
answer because they say well I have to

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,610
use Linux I think no you don't vxworks

00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:26,580
exists go license it if you really want

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:28,530
proprietary software so because the

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:31,440
freedom of modification is the most

00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,670
important thing for developers for free

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,930
software so I think the most important

00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,850
thing certainly for Linux developers

00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,260
they want to be able to see the code

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,930
that someone gives them when they get a

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:42,810
copy of Linux source code is ultimately

00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,700
the center place of what you need right

00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,170
because you don't modify a binary work

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,540
most of the time people do they

00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:51,000
reverse-engineer it but that's much more

00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,530
painful than modifying the source so

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,250
there are many many provisions in the

00:18:52,530 --> 00:19:00,000
GPL that talk at length about source

00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:03,060
code provisioning assuring that the

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,430
source code is given downstream when you

00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,640
do that modification and distribute and

00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:11,610
the reason this works is because

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:14,510
binaries are just text modified versions

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:17,280
of the software so they're covered just

00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:19,260
by copyright like any other thing the

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,250
binaries are copyrighted - and to get

00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,710
permission to create that derivative

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,840
work binary being a derivative work of

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,610
the source you need you need the

00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,910
copyright permissions from the GPL and

00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:34,260
therefore they're the the compiled code

00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:36,270
that's modified by the compiler is also

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,460
covered by the GPL I think a lot of

00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:41,850
people forget that because a lot of

00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,070
people forget that the binary itself is

00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:46,200
also licensed under the GPL there's no

00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,550
other licenses allowed to be under so

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,840
it's not like the binary is under one

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,880
license and the source codes under GPL

00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,610
now the binaries under GPL and then

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,170
there's sections in the GPL that lay out

00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:58,399
the technical details of what you have

00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:01,409
to do to provision the source code

00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:04,379
and this is where I think developers and

00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:06,539
engineers are the most useful people in

00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:09,089
discussions about GPL and compliance

00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,739
because when you get to that point where

00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:13,249
you've distributed a binary work a

00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:16,019
binary copy of Linux under GPL and

00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:17,009
there's a question of is this the right

00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:19,409
source code for it

00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:20,849
all the decisions and figuring out if

00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:22,919
it's the right source code is a

00:20:20,849 --> 00:20:25,859
technological problem not a legal

00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,570
problem and so you are if your company's

00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:29,099
having say trouble complying with the

00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,659
GPL Linux which a lot of companies are

00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:32,210
so probably people in this room have

00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:35,789
companies that are having such trouble

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:37,589
they will rely would would do best to

00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:40,979
rely on you to help them figure that out

00:20:37,589 --> 00:20:42,719
rather than asking of the lawyers so

00:20:40,979 --> 00:20:44,639
from my point of view the most important

00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:45,960
requirement in the GPL is the

00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:48,419
requirement to provide complete

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,359
corresponding source and years ago we

00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:53,580
made an acronym for that we call it CCS

00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:55,519
because GPL says those words complete

00:20:53,580 --> 00:21:01,830
corresponding source so we call it CCS

00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:03,839
so ultimately what the idea behind CCS

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,899
is trying to do is to assure that when a

00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:09,719
downstream user gets the binary they can

00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:11,700
reproduce and install that binary just

00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:15,779
as the upstream that gave them to him

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:19,320
did so this is the actual text of GPL

00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:21,149
that talks about how to do this I think

00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,289
the most important phrase and the phrase

00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:25,589
that I've spent most of my career

00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:27,779
dealing with is the last few words the

00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:30,239
scripts used to control compilation and

00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:33,419
installation is executable I have had

00:21:30,239 --> 00:21:37,320
half day long conference calls talking

00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:39,869
about the word thaw in that phrase by

00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,549
the way the scripts I think we've pretty

00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:42,809
much figured out that as long as the

00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:43,979
scripts work they don't have to be the

00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:46,499
original ones you used because

00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:47,909
frequently they people will write a

00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:49,889
proprietary build system and they don't

00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:51,330
want to give that away and so then when

00:21:49,889 --> 00:21:53,279
you find them out of compliance you ask

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,739
for the scripts and they say we don't

00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,389
want to give you the scripts and for

00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:59,820
awhile I would say we have to assess the

00:21:57,389 --> 00:22:01,529
scripts and we figured out we can't

00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,940
really rely on the word the to mean it

00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:04,619
has to be the actual scripts because

00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,950
doesn't say the actual scripts it just

00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:08,940
says the scripts so any working scripts

00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:11,879
are okay

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,309
but this is the level of detail that GPL

00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:16,619
violators like to get into when they

00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:18,210
violate the GPL they will spend days

00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:20,190
with us debating whether or not those

00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:24,059
scripts means they have to give us the

00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:26,539
scripts or not so one of the things we

00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:30,029
do when we enforce the GPL for Linux is

00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:33,509
we evaluate the CCS we actually try to

00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:36,359
build it and after 20-some years of

00:22:33,509 --> 00:22:37,830
doing this I'm sad to say it's pretty

00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:42,289
much a no when you see it kind of

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:45,960
standard I we do have one example in the

00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:48,570
copyleft org guide that has an example

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,190
of a very good CCS candidate that we

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,249
looked at and worked well and is worth

00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:55,739
imitating and emulating but I usually

00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:57,419
see people just barely get across the

00:22:55,739 --> 00:22:59,489
finish line kind of huffing and panting

00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,109
the one in the copy left guy is the only

00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:03,029
one that I saw go sailing running way

00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:07,049
past the finish line you know and still

00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:08,639
still sprinting along so the tests that

00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:10,320
we do is we actually try to build and

00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:11,849
install the thing so if we get it

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,609
usually embedded devices that are

00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:16,320
violent GPL IOT devices we say okay can

00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:18,509
we build this from source and can we

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,979
install a copy of Linux our own Linux

00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:22,139
binary back in place where the other

00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:25,049
Linux was and if we can't build and

00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:26,429
install it then it's not including the

00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:27,899
prot at least the proper scripts to

00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:30,149
control compilation and installation

00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:32,489
that executable and I've been making

00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:35,460
this recommendation for at least 10

00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:37,769
years probably 15 and I have not yet

00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,840
seen a company that does this they spend

00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:41,999
millions of dollars now on the

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,590
compliance industrial complex when all

00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:46,109
they could have done for every product

00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:48,269
is hire one extra engineer just for like

00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:50,399
a week at the end of the process who's

00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:52,200
never seen the product before hand them

00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:53,399
the source release and say can you build

00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,330
and install Linux from this source

00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:56,070
release that we're gonna give to

00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,869
everybody who asked for it and the

00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,869
answer's no you're not complying with

00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:02,519
the GPL if the answer is yes you're most

00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:03,960
likely complying with the GPL modulo

00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:05,580
proprietary kernel module issues that

00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,950
I'll talk about in a minute I'm

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,960
flabbergasted that not a single company

00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,729
does this and of course the reason is is

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,289
they'd much rather give millions of

00:24:11,729 --> 00:24:17,509
dollars to Blackduck than actually

00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:19,589
comply with the GPL it turns out so

00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:21,550
obviously I like copyleft a lot it's my

00:24:19,589 --> 00:24:23,650
favorite form of licensing

00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,910
I like this joke about the ISC license

00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:27,370
you know people say I love the ISC

00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:30,340
license it's so simple the joke is it's

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:32,140
simple because it doesn't do anything it

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,700
gives you a bunch of permissions but it

00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:36,400
doesn't assure anything for anybody

00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,260
other than the original author and in

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,030
fact any proprietary license does that

00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,970
for us

00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:43,840
but I do want to at least give you

00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:47,860
mainly because I wanna show you how bad

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:50,650
I am at making charts what the kind of

00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:52,420
layout of faust licensing is right so

00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,460
you can kind of think of it as a two

00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,700
dimensional spectrum on the one hand

00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:00,190
there's these highly permissive licenses

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,510
like the ISC license that give you

00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,010
software freedom they give you the right

00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,380
to copy modify and distribute software

00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:08,620
and then there's the far end of copyleft

00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:11,980
which are licenses that contain a lot

00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:13,840
more requirements that seek to assure

00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,580
software freedom so I just throw that

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,290
out there mainly because you know I

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,430
should have some graphics and I'm not

00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,130
good at graphic so now you know how

00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:23,220
about I Emma graphics so one of the most

00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:27,520
important things about Linux is license

00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:30,610
is that not all of it is GPL not every

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:34,140
little piece of Linux is GPL license as

00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:37,750
it turns out our hackable like software

00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:39,400
so you can take any strong copyleft

00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:43,180
license something on that far end of the

00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:45,130
spectrum and make it weaker ie make it

00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,470
less copy lefted and more like the IFC

00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:49,600
license by adding an additional

00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:51,760
permission these are often often caught

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,650
exceptions I've been trying to remove

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,150
that word from the lexicon like

00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:58,750
single-handedly so it hasn't gone that

00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:01,020
well but the word exception has a very

00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,730
specific not very specific but a a

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,930
cognitive meaning for engineers when

00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,210
they hear exception they think that's

00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,530
something bad and negative like oh you

00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,500
know it threw an exception it's screwed

00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:12,790
up but additional permissions are

00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,640
actually reasonably good things and

00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:17,530
useful so I kind of even though it's

00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,440
longer I kind of leaned towards the

00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:21,640
additional permission phrasing so I'm

00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,230
finally going to actually talk about

00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,970
Linux Linux has now appeared on a slide

00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,950
for the first time the half way through

00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:28,750
a talk about Linux is licensed so I

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,929
thank you for your patience for waiting

00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:34,239
this long to see the word Linux up there

00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:37,849
we all know Linux is a very technically

00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:40,989
complicated project it is probably one

00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:43,940
of the most complicated license wise

00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:47,419
software projects in the Foss world as

00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:50,089
well mainly because it's big but there

00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:53,419
is a single thing you can think about it

00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:55,879
will generally give you 98% of what's

00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:58,659
true about Linux is licensed the

00:26:55,879 --> 00:27:02,960
effective license of Linux as a whole is

00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:05,839
gplv2 only but many parts of it have

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,539
additional permissions that you could

00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:11,629
extract and use under different licenses

00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:12,859
so that's the summary that's the basic

00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,940
idea of what's going on to app Linux

00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:16,669
license I'm gonna dig a little bit into

00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,830
that first of all what's this GPL v2

00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:21,229
only thing so those of you that were

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:24,019
around during GPL v3 drafting remember

00:27:21,229 --> 00:27:25,879
there was a fight about this the thing I

00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:28,759
try to point out as we analyze that

00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:31,399
fight historically is the GPL is

00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:34,070
actually maybe the only copy left

00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:35,749
license that I've ever seen that doesn't

00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:38,839
have an auto upgrade clause and people

00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:40,700
don't realize this in licensing an auto

00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:44,690
upgrade clause means that when the

00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:46,820
license steward publishes a new version

00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,460
of the license the code that you

00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,419
released onto the prior version

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,849
automatically is real license to the

00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:54,799
world without your action under the new

00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:55,909
license so what's this thing what's the

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,820
license Stewart

00:27:55,909 --> 00:28:01,669
well the license doer is who published

00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,830
the original document license so the

00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:04,879
license steward of GPL is not the Linux

00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:07,309
project it's the Free Software

00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:10,639
Foundation the license stewart of the

00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:12,679
Mozilla public license is not any random

00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:14,960
author of MPL it's the Missoula

00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:17,330
foundation the license steward of the

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:23,119
Eclipse license is the Eclipse

00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:24,679
Foundation so there's a lot of

00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,859
interesting tools there obviously I

00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:30,440
don't much care for auto upgrade clauses

00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:35,690
myself I think it's actually better to

00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,830
do it the way that we do it in GPL I'm

00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,899
sorry there's actually a repeat of those

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,700
slides I apologize

00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:43,730
oh there's that's what I was looking for

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:46,280
sorry yeah so so

00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,450
I think it's a little weird you know

00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,220
when you when you license your code

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:49,550
right you've read the license you like

00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,740
it

00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:53,270
you pick that license the idea that a

00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,600
license Stewart come can come along and

00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:58,160
take control and decide a different

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,380
version license I'm kind of like

00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,520
initially like I thought that the latex

00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:03,380
community should just trust the FSF

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,360
whatever they did and I've come around

00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,660
to where the Linux community was coming

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,580
from

00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:11,510
during gplv3 right you don't want

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,440
somebody maybe never met or somebody

00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:15,170
isn't born yet

00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,870
uh-huh cuz copyright lasts a long time

00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,760
you see to be the person to decide the

00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:21,290
next license of your software you might

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,030
want to entrust somebody you know so

00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:27,290
well I think it's totally reasonable

00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:28,880
that these things don't have like to not

00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:33,070
have an auto upgrade clause I think it's

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,070
better and it's and it's reasonable

00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:40,730
so I already said this sorry about that

00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:44,180
so obviously a lot of people don't like

00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,320
gplv3 I'm pretty much a fan of gplv3 I

00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:47,540
think it's I think it's got some

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,980
problems there was some lobbying during

00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:50,720
the drafting process and has a bunch of

00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:54,440
verbiage in it that doesn't need to be

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,360
there so I actually think it's okay I

00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,520
think it's a good idea to license your

00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:00,050
code GPL beat or later but as I was

00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,920
saying I certainly understand why you

00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:05,390
would license it under v2 only and it's

00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,340
really a kind of a question of how you

00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:10,100
feel about GPL v3 whether you want your

00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,870
code licensed under GPL v3 or not that's

00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,580
an individual decision I think that's a

00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:15,500
decision each individual developer

00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:17,060
should be making the problem we have in

00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:19,610
Linux right now is in most cases it's

00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,810
companies that hold your copyright that

00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,820
are making this decision so you don't

00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:24,170
get to make it for yourself your company

00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,630
gets to make it if they pay you to write

00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,560
code again as I mentioned tell your

00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,790
company you want to keep your own

00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,550
copyrights and make this decision

00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:34,310
yourself now I do want to point out that

00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:36,680
there are large contrary to popular

00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:38,570
belief there are large amounts of GPL v2

00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,880
or later code floating around in Linux

00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:43,040
so remember I said the effective license

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,700
was v2 only that's because once you add

00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:48,670
one line or maybe one lines not

00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:51,200
copyrightable but once you add like a

00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:53,120
substantial portion that's under GPL v2

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,740
only you kind of have to go to the

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,870
lowest common denominator license which

00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,080
is why Linux is licenses GPL

00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:01,760
to only but you could certainly find

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,770
parts of Linux that were you could

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,180
clearly show a code provenance that it

00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:07,400
was under GPL b2 or later and then you

00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:12,830
could use that under under GPL b3 if you

00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:14,420
wanted to so there's also lots of these

00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,910
additional permissions floating around

00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:20,200
the lowness code base this is the oldest

00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:23,360
one and perhaps the least understood one

00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,610
in part because Lena's wrote it when his

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,390
English was not as good as it is now and

00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:32,990
in part because it Wow there's lots of

00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:34,460
reasons problems with this but it does

00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:38,390
talk about this thing called a Cisco a

00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:39,679
system call and a system call tends to

00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:41,030
be another one of these know it when you

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,920
see it kind of things for Linux

00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:47,510
developers so I think it's a great

00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,700
example of what I was saying earlier

00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:51,080
about how technical analysis is really

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,210
important I mean this is ultimately a

00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,250
legal document here this is legally

00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,390
binding and lawyers have spent more time

00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,280
arguing about this believe it or not

00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,690
that even Linux developers have because

00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,640
lawyers are obsessed with this thing

00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,870
because you know I think NVIDIA believes

00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,250
that it means they can make every module

00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:07,370
proprietary because they believe

00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:11,030
everything is a syscall we don't agree

00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:13,070
with them of course but it's the

00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,420
technical folks that ultimately would

00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:17,179
decide this and just to give a little

00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:19,070
bit of flavor to this ultimately these

00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:22,040
kinds of questions are decided in courts

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:24,710
right courts like expert witnesses they

00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:27,080
like people who understand the field so

00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,610
if there is ever litigation over the

00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,590
question of what the cisco exception

00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:32,960
means or doesn't mean both sides will

00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:35,240
call people like you from the Linux

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,640
community to say I believe that was an

00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,440
assist call and here's why because no

00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,730
one would really think the one who's in

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,840
their right mind is a technical person

00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,890
would think that's a Cisco and then

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,360
somebody else would come in and say I

00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:46,340
absolutely believe it does this call and

00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:48,710
the court will decide which expert is

00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,270
right so you being an expert on this

00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:52,610
kind of stuff is really important to the

00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:54,320
future of Linux is licensed it comes

00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:55,730
down to if somebody's recently skilled

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,929
in the art what would they think is a

00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:02,260
normal system call so as we all know

00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:05,900
this calls are generally a way that

00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:09,299
stuff gets not in kernel space talks to

00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:12,130
a resource that's in kernel space

00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:14,200
the goal here we sort of have a general

00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,580
sense of what the goal was the goal was

00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,559
to say well you can write userspace code

00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,260
and it doesn't have to be GPL that was

00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:23,289
that was sort of the original intent so

00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:23,740
the thing is is that we just made that

00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:26,380
up

00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:29,080
there's no wearing cut not a copyright

00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:31,360
statute in the globe has a definition of

00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:35,409
syscall in it half of them don't have a

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,539
definition of software in it so the

00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:40,690
other thing is is that copyright law was

00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:42,820
designed as a way for people to make

00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:44,470
money from works right it was a way to

00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,970
restrict people from doing things and

00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:48,250
then you say oh you want to do that

00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:50,799
thing you want to modify that costs this

00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:52,990
much money you want to redistribute that

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,210
cost this much money it wasn't designed

00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:57,789
for what kopylov does copyleft was this

00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:59,980
innovative hack on copyright which means

00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:02,590
there's no discussion of what you should

00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:04,029
do if we say we don't want money in fact

00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,110
you couldn't buy off every Linux develop

00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:06,159
you're tried so you actually have to

00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,210
figure out whether your thing is the

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,339
syscall or not to see whether you have

00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,379
an exception because you can't just go

00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:13,929
pay everybody in linux to give you a

00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:15,159
different license none of these

00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:16,359
questions none of these kinds of

00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,220
questions everybody considered by any

00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:21,399
court in the world really there's a

00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:23,139
couple of cases in the u.s. there's an

00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:24,669
interesting case in the UK that kind of

00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:26,290
gets into this kind of stuff but it's

00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:27,879
it's all about proprietary stuff and

00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:29,200
it's in the end everybody settles and

00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:31,359
just picked somebody pay somebody some

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,220
money to get what they want and this is

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,169
again why you have so much power in this

00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,929
because what we think as experts as

00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:41,820
technical experts will decide what

00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:44,919
really happens in any kind of legal

00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:46,089
disagreement that comes up so I've

00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:48,369
obviously thought about this question a

00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:51,369
lot you know I've known about this is

00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:52,480
call exception since the late 90s at

00:34:51,369 --> 00:34:53,409
some point is when I first heard about

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,960
it

00:34:53,409 --> 00:35:00,339
and I recently did an analysis of GPIO

00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,619
because I was working with some of the

00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:04,030
embedded folks about this question of

00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:06,580
like oh does the cisco exception apply

00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:08,680
so I looked at the slash this way of

00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:11,290
talking to GPIO and I said okay is that

00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,760
a syscall right well it's weird right

00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:13,930
because it's not it's not a system call

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,140
like we would think like it's not like

00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,580
calling a c function but is it a success

00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,290
call

00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,430
I pretty much decided it was and one of

00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,950
the reasons that really convinced me is

00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:26,650
I found this in the documentation and it

00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:30,250
said oh now even though it says

00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:31,690
deprecated it's telling the user this is

00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:34,630
the way you talk to this system

00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:36,550
interface as user space and so that to

00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:38,530
me that feels like it should be a Cisco

00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:40,630
because it's like okay the developer

00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:42,940
said when you want when you're sitting a

00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:45,010
user space and you want to talk to my

00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,410
subsystem this is what you should do but

00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:49,900
it's deprecated so don't use it in fact

00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:53,110
what you should be using is this newer

00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,730
thing which I think is I've never said

00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,410
this out loud Lib GPIO D is that what

00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:59,530
it's called or as like I said it was Lib

00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:04,660
gpiod yeah but that sound cool

00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:05,860
look gpiod anyway so this is a I'm told

00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,410
by the event developers I'm not an

00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:11,470
embedded developer myself yet this is a

00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:14,110
better API for talking to GPIO and I

00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:15,910
looked at the code a little bit and it

00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:17,500
looked to me like it makes normal system

00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:19,090
calls and the way you would think so

00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,070
it's an interesting example of kind of

00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:24,880
layering copyleft because of course

00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:27,370
Linux is GPL with this call exception so

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,770
it means you can make proprietary works

00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:31,300
if you want but with the lid GPIO D

00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,520
developers said is what we actually want

00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,530
to copy left that too but we only wanna

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,930
make it a weak copy left because we want

00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:39,580
the works that use the library to be

00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:41,170
proprietary if people want but we want

00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:44,260
changes to the library to have to be

00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:45,970
under copy left so I think it's really

00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,270
an interesting way to approach that

00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:50,800
problem so I I didn't do a full

00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:52,990
derivative work analysis I didn't like

00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,390
look at the various different programs

00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,620
that use Lib GPIO D and figure out

00:36:55,390 --> 00:37:02,050
whether they were really derivative

00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:03,460
works or not but I think that if if I

00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,320
would be pretty flabbergasted somebody

00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:08,560
did that analysis and said oh no no it

00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:10,300
turns out yeah any program the the gplv2

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,250
all the way from linux goes all the way

00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,870
up into user space through through

00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:17,050
through you know through the GPIO

00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:18,700
subsystem I'd be surprised if a court

00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:20,560
came to that conclusion now courts have

00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,750
surprised us all sorts of times with

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,050
really crazy decisions so it could

00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:27,100
happen so I didn't want to speed up a

00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,080
little bit so I can leave some time for

00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,090
questions I want to talk a little bit

00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,730
about this

00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:34,770
licensed thing because this is kind of

00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:37,050
unique to Lin and dual licensing isn't

00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:39,890
unique to Linux but this dual licensing

00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:42,120
of various parts of Linux with BSD is

00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:44,010
maybe after the talk somebody can

00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,080
educate me why this tradition tradition

00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,160
started I have a good sense but wait

00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:49,440
Keith you started it

00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,420
no you got rid of it Keith got rid of it

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,350
Keith didn't start it but I'd like to

00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:57,180
know where it started but I'm guessing

00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,800
it was ostensibly for code sharing with

00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,190
BSD I mean that was sort of I guess the

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,450
initial idea that would happen but the

00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,830
interesting thing that's happened with

00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,950
it and I think I think it's great the

00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:10,550
keeps trying to end it is I think that

00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:12,630
it's really been exploited by companies

00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:15,300
one of the ways that's been exploited by

00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:17,190
companies is in Qualcomm is really kind

00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,230
of the the worst on this regard is they

00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:21,720
discovered that there are certain types

00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:25,320
of implicit patent licenses under GPL B

00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:28,440
2 and they said wait a second if Linux

00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,670
upstream will take BSD code BSD license

00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,630
code because it's compatible with GB

00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,240
also can go upstream

00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:36,090
but when Qualcomm upstream something

00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,410
under BSD they are not granting the

00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,850
implicit patent license under GPL

00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:41,150
because they've been released it under

00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:43,770
GPL they released that under BSD and

00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:45,510
early on Qualcomm figured this out was

00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:47,310
like oh we want to upstream things in

00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:49,440
BSD because then we don't then we can

00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:51,420
later argue we never gave you a patent

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,890
license under GPL v2 s implicit patent

00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,870
license so I think you should stop

00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:56,130
taking like this is this good part

00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:57,540
skating a quarter-mile BAM I think you

00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:02,850
just stop taking upstream stuff that's

00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:04,350
not under GPL v2 but the other thing is

00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,610
that there are companies out there that

00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:07,170
could not qualcomm in this case the

00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:09,210
other companies i won't mention they

00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:11,580
think they somehow get around copyleft

00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:13,860
themselves by only ever contributing

00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,750
upstream under BSD that somehow they're

00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:18,060
not bound by Linux is caught Linux is

00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:20,790
copyleft in some way and I've heard this

00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:22,890
argument made and kind of you know bat

00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:24,720
young back smoke-filled rooms of lawyers

00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:26,400
and so if those are the two reasons why

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,260
I'm not a fan of this still licensed

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,510
thing I mean I get you want to be

00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,370
friendly the DST people I mean why

00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:35,250
anybody can be friendly to Theo de Raadt

00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,210
anymore I don't know but it's a nice

00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,620
thing to want to be friendly to people

00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:39,180
even that aren't friendly with you but I

00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:41,609
don't think it's worth it I think it's

00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:43,349
not good for the

00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:46,289
left on linux to continue with the whole

00:39:43,349 --> 00:39:47,640
new licensing thing so I've left a very

00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:49,619
brief time to talk about proprietary

00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,999
kernel modules cuz I suspect that's when

00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:52,140
people have questions they'll want to

00:39:50,999 --> 00:39:56,400
ask about

00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:58,589
so I don't know what courts are gonna

00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,720
say about proprietary kernel modules I

00:39:58,589 --> 00:40:04,319
know with somebody who's worked in

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:07,619
software and as an amateur copyright you

00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:10,440
know expert non lawyer for years I have

00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:13,970
never seen a proprietary kernel module

00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:16,710
that in my like honest academic approach

00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:19,640
did not look like a derivative work of

00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:22,019
Linux as a whole I've never seen it

00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:24,569
there is arguments about export symbol

00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:25,890
GPL and export symbol if you look back

00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:28,259
in the history of that it's very clear

00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,849
that was advisory only and I don't think

00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,529
it makes a big difference I think I

00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:33,660
think it's better to put expert symbol

00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:35,069
GPL because you've put people on more

00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,720
notice than there would be otherwise so

00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:38,460
I think you should put export symbol GPL

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,289
on your symbols but I whether it's

00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,059
export symbol or export symbol GPL I

00:40:40,289 --> 00:40:43,499
think I'm a FRA eternal module at least

00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:47,849
everyone I've ever seen in the real

00:40:43,499 --> 00:40:49,619
world has created you know triggered

00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:52,200
that the modification slash derivative

00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:55,200
work standards and the copyright regimes

00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:57,329
that I'm familiar with obviously we know

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,829
of companies that have spent at this

00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:01,650
point decades getting away

00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:03,660
with violating the GPL in this regard it

00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:05,609
is not an easy task to enforce the GPL

00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:07,140
we do a lot of work I'm not gonna say

00:41:05,609 --> 00:41:09,089
too much about kind of strategy about

00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,829
that because I had a habit of like

00:41:09,089 --> 00:41:11,940
talking about strategies publicly and

00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:13,559
then companies heard about them and

00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,029
developed counter strategies before we

00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:16,859
implemented our strategies so I'm a

00:41:15,029 --> 00:41:18,089
little less a little more guarded than I

00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:19,829
used to be about that sort of stuff but

00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:20,819
I'm happy to talk offline with people if

00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:23,220
they want to hear more about what

00:41:20,819 --> 00:41:25,980
conservancies doing on this Conservancy

00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:28,259
is the only like organized group of

00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:30,599
people doing enforcement of the GPL for

00:41:28,259 --> 00:41:32,549
Linux right now the others who have done

00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:33,809
it in the past are no longer doing it

00:41:32,549 --> 00:41:37,109
generally speaking because they moved on

00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:38,640
to other projects where it I I know you

00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:40,710
didn't elect us and maybe you weren't

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,970
happy with us doing it but if you want

00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:44,400
it done at all we're the only game in

00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:46,859
town we'd love of other people wanted to

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,630
do it independently at least not in the

00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:51,480
Patrick Carney sense but in the how I

00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:52,799
felt a sense but but at this point

00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,869
nobody has time or inclination because

00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:56,369
it's hard and painful and expensive work

00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:59,969
to do

00:41:56,369 --> 00:42:02,849
so I want to just end with this

00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:05,829
licensing analysis is very complicated

00:42:02,849 --> 00:42:07,029
but like I said earlier on it's only

00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:08,799
complicated when you want to do

00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:10,269
something proprietary if what if you're

00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:12,299
doing all your development in the open

00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:15,009
you're doing everything upstream first

00:42:12,299 --> 00:42:18,160
the licensing details of linux are just

00:42:15,009 --> 00:42:19,660
not that complicated if you have a rule

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,099
where you just release everything under

00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,079
your favorite GPL compatible license

00:42:21,099 --> 00:42:25,209
even if it's BSD your Qualcomm and you

00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:27,969
only released under BSD at least it's

00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:29,650
all being done in the open and so you

00:42:27,969 --> 00:42:31,809
don't get compliance problems if you're

00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:33,190
doing all your work upstream and there

00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:34,630
are lots of technical reasons that you

00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,739
all make all the time quite correctly

00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:38,559
that people should just be working

00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:39,489
upstream so it solves the licensing

00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,019
problems it solves the technical

00:42:39,489 --> 00:42:43,329
problems why not just everybody do that

00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:45,670
and encourage your employer's to do it

00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:46,989
as well with that I have seven minutes

00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:50,579
according to my counter I have four

00:42:46,989 --> 00:42:50,579
questions thank you

00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:58,029
he's got a mic so I'm not gonna pick

00:42:56,529 --> 00:43:05,170
people up I'll let him pick people with

00:42:58,029 --> 00:43:06,910
a mic just a question I have an opinion

00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:12,660
well let you do your opinions are

00:43:06,910 --> 00:43:15,759
important but the Cisco normal Cisco

00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,979
statement have you like thought about

00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:20,170
that in terms of the IOC TLS is cold

00:43:17,979 --> 00:43:22,329
which is not really normal it's like

00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:24,640
it's a conduit for whatever the hell you

00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:26,440
want and I get this sort of normal in

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,059
the sense of it's open readwrite their

00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,309
normal is something I create

00:43:28,059 --> 00:43:33,069
specifically to run a binary in user

00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:36,880
space using a normal Cisco if I create

00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:38,619
that API just for that I mean people I

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,969
don't I don't know much about what's

00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:41,680
being done because I'm not an upstream

00:43:39,969 --> 00:43:43,749
Linux developer but I've been told

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,999
situations where you can like hack high

00:43:43,749 --> 00:43:47,339
October like ship a binary firmware into

00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:51,519
Linux right

00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:53,469
and I I can't imagine a court looking

00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:54,609
that and saying I mean it could happen

00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:56,499
right I mean court could say oh yeah

00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:58,029
your system ioctl is the system call

00:43:56,499 --> 00:44:01,930
right so there and they use the system

00:43:58,029 --> 00:44:03,339
call but when the courts I've only been

00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:06,349
we've only been in front of judges a few

00:44:03,339 --> 00:44:08,419
time with GPL violations and

00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:09,589
my experience sitting of course they are

00:44:08,419 --> 00:44:11,329
the lawyers are there arguing I'm just

00:44:09,589 --> 00:44:13,219
I'm just representing the plaintiff you

00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:14,630
know solver freedom Conservancy but

00:44:13,219 --> 00:44:17,329
sitting in the gallery and listening to

00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:19,400
the judges judges don't like when people

00:44:17,329 --> 00:44:21,229
play games I think one of the weirdest

00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,809
thing that's happened with the GPL is

00:44:21,229 --> 00:44:26,089
you have this weird marrying of the you

00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:28,519
know kind of the you know the playful

00:44:26,089 --> 00:44:30,349
hacker nish hacker ish sense that the

00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:32,179
the geeks have you know they're like oh

00:44:30,349 --> 00:44:33,619
I know how to hack around this problem I

00:44:32,179 --> 00:44:37,130
can do this really complicated thing and

00:44:33,619 --> 00:44:38,359
then lawyers who are just thrilled at

00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:39,589
having something interesting to you

00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:41,479
because most of what lawyers do all day

00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:42,650
is like read boring documents but this

00:44:41,479 --> 00:44:44,089
stuff is gonna kind of cool and they're

00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,249
like well let's sit down to create a

00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:48,380
weird complicated system to circumvent

00:44:46,249 --> 00:44:49,699
the GPL and we'll totally come as a

00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,259
judge of this cuz I can't wait to argue

00:44:49,699 --> 00:44:53,689
this in front of a judge but judges are

00:44:51,259 --> 00:44:54,859
like are you kidding me like did you

00:44:53,689 --> 00:44:56,449
know you were supposed to release all

00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:59,809
the source code to everything yes your

00:44:56,449 --> 00:45:00,859
honor and and you did this so that you

00:44:59,809 --> 00:45:02,179
wouldn't have to the source code of that

00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:03,859
weird thing you sent for the I outfit

00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:05,959
right well well yes your honor I can

00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:07,969
totally imagine judge saying get out of

00:45:05,959 --> 00:45:09,439
my court release the thing or stop using

00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:10,880
Linux whatever you want them this is

00:45:09,439 --> 00:45:12,409
totally silly now we could go the other

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,719
way right somebody could be hard notice

00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:16,339
and say octal is a cisco but one other

00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:17,900
thing I want to mention notice that I

00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:20,809
said the effective license of all of

00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:22,789
Linux is GPL v2 only there is code in

00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:25,279
Linux that does not have the syscall

00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:26,630
exception on it end of statement there

00:45:25,279 --> 00:45:28,999
is code that's been brought from other

00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:30,799
GPL projects and put in Linux so the

00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:33,739
entire license of Linux is not with the

00:45:30,799 --> 00:45:34,999
cisco exception so even if you're

00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:36,619
relying on the cisco exception the

00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:38,449
question will then become well was there

00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:40,189
code that was part of your build that

00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:42,349
came from one of the things that was not

00:45:40,189 --> 00:45:44,299
included in cisco exception so that'll

00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:46,729
be a fight to so I think in both sides

00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:48,079
of it I'm I I think the I octal thing is

00:45:46,729 --> 00:45:49,640
something we should deal with and I

00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:51,499
think the best thing to do right now is

00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,669
just refuse to work with companies that

00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:54,619
are trying to do these kind of goofy

00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:56,839
tricks don't take it upstream don't

00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:57,919
support their features upstream and tell

00:45:56,839 --> 00:45:59,299
them to go away and leave the community

00:45:57,919 --> 00:46:00,709
until they become serious upstream

00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:02,390
developers that's what you can all do

00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:04,069
now about that problem and in the long

00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:05,719
term I think the courts will figure it

00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:06,890
out but courts take decades to figure

00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:09,559
out things that we can figure out in

00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:12,249
five minutes okay I think we've got time

00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:12,249
for one more question

00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:26,219
so the question of how sort of

00:46:23,759 --> 00:46:29,039
far-reaching the GPL licenses was a

00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:31,919
question in my current at my current

00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:34,439
company and the question was essentially

00:46:31,919 --> 00:46:37,169
like if we do if what we write does fall

00:46:34,439 --> 00:46:39,239
under the GPL license how are we

00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:42,119
supposed to make it available is there a

00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:45,630
level of sort of compliance that we have

00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:48,059
to exhibit or could I just take whatever

00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:50,369
I've written that proprietary put it on

00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:52,949
303 about three and a half inch discs

00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:56,369
and ship that in a crate to you for

00:46:52,949 --> 00:46:58,380
example so so as far as your three in

00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:59,939
half-inch this question the the phrase

00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:03,179
medium customary for software

00:46:59,939 --> 00:47:04,169
interchange appears in the GPL I don't

00:47:03,179 --> 00:47:05,519
know if three and a half inch discs

00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:06,989
would it won't any longer be considered

00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,630
a medium customary for software

00:47:06,989 --> 00:47:13,199
interchange anymore so so that probably

00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:14,489
wouldn't work I think I think the the

00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,249
most important thing to do is is

00:47:14,489 --> 00:47:18,839
whatever you need source code wise and

00:47:17,249 --> 00:47:21,449
build script wise to make the software

00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:23,939
build and install that's what the GPL

00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:26,130
means to include so if somebody can

00:47:23,939 --> 00:47:28,349
download your source release who bought
