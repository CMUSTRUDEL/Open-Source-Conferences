Title: "Fonts and Math" - Jussi Pakkanen (LCA 2020)
Publication date: 2020-01-14
Playlist: linux.conf.au 2020
Description: 
	Jussi Pakkanen

https://lca2020.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/231/

Font design is seen as a purely artistic and aesthetic pursuit. In this
talk we shall examine some ways to do the same with mathematics. Things we
can expect to be talked about include nib pens, Donald Knuth, railroad
tracks (yes) and possibly even differential equations. Not advanced math
knowledge is needed to participate, though. This talk is almost guaranteed
to provide no answers, but hopefully it will intrigue the audience's minds
so that they will start coming upwith their own questions.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

I hope you're all well fed first up this

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,970
is the creative arts mini con and first

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,330
up we have you see giving a presentation

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:16,139
about fonts and math this is a talk that

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,650
I think he volunteered for two days ago

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,660
one day ago because our original speaker

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,039
in this time slot unfortunately has

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:33,230
taken ill and couldn't attend the

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:37,410
conference at all so um thank you right

00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:39,600
good evening welcome some four warnings

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,000
which already might have heard that I

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,300
did find out of doing this about to 24

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,460
hours ago I spent the entire weekend

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,230
traveling from Finland to here so I was

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,670
on a plane where I didn't sleep much and

00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,829
also the Wi-Fi was broken so I couldn't

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,180
do background research it's so this

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,280
position is hopefully going to be

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,670
interesting at least in some way to you

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,799
we have perhaps not to me anyway even

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,680
more I have actually never done phone

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,540
design yeah you know so a lot of it only

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,070
first like deublin other people here who

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:16,500
have done what font design anyway um

00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:18,119
okay so I'm good okay so if so if I get

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,680
some of the terminology or like things

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,450
that actual font design is still wrong

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,790
it's just because I don't know what they

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:27,060
actually are so but but please please be

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,610
covering if this thing's wrong so the

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,829
way you do fonts the basic approach is

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:36,270
that you have an idea of the kind of

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:38,100
thing that you want to do and then you

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,930
start a font Forge or some other tools

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,180
and then you draw the letters one by one

00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:47,040
where you have the outline and then you

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:49,290
draw it using Bezier curves and then you

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,570
do that for all letters so 26 lowercase

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,369
letters 26 uppercase letters and then

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,899
you have the accident versions and the

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:57,810
numbers you know and all the special

00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,750
characters and so on and it takes a fair

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,520
bit of time and then you keep improving

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,020
that intuitively until you're satisfied

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,610
with the result and then you release

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,259
that this is a fairly straightforward

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,810
approach to doing things but there are

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:16,550
some lightness severe downsides

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:20,450
one of the the biggest things is there's

00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,860
lots of manual work in the in the olden

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,960
days when you had to do forms hinting

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,030
that was even more tedious but just

00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:29,840
doing all the outlines is a lot of work

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:32,390
and and and each letter is its own

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,640
unique snowflake so you have to do all

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:41,150
the things in advance and and for that

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:44,000
too specific sorry and it's quite easy

00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,530
to get like little things wrong when you

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,720
draw all the letters then you look and

00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,550
say okay so this one appears to be a bit

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,260
thicker than the other ones so you now

00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,120
have to do and manual to fix it so it

00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,709
looks the same as all the others another

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,350
I do this this one actually looks a bit

00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:00,770
off and so on and it it takes a lot of

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:02,090
work if you want to do different weights

00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,110
for your phones you have to do this

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:07,370
again for every single one of them

00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,230
pretty much from scratch because it's

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,870
it's not easy to just say something

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,300
there are some techniques like multiple

00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:18,170
master phones which are an Adobe thing I

00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,730
think when you draw a very very thin one

00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,540
and a very thick one version of the

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,950
letter and then you just it somehow

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:29,840
calculates the the average between the

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:31,880
two and it's it's actually quite hard

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,459
because they're like if you have lots of

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,390
letters they have parts that repeat but

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:37,370
they are slightly different

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,280
like like you have the balls in the P

00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,500
and so on and it's actually quite hard

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,630
to make sure that they are all in the

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,459
same way like have the same ratio of

00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,459
width to height and the thicknesses and

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:52,850
so on and little errors that like these

00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:54,950
keep keep cropping up so are there other

00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:58,160
ways of doing fonts and it turns out

00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,780
that there are this is the original one

00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:05,209
which is called better font which was

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:08,000
created by Donald couth in 1977 I think

00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:11,450
it was May 1977 so it's the same time as

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,790
the original Star Wars and this predates

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:17,900
all of the fonts phone systems in use

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:19,669
today and the the landscape for computer

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,530
fonts at the time was that there isn't a

00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:22,910
landscape so people were doing some

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,099
things and they were quite typesetting

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,230
machines and so on but it there wasn't

00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:31,670
really like a general pool of no

00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:35,480
to pull from and the operating idea that

00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:37,790
that he had was that you can draw

00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,640
computer fonts in the same way that you

00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:43,010
draw phones using a pen and nib so if

00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:47,030
you nimac the the way the person would

00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:50,540
draw with by hand you can then create

00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:53,600
ones line with this and each letter

00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,880
consists of multiple one or more strokes

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,310
and you are done with a specific kind of

00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,990
nib which maybe this means the shape of

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,080
the pen that you are using to draw this

00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:06,230
comes from calligraphy as well as a term

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,590
and then you define the properties of

00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:12,200
those strokes and the nibs

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:14,720
mathematically and not not like a visual

00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,000
thing but in specific mathematical terms

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,250
and then you can use that information

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,550
generate the actual letters so DL it

00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,410
roughly looks like this you have a

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:31,160
stroke and it says at the top of the

00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:32,630
stroke is at some height and then at

00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,880
some point some other point it's

00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:36,920
somewhere in the thing this at this

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,400
point the stroke needs to be going at

00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,410
this angle so 45 degrees down usually

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,060
like vertical and or horizontal at

00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,270
specific points to get the shape that

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:50,390
you want and so on and so on and define

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:54,650
all the things and then you what you get

00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:58,040
is a set of linear equations for for how

00:05:54,650 --> 00:06:00,290
the outline has to look like and then

00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:04,610
you solve that and then you get a

00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:08,390
describe like a specific description of

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:09,980
how the leadership work and this the

00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,900
first part is done by the human and then

00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,300
it just handed out to the machine

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:20,000
solving system which does all the actual

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:23,330
work here's an example of how it would

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,120
look like so this is a typical part of

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,850
the letter a gun in a color graphic

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,920
style so you have started at top um they

00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:32,720
go at the bottom and then the way you

00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,420
would define this letter it's roughly is

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,670
that it started the like a very leftmost

00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,370
thing of this stroke is that the

00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,240
vertical line

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:45,190
the most the highest point is at the

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,380
horizontal line the top at the bottom it

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,980
it hits the bottom line and then at the

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,510
end it goes like this and then what the

00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:54,340
system would do is that it was like okay

00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,500
so I would have to start from there and

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,620
there then they would need to be some

00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:05,980
sort of stroke of sometime to get down

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:08,290
here and then get this part and then

00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,960
when you do this if you define your your

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:14,590
graphics in this way you get interesting

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:16,540
things for free for example you can

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,520
change the width of the letter and the

00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:22,150
stroke of the letter individually so

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,520
typically if you have have this thing if

00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,950
you if you want to make it narrower what

00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,050
happens if is that the letter also gets

00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:32,710
thinner because everything just gets

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:35,320
closer together but if you do it like

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,570
this then you just moved there one of

00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,060
the constraints closer the other one and

00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:43,120
then the system will calculate okay so

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:45,430
what would the stroke be like in this

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,860
case so that it still satisfies all the

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:50,140
things that you require so I'm going to

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:54,130
show you an example half the work I have

00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:58,620
here a a calligraphy simulator which you

00:07:54,130 --> 00:08:01,750
can do at home it consists of two pens

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:06,090
and you hold them like this and now you

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:10,770
have a nib so if you do later like this

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:13,780
it would go something like this

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:15,760
but if you want to make it narrower then

00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:20,260
what you can do is it would do something

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:22,870
like this and from here you can tell

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:26,140
that that the change going from wider to

00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,550
narrower one it's not just squishing

00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,470
everything together it's at the the

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,440
whole shape of the letter changes

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:35,350
because these it's defined by these

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,030
points and then we need to squish them

00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,620
together and then the system solves a

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,270
new one then you get the different kind

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,330
of results and then you can do these

00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:45,250
fine tunings and you can change the

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,690
width of the letter but still have the

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,000
same stroke and if you want to make a

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,190
bold version of that you just separate

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,560
the pens out more and then you do the

00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,090
same stroke and you get one

00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:11,040
but he's exactly the same width and

00:08:55,090 --> 00:09:14,710
height so this is kind of nice right

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,350
okay and you can do things like you can

00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,620
do an italic version where you just

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:22,600
slant the control points now if you if

00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,760
you just do the slanting on a regular

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,200
font it gets even even thinner and it

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,380
looks really bad

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,540
but if you just like do the tilting on

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,910
the control points and then do the

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:36,130
stroke again you get again the same

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:37,810
width and you can change fine-tune the

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,790
angle at which your it's hallux sloped

00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:44,970
by just changing one parameter and it

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,970
will recalculate recalculate everything

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:52,120
so then we have the next problem so we

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:54,340
have we can define these points where

00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,900
which are defined but in terms of these

00:09:54,340 --> 00:10:00,400
these restrictions but you have it's

00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,740
called a skeleton like the the middle

00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,160
line of the stroke so you need so how

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:10,480
should it go from one point to another

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,460
what should be like and for this I need

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,260
a volunteer from the audience for a

00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:20,440
small drawing simple and and our Chazz

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:24,040
has agreed to be be they be the

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:27,070
volunteer so here are being volunteered

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,910
yes so here we have a set of points one

00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:34,810
two three four five and six and your

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:37,300
task is to draw a line it starts from

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:42,070
here and here and go through all the

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:46,650
points and in your view is aesthetic in

00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:46,650
some way and now rehearsal

00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:07,829
but do I pass yes all right thank you so

00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:14,639
how many here would have drawn roughly

00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:17,430
the same thing okay okay so the so we

00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:21,779
can learn from this is that human beings

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:24,120
consider like the soft sloping curves

00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:25,680
pleasant to the eye and if you have

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,070
sharp edges or something like that it's

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,630
usually not so so what you want to do is

00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,540
that if you have some sort of mechanism

00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:36,120
given that you have these points to get

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,100
a path that goes through them and looks

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,769
pleasing to the eye then you can use

00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:45,600
that as the basis of forming your fonts

00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:49,680
and this is also also in meta phones and

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:53,490
this was named by Donald Knuth as the

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,160
most pleasing curve and this is a

00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:58,050
mathematical description of it given

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,120
that we have these points what would be

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,480
the the most pleasing curve that would

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,760
go through them and then but Donald

00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:09,329
Knuth was a mathematician and and then

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,940
he he has a method like the way

00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:14,069
mathematician works is that a say okay

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,529
this probably doesn't exist God you

00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:17,880
cannot say that something any curve that

00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,010
you draw through these points would be

00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,990
the most pleasing across all people in

00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:25,470
the world so it probably doesn't exist

00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:30,209
and and it in fact cannot exists but if

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:33,180
it did what properties would it have

00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:36,839
like this is mathematical thinking 101

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,100
here pretty much the thing and and it

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,079
seems a bit strained but actually this

00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,269
kind of makes sense because when you

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,550
start actually going through the the the

00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:46,319
requirements and thing things about it

00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:49,139
you find out things that you really

00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:52,829
didn't consider before so so he

00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:55,230
postulated a set of requirements that a

00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:59,880
most pleasing curve should fulfill if it

00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,949
exists and the basic ones okay scale

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,260
invariant rotation invariant translation

00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:09,839
invariant mirror invariant probably as

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:12,870
well and derivatives of the function or

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:17,730
the curve should be continuous up to

00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:19,830
level something like maybe two second

00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,450
derivative maybe third one I don't

00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:22,860
actually know that the actual number but

00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,580
but they should be continuous because

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:28,740
that's how you get smooth curves and

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,529
this was an interesting observation so

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,960
if you have points the considered points

00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:36,810
that are on a circle arc then the most

00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:42,450
pleasing curve should be the circle that

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:44,730
goes through those points and and this

00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:47,040
is the again a mathematician speaking so

00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,339
it if you have a most pleasing curve

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,770
defined by some points if you add one

00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:55,440
point to the set of points which is on

00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:57,839
the curve itself there and then you

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,270
recompute the most pleasing curve for

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,360
those points it should be identical to

00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:05,190
the one you did without the extra points

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,260
because like yet make sense because

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:11,450
there's no extra constraints there but

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:13,740
turns out these are impossible to

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:16,710
satisfy all of them at the same time and

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,920
they're all proof that these are in

00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:20,670
Donuts papers and much like the art of

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,260
computer programming

00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,480
I haven't actually made it but I'm told

00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:30,480
that exist and I'm completely happy with

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,860
that but these are all of this are

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,200
impossible to say so at the same time so

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:37,830
like do doing the things that you have

00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:42,180
and then I think they were like two or

00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:45,000
three PhD thesis made out like just on

00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:48,209
this problem alone or like related to

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,980
Texan and meta phones and the algorithm

00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:51,540
that they then came up with and it is

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,540
the one that meta phone use is roughly

00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:57,120
goes like this take three consecutive

00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:00,720
points of on on the of the list of

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,339
points that you have and you fit a

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,320
circle on three points because that's

00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,600
given three points you can always be the

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,040
circle and the solution is unique if

00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,300
there are a straight-line segment just

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,630
let's pretend that they are not our

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:15,750
state line segment and the most pleasing

00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:18,779
curve has the same direction and value

00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:22,950
in in the pot in the middle point as the

00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:25,020
circle has that goes through it so this

00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:27,120
has better looked at two an example so

00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:30,660
we have three points

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,720
three of of many and then we fit a

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,780
circle that goes through them and then

00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,360
the point at the top what we know that

00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:43,310
that at that point the curve should have

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,110
the same direction and and the same

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:48,810
curvature as the circle that's in that

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:51,200
point and then once you have that you

00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:54,870
get rid of the circle and then you get

00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,670
points and directions which are

00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,590
constraints for the most pleasing codes

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:02,340
you want to draw and then the actual

00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:05,130
task of drawing the graph from that is

00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:08,850
very complicated like the the formulas

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:13,920
are about this long but this is roughly

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:17,010
how it works if you look it up in actual

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,200
use the only real font that that ever

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:21,450
was done with metal phones in like

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:23,220
proper phones was computer modern there

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,520
were some some minor other phones but

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,900
they never took hold and does anyone

00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:32,250
know everyone know here what computer

00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:34,860
modern is used for okay so so if you

00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:36,810
ever do a document with latex or plain

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,060
tech by default it uses the computer

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:42,330
modern phones and if you ever read a

00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:45,630
document or a scientific article then

00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:48,110
it's most likely written with with with

00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:51,980
tech and to use the meta phones phones

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:53,970
and one family is called computer modern

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,490
the interesting thing about which

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,590
usually is not spoken of is that

00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:02,220
computer modern does not behave in the

00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:05,550
way I just described because it turned

00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,410
out that the need based approach or like

00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,320
the calligrapher phased approach is not

00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,730
as flexible as it would imagine so

00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,100
instead what they do is that they

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,079
parameterize the outline of the font and

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:20,550
then they feel done in which is kind of

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:22,650
similar to how regular fonts work but

00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,300
the parameter station still stands so

00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,730
absolutely everything about these phones

00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:31,160
is parameterised you have the x height

00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:33,930
and the aldehydes stroke with this lens

00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,150
but even the fact whether your character

00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:37,890
has serif or not is a parameter and you

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,510
can say that you can set the size of

00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,280
your saris by tightening

00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:45,480
the perimeter so if you actually look up

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,940
the meta font files that you find on a

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,770
regular Linux distribution all of the

00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,470
letters are defined so that you have a

00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:53,880
letter C in some font and then it just

00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,430
sets up a bunch of parameters with

00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,710
macros then it includes a different

00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,500
function which has the underlying letter

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:04,110
C or L or s or whatever so all letters

00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,700
offer a certain type in a computer model

00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,620
across all of the computer modern

00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,300
families come from the same function

00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,630
it's just instantiated with different

00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:15,390
parameters so here's an example the

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,220
letter M both of these come from the

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:21,150
same definition it's just that the one

00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:23,850
on the left has a bigger number in the

00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:27,510
the seraphs and antacid parameters like

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:30,480
do the rounding at when the two lines

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,250
join and so on and this actually like

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,660
once you know this and you start looking

00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,670
at the letters you can you can easily

00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,530
tell that this is the case but if you

00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,300
don't know this and it's just like they

00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,310
work together and they're kind of

00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:47,300
similar but you don't know why but now

00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:50,610
you know metafile never really took on

00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:52,860
because the computer Modern Family has

00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,410
60 parameters and you can change them

00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,690
and and you changed one of them and then

00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,520
you run all of the recent generation

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,070
things and it's a batch processing

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,810
system basically and then you get your

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:05,880
results and then it's like both now it

00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:08,310
looks different or not and and you

00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,910
really need to be a programmer to be to

00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:13,710
get the most out of it and for this

00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:16,590
reason it never really took on which is

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:19,200
kind of appealing it would be kind of

00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,300
fun if someone were to like try to do it

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,400
again from like maybe like a graphical

00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,650
user interface where you have live live

00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,690
updates and so on so you could have a

00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:31,680
different kind of thing for font design

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:35,790
but but for now it's it doesn't it's not

00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:39,410
really used ok but let's do an

00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:43,800
intermission so here are two for puzzles

00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:47,040
suppose you have this so you have a a

00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,780
piece of metal the bar here that's

00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,790
affixed to a wall and it has a weight

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,550
hanging from the end

00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:58,440
and you can add this when it's like this

00:19:53,550 --> 00:20:00,030
the it's perfectly straight so so if you

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,940
take away the weight it will curl into

00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:05,100
some sort of other form in so what's

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,790
what's the form that it's going to take

00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,770
once you cut the string and if you are

00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:12,840
if you prefer the differential equation

00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:14,970
solution version of the problem and that

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,740
men who woman less doesn't the prop the

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,690
same problem is that it what is the

00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,970
shape of the curve whose curvature at

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:25,350
every point is equal to the arc length

00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:28,550
up to that point as you know I'll let

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,550
you think about it have a sip of water

00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,840
okay I'm sure you all have the problem

00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,050
so let's hope so it's all worked out so

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,930
it's on next one connecting railroad

00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:45,870
tracks this is an interesting challenge

00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,640
so railroad tracks consists basically of

00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,080
two parts you have the straight segments

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,040
where you go from one place to another

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:56,520
and then there are circular segments but

00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,560
for turning this train around but the

00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,480
thing is that you cannot have a straight

00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,130
line segments and a circular segment and

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,480
since put them together because what

00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:06,170
happens is that you have a discontinuity

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,030
in the first derivative and this causes

00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:11,310
wear and tear on the track and also it

00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:14,400
causes like rough right and feels

00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:16,920
unpleasant so the problem then is is

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,920
that how should you join a straight line

00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:23,190
segment to a part of a like a arc of a

00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,190
circle in in the optimal way so you have

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:27,450
have very smooth experience now we we

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,580
assume that they're on the same height

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,310
which is called the elevation and and

00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,500
that you can ignore banking which is

00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:38,160
called an I kid you not

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:41,430
superelevation but this is the problem

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:46,830
so how you do and this was I think sold

00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:48,450
in the 1800's or late 1800s and and as

00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,310
I'm sure you all worked out in your

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:53,700
heads both of these problems have the

00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:55,800
same solution it's exactly the same it's

00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,520
it's actually this one so this is called

00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:02,530
the Euler oh I don't

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:07,309
boiler sorry thank you Oilers pilot

00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:09,080
so if you there in the middle right the

00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:11,809
point of symmetry is that's the origin

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:15,440
and then you go from there upwards and

00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:17,630
if you were to cut the spiral at any

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,970
point and have a weight attached at that

00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:24,200
point then it would hang out completely

00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:27,770
straight and if you wanted to join a a

00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,150
circle thing which with the straight

00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,830
line segment series that put a straight

00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:33,260
light blue segment beginning and then

00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:35,020
you find where they the slope is the

00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:38,120
same that's the circle and they just

00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:40,549
catch that there and these this is the

00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,299
solution that's this is this has been

00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:47,360
actually come up like tens of times

00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:50,450
various times in the pulse of mass for

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,880
things and they say it's kind of like a

00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:55,179
beautiful thing on its own as well you

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,580
could have a like a art moti with there

00:22:55,179 --> 00:23:02,450
anyway this is the approach that was

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:06,530
taken by Raph Levien it's called the

00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:09,460
Spiro so if you have two points and the

00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:12,590
angle of the derivative at that point

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:15,110
then what you can do is that you form a

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:18,679
path by finding a part of the Euler

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:20,660
curve which fits those requirements and

00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:23,690
then you just don't use that adjoint and

00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:27,169
this is optimally smooth for so that

00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:29,299
some definition of optimality and this

00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:30,650
turns out it has interesting properties

00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:31,940
which are interesting for the

00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,130
implementation it's really fast to

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:37,669
compute you can get exact solutions out

00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:42,919
of that and it's easy to have Bezier

00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:46,340
that that that's so that's do the same

00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:49,880
thing so it's very easily approximate

00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,260
able with Bezier and the resulting

00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,070
course are very smooth and a very

00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:57,500
pleasant and this is available today or

00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,059
has been for several years actually in

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,000
front porch and is also available in

00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:04,100
Inkscape and there's even a C library

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,280
called Lib spiral which you can use in

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:10,040
your own applications and if you want to

00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,380
know more about this then Raph Levien

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,140
has a PhD theses where he goes through

00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,140
the design and it's as far as PhD

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,460
physical it's really

00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,990
readable and it's really interesting so

00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:26,160
every well-written and I highly

00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:28,200
recommend it ok and the last thing what

00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,870
you can also do is that you can think of

00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:34,020
font design as a constraint normally a

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:36,030
contract optimization problem this is a

00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,220
thing that I've tied it on my own

00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:40,280
Nestea I wrote a blog post about it you

00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:44,520
can go there for all the gory details

00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:46,470
and then but the approach is is again

00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:50,160
fairly simple to explain but the path

00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:53,550
gets a bit tricky so you have a path

00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:55,200
which is just Bezier segments one or the

00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,790
other and you have the point and you

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,070
have the control points and they are the

00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:01,710
free variables and then you add

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:03,420
constraints such as Direction constraint

00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,700
or smoothness constraint constraints and

00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:09,780
you can have constraints as like like at

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:12,630
this point the the distance between this

00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:15,030
control points and they the defining

00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,740
point on this side has to be three times

00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:19,860
that on the other side and so on and so

00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:22,560
on and then you have a target function

00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,470
which is something like smoothness or

00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:29,280
energy of the curve arc length whatever

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:32,060
what have you and then you use this use

00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:35,700
numerical methods to to minimize this

00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:37,170
and the results you get out of this are

00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,030
something like this and when I say

00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:42,360
results this is the only result set I

00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:44,490
have ever done the letter S is actually

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,710
the most difficult one to do because it

00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:51,000
it's very difficult to get a pleasing

00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:54,500
thing out of it but this kind of work so

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,090
so the way this is done is that you have

00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,280
constrained points for at the top so

00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,870
whether Hillary begins and there's an

00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,420
angle constraint saying that it should

00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:06,840
go in that direction and then at the top

00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:09,270
at the bottom you have horizontal no

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,730
horizontal requirements and then at the

00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:14,250
points where touches besides you have it

00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:18,540
has to be vertical and at certain height

00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:22,530
and then the optimization function for

00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:26,610
this is to minimize the maximum value of

00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:27,940
the second derivative as one does over

00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:32,829
the entire

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:36,069
tire curve and and do that so the status

00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:38,469
on this one is that it's mostly an

00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:40,269
interesting toy I wrote it and then I at

00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:42,969
some point got a bit bored with it

00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:44,739
but you can run it in the browser with

00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:47,199
wisdom so you can type your constraints

00:26:44,739 --> 00:26:51,909
in in the browser window and just press

00:26:47,199 --> 00:26:53,949
and it will calculate it the results if

00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:55,539
people are interesting like things that

00:26:53,949 --> 00:26:56,529
you could do is you could experiment

00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:58,959
with different objective functions

00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:00,819
because if you have different constraint

00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:01,899
or objective function the shape of the

00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:04,719
curve and you get out of it it's

00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:07,749
different so be interesting is like what

00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:09,759
what would be a good function to get

00:27:07,749 --> 00:27:11,199
pleasing results either way maybe the

00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,239
the function that you need to optimize

00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:15,359
is different on different letters and so

00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:15,359
on

00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:18,459
there are interesting numerical

00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,859
stability function problems with this

00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:22,329
you want to know more come ask to me

00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:23,609
afterwards preferably after I've had a

00:27:22,329 --> 00:27:26,409
few beers

00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:31,629
it hasn't really been touched since last

00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:33,759
summer when I made this and I hadn't

00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:36,039
read roughly nians PhD thesis at the

00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,959
time then I did read it and realized

00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:39,729
that what I had resolved the the the

00:27:37,959 --> 00:27:41,109
role function that I used is actually

00:27:39,729 --> 00:27:43,569
the same and it's a numerical

00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:45,789
approximation of the Spiro algorithm it

00:27:43,569 --> 00:27:47,829
just runs a thousand times slower but

00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:51,729
you know that's that's how experiments

00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:53,949
works in conclusion there are

00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:57,369
interesting math problems if if you are

00:27:53,949 --> 00:27:59,909
in the front design and things and have

00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:59,909
fun explore it

00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,690
