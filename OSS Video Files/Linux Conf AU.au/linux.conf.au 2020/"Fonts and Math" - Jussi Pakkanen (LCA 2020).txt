Font design is seen as a purely artistic and aesthetic pursuit. In this
talk we shall examine some ways to do the same with mathematics. Things we
can expect to be talked about include nib pens, Donald Knuth, railroad
tracks (yes) and possibly even differential equations. Not advanced math
knowledge is needed to participate, though. This talk is almost guaranteed
to provide no answers, but hopefully it will intrigue the audience's minds
so that they will start coming upwith their own questions.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/
