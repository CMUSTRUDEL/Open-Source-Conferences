Container images come in all shapes and sizes, with some being more useful then others. It's easy to have a one-size-fits-all approach to building images, but there are benefits to tailor making them for each appropriate situation. Images being deployed probably shouldn't be massive, nor should they include development tools, and it's probably unnecessary to run deployed integrations in a development environment. One approach for specifying images is to ask a few questions, naming appropriately along the way.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/
