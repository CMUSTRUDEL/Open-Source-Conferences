As technical communicators we have responsibilities - to our engineers, our audience, and to ourselves. 

We owe it to our engineers to be precise - to represent their ingenuity and hard work in the most accurate way. We owe it to our audience to be accessible - to be easily understood by anyone who wants to learn from us.

I also believe we owe it to ourselves to be far-reaching. We have limited time in each day, and we put a lot of it into researching and writing great content. So we want to make sure it’s getting in front of as many people as possible who need it (and sometimes those who don’t know they need it until they see it).

We don’t want to waste our time. We do want to make it count.

In this talk, I’ll talk about precision, accessibility, and reach - why we should think about them, how we can sharpen them, and tips we can apply from content marketing strategies to strengthen them.

Who knows, you may even find yourself landing in a marketing team as I have. Scary? Only at first. (I can tell you a little bit about that too.)

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

okay well thank you everyone we'll

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,050
continue the presentations with our next

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,960
presenter Ben long is going to be

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,360
speaking now on marketing not such a

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:24,170
dirty word after all please make him

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:29,449
feel welcome I used to think that

00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:33,059
marketing was not for me I thought that

00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:34,440
marketing was for mega extroverts who

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,079
are interested in making things look

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:43,399
shiny on the outside even if they're

00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,399
rotten in the middle dirty

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,770
hear me out

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,140
I used to work as a defense scientist

00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:54,390
working on designs of security systems

00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,120
and security protocols using set theory

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,090
and logic and this is an example of one

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,300
of my designs there was absolutely no

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:05,010
ambiguity in these designs but the

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,200
problem was how anybody else could

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,369
understand them they simply weren't

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:15,180
accessible to a wider audience and that

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:17,850
bothered me by the way that's a

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,330
specification of public key and

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:23,670
symmetric key encryption and decryption

00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,590
for anyone who's interested but I wrote

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,829
it about 15 20 years ago so don't ask me

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:31,650
how to explain it now these are two of

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,720
my favorite quotes nothing in science

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,619
has any value to society if it is not

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:41,750
communicated furthermore science isn't

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:44,490
finished until it's communicated

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:47,040
communication is indeed a two-way street

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,290
and so I believe we have certain

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,810
responsibilities in terms of how we

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:53,810
communicate what we know with others

00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:03,829
we owe it to our engineers to be precise

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,130
to represent their ingenuity and hard

00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:11,030
work in the most accurate way and so as

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:14,720
not to mislead our audience but there's

00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:17,690
no point in being precise if we're not

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,060
being understood so we go out to our

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,620
audience to be accessible to be

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,980
understood by anyone who wants to learn

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:28,000
from us to meet them also where they are

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,000
on their learning journey

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,880
but I also believe we owe it to

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:38,299
ourselves to be far reaching with our

00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,180
content we have limited time in each day

00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:45,290
and we put a lot of it into researching

00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:47,299
and writing great content but there's no

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,370
point in creating great content that's

00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:53,120
precise and easily understood if

00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,590
nobody's reading it so we want to make

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,690
sure we're writing content for our

00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,810
audience once and we want to make sure

00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,280
that it's getting in front of them so

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:05,840
what's this got to do with marketing

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,299
with the balance of precision

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,519
accessibility and reach we can promote

00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:12,680
valuable information to a diverse

00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,420
audience and that's what content

00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,940
marketing is all about promoting

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,940
valuable content to our diverse audience

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:28,220
you're putting in oh yeah so not so

00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,470
dirty after all in fact

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,470
precision accessibility and Reach is my

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,420
content happy place you're putting in

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,940
the effort already the research the

00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,560
writing to make great content so I say

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,500
put on your marketing content marketing

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,750
hat think about how you can write and

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,630
remote more valuable content to an

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,910
increasingly diverse audience and have

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:53,920
your ever-growing body of knowledge and

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,920
content work harder for you

00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:04,000
first let's talk about reach the more

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,860
helpful your content and the more people

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:12,070
you're helping with us the more valuable

00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:13,690
it is so ask yourself how can I find out

00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:17,980
what my audience wants to know about

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:19,180
most and that's an open question with

00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,430
lots of answers but here are some

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,310
examples you can talk to your customer

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,870
support teams they have great insights

00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,550
into what your customers are doing with

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,380
your products and the things they're

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,900
struggling with so there's a great place

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:35,170
to start for ideas for useful and

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,970
valuable content talk to customers

00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:38,440
directly set up a call with them or

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,630
attend the same conferences they're

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,640
attending work with your support teams

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,140
or customer success teams to set up some

00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,430
kind of communication channel with them

00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:49,660
so you can communicate with them

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:51,960
directly access your customers support

00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,040
information in tool such as Salesforce

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,450
there's a lot of information that goes

00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,890
and a lot of discussions that goes on

00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,540
those tools where you can find out more

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,600
about what your customers are struggling

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:03,490
with check out relevant community forums

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,320
like Stack Overflow where people are

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,669
asking questions about certain topics

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,850
and you can find out which topics are

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:13,210
most popular and you can monitor Google

00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:15,430
Analytics for instance to find out more

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,460
about how many page views you're getting

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,419
on certain bit pieces of your content

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,500
you can even set yourself some goals

00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:26,290
around Google Analytics as well like how

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:29,710
many blog views I want to be getting per

00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:32,110
month or how many blog views a certain

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:39,640
piece of content you'd like your content

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:41,530
to get each month so here's an example

00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,150
from Stack Overflow I'm sure everybody

00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,220
hears you Stack Overflow so don't really

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:49,330
need to go into the details but I can

00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,430
search on certain topics like HTML and I

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,280
can then sort on things like newest

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,290
questions most active questions and most

00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,390
popular questions as voted up by Stack

00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:01,270
Overflow users incidentally the most

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:05,110
popular for HTML is why does HTML think

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:06,640
Chuck Norris is a color I'm not sure I'm

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,630
about to go write a piece of content

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,729
about that but and on the second item

00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:14,680
there you can see how do I check whether

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:16,770
a checkbox is checked in jQuery and

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,700
that's actually got four million views

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,200
so if you're writing content about

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,470
jQuery that might be a good place to

00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,470
start

00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:38,280
also on reach when you finish writing a

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:41,470
piece of content or you have answered a

00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:44,410
technical question on a forum say or via

00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,930
email don't stop there make the most of

00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,400
your efforts think about so ask yourself

00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:50,350
where else could I share my knowledge

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,140
and content or who else might benefit

00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:55,240
from reading it so for example you have

00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,880
mailing lists you have other colleagues

00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,080
and other departments you know

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,060
organizations you can share with them

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,600
via slack or email or whatever

00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,190
communication platform you use there are

00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,979
also the other online communities and

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,460
forums Twitter Facebook Linkedin the

00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:11,650
docs

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,020
and your company blog or personal blog

00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,550
so a company blog is now mainly where

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,240
I'm spending most of my time at the

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,100
moment but my colleague and the audience

00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,770
there Tyler spends most of his time in

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:27,280
the docs and I guess depending on where

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,990
coming from you would look in in the

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,310
appropriate areas so say if you're

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,599
writing in Docs you might think about

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,020
how you might contribute some of your

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,640
content to your company blog or if

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,440
you're a developer and you've just

00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:40,060
written a great answer to it to a quick

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,830
technical technical question in the

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,390
forum then you might think about how you

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,400
can incorporate that into the Docs or

00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,580
write up your own blog about that as

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,580
well

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:59,919
and when sharing your content on social

00:07:55,569 --> 00:08:00,939
media find the best hashtags to use for

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,710
instance you could use a tool like

00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:05,680
hashtag fight to find out the most

00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:09,060
popular hashtags to use but also other

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,960
hashtags that are related to those and

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,960
that can give you more exposure

00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,569
so when thinking about reaching more

00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,909
people with our content we also need to

00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:30,669
think about how accessible it is to our

00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:32,319
diverse audience different people have

00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:34,449
different motivations and different

00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:36,519
levels of knowledge I know there are

00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:40,860
only two of me there so it's not exactly

00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:40,860
a very diverse but anyway

00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:47,079
so when writing content ask yourself

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,600
what questions might different people in

00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:51,880
my audience have they might be asking

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,279
thank questions like what is this

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:56,889
product or feature or what is this why

00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,990
should I use it how do I use it how do I

00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:00,399
get started quickly with it how do I get

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,069
into the depths of it into the more

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,529
advanced content or how do I solve this

00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:10,240
particular issue also known as

00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:13,389
troubleshooting and the answers to these

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,069
questions can be individual sections or

00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:17,470
pieces of content in their own right and

00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:20,699
help build up a body of content that

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,980
caters for your diverse audience

00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:25,810
but when catering for such diversity we

00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:32,290
need to make sure people can easily find

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:35,410
the information they're looking for good

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,360
specific headings are signposts that

00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:39,670
help members of your diverse audience

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,259
find what they're looking for and when

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:43,209
talking about accessibility we should

00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:45,189
also consider people who rely on

00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:46,600
assistive technologies such as people

00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:49,839
with vision impairments who rely on

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,819
screen readers and once again headings

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,800
are really highly valuable for those

00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:56,980
people as well because headings provide

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,829
them with an at-a-glance view of the

00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,180
entire content so they can navigate to

00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:04,120
the particular parts that they're

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,439
interested in as well and there's more

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:10,149
specific you are with your headings the

00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:13,269
better for search engines as well in

00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:17,350
terms of it being picked up by your

00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:20,350
audience so for example if you're

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,689
writing content about CSS animation you

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:25,420
might use headings like these what are

00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:28,600
our CSS animations the benefits of using

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,490
them using them a quick introduction to

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,019
CSS animations but of course I wouldn't

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,610
actually write using them as I'm

00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:36,100
saying now I'm just saying that thank

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,189
you what number does that say ten thank

00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,189
you

00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:45,389
sometimes there is a tendency to write

00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:48,279
what are CSS animations then benefits

00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:50,350
using them but it's always better to

00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:55,509
spell it out in full

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:56,529
especially for search engines like when

00:10:55,509 --> 00:11:00,279
people are searching for your content as

00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:02,170
well a quick introduction five CSS

00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:05,110
animation examples to try a detailed

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:06,939
guide to CS animation and how to use CSS

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:13,889
to fade HTML text in and out so that

00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:16,239
one's even more specific and don't

00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:18,189
there's no reason why you can't mirror

00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:20,379
your headings with the types of

00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:23,470
questions you were thinking about your

00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:26,049
audiences your audience asking as we did

00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:33,489
previously so I've just done a

00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:35,170
one-to-one match there now Google can

00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:37,540
help you get a more of an idea of how to

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:39,309
phrase your headings as well as related

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,290
questions that people are asking and I

00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:42,910
use it all the time to create my

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:44,529
headings because I don't necessarily

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,230
know exactly how other people are

00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:49,540
talking about these things so if I'm

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:53,110
looking if I'm creating a piece of

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:56,290
content by animating text HTML sorry

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,790
animating text in HTML then I might put

00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:59,139
these keywords in Google and it will

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,420
just show me a whole lot of things that

00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:03,459
are that people are searching on where I

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,499
can get other ideas now I know it's not

00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:07,749
as detailed as nickel as user testing

00:12:05,499 --> 00:12:11,470
but I think Google can provide a place

00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:13,420
to start as well because it then shows

00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,860
me our CSS yeah I should probably use

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:17,079
CSS in my heading somewhere

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,639
oh how to yeah good point I should use

00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,529
how to in fact that one there right

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,660
about in the middle how to animate text

00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:25,029
in nature my using CSS that's perfect

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:30,549
that's nothing specific and exactly on a

00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:31,839
topic that I'm writing about and yes so

00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,669
it also shows other things that people

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,589
are asking around these topics so

00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:37,149
they're also you can get some ideas of

00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,689
what else you might write about that's

00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:45,269
that the people are looking for and

00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:48,579
searches related to that to that query

00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:51,269
and I actually used that as a method to

00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:53,889
come up with those examples for the CSS

00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:57,790
animation earlier pretty much by typing

00:12:53,889 --> 00:13:00,189
in what is the CSS animation why should

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,470
I you you CSS animation and those topics

00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:04,990
on the Left were more like the topics

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,429
that came up in Google so I was like

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,850
yeah okay that sounds more like what two

00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:15,160
people are searching for and how people

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:16,959
would normally phrase that okay here's

00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,850
an interesting example that happened

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,670
recently one of our engineers wrote an

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:25,050
article about building dispenser so

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:27,579
dispenser is a content delivery network

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,949
but this was the initial title for it

00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:31,600
now we're thinking hmm I think we can

00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:33,579
probably do better than that if we want

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,639
to really tell our audience what we're

00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:38,139
writing about so I thought about the

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,959
questions the audience might be asking

00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:42,910
about what was in this article so what

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,040
is it and what can I learn from it and

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,139
the answers to those were it's a new

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,730
city and infrastructure and what can I

00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:51,100
learn from it three tips from improving

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,079
performance in a cloud perfect those are

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:59,079
my new headings for two different pieces

00:13:53,079 --> 00:14:02,610
of content so instantly the audience

00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:09,249
knows more about what they're reading

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:10,480
and I can also catch different members

00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:14,939
of my audience depending what they're

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,939
looking for when they're searching say

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,100
and on to precision something that I

00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:26,649
think most of us here don't really have

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,930
a problem with but I'll talk about it

00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:31,930
anyway because there's a point to be

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:35,320
made but I'll start with a story

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:36,640
my brother-in-law recently actually one

00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:40,560
of my brother-in-law's is in his room

00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,560
but it wasn't him it was somebody else

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,149
what I'm just thinking about it was

00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,920
brothers-in-law isn't it's not

00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:53,470
brother-in-law's anyway yep

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,880
bought this from my daughter for

00:14:53,470 --> 00:15:00,070
Christmas and this was on it was on the

00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:02,020
box and we're like great this is

00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,899
fantastic she was so she was excited

00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:07,330
anyway she opened up the box and of

00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:08,680
course the wooden box was inside as she

00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,560
opened up wooden box and nothing was

00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,000
inside it

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,380
so she felt a bit she's well actually

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,480
she took it really well my

00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:21,730
brother-in-law was really pissed off so

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,480
the point here is that we need to be

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:27,790
accurate oh yeah in what we're saying

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,920
because being pissed off is something we

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,440
never want our customers or developers

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,390
or users to feel so precision is

00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,220
important

00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:40,660
people want content from sites that

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:43,029
display a high level of e8e expertise

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:45,310
authoritative Ness and trustworthiness

00:15:43,029 --> 00:15:48,339
and that's the content that google

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,709
recommends as well and I reckon a great

00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:54,959
deal of DAT is established based on

00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,959
accuracy and completeness and precision

00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:01,000
now as I said most of us here I don't

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:02,350
think have a problem with precision but

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,450
I mention it because as you make your

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,560
content more accessible to different

00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:10,839
audiences although we need to be precise

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,570
we don't always need to be thorough all

00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:15,550
in the one place so there's a balance

00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:18,600
that that is required because people

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:21,399
don't necessarily want all the details

00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,180
right from the beginning or land all in

00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,160
one place

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:27,220
sometimes we can drip feed the

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,870
information as they as they need it

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,270
along their learning journey or

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,020
depending on what they need so my pro

00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:36,350
tip

00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:41,300
for precision is simply linked to more

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:43,250
details we're required but there's

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,690
always a there's always a tricky balance

00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,190
that has to be made and as always asked

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,020
should I put this paragraph in I should

00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:50,180
at a paragraph out how much information

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,790
is too much information or not enough

00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,470
information etc but with lengths I think

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,640
we can't go wrong so for example this is

00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,610
a piece of content I wrote recently

00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:02,120
about how to go mobile without tiny MC

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:04,850
WYSIWYG editor I said step 1 get tiny MC

00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,620
5.1 if you're a cloud user it should

00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:08,120
already be updated great you've got

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:09,770
nothing else to do but if they're you

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,520
know if you need more info check out the

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:16,160
docs step to configure it add this line

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,190
of code it's as easy as that but if

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,870
things do get a bit tricky check out the

00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:22,459
documentation for more info so it's

00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,020
basically I've documented the happy path

00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:31,210
with links to the docs for more

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:33,530
information and finally back to reach

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,440
share and celebrate the work you've done

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,450
with the people or the list or the forum

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,330
way you got the idea from if it's

00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,680
appropriate like yeah this doesn't

00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,270
always happen this way but if if

00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,680
somebody has suggested some cool having

00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,420
you know really struggling with

00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:50,030
something and you write up your content

00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,950
go back to the forum or the email and

00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,310
let them know you've done it say here it

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,320
is

00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:56,240
thanks let's do it again and you might

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,820
use phrases like here's some content I

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,170
wrote about X put a link to it thanks

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:03,340
for your input and let me know if

00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,340
there's anything else I can do to help

00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:13,310
so that's about it for me yeah so are

00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:20,120
there any questions yeah we do have time

00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:22,210
for some questions one question over

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,210
here

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,659
you mentioned a few times to encourage a

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:33,380
diverse audience yeah

00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:35,960
would you ever feel like actually what

00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,820
you need to do is narrow your scope and

00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,740
like narrowing your audience or do you

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,240
always want the content narrow but

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:45,559
actually you've got a broader audience

00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:48,140
mind good point so I think probably the

00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:51,740
the headings comes into this as well

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:54,580
because I want to I want to be bringing

00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:58,130
a whole a lot of people to my content so

00:18:54,580 --> 00:19:00,110
I want to be catering for a large number

00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:03,020
of people who are who are all looking

00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,100
for different pieces of information but

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:07,970
eventually they're going to be wanting

00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,710
to find specific things and so I think

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:12,049
the headings comes into play there where

00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:15,200
you need to be really yeah specific

00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:21,049
about about what's where and so they can

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:28,900
find what they're looking for yeah any

00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:30,080
any other questions no questions okay

00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:32,410

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:38,819
