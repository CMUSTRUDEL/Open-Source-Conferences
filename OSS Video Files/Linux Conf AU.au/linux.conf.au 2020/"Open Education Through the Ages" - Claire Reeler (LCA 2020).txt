Education is a vital component of human society. Our young are born relatively underdeveloped compared to many other species. We sacrificed a longer development in utero for larger brain size. Thus we are born needing to learn and geared to learn as fast and efficiently as possible, even adapting our brain architecture to suit the material we learn, and sadly, discarding areas that are not developed. During the long millennia of human (pre)history, we have adapted how we educate each other. This presentation will whip through the last 100,000 years with a very brief overview of how education has changed and what we have learned about the process on the way. The 'open' context of human societies through time in the context of education is also examined, with a goal of distilling information that has application in our modern lives and our approach to open education in the current sense.
We will examine what 'education' means in different human societies and through time; and the implications of an 'open' approach and how that fits with different ways of organising society. What has worked well, how can we define and measure that, and how we can apply it in our modern world, which is so very different to anything that has gone before are all topics to be addressed. We will also touch on the aspects of human psychology that are influenced by our evolutionary biology and what that means for how we teach and learn, as well as how we can work most effectively. The separation of 'work' and 'education' is a very modern phenomenon and one that some of our ancestors might find hard to comprehend. Thus, looking at education through time can teach us a lot about how humans can optimise living in all spheres of their lives.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
