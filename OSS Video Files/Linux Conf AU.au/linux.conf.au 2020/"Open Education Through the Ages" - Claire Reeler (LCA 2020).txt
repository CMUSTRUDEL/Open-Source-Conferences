Education is a vital component of human society. Our young are born relatively underdeveloped compared to many other species. We sacrificed a longer development in utero for larger brain size. Thus we are born needing to learn and geared to learn as fast and efficiently as possible, even adapting our brain architecture to suit the material we learn, and sadly, discarding areas that are not developed. During the long millennia of human (pre)history, we have adapted how we educate each other. This presentation will whip through the last 100,000 years with a very brief overview of how education has changed and what we have learned about the process on the way. The 'open' context of human societies through time in the context of education is also examined, with a goal of distilling information that has application in our modern lives and our approach to open education in the current sense.
We will examine what 'education' means in different human societies and through time; and the implications of an 'open' approach and how that fits with different ways of organising society. What has worked well, how can we define and measure that, and how we can apply it in our modern world, which is so very different to anything that has gone before are all topics to be addressed. We will also touch on the aspects of human psychology that are influenced by our evolutionary biology and what that means for how we teach and learn, as well as how we can work most effectively. The separation of 'work' and 'education' is a very modern phenomenon and one that some of our ancestors might find hard to comprehend. Thus, looking at education through time can teach us a lot about how humans can optimise living in all spheres of their lives.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

yep okay I'm Claire ela I'm actually an

00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,290
archaeologist but I work in IT I'm

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,839
actually working with catalyst at the

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:17,789
moment and I'm gonna talk about open

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,300
education from an archaeological

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:28,980
perspective in particular not just a

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:32,070
historical perspective so what is open

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,850
education well it start with some

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,100
definitions of Education one that I

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,559
found in a site calling itself Cambridge

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,910
dictionary online is the process of

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,950
teaching or learning especially in a

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,039
school or college sounds very kind of

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,420
you know what we'd expect from a

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,360
traditional definition of Education

00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,670
Wikipedia has a slightly broader

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,879
definition of Education the process of

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:02,399
facilitating learning acquisition of and

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:08,310
it includes skills values beliefs as

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:10,290
well as just knowledge so open education

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,740
the definition I found is that it's

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:17,220
actually a philosophy about how people

00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:20,850
acquire knowledge and so it's taking a

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,500
different approach to that and I know

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,770
there's been a lot of discussion in

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,130
recent years about open education as

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,540
this new and advanced way of coming to

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:37,020
grips with human knowledge acquisition

00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:39,659
but if we actually look at it there's

00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:44,000
some interesting perspectives from an

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,000
archeological sense that feed into this

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,880
if we look at the idea of how we've

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:53,729
approached education through time

00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,710
there's the very conventional Victorian

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,119
school room this is actually Rockhampton

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:02,790
and this is Haledon between Brisbane and

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:06,180
Tomba in the 19th century in the late

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,799
19th century the government went around

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,000
and set up a lot of schools in

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:14,160
Queensland and at the time

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,350
many of you have read Thomas Hardy but

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,750
the notion of little pitchers that just

00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,970
had to be filled up with knowledge

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,440
children were there to receive

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,770
information in a very strict and orderly

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,760
way which is why they all shown busily

00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:32,820
at their books in these pictures there's

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,650
a wide cross-section of Ages in the

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:39,270
classrooms because these were typically

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:41,640
one-room schools and basically the

00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,710
students work their way through the set

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,190
knowledge base which they were presented

00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,600
with until they were familiar enough

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,280
with the knowledge that they then in

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,200
turn started teaching it themselves

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,330
so most of the girls when they got into

00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,000
their early teens became student

00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:00,990
teachers in the classroom informally and

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,930
then later on teachers themselves if we

00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:06,630
go further back through time there's

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,920
different ways in which education has

00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,700
been approached because if we think

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,730
about it

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,970
education is fundamental to human beings

00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,430
as a species now I just want to jump in

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:19,730
here and say I'm going to use some

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,980
photographs of indigenous communities

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:26,340
not because they represent something

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,130
that's stuck in time not because they

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,500
haven't changed since the Stone Age or

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,200
any of that but simply because their

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:38,100
life ways are different from our own and

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:42,570
they provide an analog of different ways

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:45,690
that different concepts in our society

00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:47,810
can be approached ok so it's as an

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:52,220
analog to different forms of behavior

00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:57,060
rather than a representation of the past

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:59,550
so human beings are unique or relatively

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:04,230
unique in you in the animal world in

00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:07,350
that we've kind of sacrificed doing a

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:11,970
lot of development in the womb and early

00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:14,550
on for a large brain so in a biological

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:18,750
sense our young are born relatively

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:22,970
premature in order to get this very big

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,370
brain out intact that means that

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:28,000
education

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:30,400
for I starts the moment a child is born

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,240
we still have so much to learn if you

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,490
abandon a human baby it will die okay it

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,620
cannot support itself that's not true of

00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,740
something like a bush Turkey which is

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:46,810
independent from day one or crocodile or

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:50,320
other things so as humans we have to

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:53,229
train our young it's something that we

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:58,510
have to do so education is not this

00:04:53,229 --> 00:05:00,639
thing that we kind of have invented it's

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,370
something inherent in who we are or none

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,530
of us would be here we have to teach

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,770
them pretty much everything from the

00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:12,910
start so education is actually something

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:16,780
that's fundamental to we start out

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:20,380
learning and as we learn we teach each

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:22,840
other and we become the kind of learning

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,789
and teaching roles swap during our lives

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,760
until we mostly teaching and less

00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:31,840
learning from being mostly learning and

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:34,720
less teaching and education there of

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,930
necessity occurs in very informal

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,240
environments so when we have a newborn

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:41,770
baby and we interact with it we're

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,240
actually teaching that child we're

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,400
teaching that child about human

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,139
interaction we're teaching it about

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,820
emotions we're teaching it about

00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:51,639
regulating its emotions we're teaching

00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,990
it about how our society works and

00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,729
there's a lot of anthropological

00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,560
literature that shows that the way

00:05:54,729 --> 00:06:01,210
people treat newborn babies has so much

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:08,860
societal baggage a hospital it's just

00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:11,740
enormous right so let's look way back to

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,260
the beginning okay and I'm gonna be

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:19,210
talking in large part about the ice age

00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:22,210
and so here's a fun depiction of the ice

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,010
age this is all I see not anything to do

00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,229
with the ice age particularly in

00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,260
Australia where we didn't even have ice

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:31,960
in Australia the ice age was actually

00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,450
expressed as colder drier climates in a

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,219
lot of areas and wetter climates and

00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,220
other parts depending on because the

00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:41,870
rainfall patterns were

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:44,990
shifted and changed so it's probably

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:50,300
best if I start with doing a quick

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:53,060
overview of the history of humanity just

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,720
to give you some perspective on what I'm

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:59,060
talking about now the dates for the

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,610
origins of what we call anatomically

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:06,160
modern humans which is ice people who

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:09,230
have bodies and brains like we do is

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,740
somewhere around a hundred thousand

00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:14,630
years ago now in the literature there

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,480
are some papers arguing for as far back

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:20,740
as three hundred thousand but it's it's

00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:24,800
in that really long ago kind of space

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:29,540
the last ice age started at about a

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:34,340
hundred and twenty thousand years so we

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:35,960
are an ice age born species if you like

00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,090
I mean we may have been there before it

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,740
started but we've spent the majority of

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,440
our existence and I've got another slide

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,870
that will show that more clearly as

00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,790
people adapted to the ice age which is

00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:53,690
reflected I think in the temperature of

00:07:46,790 --> 00:08:00,560
this room so a lot of our approaches to

00:07:53,690 --> 00:08:03,190
the world were kind of formed from that

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,150
long history we had of dealing with

00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:09,380
conditions that were quite different

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:11,240
from what they are now so moving on from

00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,310
about a hundred thousand years ago

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,010
actually let me just talk about the

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,900
skull briefly this is a skull from

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,360
southern Africa

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,150
from a site called cub way or Broken

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:27,020
Hill and this particular individual

00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:30,200
whose Anna kek Homo sapiens so early

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:33,800
anatomically modern human actually died

00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,050
from an abscess behind a tooth here that

00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:38,060
ate its way up the infection ate its way

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,979
all the way up here into the sinuses

00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,280
through into the orbit and into the

00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:45,140
brain before it killed them so anytime

00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,940
you think romantic thoughts about the

00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,740
past or somebody wants to introduce you

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,200
to the Paleo diet

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,940
and just be very thankful that we have

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,580
modern dentistry and modern medicine

00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,589
because the amount of pain that that

00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,470
must individual must have been in when

00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:04,610
they died would be quite substantial

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:06,560
um now often in in archaeological talks

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,600
and talks about early human ancestors

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,550
you see a lot of skulls so I just wanted

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,850
to show you that the kind of hunt

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,830
hunched over hulking cave person is not

00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,440
really what our ancestors looked like

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:21,470
anatomically modern means like ice this

00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:25,100
is a Neanderthal child nano tiles are a

00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:27,260
form of early modern human they had a

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,010
slightly bigger brain than we did but in

00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,990
different areas so the prefrontal cortex

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:35,630
which in us is very large and his

00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:41,839
problem-solving area was smaller but

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:44,180
they had phenomenal memory there's some

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,130
argument that we either merged with them

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,100
or out completed them or maybe a bit of

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:50,990
both so one of the first things that

00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,149
anatomically modern humans did was

00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:56,120
spread out across the entire world

00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:58,399
we are Wanderers at heart and we like to

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,610
move the fact that we have not speciated

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,250
in all that period whilst being spread

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,260
across literally the entire planet shows

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,000
how often we move and how good we are at

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:11,930
exchanging genetic material with each

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,660
other at about some time before

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,880
sixty-five thousand years human

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,800
ancestors reached Australia there's a

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,170
site up in the Northern Territory now

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,579
data that greater than 65 thousand years

00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:30,260
with a very modern suite of

00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:32,000
technological material and that's right

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,880
in the middle of the Ice Age the last

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,770
glacial maximum so the peak of the Ice

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:42,829
Age before it tailors off 18,000 years

00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:43,880
from about 12,000 years ago we're moving

00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:45,260
to the start of what's called the

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,529
Holocene so all of this is the

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:51,020
Pleistocene at the Holocene we have a

00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:53,649
huge environmental shift everything

00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:57,110
changes the weather patterns change

00:10:53,649 --> 00:11:00,140
there's global warming on an enormous

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,240
scale as the ice age ends and we go into

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,649
what's called an interglacial period and

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,779
what happens is for several thousand

00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:08,390
years about 6,000 years there's an

00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:12,500
alternating between centuries of wet and

00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:16,190
centuries of dry but so there's a lot of

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:18,110
floods a lot of desertification that is

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,820
very challenging for humans so for

00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:22,279
instance if you know the area of the

00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,680
Middle East and the Gulf that was

00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,750
actually a riverine plain until about

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,580
6,000 years ago between ten and six

00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,820
thousand years ago it flooded in bursts

00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:34,910
and those floods came every few

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:37,220
centuries and flooded hundreds of

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:40,220
kilometres inland and people were forced

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:44,540
to move away from that that constant

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:47,720
changing environment lots of changes in

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:50,450
the environment obviously the the plants

00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,580
there was an impact on the plants and on

00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:55,100
the animals on the ecosystems on the

00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,750
rainfall patterns everything and people

00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,660
were forced to move over dramatic

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,300
distances out of that came the

00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:06,790
development of agriculture and settled

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:09,890
villages and the start of the sorts of

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:12,770
complex societies that led to where we

00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,390
are today so we get the pyramids at

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,130
about four thousand years the Roman

00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:17,870
Empire about two thousand years and then

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,990
medieval castles and all that sort of

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:22,940
jazz so because humans are really really

00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:26,180
find it really really difficult to

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:28,279
visualize scale I got some help from my

00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:30,700
son to produce this for you so this is

00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:34,100
the last hundred thousand years of human

00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,690
existence so back here you've got the

00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,240
beginning of anatomically modern humans

00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:40,040
possibly you've got the settlement of

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,800
Australia sometime in this period over

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,329
here so it's a bit of perspective

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:48,620
Aboriginal people have been in Australia

00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:52,730
for that entire green bit the first

00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:54,320
fleet landed about here so when we

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,350
acknowledge the traditional owners of

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,430
this country we're not just saying words

00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:03,170
okay these guys have been here if you

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:05,810
ask them how long have you been here and

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,440
they answer forever they mean it

00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:11,709
Europe was settled somewhere down here

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,150
because it was covered in ice back here

00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:15,210
ok so that's just the same thing to give

00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:18,180
you a bit of perspective

00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:20,100
again because we struggle with scale the

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,390
Halle scene starts back here that last

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,220
little bit we've got agriculture

00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:28,200
pyramids Cleopatra is as distinct in

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:32,790
time from the pyramids as we are from

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:36,600
her so we tend to collapse the past when

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:38,610
we think back right so what did

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,220
education look like over that period

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,440
well we know that the Sumerians at about

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,830
6000 years ago with their Canaan form

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,920
had schooling they actually set homework

00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:51,720
and you have kids who got into trouble

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:55,440
for not doing their homework and not

00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:59,040
handing it in with their clay tablets so

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,780
that's been a thing for a while the

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,940
School of Athens famous painting we've

00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:05,640
got the Greeks and Romans with where

00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,290
education was held in high regard we've

00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,610
got those notorious Victorian school

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:14,190
rooms and we have the modern school

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:17,040
rooms so is that education well we have

00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:22,350
about 90,000 years where that wasn't

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:24,630
education okay and where education

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:27,990
probably looked more like this sort of

00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:30,750
thing people learning from each other

00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,390
people discussing things kids copying

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,810
what their parents were doing

00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:38,730
grandparents passing stuff onto children

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:40,650
elders giving their knowledge children

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,630
actually doing stuff themselves this is

00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:44,190
actually a well and they're collecting

00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:46,010
water I think it's very sensible design

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:52,490
well you can't fall down that no matter

00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:55,490
how dark it is okay so how did this

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:58,230
education happen several different ways

00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:02,280
there's straight heart instruction where

00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:04,980
we teach people how to do stuff somebody

00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:10,950
explaining somebody telling kids

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:14,780
information stories and knowledge being

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:17,070
passed on to people women in particular

00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,810
showing children how to do things often

00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,790
their own children but sometimes others

00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:25,040
here's a father teaching his kids to

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:28,340
fish or instructional methods

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,310
storytelling plays a huge part

00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:33,230
in that the reason we love stories I

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:36,380
mean you can see it here on the faces of

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:40,340
these kids we've got 90 thousand years

00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:42,770
of that okay there's a lot that we just

00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:46,610
plug straight into with it so it's a

00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:48,380
very powerful medium up here we have a

00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,690
Sumerian tablet this is one of the flood

00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,300
tablets which records those floods those

00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:56,600
devastating floods that poured into the

00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:59,180
Gulf and started off the stories that

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,580
were passed down and we'll talk about

00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,140
that in a bit but the stories of the

00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,060
floods and the stories of these

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:08,210
devastating impacts and it's been shown

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,589
in in research that stories of things

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,930
that have happened including negative

00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:14,089
things are very important for children

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:17,240
to hear because it teaches them

00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:19,430
resilience and it teaches them how their

00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,320
parents and generations before them have

00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:22,910
faced challenging times and overcome

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,880
them and it actually gives them hope

00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,930
that when they check face something

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,870
challenging in their own lives they can

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:32,750
overcome it as well and of course buds

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:37,400
and their role of music in storytelling

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:39,710
is also pretty fundamental obviously

00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,880
there was a lot of hands-on learning now

00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:43,610
something that's really interesting

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:47,060
about children in a lot of societies is

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:49,240
they are sent out to do actual stuff we

00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,500
all know about kids herding animals

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,010
particularly in Africa and places like

00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:57,010
that there's three pictures here if you

00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:59,330
just look on public domain pictures

00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:03,290
places where you can see public domain

00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:04,760
pictures and you look for children

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:08,240
activities you'll see a lot of children

00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:11,329
collecting water okay water is

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,310
fundamental to our existence obviously

00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:16,400
we can't go more than 72 hours without

00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:19,400
it so children are taking part in

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,550
activity that's actually critical to the

00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,290
survival of everybody obviously up here

00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,610
you can see from the stage of these boys

00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,620
clothes they've been having a lot of fun

00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:29,060
at the same time but they know that

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,770
they're getting water for their family

00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:34,570
and what they're doing is important and

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:37,190
they're learning by actually doing now

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:40,049
one of the things that I mentioned with

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,489
that flood tablet is you have events

00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:43,350
especially with that flooding at the

00:17:41,489 --> 00:17:44,820
early Holocene he had centuries of

00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:47,149
flooding and then centuries of drought

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,369
and then centuries of flooding now

00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:51,629
grandparents are a great method of

00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:54,210
transmitting knowledge to younger

00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:56,489
generations but grandparents don't live

00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,710
for centuries especially back when there

00:17:56,489 --> 00:18:00,450
wasn't modern medicine so how do you

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,389
transmit knowledge that has to go

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:07,039
greater than a generation and the answer

00:18:03,389 --> 00:18:15,330
is through codifying it into stories

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:16,799
into ways of being in the world so one

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,960
of the roles of religion in their

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,539
societal sense is to transmit

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,700
information that it's needed

00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:26,580
for a society at greater than a

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,619
generation interval and so those stories

00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,450
of the floods in the Middle East have

00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:33,029
been transferred all the way down to the

00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:35,249
present similarly there are Aboriginal

00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:39,869
stories of the floods in the early

00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:42,269
Holocene the glasshouse mountains north

00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:44,580
of Brisbane are giants who ran away from

00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:47,399
the waters that were encroaching in the

00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,169
East which is a direct story of that

00:18:47,399 --> 00:18:55,289
flooding that occurred of their coastal

00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:57,389
plain at the early Holocene so let's

00:18:55,289 --> 00:19:01,109
talk about open versus closed knowledge

00:18:57,389 --> 00:19:02,460
okay we might think okay the way that

00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:04,980
knowledge is transmitted in these

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,919
societies for most of our history was

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,409
very open people taught what they knew

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,659
and didn't weren't worried about who

00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:14,159
they were teaching it to yes that was

00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:15,859
true however there was some knowledge

00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:18,960
that was closed

00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:21,809
there were initiations for certain

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,580
members of society there were people who

00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:25,470
had special roles

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,109
there's men's business there's women's

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,690
business and there's this chap called

00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:34,559
Jon Yellen who in the 70s studied the

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:36,629
spatial patterning of campsites and he

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,279
discovered that in hand together a

00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:40,259
community because people had to share

00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:43,259
resources it was really really important

00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:45,619
that everybody shared stuff because if

00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,940
you're a hunter-gatherer and you hoard

00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:51,450
other people in your group are going to

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,820
starve and then they won't be there to

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:57,570
share with you if you haven't

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,279
got food resources so it's absolutely

00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,379
critical that hunter-gatherers share

00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,769
their resources with each other and so

00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:06,509
as a result what you can see here it's

00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:08,190
hard to see from this partial picture

00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:10,559
and unfortunately I wasn't able to get a

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,029
full one but a lot of hunter-gatherer

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,299
communities when you look at how they

00:20:12,029 --> 00:20:18,479
position their living spaces a they have

00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:21,359
open doorways they don't close the

00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:24,200
doorways at all everybody must be able

00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,369
to see what everyone else is doing

00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,929
because then they know if anybody's

00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:30,899
holding anything and that can be

00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:33,149
threatening to the whole group they tend

00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:35,159
to face each other for that reason they

00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:39,109
tend to have communal fireplaces

00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:41,399
and a lot of group shared activities

00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:44,149
particularly around food processing and

00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:48,929
particularly around the larger stuff so

00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:51,419
in some of these analog communities men

00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:52,919
will go out hunting larger animals women

00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,690
will do hunting and gathering with the

00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,779
children and they'll snack along the way

00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:59,609
both groups will when there's a lot of

00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:01,649
resources they bring them back they pass

00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:03,479
them out they share them out and they

00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:05,399
look after each other we know that back

00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:07,409
as far as about a hundred thousand years

00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:10,590
ago humans were looking after each other

00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:12,690
we have examples of skeletons where

00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,519
people have suffered horrific injuries

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,619
that they would not have been able to

00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:18,629
sustain themselves and they were looked

00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:22,499
after by the group so again that's

00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:25,519
something we do so in order to enforce

00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:28,739
the sharing ethic in a societal sense

00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,599
people were supposed to be accountable

00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:32,129
to each other and this is one of the

00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:36,109
things about the open aspects of

00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:38,849
knowledge when people share openly

00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:42,840
accountability goes with that you can't

00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:45,869
share some stuff and not others because

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,389
that generates suspicions the only ones

00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:53,220
who can get away with that other people

00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:56,549
who deal with dangerous stuff okay so

00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:00,629
people who deal with magic or any of the

00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:02,249
kind of really dangerous information we

00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:05,710
can see here somebody who's got a

00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:10,029
replica of a American plane on the

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:13,110
and performing some ritual we don't know

00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:15,520
exactly why but we can imagine from the

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:18,880
analogous situations that that was

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,440
regarded as dangerous information that

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,830
he was dealing with to keep the group

00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,779
safe those individuals did sequester

00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,779
themselves so the only Hut's

00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:33,010
that face in the opposite direction are

00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:35,559
the huts of these Shaymin witch doctors

00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:39,309
whatever the class of people in society

00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:40,929
that dealt with dangerous knowledge that

00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:45,549
was knowledge that was a obtained

00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:47,850
through a lot of severe trial and effort

00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:51,700
and through which you had to pass

00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:55,090
numerous tests in order to be accepted

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,370
into that realm and these people lived a

00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:00,909
very interesting life in their

00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:04,799
communities because they were trusted to

00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:07,270
a point but they were also not trusted

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,029
because they were on that fringe and

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:13,330
they weren't part of that open sharing

00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:16,570
ethic so the minute you start to shut

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:19,390
things down and become proprietary about

00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:22,690
information you lose part of the

00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:24,789
community's trust they will accept that

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,010
there's things that you have to do to

00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:31,809
keep them safe but you will also lose a

00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:34,990
percentage of that trust however it can

00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:37,510
also be a means of pulling parts of the

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,610
community more tightly together so the

00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:42,909
reason for men's business and women's

00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:45,130
business is not some kind of neat

00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:48,309
stereotype gender stereotyping but is

00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:50,110
actually to pull those particular

00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:53,110
communities that have particular roles

00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:57,210
more closely together in the context of

00:23:53,110 --> 00:24:00,610
those roles themselves related to that

00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:02,860
it's quite interesting that when people

00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:07,000
have studied warfare in earlier

00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:09,700
society's most pre-industrial societies

00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,260
had ceremonies attached to warfare and

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:17,830
they had ceremonies that surrounded

00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,610
people who are going to indulge in

00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,770
warfare

00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:23,110
and then ceremonies to reintegrate those

00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:25,809
people back into society and what those

00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,549
ceremonies were about we're from saying

00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:30,520
you're going to do stuff that's not

00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:32,380
socially acceptable in regular living

00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:35,830
we're not going to do a ceremony that

00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:37,780
removes you from this nicely integrated

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:40,299
sharing environment that we have and

00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:43,390
puts you slightly on the outside in this

00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:45,400
dangerous knowledge area and that

00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,900
ceremony will mean that when you do that

00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,450
stuff that we really don't approve of

00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,820
you're not doing it as part of our group

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:54,460
in a normal sense we then here our

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,650
ceremony when that ends to reintegrate

00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,840
you into the group so you can put all

00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:00,130
that stuff behind you and become part of

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,110
the group and then your behavior and it

00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,480
has to go back to mean what it was

00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:06,520
before and you put all that behind you

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,380
and that people have actually looked at

00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,049
that because it's part of their issues

00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,610
in our modern society that we have that

00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:14,110
we don't have any of those ceremonies

00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:16,059
and so people that just cut off and left

00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:18,220
hanging knowing that they've committed

00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:22,210
atrocious acts and with no way of

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:25,929
processing that that's a slight direct

00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:28,210
aggression so the basic point here is

00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:31,240
that there has always been a separation

00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:34,150
between open knowledge and closed or

00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,540
proprietary knowledge but it comes with

00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:39,250
different roles in society and it comes

00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:42,820
with certain amounts of societal cost

00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:46,900
and so people need to be aware of what

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:50,070
choices they're making around that okay

00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:55,660
so getting back to the kind of

00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:58,419
archaeological model of Education how do

00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,520
people learn most effectively it's

00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:03,090
something that modern educators spend a

00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,260
lot of time looking into and

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:07,960
archaeologists say well let's look at

00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:10,150
how we've learnt effectively for most of

00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,460
human history so that we can actually

00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:15,220
look at what's working and what's not in

00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,260
our modern context because we all know

00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:20,470
that the Victorian classroom had severe

00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:23,620
limitations and we've all been trying to

00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:28,570
move beyond that so one of the main

00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:30,140
things that is a hallmark of education

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:33,140
in the broadest sense in

00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:35,990
the archeological sense is interaction

00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:38,360
and that's interaction in a lot of

00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,670
different ways primarily interaction

00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,530
with other humans

00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:44,770
okay people collaborating working

00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:47,840
together learning from each other

00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:50,090
learning stuff together so here we've

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,270
got a working group working together on

00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:54,680
something here we have a study group

00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:56,330
they're interacting a little bit with

00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,740
each other but mostly with the material

00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:02,050
with each other to bounce things off

00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:05,540
interacting with the environment and

00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:08,950
here we can see a child learning through

00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:11,870
an older female relative presumably

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,430
what's okay and what's not in this

00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:15,260
interaction with the environment we're

00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:18,130
doing an activity in the river

00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:20,480
we're probably catching little fish or

00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:23,990
crayfish or something and suddenly

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,790
there's a massive rainstorm oh it's okay

00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,590
we can just laugh and put a leaf over

00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:30,860
our head we don't have to get stressed

00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:33,710
about that and we learn by interacting

00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:36,590
with things for example a musical

00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:41,450
instrument and then the people around us

00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:43,610
learn from the effect on the emotions of

00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:47,120
that music that's produced by the person

00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:49,490
interacting with that thing so most of

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,020
these we don't really separate from

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:52,700
their interaction with humans there's

00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:55,460
always some interaction with other

00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:59,330
humans that's part of the what's

00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:01,100
happening something else that's

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,690
fundamental that come out of the

00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:08,390
archeological research is looking at

00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:10,580
group size there's a field called

00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,140
evolutionary biology which says that

00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:15,290
since we spent ninety thousand years

00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,360
minimum living in a particular way and

00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:21,560
we've only lived there very short period

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:24,530
in a very different way we should look

00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,990
at what's influencing our biology and

00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:29,360
what's then influencing our psychology

00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:31,040
from that long period and so

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,620
evolutionary biology tries to explain

00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,440
human psychology from the perspective of

00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:39,320
that long period in the archaeological

00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:41,630
record and by looking at that we can say

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,640
that optimum group size if you want to

00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:46,490
get anything effective done

00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:50,330
if you want to actually have work being

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,980
done so there's something progressing in

00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,650
a useful way

00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,680
you need less than six people up to six

00:28:54,650 --> 00:29:02,410
is the maximum if you put more than six

00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:04,640
humans together you get a party okay

00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:08,600
it's just the way it works and you can

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,910
watch this in your own interactions if

00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,370
you get larger groups trying to work

00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:15,530
together they will tend to break down

00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:17,990
into smaller groups until you get six or

00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:19,460
less it's just the way it works if

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,930
anybody's ever played role-playing games

00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:26,180
if you have more than six people there

00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:28,430
just ain't gonna work well not well okay

00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,990
so examples of groups where there's less

00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:31,580
than six again it's really interesting

00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:33,470
looking at the pictures that are

00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,000
available on public domain websites

00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,440
because when you look at the groups that

00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,180
are working effectively and you count

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:46,120
the number of people 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 1

00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:49,340
2 3 4 6 or less ok that's what works

00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:51,620
again down here collaboration this one's

00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:57,500
called 6 people's hands all together

00:29:51,620 --> 00:30:01,580
study group 3 people shown and this has

00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:04,430
bearings on obviously education which

00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:07,250
we'll cover in a moment but generally in

00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:08,870
our lives and our workplaces so if

00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:10,760
you're trying to work on a project and

00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,560
you've got a team and you've got more

00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:18,560
than six people you've got a party not a

00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:20,300
team right so examples of more than

00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,680
groups of more than 6 people because

00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,410
obviously we need more than six people

00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,450
and archaeologically as I said although

00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:29,180
we spread out across the entire world in

00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,370
order to keep us all one species we had

00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,600
to regularly exchanged anything material

00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,900
which meant getting together in large

00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:39,140
groups so that people could meet

00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:41,810
partners of across wider genetic

00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,250
diversity so I've got a meeting a large

00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:45,590
conference such as this one with a

00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:49,250
plenary session or some other large

00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:54,440
meeting we have the modern classroom and

00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:55,940
we have a party genuine party now what's

00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,140
interesting in this picture of modern

00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,630
classroom is the key

00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:01,160
subdivided into little groups and I

00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:02,840
don't know if there's any teachers in

00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,030
the room but if you subdivide kids into

00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,590
little groups again gee if you put them

00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:14,290
in groups of six or less it actually

00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:20,420
works more than that not so much okay

00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:23,600
another aspect of archaeological

00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:25,130
education is the role of mistakes now

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:28,790
other people have covered this in other

00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:33,080
talks today so it's quite interesting in

00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:35,750
the traditional education realm that a

00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,150
lot of us grew up in the big red cross

00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:41,660
on your work was something to be feared

00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:45,710
it left you feeling like that when your

00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:46,490
work ended up like that okay that was a

00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:48,560
mistake

00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:53,690
and it was dreadful and it was something

00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:56,120
to avoid and this is just odd something

00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:58,580
as an adult that I've realised that we

00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,880
have made such a fundamental mistake in

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,900
is this whole realm because this is not

00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,880
how it works

00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,460
human beings learn by making mistakes

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,700
and as people have talked about in other

00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,860
talks when you give kids the opportunity

00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,780
to try something if it doesn't work just

00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,000
self-correct and try it again

00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:20,810
they keep learning and they don't end up

00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,710
like this and this is something that I

00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:27,250
actually saw you can have this face on a

00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:29,480
kid when they're making mistakes and

00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,380
that's what we want because that's

00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,530
effective

00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:35,660
this kid is actually learning something

00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:39,950
this kid is just learning to avoid that

00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:43,070
and I saw this in my own son when he was

00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,750
about three years old because I was

00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,640
already doing stuff on computers he

00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,260
wanted to play on the computer and so I

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,680
thought well I don't want him playing

00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:53,960
first-person shooter games so I'm going

00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,850
to get him educational software and I

00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,920
wasn't serious about it I wasn't trying

00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,570
to teach him to read or any of that jazz

00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,910
but I just thought well just give him

00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,220
say educational software so I got him a

00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:07,430
little phonetics stuff and all of that

00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,920
sort of chairs and he was like this he

00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,990
would do the wrong thing and

00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,360
he would laugh until he nearly fell off

00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:15,850
his chair because if he chose the wrong

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,210
sound the little ants that were trying

00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:20,650
to build a word would go back and make

00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:22,690
all these funny little noises and he

00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,700
thought it was absolutely hysterical and

00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:27,310
at one point I thought oh this is

00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,080
actually not a good thing because he's

00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:30,670
learning the wrong thing because he's

00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,770
always choosing the wrong thing because

00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:36,100
he loves the sound that they make when

00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:38,110
it's wrong and then I forced myself not

00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:40,090
to intervene because he was having such

00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:42,670
a ball it was something I didn't want to

00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:46,920
interrupt and I stood and I watched him

00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:49,710
and I thought you know he can't

00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:51,970
consistently choose the wrong sound

00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:55,960
unless he knows which one is the right

00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:57,760
sound and sure enough when he was about

00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,740
five we'd been out shopping and I'd

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,180
bought a copy of green eggs and ham and

00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,380
I tossed it down on the coffee table to

00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,570
read to the kids later and I was

00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,160
unpacking the groceries and I turned

00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:08,530
around and he picked it up and was

00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:12,130
reading it aloud to his sister and I

00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:14,080
went you can read and I hadn't taught

00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,730
him to read he just played with these

00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,800
games

00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:19,210
nobody had like even the games although

00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,520
they were educational they were kind of

00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:22,810
open-ended they weren't you start here

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,190
and you work your way through and hey by

00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,050
the end you're reading they would just

00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:28,360
explore these different things and do

00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:30,940
all these different activities and he'd

00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:33,669
learned to read even was like mountain

00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,860
and I was just gobs mate

00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:38,380
and that was through this okay making

00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:41,380
heaps and heaps of mistakes and if you

00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:44,830
can do that if you can catch a way for

00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:47,710
the mistakes to be fun and it to be okay

00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:49,660
a you end up with a mental health

00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,360
outcome that's a lot better for

00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:57,840
everybody and you also have much more

00:34:52,360 --> 00:35:01,840
effective learning so to wrap it all up

00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:04,630
basically society and the way we live is

00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,200
all about choices and something that

00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:10,810
people tend to forget in most part is

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,310
that money and finances because one of

00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:14,790
the things that open education tries to

00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:17,230
move away from is very high cost courses

00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:21,370
money is that something we dreamt up

00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:22,300
okay it doesn't exist we made it up it's

00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,670
a giant Fanta

00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,950
see that we all take part in which seems

00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,320
bizarre because a lot of us at rules are

00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,510
liars and it causes a lot of misery and

00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,180
suffering and all those things and yet

00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:38,230
we made it up we could choose to not do

00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:39,790
it at any time okay at some point in the

00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:41,830
past way back when we were starting

00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:43,780
agriculture and we started to exchange

00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:45,640
things with each other we went okay well

00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,290
I'm gonna give you this sheep and then

00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,940
next time your wheat fields got some

00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:51,610
surplus I'd like you to give that to me

00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:54,250
and that grew into money and we are

00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:55,750
where we are today we can undo that we

00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,630
can change direction we can do it

00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:02,670
differently so we don't have to charge

00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:06,010
loads of money for courses and education

00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:07,600
sure everybody needs to eat but

00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:10,240
everybody ate in prehistory when there

00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:12,040
was no money eating and money are not

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,620
two things that go together we've made

00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:19,350
them go together and that's a societal

00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:21,330
choice how we structure our classrooms

00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,740
whether we have groups of kids

00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,980
collaborating on stuff or whether we

00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:29,050
just have a teacher at the front

00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:33,730
imparting knowledge the way that we do

00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:35,170
that is again our choice okay sometimes

00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,730
it feels like we're up against this

00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:38,620
establishment that's so huge and

00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,810
overbearing it's there because we put it

00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,190
there all of us together we can change

00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:45,070
it at any time

00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:48,610
we built our society we can build it

00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:52,540
differently anytime we want in our

00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:53,920
workplaces we can choose how we work we

00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,560
can choose to do things that are more

00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:00,010
effective that have better outcomes for

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,930
everyone so if archeology teaches us

00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:04,180
anything it's that loads of different

00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:07,150
ways of approaching the world all work

00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,770
for human beings we can do that any way

00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:11,260
we want

00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:13,330
and we can make those choices we have

00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:16,300
the technology now to make a lot more

00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:19,660
choices than we did a hundred years ago

00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,280
so it's time to start looking at how we

00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,170
want to implement some of them and a lot

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,460
of that's already going on that's why

00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,960
we're having these sorts of discussions

00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:30,610
because people are starting to realize

00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:32,380
hey we can do this differently so open

00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:35,890
education is actually what we've always

00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:40,690
been doing throughout human history

00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:42,009
a few pointers keep your group size at

00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,960
less than six unless you want to have a

00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:48,220
party

00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,440
make it real kids have spent all of

00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:52,239
human history doing real stuff getting

00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,299
water for the family helping out

00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:57,269
learning to do the real stuff they won't

00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:59,890
want to do something esoteric and

00:37:57,269 --> 00:38:03,819
abstract that has no bearing on the real

00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:05,710
world one of the great failings of our

00:38:03,819 --> 00:38:07,960
education system I think in the moment

00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:10,180
is that we teach kids about voting and

00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,130
stuff when they're 11 and they don't

00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,289
care because it has nothing to do with

00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:17,349
their world at 18 when they're leaving

00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:19,180
school and starting to learn to actually

00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:19,390
need to vote we don't do anything with

00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,720
that

00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:26,549
so it's kind of backwards so if you give

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,650
kids projects that have a real outcome

00:38:26,549 --> 00:38:31,989
particularly something in the real world

00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:33,069
when my kids were at school we were in

00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:35,319
the Middle East for a while and they

00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:37,180
went to school there the teacher at some

00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:39,430
point there was a giant earthquake in

00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:41,259
Haiti and it was all over the news and

00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:43,390
the kids came into school because the

00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:45,609
class size was really small it was quite

00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,140
a small school and the kids came in

00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:48,430
really concerned about what they've seen

00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,410
on the news about the earthquake and

00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:52,329
wanting to help so the teacher she just

00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,789
chucked out all her plans for the rest

00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:57,339
of the year and they started putting

00:38:54,789 --> 00:39:00,099
together how they were going to help and

00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:02,440
they sat down had planning sessions

00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:04,359
about what they could do and she just

00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,940
built everything into that so there was

00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:08,769
the maths involved in working out what

00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,749
parcels they were going to send to that

00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:12,099
part of the world and how much it was

00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:13,839
going to cost and how much money they

00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:15,039
needed to raise and what sort of things

00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,980
they're going to do to raise money to

00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,480
send stuff and the weight of the parcels

00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,910
and all that kind of jazz that was maths

00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,769
English was about preparing the

00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:26,289
materials to convince people to bring

00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:28,119
stuff in to send for disaster relief and

00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:30,519
all this kind of jazz she built it all

00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:33,249
in those kids were so engaged for the

00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:36,279
rest of that year the outcomes they all

00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:39,279
did much better than they had been doing

00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:40,779
and all of those subjects it was just so

00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:42,309
much and she just said I should have

00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:45,609
been doing this all along I should have

00:39:42,309 --> 00:39:46,839
actually been teaching them in the

00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:47,930
context of something that they're

00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:51,710
actually doing that makes

00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:53,750
difference and along with that it's not

00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:55,190
about that red X it's not about being

00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:56,960
judged for what you do

00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:58,640
it's not about somebody looking at you

00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,830
and assessing you and what what you're

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,690
doing it's about whether it works or it

00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:05,360
doesn't work okay that's how it's always

00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:08,780
been if you set out and you've got a

00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:10,730
grand idea about how to hunt a buck that

00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,470
no one's ever thought of before and you

00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:14,810
try it out it either works or it doesn't

00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:16,160
work if it doesn't work you're a bit

00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:17,600
hungry that day and you're going to try

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,880
harder and do something different the

00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,800
next day you don't need somebody saying

00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,820
oh well buck hunting now you failed that

00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:28,520
one yeah that's not required that's

00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,650
really built in and it can be the same

00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:35,300
in the things we do if we set kids

00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:37,670
challenges to do stuff that's it works

00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:40,190
or it doesn't work then it's built in

00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:44,480
and it's not a it's not an emotional

00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:46,340
judgment and then yeah a reminder we

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,720
create our society so do you exercise

00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:50,840
your choices when you're old enough to

00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:54,560
use that ballot paper use it wisely to

00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,630
create the society that you want in your

00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:01,700
workplaces try to find the environments

00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:04,550
that actually foster the direction that

00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,780
you'd like things to go okay and I'd

00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,580
like to acknowledge the traditional

00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:09,800
owners of the land on which we meet

00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,970
which is the you can bear people and the

00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:15,170
traditional owners of the whole of

00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:17,270
Australia and then my employee catalyst

00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:21,160
and everybody else that's listed up

00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:21,160
there thank you

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,619
we have time for a few quick questions

00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:39,160
yeah particularly um hmm really enjoy

00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:42,249
that notion that you brought up of the

00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,890
Red Cross because I'm a teacher myself

00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:46,960
and I've always looked at that kind of

00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:48,970
thing as a point of view of he give them

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,920
a piece of paper and they work really

00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:54,430
hard on it they stress over it and then

00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:56,049
they kind of submit this thing and then

00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:58,180
when they get it back and there's just a

00:41:56,049 --> 00:42:01,200
cross on it with a vague explanation and

00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:03,729
they kind of go oh okay well that that

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,799
that there must be something wrong with

00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:08,950
me you know that that kind of undermines

00:42:05,799 --> 00:42:11,559
my confidence and there's no explanation

00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:13,660
of in the moment okay you know is it

00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:16,089
this way or is it that way and does this

00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:19,239
work does this not work and after a

00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:21,309
while the kid just stops trying and they

00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:23,440
just you know they'll just leave the

00:42:21,309 --> 00:42:25,809
paper blank and that's when they start

00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,210
to flounder the other thing about group

00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:32,380
sizes is one of the subjects that I

00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:34,900
teach is drama and I can definitely get

00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:37,569
behind that anything bigger the six and

00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:40,180
you've got chaos however in a whole

00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:40,960
class context if you're talking to the

00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:43,900
entire class

00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,670
that's the story time and that's the

00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,710
thing that needs to be engaging and

00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:51,130
entertaining and capture their

00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:53,940
imagination so I really enjoyed that

00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:57,519
that notion because that kind of

00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:59,940
reinforced what I already believe so

00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:59,940
thank you

00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:13,579
so in my teaching style I'm kind of like

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,999
the super expert and it's very hard to

00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:22,180
get my students to do things for

00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:24,950
themselves because they know that I know

00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:28,240
so what I want to know whether you think

00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:32,660
there's a place both for sort of the

00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:35,029
extroverted plugged-in teacher and the

00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:38,329
sorts expert who's like kind of the

00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:39,049
shame and or or something like that yeah

00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:42,289
absolutely

00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:44,809
I'm I mean in those pictures I can

00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:50,809
gallop back if it's gonna go fast enough

00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:52,670
but the role of the mentor is critical I

00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:57,769
mean it's something that I didn't really

00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:59,210
spend a lot of time on but you know like

00:43:57,769 --> 00:44:01,309
this check here and partying is

00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:05,630
knowledge people who have huge amounts

00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:07,369
of knowledge that will be respected by

00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:09,680
people who are wanting to learn and as

00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:11,989
long as they're not disengaged they'll

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,089
want to get use you as a resource to get

00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:19,130
that knowledge and it's all about how

00:44:14,089 --> 00:44:21,200
that's done so if you were to just stand

00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:22,460
up and lecture and drone on at the front

00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,549
of the classroom people are gonna fall

00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:27,109
asleep I heard the definition of a

00:44:25,549 --> 00:44:31,069
lecture as someone who talks in someone

00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:32,900
else's sleep but if as I'm sure you do

00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:35,329
you actually get down and you engage for

00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:37,369
the kids and you use yourself as a font

00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:39,619
of knowledge as as a resource that they

00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:40,910
can tap hey we're really stuck with this

00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:43,369
we have no idea and you can come along

00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:47,359
go huh have you thought of looking at it

00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:49,180
this way then that opens that and yeah

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:51,349
so I definitely think there's a role for

00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:55,849
subject matter experts there's a role

00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:57,829
for mentoring and as the previous chap

00:44:55,849 --> 00:45:01,099
said you know in that kind of story

00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:02,450
giving if you've got huge amounts of

00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:04,940
knowledge and and you've got a lovely

00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,900
extroverted way of delivering that then

00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:08,630
that's brilliant

00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:11,989
they won't definitely engage so I work

00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:13,579
with people who are a lot better

00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:15,630
facilitators I guess than I am and I

00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:20,930
think the combination

00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:23,900
yeah this is sort of valuable yeah

00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:27,079
definitely

00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,079
last question

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,800
I teach at uni and so I've got a lot of

00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:40,190
students who come from overseas yep

00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:43,310
and looking back at sure the Big Red

00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:45,560
Cross slide oh yeah we have a lot of

00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:47,630
local students who go our big red cross

00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:50,750
stop engaging so same sort of experience

00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:53,630
at uni I also have those students for

00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:56,570
overseas and they have a culture of oh I

00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:58,880
failed that when can I resubmit yeah

00:45:56,570 --> 00:46:00,410
right so we don't have that in our

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,000
particular culture because we're done

00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:05,030
and dusted that's it you've got so many

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,859
marks we move on we don't really have

00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:10,730
that revisit that option whereas love

00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:12,859
all the cultures do so I've always found

00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,910
this very sort of challenging kind

00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:15,260
approach because other people they do

00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:16,609
want to resubmit and they do want to do

00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:18,770
a better job and they do want to learn

00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:20,150
from that mistake but we've kind of got

00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:21,890
a built into our teaching culture that

00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:25,190
we don't allow that or we just don't

00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:27,260
have time for it yeah so what I said

00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,970
there was what people learn from that is

00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,920
to avoid that and people learn to avoid

00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:33,440
that in different ways some will give up

00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:37,460
and some will go I'm gonna make sure

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,480
that I get that wrong ever again that's

00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,579
one of the things that I've been trying

00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,740
to do there is oh that's not working yet

00:46:40,579 --> 00:46:44,180
you know you'd provide that mentor thing

00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:46,730
in your workshops and you get them to go

00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:49,880
in a different direction yeah

00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:52,160
and that's that opportunity I don't know

00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:55,010
I don't really have the classroom kind

00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,900
of thing but it's we've tried to

00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:58,790
minimize our lecture time and try and

00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:01,130
increase our workshop time exactly how

00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:05,380
huge dividends are that's exactly yeah

00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:05,380
yep cool awesome

00:47:06,709 --> 00:47:09,709

00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,769
