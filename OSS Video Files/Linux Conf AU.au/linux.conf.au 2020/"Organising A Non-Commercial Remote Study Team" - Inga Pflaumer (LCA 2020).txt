A year ago in my free time, I started a remote study group for female junior developers, focusing on creating a game using Node.js, React, Redux and Electron. This year, three of the participants found jobs in the industry, and the project continues to grow.
How do you motivate junior developers to work in a non-profit study project? What are the main issues for them, and how to address those? How do you inspire people to learn, let them experiment and try new things, but at the same time deliver results and move the project forward? And to do all of this with an all-remote team?

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

nicely from everything that was said

00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:08,309
before so Who am I

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:11,429
my name is Inga Plummer I'm a software

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,920
developer not an educator but I have a

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,289
passion for mentoring so I mentor a lot

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,210
for muses coaches in Sydney and women

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,449
who code and I was organised a couple of

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,460
game development groups so I'm very

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,859
passionate about bringing people into

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,080
death also I am accordion er if you're

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,689
ordinary and he always has to be in my

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,230
slides because he's a corgi what do you

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,660
expect so I am here to share my

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,840
experience working on a non-commercial

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,219
project and talk a bit about difference

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,559
between commercial and non-commercial

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,129
educational projects that are currently

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,539
running so you can imagine the main

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,440
difference between commercial and

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:55,829
non-commercial projects is money because

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,020
on non-commercial projects on commercial

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:02,969
projects people work for like work for

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:05,070
self growth they work for the interest

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,439
their own interests and for money so if

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,729
you take money out of equation you're

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:13,439
only left with self growth and learning

00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:15,810
so I think it's an interesting question

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,520
that you can actually ask yourself even

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,290
at your workplace what will happen if I

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,670
take money out of equation who will

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:26,460
actually stay in the project so that's

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,159
what I'm trying to point you towards in

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,500
this talk to think about commercial and

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,049
to think of what we can learn from

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:37,770
non-commercial projects and apply it to

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,829
commercial projects so this talk is

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,860
based on my personal project called bit

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,750
van it's a computer game and it started

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,070
from a very simple idea I just wanted to

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,860
make my own game and I posted on

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,780
Facebook like who wants to join me and a

00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,460
couple of my friends just got excited

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,110
like we definitely want to participate

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,600
in this we have zero programming

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,979
experience I'm like okay we'll see what

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,210
we can do and then more people joined

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,479
and they also had zero programming

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,450
experience so as a result instead of

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,580
just making a game it became this

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,890
educational project with the distributed

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,090
team that's like all across the globe so

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,870
it was pretty interesting

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,250
just a small insight into a project over

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,800
the course of the project which is about

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,110
two years now we had about 50 plus

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,610
members so people are joining they're

00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,459
learning what they want to learn and

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,770
they move on so some of the people who

00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,510
joined with your experiences now they're

00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,580
experienced now have jobs in the

00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,350
industry just because they like worked

00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,850
on this project it helped them to build

00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,959
their confidence and actually go and

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:43,810
find jobs so we usually have about 10

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,370
active members at every time and by

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,709
active members I mean people who are

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,500
currently developing the project not the

00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,630
people who just joined and learning how

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,730
to get in or not people who learnt and

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,700
left so generally is like around 10

00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,700
people who working on animations working

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:04,510
on arts working on the code on sounds

00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,430
and everything so in the first year we

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,489
actually completed our Minimum Viable

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,110
Product and it had a very strict scope

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:14,050
that's the only reason we were actually

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,730
able to finish it but then we had the

00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,100
conversation we decided not to release

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,930
it we decided to work on it a bit more

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,480
because there are some other interesting

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,340
as I said main focus was learning and we

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,180
decided there are more things that we

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:30,220
can learn from it so yes we're working

00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,780
on a network game now because no one in

00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,470
the team has any experience with not

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,880
working so we just had to fix it and we

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,920
went through two big cycles of

00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,720
refactoring because personally I think

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,640
we factoring is very important for

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,620
junior developers because it actually

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,340
helped them to see how much they're

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:50,799
grown over time so I'm a big fan big fan

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:54,700
of refactoring and automated tests but

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,170
later so it's a hot seat game based on

00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,000
Russian folklore that's actually the

00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,269
previous version of UI we changed it a

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
bit

00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:05,680
but overall that's a very simple card

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,630
game there is not much to it so main

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,820
question that I had to ask myself even

00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,200
before the project started was how the

00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,940
hell am I going to keep people

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,019
interested in that if I'm not paying

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:19,450
them so because programming is hard and

00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,140
there's no money and they have no

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,169
experience

00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:25,180
so my team finding motivation finding a

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:25,389
way to make sure people are staying in

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,069
the

00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:29,229
project and they're doing things and

00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:31,990
they're growing was very very important

00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:35,110
I want to share an important quote with

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:38,289
you it's actually inspired me through

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:40,479
the through the process i define leader

00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:42,219
as anyone who takes responsibility for

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,840
finding the potential and people and

00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:47,379
processes and who has the courage to

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,419
develop that potential so this idea of

00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:51,969
helping people to develop their own

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:54,550
potential was very important for me I

00:04:51,969 --> 00:04:57,370
would say it was like the main reason

00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:01,060
the main force behind the project for me

00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:03,099
so how can you develop potential in

00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,500
programming in people who never

00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:09,069
programmed before that was an

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:13,180
interesting question to solve problem to

00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:15,340
solve so first I'm a big believer in

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,099
information so I actually started with a

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,740
very detailed explanation of what roles

00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:23,589
and the projects are and what can you do

00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,719
and I just asked people to ask

00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:29,139
themselves this question what do you

00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:30,699
actually want to do we did not as I said

00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:33,159
we did not require any experience in the

00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:37,060
project and more importantly we did not

00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:39,969
require any commitment so there was a

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,949
try anyone could try any role in a

00:05:39,969 --> 00:05:43,629
project like today you want to do this

00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:45,490
you want to learn front-end web

00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:47,110
development perfect here are the

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,060
learning resources I'll teach you I'll

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,490
help you out tomorrow you want to move

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,219
into UI experiences ok here are the

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:58,029
resources you can try and do some UI if

00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:59,770
you want to as a result it actually had

00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:02,439
some amazing results because like two

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,719
years into the project my UX designers

00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:06,759
can do front-end my front-end people can

00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:09,099
do back-end so we got into

00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:14,889
cross-functional team just by not

00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:18,639
committing to arrow so another thing as

00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:22,599
you probably know motivation is this

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,219
very interesting sweet spot that when

00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:26,770
you make sure that people are working on

00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:29,589
the edge of their knowledge so they're

00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,210
always learning thing but I never pushed

00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:34,659
into the zone when they don't know

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:36,399
anything so they're never lost and with

00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,689
junior developers when developers with

00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:39,339
no experience

00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,439
hard to find this spot because they

00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:43,989
don't owe anything the good thing is

00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,549
they will learn as they will learn you

00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:48,039
will learn you will know what motivates

00:06:45,549 --> 00:06:50,469
them you will know how far you can push

00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:55,509
them and how do you react to those push

00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:57,759
or pushes the next step is very

00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:59,459
important for every team commercial or

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,110
non-commercial is to have clear goals

00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:05,589
lucky for us our goals were pretty clear

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:10,419
from the beginning it also links to the

00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:13,719
motivation so our goals were first to

00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:15,789
learn to learn the tech to learn the

00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:19,119
process to have this development

00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:20,649
experience second was to engage and I

00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:22,419
don't mean engage players

00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,979
I mean engage people who were on the

00:07:22,419 --> 00:07:26,409
project because it was a learning

00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:29,139
project and as I said motivation is very

00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:33,159
important in those conditions and the

00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:34,749
third one was making a fun game so every

00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:38,189
step that we took in a process was

00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:41,949
evaluated against those three goals and

00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:44,349
as I said they are prioritized what I

00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:47,669
mean by that every question that we

00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:51,610
asked was ourselves in relation to check

00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:54,369
we had to evaluate the answer against

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:57,009
all of those metrics first question

00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:59,679
react for junior developers with no

00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,329
experience like it's definitely not

00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,009
engaging because react is scary

00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:04,569
especially if you have people who never

00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:07,149
wrote any line of JavaScript in their

00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:08,829
lives but react is a very important

00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,649
technology that's very popular so it's

00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:13,869
really nice to learn it as a result yes

00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:16,499
we want to react because it definitely

00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:20,169
aligned with our first goal learning

00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:22,959
another example should we focus on like

00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:25,569
test groups focus groups and player

00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,329
experience because it's very important

00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:30,939
when you make in a fun game but we were

00:08:28,329 --> 00:08:33,430
not learning how to make a fun game we

00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:36,579
were learning a tech stack so we decided

00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:40,919
maybe our game won't be that fun but we

00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:43,539
will focus on other things the next

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:46,179
important thing is to know your limits

00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:49,540
it's very important to know what

00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:50,400
actually limits you for us clearly the

00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,800
limit is

00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,890
obvious we had an experienced developers

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,339
who had no idea what they're doing

00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:01,010
and as a result again we tried to align

00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,779
it with everything that we were doing

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:06,420
that's how we got into unidirectional

00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:09,270
flow and staff-driven architecture so

00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,070
delay literally the limit was how the

00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:14,160
hell am I going to explain it to juniors

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,810
so with that question in mind we started

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,370
making some decisions on our

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:24,720
architecture another limit is engagement

00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:27,120
and support because managing managing

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:31,440
the level of interest was very important

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,910
so yeah to keep the team engaged we had

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,900
to have something on the screen as soon

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,690
as possible

00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:38,450
again it affected our planning for

00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,010
example question test-driven development

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:45,240
should we apply it on front-end or

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:47,520
back-end or both the answer was yes on

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,089
back-end no on front-end because on

00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,010
front-end

00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:51,390
we wanted to see something on the screen

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,430
as soon as possible

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,680
instead of writing the test for six

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,810
months yes it would allow us to have

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,240
more stable environment and more stable

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,580
game but I couldn't keep people

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,570
interested in for six months without

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:09,209
showing them anything that's happening

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:11,279
so another important thing is immediate

00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:13,380
feedback for developers what does this

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,730
mean junior developers cannot look at

00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,970
the code and say if it's going to work

00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:21,480
or not they're not there yet and even

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:23,070
I'm not there yet so that's why we

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,920
actually apply it as driven development

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,750
on back-end because we have the very

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,940
good test coverage so the moment

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,980
developer writes something they run

00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,110
their tests they immediately see okay

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,690
the test passes is green I can continue

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:41,400
or oh my god the test is red I should

00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:43,620
probably stop and fix it we also had

00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,930
immediate feedback not just on code but

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,790
also on some game economy stuff we had

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,830
some simulations written to make sure

00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:52,500
that our game balance still works so

00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,750
tests were very important to us to get

00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:59,300
this immediate feedback to see that our

00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:02,029
developers are doing the right thing and

00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,399
isn't a nice tidy project it was very

00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:07,940
important to allow experiments as much

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,680
as possible that may be not the case for

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,029
a commercial projects because you

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,800
probably don't want people breaking

00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:14,420
stuff all the time but for a

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,160
non-commercial project that was very

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,890
important because we wanted to make sure

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,690
that people have a chance to explore

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,610
have a chance to see what they want to

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:26,080
do and how to do the stuff they want to

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:29,570
do and another important limit is a

00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,339
communication we are a remote team we're

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:34,100
not in one place we're not in the one

00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:36,410
time zone were not in one continent so

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,480
we have developers in us we have

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,520
developers in Russia we have developers

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,300
in Europe we have developers in Cyprus

00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:46,850
so it was really really hard to find to

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,459
build the communication it's not just

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,920
about finding a time for calls was how

00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:55,040
do you explain stuff to each other how

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:59,450
do you communicate ideas so as a result

00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:02,060
we drew a lot of boxes like every idea

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,880
every textured decision that we tried to

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,430
make we start off with that we started

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,790
with boxes trying to explain what we're

00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:13,940
doing here is the example for what we're

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,820
did a couple of months ago decoupling of

00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:19,130
our engine in our game terminal so we

00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,079
started with boxes that's how it is

00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:24,290
right now here our players here are

00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:25,730
terminal here's our engine then we're

00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,680
going through the steps that's the

00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:31,399
second step third step and the result

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,529
should be like this so this again helps

00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:35,930
with communication and it also helps

00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:37,850
with onboarding because you can show

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,140
this schema to a person and explain

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:40,670
what's happening there and they

00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:45,200
understand it much better than if you

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:49,190
just say it to them over Skype call and

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:51,589
when you know your limits when you know

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:56,029
your goals you can build your heat

00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:59,180
texture around it so let's talk about

00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:00,920
design architecture for a bit more so as

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:04,190
I said we went with a unidirectional

00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,899
data flow we also went for some specific

00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,970
technologies that's actually why I'm

00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:10,910
here because we went with node on back

00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,570
end electron as a connector and react on

00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,570
front end

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,750
as I said we went with stab driven

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,840
project and the moment I hear state I

00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:23,970
immediately think react so that was the

00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:29,280
question but the answer for us so here

00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:32,250
is the note electron and so yeah here is

00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:34,050
a short summary of electron it starts

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:37,200
the version of crawl and it allows you

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,480
to connect to your node processes slack

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,100
atom and I think Skype are built using

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,020
electron nowadays so it's a pretty

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,320
popular technology and a lot of people

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:49,140
are using it so how did we apply it and

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,350
why it was important to get to this

00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:54,600
unidirectional data flow as I said we

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:58,290
draw a lot of skin person everything to

00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,900
explain stuff to people so yeah electron

00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:06,210
gives you this very nice separation of

00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:10,470
duty which is very important your front

00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:12,810
end communicates with electron then it

00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,630
goes to back end you back and

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:18,060
communicates with your game data then it

00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,100
goes other direction your back end sends

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,800
your games data through electron to your

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,320
front end and then your front end draws

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,480
the game when it's needed your front end

00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,480
takes the user input from the user and

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:35,400
it sends it back so as you can see your

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:38,060
data always goes one way and your front

00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:41,850
end always sends actions to back end so

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:44,910
why was it important it gives you a very

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:47,700
clear separation of duty you know your

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:50,370
messages you know what goes you know

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:52,380
what goes out you know what goes in so

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,810
this way your developers can actually

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,820
work pretty independently like you back

00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,400
and knows that that's the messages that

00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,050
we're going to get and that's the code

00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,300
that we have to write your front end

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,580
knows okay that's the game data adjacent

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,400
we're going to get so we can work on

00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:10,140
that again it helps with motivation

00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,300
because now people are not blocked on

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,920
stuff they're not waiting until back and

00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,110
finishes things and they're not waiting

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,240
and to front-end finishes things they

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:23,250
can work together they can communicate

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,780
and build things so yeah if you web

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,250
developer you probably thought okay that

00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,470
sounds like redux

00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:31,650
and it totally does we ended up not

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,970
using redux for again very important

00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:35,970
reason how the hell am I going to

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:38,340
explain relaxed to trainers I decided it

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,680
might be a bit difficult and that's why

00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,510
we use three ducks like but not redux

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,370
completely as I said you need to know

00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:49,220
your limits and you need to evaluate

00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:49,220
your decisions against those limits

00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:57,870
another important thing and interesting

00:15:53,940 --> 00:16:00,900
decisions that were made we wanted to

00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:02,910
engage people participating in the

00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,010
project we wanted to make sure that at

00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,440
every stop step of the way they're

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,480
interested that's how we always keep

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,540
like at least 10 members participating

00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,300
because it's fun because because they

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:18,570
can experiment because they can do

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,340
things and at the same time we're always

00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:23,460
try to make sure that our changes are

00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:25,740
safe what does it mean it means that our

00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:28,080
big picture doesn't suffer because when

00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,360
you work on a project you write a code

00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,910
then you go and pull it from a repo and

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:37,200
nothing works that's not much of a ting

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:39,030
that's actually DVD racing so yeah we

00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,650
solve this first with economy

00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,880
simulations for those who don't know

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,910
they're pretty popular in game

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,040
development for us it's a simple model

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:51,030
Monte Carlo simulation that anyone can

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,610
write it just runs 100k random games it

00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:56,100
shows you who's winning who's losing how

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,589
often and based on that you can see like

00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,120
okay my game balance is good no my game

00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:03,480
balance is not good I broke something

00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,000
and this allows people to experiment add

00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,310
their own cards add their own characters

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,530
run the simulation see this character is

00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:15,660
too powerful or if this card is not

00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:17,040
powerful enough and automated test as I

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:20,130
said we have pretty good coverage and

00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:22,860
back-end we're still working on that and

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,800
again it's not because we love testing

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:27,959
it's because we needed tools to make

00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:31,850
sure people are staying in the project

00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,850
to make sure the project moves forward

00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:38,260
always iterate on all of those decisions

00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:39,940
are they still valid are they still

00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:44,110
working are they still doing what

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:49,080
they're supposed to do so the goal of

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:51,760
this talk with this example was not to

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,280
was to show you that there are no

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,440
perfect conditions there are no perfect

00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:58,630
conditions if your own educational

00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:03,280
project there are no perfect conditions

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:05,679
if your own commercial project but for

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,169
your knowledge of those conditions your

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,330
understanding of what it what the team

00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:13,210
is like what are the people that you

00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,860
work in with what do they want how they

00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,530
want to proceed whether they're looking

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,480
for is very important and that's what

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,790
should actually affect your cachexia

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,549
that's what should form your decisions

00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:25,960
not that's a cool check let's just play

00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:29,820
with that

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:32,230
so yes commercial and non-commercial

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,760
motivation is very important for

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,799
non-commercial project because otherwise

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,540
you just won't get done but it's also

00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,190
very important for commercial projects

00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,929
because if you have people who are

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:42,880
already on your project you probably

00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:46,260
want to keep them you want to keep them

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,000
engaged cross-functionality

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,590
it really depends on the project like

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,890
I'm a big fan of cross-functionality

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:55,330
because always work in small teams so

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,280
it's very important to make sure we

00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,140
don't have a person who like if they

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,260
fall out of the project nothing happens

00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:06,910
but maybe for like big enterprises is

00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:09,460
not that important clear goals are very

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:10,660
important of course they can be really

00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,150
different for commercial and

00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:17,020
non-commercial projects because having

00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:19,330
fun is having a happy client those are

00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,950
two different things but still you need

00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:23,380
to understand why you're doing what

00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:27,100
you're doing what's the reasoning behind

00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:31,630
all of your decisions understanding of

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:34,570
your limits limits a row is where limits

00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:37,780
are where all the risks are like your

00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:39,640
limits actually define your risks that's

00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,070
why you need to know them that's going

00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,130
to analyze them and figure out how they

00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:50,030
should affect your decisions

00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:51,800
and experiments let's be honest on the

00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:54,110
commercial projects you won't control

00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:56,630
experiments you don't want people to run

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:59,540
wild and break everything but it's still

00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,010
important because we're in development

00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,650
because we're passionate about it

00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:05,840
because we want to create cool things we

00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:10,670
want to write cool things we'll love it

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:14,150
so being very strict if being confined

00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:15,590
to one one task or one specific thing

00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:17,840
that you're doing can be very

00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:22,970
discouraging so that's why I think

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:25,760
experiments are important in both and

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:27,650
tester refactoring I personally think

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,480
it's actually critical in a commercial

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,700
project because in our non-commercial

00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,350
project if the game breaks for two weeks

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,920
and no one can download it that's

00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:39,380
totally fine that's just us as that's a

00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,120
pet project for us even a commercial

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,940
project something doesn't work for two

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,490
weeks you're in trouble so that's why

00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:49,220
for me testing and refactoring all the

00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:53,180
time is very important for both of those

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:55,310
projects so how can you apply any of the

00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:58,220
stuff that I just told you about first

00:20:55,310 --> 00:21:01,430
ask yourselves with the team that you're

00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,860
currently in what motivates your team

00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:07,010
members what prevents them from

00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:09,170
progressing and how those two things are

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,820
reflected in your process are they

00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:13,900
reflected in your process are you

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:16,760
actually asking yourself those questions

00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,530
also try to figure out what's the main

00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,860
limitation on your project maybe it's

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:24,260
time maybe it's a client maybe it's

00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:28,250
something else but if you don't know you

00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:30,290
cannot move your development further you

00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,960
cannot make it better you cannot

00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:37,520
actually iterate until you know all

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:40,190
those answers know your limits know your

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:43,580
goals align your decisions with those

00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:47,000
things so that's the main idea of the

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,650
talk thank you so much for your time you

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,820
can find me on Twitter medium LinkedIn

00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:56,420
talk to me if you have any questions on

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:59,030
electron or non-commercial projects and

00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:01,010
called the Einstein isn't there and it's

00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:10,190
Christmas it's still Christmas yourself

00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:30,110
that's it thank you so much any

00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:32,780
questions for me yeah so how do you

00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:35,750
teach people tools that are not cool and

00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:40,160
sexy first you can always lie that

00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:43,460
they're cool and sexy I mean okay that's

00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:46,760
not the perfect answer but as I said

00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:49,880
when you know your goal you can actually

00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,460
communicate a lot better because okay

00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,110
right in those automated tests maybe not

00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,510
the most interesting thing in the world

00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,040
but if you have those tests you're

00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:01,100
immediately know that your stuff is

00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,920
broken so what I try to do I try to

00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,930
actually explain all the decisions I was

00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,820
making to make sure that people

00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:09,590
understand them not on the level okay

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,770
here we need three ducks here we need

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:15,740
react but on level how it relates to the

00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:17,780
team why this is important not just for

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,820
you but for everyone else it's much

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,680
easier now because people who spend like

00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,540
a year on this project they still they

00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,640
understand like for example why do we

00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,740
need the commentation because new people

00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,660
are coming on board so which money we

00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,520
have to make it easier for them do you

00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,620
remember how hard it was for you when

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:40,090
there was no documentation so I think

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:40,090
it's mostly in communication yep

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,930
teaching new people code what surprised

00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:51,290
you in terms of what they could

00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:54,110
understand easily or what they couldn't

00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,970
they've had trouble with was there

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,310
anything that you'd assumed would be one

00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:01,550
way and was the other and vice versa I

00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:03,140
actually had a very interesting problem

00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,450
that puzzled me for a while it's not

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,710
what happens at code related but when we

00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:09,899
started planning we had our first us

00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,710
Trelleborg it was a very pretty

00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:13,409
marvelous

00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,059
no one was claiming tickets like there

00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:16,950
were tickets and there were people who

00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:19,590
were clearly excited like I want to work

00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:21,750
on this I want to do this and no one was

00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:24,600
adding their names to tickets I started

00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:27,899
like why am I not explaining something

00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:30,600
correctly what's happening and I started

00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:32,940
like investigating and I learned that

00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,130
they just felt uncomfortable claiming

00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,770
tickets on their own because it's too

00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:40,200
much responsibility like I'm a junior I

00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,270
know nothing if I take this basket will

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,399
become mine and all the responsibilities

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:48,120
will become mine so what I did actually

00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:50,669
said look people don't claim the ticket

00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,130
on your own claim tickets as a couple as

00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:56,460
a team claim there's two three or four

00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:58,409
people and it actually worked magically

00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,330
because they started working on tickets

00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:02,580
together and we are remote team so we

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,260
don't like there is not there is no such

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,450
thing as too much communication and the

00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,549
remote team but they started working

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,080
together they started coding together

00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,070
and they still do it like two years in

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,630
the project they're still claiming

00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,610
ticket like two or three people at the

00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:16,080
same time and they find their own time

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,539
their own calendars I'm not

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,220
participating in that because I sleep at

00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:22,260
that time usually they're in the other

00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,059
part of the globe but they're working

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,450
together trying to solve the problem

00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:28,890
just because I gave them this chance

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,539
like it's so much responsibility

00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,520
I'm not going to pressure you into this

00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:36,480
responsibility I'll just give you a

00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,309
chance to share it so there were a lot

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,710
of things like that just there they're

00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:42,840
small and you don't immediately like I'm

00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,850
a web developer so I have all of this

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,669
experience and I don't remember clearly

00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:49,890
what were my issues with beginning so

00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:52,440
just investigating a bit more trying to

00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:54,570
figure out what what's behind the

00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,909
problem that you're experiencing helped

00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:05,429
me a lot but yeah this ticket situation

00:25:56,909 --> 00:26:06,840
was beginning anyone else I can ask you

00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:09,000
a quick question I was just wondering

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,529
what happened to all the people that

00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,270
have been through your program that have

00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:17,429
now left the group if they gone on and

00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:22,220
found commercial work if you yes some of

00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:25,020
them found work and not all of them also

00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:27,000
because we don't like it's not just

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,649
developers we also had some artists like

00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,299
for example two of our artists never

00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:33,720
actually worked with digital art before

00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:35,940
there were very large estate word for

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,409
that so they were drawing in real life

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,510
and they just wanted to experiment for

00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:41,610
that so yes they practiced with us the

00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:44,100
other did it to their resumes and they

00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:46,919
found more digital work as a result of

00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:49,649
that we have a couple of developers who

00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:52,409
actually went to and found jobs in the

00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:54,750
industry two of our UX designers

00:26:52,409 --> 00:26:56,850
actually started with us having no prior

00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:00,090
UX knowledge and now their work as UX

00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:02,850
designers so there are people as I said

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,529
we're not forcing people to stay if you

00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,600
want to come in Loudoun something and

00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:10,080
then move on that's totally fine with us

00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,330
because we're trying to build I think at

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,490
this point building a friendly

00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:16,500
atmosphere and I probably should have

00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:19,049
said that but the project mostly focuses

00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,789
focuses on female developers so we're

00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:24,380
all of our team was female

00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:27,809
like focuses there's no from the team

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:30,240
and so the goal was to just help them

00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:32,279
learn so they learn what they want and

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,130
they move on that's totally fine with us

00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:36,840
sometimes people who found jobs in the

00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:40,139
industry now they come back and they're

00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:42,179
like can you help me with Redux like I'm

00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:43,950
sure let's rewrite this couple of

00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:45,539
classes for attacks and see what happens

00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,309
so they still come back with questions

00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:50,370
and everything so it's like this

00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:52,649
mentoring thing that happens but yeah as

00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:57,080
far as I know people are pretty happy

00:27:52,649 --> 00:27:57,080
about this and I'm very proud of that

00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:05,580
okay anyone else no perfect I think it's

00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,760
lunch time sorry for taking a bit of a

00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:11,980
french-style thank you thank you so much

00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,980
