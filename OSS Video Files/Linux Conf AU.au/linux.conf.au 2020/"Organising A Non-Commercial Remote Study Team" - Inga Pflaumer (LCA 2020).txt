A year ago in my free time, I started a remote study group for female junior developers, focusing on creating a game using Node.js, React, Redux and Electron. This year, three of the participants found jobs in the industry, and the project continues to grow.
How do you motivate junior developers to work in a non-profit study project? What are the main issues for them, and how to address those? How do you inspire people to learn, let them experiment and try new things, but at the same time deliver results and move the project forward? And to do all of this with an all-remote team?

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
