VPN (Virtual Private Networks) is a prominent technology solution to help consumers and businesses to protect their data and secure their privacy. The VPN market has grown exponentially over the last 10 years. 

Ironically, customer's privacy does not always comes first for companies in the VPN business. Effective privacy requires real transparency.

That's why we are working in a complete VPN solution called TheVPNCompany which will be open source. This solution includes all elements required to run a VPN business: website, automation for all the systems via configuration management systems, and real time monitoring. 

Due to its open source nature, it is as transparent as you can get and anybody can audit how it works. 

This task also discusses the major issues that exists in the VPN market. Although most VPN services claim that they do not collect users data, we will discuss what user data needs to be collected to be able to operate a VPN service.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/
