VPN (Virtual Private Networks) is a prominent technology solution to help consumers and businesses to protect their data and secure their privacy. The VPN market has grown exponentially over the last 10 years. 

Ironically, customer's privacy does not always comes first for companies in the VPN business. Effective privacy requires real transparency.

That's why we are working in a complete VPN solution called TheVPNCompany which will be open source. This solution includes all elements required to run a VPN business: website, automation for all the systems via configuration management systems, and real time monitoring. 

Due to its open source nature, it is as transparent as you can get and anybody can audit how it works. 

This task also discusses the major issues that exists in the VPN market. Although most VPN services claim that they do not collect users data, we will discuss what user data needs to be collected to be able to operate a VPN service.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

VPN industry he's played a prominent

more than 18 years of experience working

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,020

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,419
[Applause]

00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:25,560
thank you this morning in the first talk

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:29,090
we actually spoke about the Ono moments

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,680
in technology in different times and

00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,460
after listening to that role I actually

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:40,310
think that we are in a oh no moment at

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:43,380
least in what is it is the BPM industry

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:46,130
when I do work as a consultant one other

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,750
things that I do is to help teams

00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,330
becoming agile on different countries so

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,500
I've been traveling in Thailand raised

00:01:51,330 --> 00:02:03,170
Armenia Sri Lanka Delhi and as well I

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:07,590
went to China I knew China so I knew

00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:10,200
about a Great Firewall in China and as

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,260
well about the censorship the big

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,769
countries lynnium but I never got ready

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,470
for that when I arrived to China and the

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:22,500
receptionist in the hotel with Anna

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,299
speak any English I say look this is not

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,840
a problem I'm gonna take them a while

00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:31,230
I'm gonna go to Google Translate and oh

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,930
it's not working later on in the same

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,940
trip I have to travel somewhere and I

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,510
say okay that's fine I take Google Maps

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,140
which was not working either but this is

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,180
not a problem

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,630
I will just need to install a new

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,570
application and the up a storm sorry the

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:51,750
Play Store it wasn't working either so I

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:54,660
say look I really need to learn a little

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,290
bit about the VPN how they work because

00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:01,530
I do need one for work but what I found

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,109
out in the industry it is not a pretty

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:08,400
picture

00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:09,780
if you go to any VPN company that is

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,739
available right now

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:17,190
you probably will find on a schema such

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:20,280
as this one it is great you installed

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:24,209
your VPN and suddenly you are secure all

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,920
over internet this is an oversimplified

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:32,770
version of what

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:35,860
BPM actually is their reality it looks a

00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:38,680
little more like this one so you have

00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:42,970
your device which it creates this panel

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,490
encrypted to a VPN endpoint but there is

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,260
gonna be some part of the trip to the

00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:53,950
rig of services that you want to access

00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:55,840
that the VPN has no effect at all so if

00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,950
you are using an encrypted protocol

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:05,200
somebody can still access into this

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:07,660
communication so very quickly I want to

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,900
run over the advantages so we have this

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:13,750
tunnel and we have a VPN endpoint that

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,510
you can choose to locate on different

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:19,030
parts of the world so advantage number

00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:21,519
one protect your privacy because the

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:24,640
Internet can see the IP of the PPN

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,070
endpoint not your IP and I will have one

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:30,820
part which it is encrypted so the ISP

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:33,910
cannot see what you are transmitting by

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,500
past your restrictions because that VPN

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,270
endpoint can be located anywhere in the

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,860
world so if you want to access to the

00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,560
services that they're just provided in a

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:45,760
country you just put the VPN service

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,340
there you bit censorship like in China

00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:52,900
that I could have access to certain

00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:56,380
services but if I have a VPN endpoint

00:04:52,900 --> 00:05:01,030
outside China I can access to the

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:03,250
Internet as usual save money you know

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,790
tell on flights that's how the travel

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:09,280
market works the prices that you see for

00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:12,190
sell time products it depends on the

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,470
people who is looking into it so in some

00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:16,210
websites they have those rules set up so

00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,919
you connect different countries you may

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:21,220
see different prices for the same

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,520
product you can download torrents

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:29,500
anonymously because what the internet

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:33,100
sees is actually the VPN endpoint IP you

00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:37,000
can bypass is PSV regulations if your

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,860
ISP says look HTTP we were fine but you

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,330
are trying to download a torrent it is

00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,699
going to work as long

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,099
you are using the increased tunnel the

00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:46,720
ISP doesn't have eyes on what

00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:49,330
information you are sending so they

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,849
cannot apply certain rules and secure

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,520
public Wi-Fi because well you have this

00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:58,120
tunnel so this is the standard set of

00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,830
advantages of any repairs a BPM service

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:06,639
that you can find over the Internet so

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:10,509
if I am operating a VPN service and you

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:14,919
are using these VPN service what

00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:17,409
information I can access well if you are

00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:20,440
not using an encryption marshal process

00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:23,530
here you can actually access to any sort

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,310
of information but if you are using an

00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,940
creation

00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:30,460
I can always access to the IP of the

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,039
service that you are you want to use to

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,979
the port I have the connection times

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:39,240
when you started when you finish and I

00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:42,129
have as well your IP of origin of course

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,669
with the IP and the port

00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:48,580
I might behave I probably will be able

00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:50,469
to identify what is the final service or

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,840
the final website that you are operating

00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:55,539
and with a port what is the service

00:06:52,840 --> 00:07:01,330
itself so I can get to know the domain

00:06:55,539 --> 00:07:05,860
and the company and the service but HTTP

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:10,810
and the encrypted protocols they do only

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:17,409
work if the client and the server they

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:20,949
are configured correctly for example if

00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:23,919
you have your device phone iPad whatever

00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:28,449
and you install our road

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:30,909
root certificate your device it is not

00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:33,060
longer secure and your information can

00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:40,180
be intercepted even if you are using

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:44,139
HTTP from the server side we have a set

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:47,860
of configurations such as course HTTP

00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:50,620
strict Transport Security or insecure

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,310
SSL versions where you might not have it

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,310
configured correctly

00:07:54,150 --> 00:08:00,160
depending on what you have means in this

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:03,940
configuration it will be harder or

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,700
easier to perform an attack but if it is

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:13,620
not configured correctly an attack is

00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:19,120
possible so that's the actual point so

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:21,490
we are on these tines where everyone is

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,880
being followed and everyone's

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:31,930
information is being collected George

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:35,169
Orwell 1984 and this is nowadays this is

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,750
actually becoming true with all this

00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:40,630
capability that we got to collect data

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:44,740
and all this technology that we have

00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:47,680
developed to process the information you

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,230
can really get meaningful reports for

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,680
massive amount of data

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:55,630
just remember can write analytical not

00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:01,240
an ethical work but the work was

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:05,140
actually brilliant so nowadays we want

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,410
to protect our privacy why because there

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,670
are many countries that they are

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:13,900
systematically collecting information

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:19,750
about their citizens one example

00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:22,960
Australia in Australia the ISP they have

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:27,400
to collect metadata about the internet

00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:30,790
activity of all their citizens for over

00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:36,820
two years and this information it is

00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:42,580
accessible by private agencies in USA

00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:49,150
this is even worse the ISP can actually

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:53,740
sell all your browsing history but this

00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:57,700
is happening on many many countries the

00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:00,130
trend is that the government's they want

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:04,810
to get as much information as possible

00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:07,029
of our online activity which it is

00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:12,160
getting more and more

00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:17,170
a predominant in our lives look at this

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:21,550
example Catholic stuff they government

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:26,170
did try a massive men in the middle

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:29,019
attack across the whole population so

00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:31,899
this were like this you are with your

00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:36,040
device you are in context on us turn

00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:37,810
navigating and then you have a you know

00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,129
a question would you like to install

00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:43,959
this certificate from quest net trust

00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:44,740
network I love the name you know he has

00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:47,769
the word trust

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,620
it's kind of easier right to trust it so

00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:52,379
I can imagine many people saying yes

00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:54,699
let's do it

00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:58,410
remember what I said just at the

00:10:54,699 --> 00:11:02,860
beginning if you install a row as a

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:05,079
certificate people can see your

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,139
encrypted data so the people who

00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:11,110
actually install this certificate the

00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:16,930
government will have access email

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:20,019
password bank accounts you name it this

00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,970
attack ad this didn't last long so they

00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:23,680
didn't actually try for three days and

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:28,319
the population obviously complain about

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:33,250
it and they 'mentally yesterday back off

00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:37,209
but we are under this policy and this

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:40,420
happens to many of us right so we are in

00:11:37,209 --> 00:11:42,399
this situation where you cannot trust

00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,309
your ISP because it might be collecting

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,790
data from you how do you say okay that's

00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:51,879
all right I don't trust the ISP but I

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:55,269
didn't wanna get VPN services from one

00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:59,680
company and I am gonna just trust the

00:11:55,269 --> 00:12:03,430
private company so when the law of the

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,319
ISPs in Australia it happened they

00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:08,680
people many people they call it like

00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:11,649
install the VPN day if I recall it

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:15,240
properly so that was the thinking we

00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:20,529
believe that a private company has a

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:24,269
reason to actually protect our data now

00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:29,709
gonna give in examples and in numbers

00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:32,439
all I BPM okay you have hola VPN you

00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:36,399
install it in your mobile and you will

00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:38,680
have traffic from all their users on

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:44,410
that VPN network going out of your

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:47,769
mobile hotspot shield you are using

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:55,410
hospicio you will enjoy extra

00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:57,639
advertisement but my papa hidemyass

00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:00,759
that's the name of the company i saw

00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:03,730
some laughter that's actually very

00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:08,559
popular service and this is one of the

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:12,509
worst cases that we got until now they

00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:17,459
did provide information to the FBI so

00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:20,860
one of their users could be condemned I

00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:25,000
went to the hi my ass website not long

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:27,220
ago and they still promised him you know

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,649
that they don't load your IP address so

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,649
NASA for which is kind of surprising

00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:41,620
open a free VPN well it's not a VPN it

00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:45,990
is a web proxy nothing wrong with a web

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:51,490
proxy but as you call it by its name

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:53,829
purevpn similar case they gave

00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,959
information to the FBI about the

00:13:53,829 --> 00:14:00,370
activity of one of their users which it

00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:02,680
is against of what they promised and I

00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:04,899
again I access to the web site and they

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,769
still say that they have a

00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:11,170
military-grade encryption to protect you

00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:19,269
so on and so forth which it is useless

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:22,749
in this case so VPN secure 2016 well the

00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:25,449
VPN wouldn't work the IPS will leak so

00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:28,089
not so much privacy that you could get

00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:31,209
from them and as well they were using

00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:34,390
the devices just to get information out

00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:38,110
of it sane mate

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,910
similar case IP leaks meaning that it

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:45,339
doesn't work correctly and your

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:48,970
information it is not protected Facebook

00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:51,579
on above EPM okay so this is actually

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:54,100
one of the interesting ones so you have

00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:59,320
Facebook which it is a company that

00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:03,190
profits by selling private data yet

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:07,839
they offer a BPM to help you to protect

00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:12,339
your private data it is kind of hard to

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,610
believe you know that yeah that can

00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:14,610
happen

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:23,860
Facebook research 2019 Facebook research

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:26,440
it was an application that they were

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:30,130
paying users to so the users will

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:34,269
install it if you install Facebook

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:38,200
research it actually was a VPN which

00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:41,649
would install you a row root certificate

00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:44,380
and as I said at the beginning if you

00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:46,570
install a row root certificate your

00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:50,560
device it is not secure but this is an

00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:54,190
app so it will have access to all the

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:59,440
network or network information that you

00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:04,420
are running in your mobile so yeah well

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:06,790
Ted grant in 2019 they raise the problem

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:09,160
and they contacted with a Apple Store

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,829
and they did remove the means for

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:17,230
Facebook to keep distributing this

00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:21,370
application so that's the thing we are

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:23,829
living in capitalism private companies

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:28,329
they do want to make money this is how

00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:31,000
it works so you need to check on the

00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:34,680
conflict of interest private information

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,339
if it cost money in the market has value

00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:41,140
for example if you have three VPNs how

00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:44,110
are they gonna get profit Alfred out of

00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:47,170
it do you really think that there are

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,990
hundreds of revvs applications in the

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,630
app

00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,670
Playstore and they are getting no money

00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:55,910
out of it

00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:58,040
if you don't pay for the product you are

00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:03,770
the product and this is kind of

00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:09,350
universal low in capitalism so some

00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:13,970
numbers I have take a to report one from

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:17,059
2016 the second one from 2019 numbers

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:21,800
are occurring both reports one of them

00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:26,809
they take 283 3 VPN applications and 20

00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:30,620
paid applications May 1 of 2019 153

00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:35,720
applications so I have a handpick some

00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:41,420
information from the reports 59 percent

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:43,760
of the 3 VPN applications in the Play

00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,890
Store and the Apple Store they have

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,590
hidden Chinese ownership according to

00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,600
that report think about this for a

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,720
second

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:59,570
Chinese ownership it is a country where

00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:03,620
the bpms are banned yet there are many

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:07,610
many companies that they have they offer

00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:11,000
free VPN they must be monetizing it I I

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:13,340
think it is very unlikely that so many

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,840
companies they are working without a

00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:24,890
profit in mind it 86 percent of the apps

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:28,370
have a hidden policy flaws which they

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:31,370
had in no private policy or it was a

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,990
generic one or they just said anything

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:39,370
about whatever they are doing with the

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:41,600
data they're collecting you 85 percent

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:45,320
represent excessive permissions

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:48,559
functions that may lead to privacy AV

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,570
abuses for example it is a VPN

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,630
application right you need access to the

00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:55,040
network that's pretty much it

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:58,910
why would an application request access

00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,980
to the microphone or the camera or to

00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,809
read the state of the phone so I do pick

00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,450
up your phone

00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,960
you have a call to pick it up and the

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:09,729
VPN application knows who is calling you

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,559
what is your phone number they can

00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:15,639
access to the serial numbers of your

00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:18,639
mobile and your devices we are talking

00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:22,749
about applications that represent 518

00:19:18,639 --> 00:19:27,460
million downloads in the first six

00:19:22,749 --> 00:19:32,229
months of 2019 it was they was it was

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:34,539
downloaded 260 million times there are

00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:38,830
applications that they have four star

00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:42,570
ratings five star ratings and you still

00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:46,299
have access to those applications today

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:49,839
according to the research report they

00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:52,389
did contacted Apple and Google and they

00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:55,929
express their concerns about the

00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:59,889
findings yet the companies have done

00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:03,609
nothing about it look we never had so

00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:06,129
many companies selling privacy but is

00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:11,169
likely that we are going to need to

00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:14,099
change how we do things and the laws and

00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:16,389
if you want to upload our privacy

00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:18,609
application related with privacy on the

00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:22,149
stores you know that they might have

00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:27,849
extra rules or something like that but

00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:30,639
right now is very scary our VPN

00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:33,309
companies needed well the easiest thing

00:20:30,639 --> 00:20:36,429
it will be yep I am NOT gonna use a VPN

00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:40,119
company so I am safe that's fantastic

00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:42,609
all of you are technical people any of

00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:46,869
you has the capability to install your

00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:50,469
own BPM but not all the people have such

00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:54,549
capability we need to find a way where

00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:57,549
the people with non-technical skills can

00:20:54,549 --> 00:21:03,399
access to the privacy features that they

00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:10,259
are being offered by mediums how can we

00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:14,710
improve the VPN market I strongly

00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:15,559
believe that transparency and privacy

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:20,840
the

00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:23,539
Cunningham you cannot promise privacy to

00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:26,330
somebody if you don't have transparency

00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:28,519
on how you actually operate you have to

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:32,269
be fully transparent that's part of the

00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:35,539
deal yet the companies and the BPM

00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:40,909
companies they have no transparency as

00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:42,049
you can see open-source they do provide

00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:44,779
transparency

00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:48,289
you are telling how you work look that's

00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:52,070
the code plus how things works it is a

00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:54,169
great step in transparency probably more

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:57,769
things has to happen to be fully

00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:58,759
transparent but this is a huge step

00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:02,929
forward

00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:05,809
so VP I believe that the BPM companies

00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:08,720
they should be open source so people

00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:10,669
with the right skills they can access to

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,700
the source code of the applications and

00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:16,429
they can evaluate and they can see that

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,869
things are working fine so when we have

00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:21,320
all these marketing running through all

00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:23,360
the BB games at least yeah we can have

00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:26,389
as well the technical view that yeah

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:32,899
this BPM it is protecting it it is

00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:36,559
protecting you as it should so on 2019

00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:40,639
I have worked on an end-to-end solution

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:44,450
for a VPN company I have call it the VPN

00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:46,920
company that come to you I am NOT

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:50,890
marketing

00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:53,170
so it comprises front-end website

00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:58,000
service configuration orchestration

00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:59,830
technology and monitoring systems so

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,520
this is just an overview of the

00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:07,059
architecture right so I think that the

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:10,110
the the most relevant thing on this

00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:13,540
architecture it is the monitoring system

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:15,250
so all those VPN companies they promise

00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:17,410
you well we are collecting no

00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:20,130
information about you on what you are

00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:23,230
doing you cannot operate an

00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:25,929
infrastructure as complex as this one if

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:27,940
you are not collecting data at all it is

00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:29,980
just impossible you need to know how the

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,380
VPN servers are doing are they out of

00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,000
capacity or not how many clients are

00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,950
they accessing it is one client who is

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,059
using all they run with or there are

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:43,240
several ones in the VPN company we have

00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:45,370
a free tire okay that is 500 megabytes

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,100
right people can use it for free

00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:50,620
that means that the monitoring system

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,290
knows when somebody has connected who is

00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:56,800
the user how much information and how

00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:58,840
much traffic they have download and any

00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:04,300
other replicas or any other company that

00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:06,850
has that sort of t tire they have to

00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:11,260
have a things like that so you need to

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:14,110
collect some information how it works so

00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:17,050
this is just an interesting thing that I

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:21,910
found when I was developing and it is

00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:24,550
that sometimes when you are using a VPN

00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:26,350
you might go to Netflix for example and

00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:28,210
it tells you well you are connecting

00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:31,120
from a VPN so you cannot reproduce this

00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:33,429
video right so two ways that I have

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,960
found that it can be done one of them is

00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:37,750
that there are IP data races on the

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,540
Internet - I've types one of them

00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:44,140
provided by the ISP those ones are the

00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:45,700
IP ranges of my clients the second one

00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,620
it is there are companies like a

00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,420
classifier in every single IP it is a

00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,200
data center of it is a public IP or

00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:55,120
something so that's the number one and

00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:59,840
the second one it is via an MTU

00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:03,559
signature so they be

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:06,590
and VPN networks they do change the VPN

00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:10,970
of the packages a to a default values

00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:14,260
and you can use it to identify if the

00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:19,220
connection has run over a VPN network

00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:21,380
the MTU is not designed for that so I

00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:24,020
don't really know how accurate will be

00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,779
on a production environment but I have

00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:29,450
don't test myself and it actually does

00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:31,340
work so for you

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:36,200
technical people if you want to have

00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:38,210
your own VPN server you don't have to

00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,610
install it from scratch and just read

00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,370
everything there are two projects that

00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:45,320
they have the install scripts uncivil

00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:48,440
and you know some other automation of

00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,809
things that will help you out to put all

00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,230
the VPN server in place with easy

00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:56,120
instructions on how to use it

00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:59,630
you want to create your own VPN company

00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,080
that stay at the website and they get

00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,500
her address

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,250
I will live really low you know to see

00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:10,640
your command feedback code over this

00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:13,039
project that we are running and well

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,440
that's my contact information thank you

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:22,789
very much

00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:25,799
[Applause]

00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:27,809
thank you very much Ruben we've got a

00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:29,250
lovely James here helping today carrying

00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:30,929
the the microphone round so if anybody

00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,639
has any questions but you handle proudly

00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:33,809
and in about five minutes we'll have you

00:26:32,639 --> 00:26:41,269
and if you can make your way over here

00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:41,269
Thanks any questions

00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:57,260
so with your VP and what protocols you

00:26:52,670 --> 00:27:00,230
sort of believe in or using say and with

00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:05,030
your own VPN is it based on Wireshark or

00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:07,160
was it gonna be sort of well there are

00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:10,340
protocols there are many different types

00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:14,630
of protocols a wife wild card it is

00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:17,000
where is actually it recommended but it

00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:19,850
is one of the newest one so it yet has

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,290
to prove itself OpenVPN it is the

00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:23,330
classic one and because it's been

00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:25,040
running for so many years with the

00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:28,309
security is using the past that people

00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:31,910
have found so that's novel and some on

00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:35,120
what you prefer to use the VPN company

00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:37,970
right now it is set up with Open VPN but

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,080
I I i with respect to install other

00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,080
servers in the future

00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:56,190
I was just looking at website is this a

00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:58,649
sample company versus an actual company

00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:02,309
you're running well if this sample

00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:04,710
company is less actual company so all

00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:06,990
this stuff I do believe that when you

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,960
build somewhere the best way to see if

00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:12,419
it works is actually running it so I

00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,070
have created the open source a project

00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:15,990
and I have the company it your access to

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:18,899
the website you have the link to fork me

00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:20,759
on github in one of the corners but yeah

00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:23,700
you can potentially sign up or and you

00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:31,919
see it or you can create your own so it

00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:33,659
is an actual service yeah hello

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,330
I was just wondering I say you use the

00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:38,549
cloud what cloud do you use and do you

00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:44,249
know if they like log all the IPAs or

00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:46,590
whatever well yeah you can use when

00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:49,889
you're talking about the VPNs normally

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:52,619
they they the companies tends to use the

00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:55,710
cheap providers so in this particular

00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:58,799
case we have set up a digital ocean to

00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:00,779
run the servers if we hit a low C and it

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,029
is well known so you try for example to

00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:04,200
access Netflix it is unlikely that it is

00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:07,169
going to run because all the IPS are

00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,179
known so you really want to use those

00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:13,559
sort of services you will need to access

00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:15,419
a supplier that they are non well-known

00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:19,799
so you have better chances that there

00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:21,899
are P IPS are not classified but any

00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:25,080
supplier will do and obviously depending

00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:27,929
on how much you spend into that in the

00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:32,179
in the servers you will have a you know

00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:32,179
better quality thank you

00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,300
interesting talk because your company is

00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,670
australian-based

00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:57,309
you could be forced by the law

00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:59,410
enforcement agencies to breach the

00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:02,400
privacy of your customers without them

00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:07,870
knowing are you aware of that

00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:09,430
well yes I am aware of that I also have

00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:12,070
on their website you know that the best

00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:25,210
way to be security is actually not break

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:27,670
the law so yes yes I am I have a

00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:40,390
question do you have a canary on your

00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:42,410
side all right let's all give Ruben a

00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:47,650
huge week thank you

00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:47,650
