Container technology is a great enabler for developer agility, and these environments require an agile and dynamic storage platform. Gone are the days where you had to wait on your storage administrator to provision a new LUN or NFS mount for your project. Thanks to the Rook Project, and its ceph storage provider, you can now have a rapid, dynamic and elastic storage footprint for all your development needs.

This session will cover - rook basics, dynamic vs static persistent storage needs of workloads, and a demo of using rook-ceph.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
