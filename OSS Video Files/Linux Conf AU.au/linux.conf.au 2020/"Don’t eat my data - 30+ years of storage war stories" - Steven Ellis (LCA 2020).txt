We are in an era of explosive data growth, with everything from cat pictures to NASA’s incredible archive of space photography, and this all needs to be stored and catalogued in a reliable and easily accessible form. How can we safely store/backup/manage this data across  a diverse range personal devices, never mind the challenges of enterprise class scale out storage, with the occasional (rain) cloud along the way?

We’ll start off with a bit of history on data storage formats to set the scene, and then dig into some stories from the last 35+ years of Steven’s own journey in IT, with some names changed to protect the “innocent”.

Themes covered will include
    Getting physical
    Bits, Bytes, Blocks and Blobs, with a file or three
    Performance sanity tests
    Hardware Raid - pain or pleasure?
    File-system selection and why checksums matter
    Going mad with MDADM (part 2)
    DRBDont
    HA NFS aren't the droids you're looking for
    Vacuum Cleaners and Dehumidifiers
    Raid is not a backup, and erasure coding isn’t about data deletion
    The cloud is just someone else’s SAN
    When physical disks trump flash storage

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
