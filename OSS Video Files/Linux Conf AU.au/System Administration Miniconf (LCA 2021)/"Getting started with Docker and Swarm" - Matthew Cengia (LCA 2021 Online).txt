Docker has been around for almost 8 years now, but I get the impression that a lot of systems administrators and software developers may only have a basic understanding of its operation, and how its functionality can be leveraged to make software easy to develop, test, and deploy. This talk aims to give an overview of what Docker can be used for, and some concrete examples on how to use Docker and Swarm to package up and deploy apps. We'll cover Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml files and how they fit together, and, time permitting, how to use Docker BuildX and Docker App to build multi-platform container images, and package collections of containerised services for easy deployment and versioning. Slowly converting apps to work with Docker is a great way to make them automatically more scalable, consistent, and portable. Participants will be able to work with Docker on their local machines, or use Play With Docker via their web browser to follow along.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
