S3 file systems are a popular interface to object storage despite their leaky abstractions and performance pitfalls.  In this talk we will explore s3fs, one of the most popular FUSE file systems, and when it is an appropriate solution.  We will compare it with NFS and also discuss how s3fs has evolved over the last ten years.
