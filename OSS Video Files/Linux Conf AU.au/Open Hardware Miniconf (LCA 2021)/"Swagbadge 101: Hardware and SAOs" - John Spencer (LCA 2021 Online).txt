Title: "Swagbadge 101: Hardware and SAOs" - John Spencer (LCA 2021 Online)
Publication date: 2021-02-18
Playlist: Open Hardware Miniconf (LCA 2021)
Description: 
	John Spencer

https://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/114/

This is the open hardware miniconf, so let’s talk about the hardware on the badge. Find out what our goal was for the badge, and why we chose the components we used. We’ll discuss the ways you can extend your badge with hardware, whether that’s working with the onboard microcontroller, or adding a simple add-on (SAO). We’ll talk about our SAO protoboards, the Tux SAO and other SAO extensions you can build and buy to enhance your badge life.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

[Music]

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,920
we're here

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,439
i hope you had a really great lunch uh

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,119
and now i know we've had a lot of people

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,960
asking about all the hardware

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,199
uh after our introduction about the

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,840
software so we're gonna have john and

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,279
john but not astra come and tell you all

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,840
about the decisions that went into

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,840
making the badge and a little bit of

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,280
ear licking and a little bit of

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,000
information about all the

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,680
uh sales that go on top so without

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,840
further ado i present to you

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,840
john and john

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,879
hello everyone seamless transfer there

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,840
from seat to seat

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,960
seamless so my name is john spencer

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,280
and those of you who've been in open

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,120
hardware mini comps before will

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,960
recognize me as giving fairly rambling

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,400
talks normally way too fast

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,000
john has asked me to slow it down today

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,720
so we'll see how that goes

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
so um i'll get right into it and start

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,280
talking about

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,920
our hardware so

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,360
um this is the putting the swag into the

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,560
badge

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,960
uh talk so to speak and i have lost

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,960
focus

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,799
so i'm going to start with a bit of a

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,600
history lesson of

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:40,079
uh open hardware mini conf badges uh

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,360
way back in 2017 we was when we first

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,399
really started looking at badges

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,399
it was a different time

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,600
we were doing it in preparation for the

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,720
sydney linux conf

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,399
we rushed through a few designs uh we

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,920
we approached linux australia to see if

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,719
they were interested which they were

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,719
and that was all good but there was

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,320
problems um

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,840
we got to like the third iteration of

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,560
the soft of the hardware to see if it

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,080
was going to work it was going to take

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,120
to get it manufactured

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,879
and out to people was very very tight

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,160
and our budget available was way too

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,920
tight just really wasn't going to be

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,000
possible

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,680
and lastly of course if we did that

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,080
badge we had no chances of doing a

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,239
regular

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,120
project those of you remember the

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,879
project for

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:33,680
sydney was the uh the lollibot

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:35,519
so the little um the soccer playing bot

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,760
but we did design something which i was

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,120
calling the minimum viable badge

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,400
now the first thing to note about it is

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,920
there's not very much that's minimum

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,680
about it

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,879
it used an e-paper screen and it had

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,319
i think it was close to 30 different

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,280
pieces on it um which

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,879
is is more work for us to produce we

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,760
would have had to get it done in china

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,400
that sort of thing but the prototype was

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,879
sitting there

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,000
and sitting on shelves i think john's

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,599
hunting around for it at the moment

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,440
maybe there's a few prototypes floating

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,400
about

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,400
so we shelved that

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:20,959
fast forward three years later and um

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,720
2020 has a whole new ballgame of stuff

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,959
obviously we can't go to canberra which

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,840
is a bit sad my first linux conf was in

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,879
canberra

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,360
and i was kind of looking forward to

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,360
going again

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,799
but obviously someone from the

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,640
organizing committee

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,080
remembered that we'd done this this

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,440
badge thing before and

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,720
sort of said well look we'd like to do

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,120
something special for everyone even

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,239
though

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,400
they can't get anywhere we'd like to

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,680
give them some hardware and here's your

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,400
budget

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,000
which yeah that's not a bad budget um

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,120
obviously it included postage which was

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,319
a bit fun

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,480
um there's a request to make

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,400
about 300 of them i don't think we quite

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,040
got to 300 i think there's a few failed

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,599
sitting around

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,400
we're at about 294 294 that's actually

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,920
pretty good

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,319
that's not a bad yield except for the

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,680
fact that there's a whole row of pcbs

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,840
that are wrong

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,360
and the intention there is to get them

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,560
to people before the conference

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,160
which is also a challenge because

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,440
shipping is fun um in 2020 shippings was

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,600
really fun

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,199
um we also had to design and build and

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,800
test and do all of the fun things that

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,040
you do with hardware design in isolation

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,040
we had weekly meetups and weekly

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,120
catch-ups

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,560
but still it was very much on our own

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,160
um as i'm going through like

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,919
we've got we did have some challenges as

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,840
i just mentioned we did a first version

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,240
of the board and

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,160
someone me accidentally used a different

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,639
oled to the one we ordered

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,000
so the ground and the five volt lines

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,040
were back to front

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,880
which if anyone is interested that means

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,560
that things get hot

00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,919
and things don't go well

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,440
it definitely wasn't happy um

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,759
john did hack a few of them to get them

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,199
working so we could start working with

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,199
real hardware but

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,039
we have a box of them here here is a box

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,639
of pcbs um

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,280
yes it's embarrassing uh i think it's

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,400
about

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,479
five kilos of pcbs

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,280
right version one

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,479
that that caused us small problems uh

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,919
something else

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,280
that you might not be aware of about a

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,840
week before we were due to start

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,840
shipping

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,320
john was due to start shipping him out

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,400
we discovered that the lanyards changed

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,240
our postal rating so

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,120
this was a question that someone asked

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,199
me earlier today is

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,240
why we didn't ship with batteries the

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,320
original intention

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,440
to keep our budget right down was to

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,639
ship the badges

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,120
as letters they meet the

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,479
minimum size restrictions they're thin

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,000
they don't have any dangerous goods on

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,039
them

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,919
that plan changed very rapidly when we

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,199
found that

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,440
the lanyard battery badge section

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,520
made the package too thick so we had to

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,479
completely change that

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,479
great expense yep great expense

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,160
but very last minute there's there's

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,240
also

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,680
obviously concerns with if we we could

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,960
have done some

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,240
people who are willing to pay more we

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,759
could have done something like that but

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,880
that adds a great deal of extra

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,400
complexity

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,720
um you're managing multiple shipping

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,280
trains rather than a single one

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,680
so you can find your own batteries

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,560
they're not hard i'm sorry

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,520
now of course big thanks there to the

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,039
lca 2021 organizing team they were super

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,960
helpful and

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,000
i'm quite happy to step in and help when

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,199
things got a bit much

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,360
so the pitch

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,479
um obviously when we first started

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,360
talking about this

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,880
the the badge i showed from 2017 just

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,800
wasn't gonna cut it the

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:06,479
um e-paper is still amazingly expensive

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,240
it's um difficult

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,240
there's no nice modules or there are

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,120
nice modules but they are expensive

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,080
um so that would have ended up with an

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,960
awful lot of build

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,160
an awful lot of time taken to either

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,520
build them here or get them

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,639
done overseas so one of the projects

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,720
that john have been looking at is a

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,759
thing called free deck

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,360
now free deck runs on a arduino nano

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:35,120
or pro mini micro instead rather

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,400
um it has six screens as you can see

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,840
it uses some uses i think shift register

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,000
to try and access the different screens

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,360
on a single i2c bus

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,080
and a few other little bits and pieces

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,360
like that access with our badges

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,280
there's a button underneath each one of

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,720
those so

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,440
we wanted to do something like that but

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,199
we wanted it to be simpler um

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,319
faster and of course with better access

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,319
to the internet

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,759
so the first most important thing once

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,240
you've decided what you're doing is the

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,680
name i mean the microcontroller

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,800
if you don't know the name you don't

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,759
know what you get what it's going to be

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,039
do you

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,840
so there are a lot of options for

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:15,759
microcontrollers out at the moment

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,560
the team mega 32u4 is a good choice

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,199
because it it offers a human interface

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,800
bus

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,800
control it can be a mouse or a keyboard

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,840
stm32 things m0s are quite popular

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,280
i think john uses them for a lot of

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,959
stuff they're also very very cheap

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,800
the esp32 s2 is

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,839
another option which can be a human

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,839
interface

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,360
device and of course the raspberry pi

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,959
nano which

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,800
is is great looking thing and if we had

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,920
a time machine is probably a real

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,279
contender

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,560
unfortunately it was literally released

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,560
while i was writing these slides

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,720
so we didn't go with any of those ones

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,399
we picked one called the lowland 32

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,839
esp32

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,880
um a big driver for that is it cost

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,000
literally three dollars per unit uh

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,120
which when your budget's only 20 dollars

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,240
makes it possible much like the s2

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,959
it's well it's a 240 megahertz processor

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,800
it is dual core but for the most part

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,959
the first course just used for wi-fi and

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,800
bluetooth

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,080
you can use the bluetooth for hid if you

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,880
want i'm not sure if anyone's done that

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,279
yet

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,920
and once again it is three dollars not

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,920
twenty dollars

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,680
so here i just thought i'd talk a little

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,760
bit about what exactly the esp32 is this

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,360
is obviously a very brief introduction

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,200
um it's low cost it's low power and it's

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,000
a system on chip

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,519
it has quite a good stack of interfaces

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,839
i suppose like wi-fi and bluetooth

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,760
obviously

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:53,279
um in the designs i've shown you in the

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,120
modules i've shown here it's it's

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,720
coupled with a few extra things

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:04,079
so like a usb bus so that you can do usb

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:06,560
communications or usb serial to it um

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,640
it's arduino compatible uh if you're

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,200
used to writing c in the arduino

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,399
language um it's micropython compatible

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,680
which is obviously what we're using for

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,640
this project

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,360
and it's compatible which is something

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,279
i've never written

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,720
but a lot of people do seem to like it

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,480
we've used it in a few previous mini

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:28,079
cops so we're quite familiar with

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,200
with it in tasmania we built the iotas

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,399
using it

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,800
iotus was built with almost pre-release

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,680
chips actually um we've got a special

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,519
delivery of those

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,920
and then sydney the lollibot that i

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,920
mentioned before

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,000
there are multiple prototype boards that

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,480
available um

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,240
we used the lonlan 32 or technically the

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,399
lone 32 light

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,360
they have multiple variants if you do a

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,880
google search you will

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,399
get them all and they have different pin

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,959
outs which is very fun

00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,160
um there's the tiny pico and the tiny

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:04,560
nano made by unexpected maker and

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:07,600
adafruit has their own hazard 32 as well

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,440
my general preference is the tiny pico

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,760
a lot of that's because they're a little

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,760
bit more expensive but

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,120
seon who runs unexpected maker literally

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,079
lives the next suburb over for me so

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,079
delivery is really good

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,200
now to give you an idea on how big these

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,839
are i've included a banana for scale

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,079
these are small the tiny pico is very

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,399
small um

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,399
yeah okay can't find that slide next one

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,160
i'm going to jump straight into

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,519
how we built this schematic now i

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,200
wouldn't normally go through these sort

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,600
of details

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,480
but this is a simple design each board

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
only has five

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,399
physical components and it's a good

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,440
place to get started when you're

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,639
designing with modules

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,680
once again we used kai-cad for our

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,839
design work

00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:01,200
we've done that for a few years now so

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,200
the first slide here is our

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,880
i've split this up into three different

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,040
views

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,160
working from left to right on the left

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,880
side we have

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,839
the schematic view which is where you

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,320
you draw out

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,560
how you want your your design to work

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,279
like what you want it to connect to

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,240
in the middle we have what it looks like

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,399
from a

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,920
like a module view then at the end i've

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,200
got a picture of the actual physical

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,800
thing we're doing

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,040
this is a terrible example the way i

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,600
laid out the lowland 32 was very hacky

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,440
and very last minute

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,959
you wouldn't normally organize it like

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,800
that

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,600
almost everything about it is kind of

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,920
wrong um

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,399
you'd normally like that representation

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,000
is pretty much exactly the same as

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,480
what the physical chip looks like where

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,639
normally you would organize it so

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,399
your inputs and outputs and your voltage

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,040
and your ground planes

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,079
are different angles so these are

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,600
terrible examples

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:04,560
um the same with the module view there

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,000
in the middle um that's a very specific

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,079
one for our project

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,600
it's upside down which is not somewhere

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,040
you would normally lay it out

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,040
and it includes some edge cuts

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,360
still that's what we were looking that's

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,959
what if you load up kai-cat and look at

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,480
our source that's what you will see

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,399
a little bit more of a summary for the

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,680
long 32 i wrote this slide before i

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,240
wrote the previous one

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,120
it is cheap it has a couple of extra

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,880
features that

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,720
some people have noticed already it's

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,160
got battery management on it

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,160
so you can just plug a battery in and it

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,959
will start charging for you uh it's got

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,399
a regulator

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,760
nice has a usb serial chip

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,600
and a little bit of circuitry that lets

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,040
it flip that on when you go to reprogram

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,639
it

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,399
that's good because that's like six or

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,639
seven extra components that if we just

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,680
used the raw esp32 we would abandon

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,959
have to add to the board it's got a good

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,760
number of pin breakouts

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,120
um the one i always miss is five volt

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,600
out from the usb

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,880
which the tiny picot does have but the

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,720
esp doesn't

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,399
also uses different i2c pins which is

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,320
always fun

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,440
i think i mentioned again it's cheap

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,440
it's very cheap

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,639
but ultimately this is all less work for

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,880
john

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,000
it did mean we needed to solder and cut

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,000
26 pins for each

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,440
badge so of the 296 badges

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,760
i had the maths up but i can't see it

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,519
because i don't have my slide notes here

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,880
um that's a lot of cuts

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,639
hundreds of thousands of cuts i think

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,720
i've worked it out to be

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,680
which andrew nielsen and i think did a

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,120
lot of them

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,040
almost all of them i think so the cuts i

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,160
think were the worst

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,160
you put up a callus on your hand

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,199
so the next component we have is our

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,720
oleds

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:51,760
now these are inch underneath an inch

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,639
oleds um they're very common uh they're

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,920
four pin because i2c only really needs

00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:02,160
well ground voltage and sda and

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,079
scl like the clock and the data

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,680
we have two of them here and the dot is

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,440
on the same bus

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,360
so again moving from left to right

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,680
that's our schematic view

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,519
and where it connects back to the the um

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,880
the micro controller

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:22,000
the what the the what it looks like in

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,760
inside our pcb design and then

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
a stock photo from the website we bought

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,160
them from

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,759
these are great little oleds they're

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,120
they're very inexpensive

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,800
i cut down a couple of dollars each two

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,160
or three dollars each again

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,759
um because they're an old they're

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,720
self-illuminating they they're not like

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,480
an lcd which is backlit

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,600
they're very simple to address and use

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,079
and because they're used in a lot of

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,920
places

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,199
libraries are very easy to get unless

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,880
you're doing things like

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,959
mark is and trying to push it to its nth

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,320
degree you can get a display fairly

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,360
easily

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,560
this particular model has

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,560
you can have two displays on the same

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,639
itc bus by

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,000
bridging a solder gap um to get the

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,040
alternative address

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,759
now we made 300 badges so we had 600 of

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,680
these

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,839
these had a lot of failures a lot more

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,600
than we would have expected

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,360
and ultimately john had to bridge 300

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,639
pins to get the alternative itc

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,199
addresses

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,480
we offered to help he did it anyway um

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,160
they're also pre-soldered

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,120
which means we only needed to cut four

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:25,120
pins for each badge rather than eight

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,880
oh sorry solder four pins for each badge

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,880
uh the next component we have is the

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,320
buttons where there are two buttons

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,160
underneath each of them or one under

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,680
each lcd

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,759
oled rather we made these in a dual

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,800
footprint because we weren't sure

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,519
what buttons we'd be able to get

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,480
john soldered all of these and we did

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,800
offer to help again

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,800
and once again he did it all himself

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,440
so those were the physical components

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,720
that was the last physical component so

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,000
yeah

00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,279
a single microcontroller uh two oleds

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,880
and uh two buttons as well so yeah

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,319
there's only five physical components

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,439
on the on each board we have a few extra

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,439
features

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,959
the esp32 something i didn't mention

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,319
when i was talking about it

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,760
is it has a touch sensor or touch a

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,079
capacitance touch

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:23,520
ability on eight of its pins

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:27,199
so we utilized four of them

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:30,000
uh for on the board itself now

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,640
this is something we originally designed

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,960
actually like

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,840
i'll talk about that in my next slide

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,120
once again uh

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,000
we schematic on the uh on the left-hand

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,000
side there

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,919
um this looks a little bit strange

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,360
because uh we have to touch sliders and

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,919
then we broke out the touch

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,200
points individually as well if you flip

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,640
the board over

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,160
underneath sort of where the touch

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,200
sliders are you'll see that there's

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,200
individual

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,200
points just made it easier you can

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,080
solder to them if you need to

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,840
and in the center so this is a good

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,520
example of where we've used solder masks

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,440
to sort of hide some details

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,400
in the center that's what the copper paw

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,320
looks like on the pcb

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,559
versus at the end what it actually looks

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,400
like on the physical process

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,000
you can't really see like the little

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,520
fingers so

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,360
you sort of hide the detail a little bit

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,559
so these are good because there's no

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,960
there's no soldering

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:32,160
that you just drop it in um in this case

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,000
the way we use them as a

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,760
the way the way we use them as a slider

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,640
is it's a proportional measurement

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,000
between the

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,200
the two main ones as the surface area

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,440
that you're

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,960
moving hovering your finger over reduces

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,000
obviously you can get a proportional

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,000
measurement between the two points

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,520
originally this worked i sort of based

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,120
my original designs on stuff nick moore

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,679
did back in 2017

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,240
he did it with was just copper paint

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,360
paper

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,000
and some sticky tape um

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,600
it did work in my original prototype and

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,760
then andrew nielsen went through and he

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,360
cleaned it all right up and

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,600
gave it that sort of iconic look with

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,200
the the two circles and the line between

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,960
them

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,960
so good work there i think

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,799
and oh the last sort of components we

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,799
have is our sailor connectors

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,640
um john's going to talk more about sails

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,400
later

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,280
the protocol for these or the um

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,880
the standard i guess is you have ground

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,360
oh you have voltage you have ground

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,000
you have your i2c bus and you have a

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,720
couple of

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,080
i o pins now because the esp32 has got

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,200
plenty of io pins

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:44,559
we were able to comfortably get four

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,559
for sale pins on each one

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,799
you'll notice oh this version i cleaned

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,520
up but if you actually load the

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,240
schematic

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,520
you'll see that i've shuffled the

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,600
numbers around a little bit

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,919
and the column on the left-hand side

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,600
there and i'll talk to that

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,799
as to why um

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,200
those badge connectors i've taken

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,559
pictures of the

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,720
the ones with the little lock in them

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,159
are great um good luck binding them

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,320
um the other works just as well but yes

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,400
the nice ones are very hard to get a

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,520
hold of

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,960
um breakouts as well when you've got

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,240
extra pins it's always nice to sort of

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,760
have somewhere other way of plugging

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,840
into them sometimes you will need more

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,520
than just the two gpios that you get

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,000
available on aseo so

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,280
they're here these are great we didn't

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,280
have to solder anything for these ones

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:40,320
they're more for you to enjoy later

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,159
so that's talking about how the

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,000
the design worked i guess the schematic

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,320
design now i'm going to try and talk

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,760
about

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,720
the sculpting of a pcb most of this was

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,400
done by andrew

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,280
so um i'm a bit blunt with my

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,640
designs i'm sloppy and all the things

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,480
lazy people end up being when they're

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,200
trying to design something

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,640
um we decided on the size pretty early

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,919
on because it had to fit in that letter

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,159
package i mentioned

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,400
so we sort of took what the largest

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,360
space we could fit into that letter was

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,919
and

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,360
fit all the components on but we only

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,799
have five components so that's fairly

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,080
easy

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,360
kaikad still doesn't have particularly

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,039
good drawing tools um

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,880
i think andrew used a lot of autocad

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,799
because he was a draftsman at one point

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,640
and that's how he thinks so that's fine

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,559
as long as you've got roll rounded it

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,159
corners though everything

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,400
that's all design is as far as i can

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:36,000
tell

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,360
so placing your components um as i

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,960
mentioned earlier

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,240
designing by components is a very good

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,520
way to start because you're starting

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,320
with something that you know already

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,120
works or

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,120
should theoretically already work um

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,039
the first thing i normally say is try

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,520
and put things near the edge

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,480
when you begin with because otherwise

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,240
you end up with

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,840
fun situations where you've got a usb

00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,360
stick in the middle or usb plug in the

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,960
middle and you cannot work out how to

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,240
get to it

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,919
we run into that before where there was

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,640
a screw right at the end of the usb that

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,640
was fairly silly

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,840
i like things that are symmetrical most

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,600
humans do

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:16,000
um

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,880
has a thing called the rat nest which is

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,559
all of

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,080
its lines indicating where all of the

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,440
pins connect to other pins

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,440
it's before you draw your your tracks

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,640
um it's very common it's very confusing

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,400
early on so i suggest turning it off

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,000
and also do your graphics last because

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,440
most of your design will end up like if

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,480
you've got large graphics you won't be

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,880
able to see anything else that you're

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,880
working on

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,559
so kaikake calls traces tracks either

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,039
way

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,039
you can think of them as wires um

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:53,840
you should be using thicker traces for

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,640
for voltages you can work out exactly

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,480
how thick

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,679
or you can just fudge it like i tend to

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,799
do

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,080
um you will find some that overlap here

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,960
now it's not really clear from this

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,039
photo

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,720
but the reason why this particular trace

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,600
and those that's the ratness you can see

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,600
there

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,880
the reason why it doesn't work is

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,559
because

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,559
i don't know where my cursor is

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,640
this section top section of the

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,000
microcontroller is where the wi-fi

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,840
antenna is

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,360
and you can't have any traces run behind

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,640
that unless you're really really really

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,760
desperate

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,240
so in order to run to that point over

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,559
there

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,080
you'd have to run right around the top

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:37,840
of the micro

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,840
and up to them which is possible but

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,039
one of the first things you'll find

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,760
you're doing after you've got a layout

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,679
that you like

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,320
is reordering literally everything so

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,240
you'll find that you can do it two ways

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,799
obviously you can rotate and

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,679
move components so that they make sense

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:57,039
or you can

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,039
adjust where things are

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,240
you'll almost always find at least one

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,760
pin that's on the wrong side of the

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,840
microcontroller and it's just a pain in

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,840
the proverbial

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,440
and the next step i would normally go

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,240
through is adding a ground plane or a

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,640
voltage plane

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,039
or both more more often not both in

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,120
kaikad that's this little green button

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,840
that's down the left-hand side of your

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,840
screen

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,640
that lets you sort of flick between the

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,400
views the ground plane

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,240
normally covers almost the entirety of

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,159
the back of the board and that's one of

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,080
the reasons why

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,840
nikola gave you all those tips on why

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,120
not to eat the board or drop it in water

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,000
or stick it to a fridge

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,640
because that ground plane is exposed and

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
the reason it's a bit exposed is because

00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,600
of our logos and graphics

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,080
now this is another piece of andrew's

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,320
work um

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,760
normally when you're designing pcbs

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,480
you're a little bit limited to two

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,559
colors

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,679
for all your fancy bits um

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,559
but we we've cheated which is also

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,159
a fairly common thing to do these days

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,919
to get an extra color

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,760
by removing what's called the solder

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,960
mask which is like the thick coating

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,480
over the top

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,279
of all of the wires so that they don't

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,840
get damaged or shorted out

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,120
that's the bit that is the bit that you

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,720
could probably easily

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,520
sort of accidentally short um

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,400
these are something else once again

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,600
graphics

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,440
kaikad uh not the best of friends

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,120
you can use inkscape you could use

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,640
anything you'd like to design a graphic

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,200
and

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,159
kiket is pretty good at importing jpegs

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,799
and putting them on layers

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,080
and i think that's the end of my half of

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,679
the talk so i'm going to hand over to

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,799
john now

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:50,240
and he can cover saos yes

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,600
thanks thank you okay this is our

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,679
seamless speaker transition you can't

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,960
tell the difference

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,400
so the part of the idea of a badge is

00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,919
that the badge itself is something that

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,360
you should be able to extend and

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,720
experiment with so

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,080
you might want to add extra

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,120
functionality or maybe you want to add

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,760
an extra bit of

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,559
bling you need some decoration on your

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,919
badge

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,279
or you need something plugged into it

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,880
that is going to add some extra

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,720
functionality

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,200
so the um you just need a little bit

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,679
more

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,679
you know swagger in the badge how do you

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,600
add it well that is what the simple

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,840
add-on headers are for

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,799
the uh the connections that john showed

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,240
earlier

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,279
are these six-way headers and as he said

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,159
there are four of them

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,720
on the badge we could fit four on so we

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,440
put four

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,000
on they provide i squared c and digital

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,720
connections

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,400
and power so if you want to use them

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,440
purely for mechanical mounting

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,200
you can or you can put in an extra

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,039
circuit board and actually communicate

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,799
with the onboard

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:56,640
control microcontroller on the badge

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:58,960
so this was a render of one of the first

00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,919
versions of the badge and you'll see

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,159
that the

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,840
sayo headers are on two different

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,360
alignments the ones at the top

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,039
are what you would expect in terms of

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,240
the normal orientation

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,400
and then the ones on the side are

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,679
vertical so the

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:16,320
sayo would stick out sideways and

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,360
we had a little bit of a debate early on

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,120
about whether

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,760
they should come out sideways or at an

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,440
angle so we drew some different diagrams

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,720
just sketched it around and see how that

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,399
would fit

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,080
this is a version i did where i printed

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,760
out a little expansion board

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,679
and just physically placed it onto a

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,320
printout of the badge so we could see

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,240
whether

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,840
it would obscure the screens trying to

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,120
get an idea of where those connectors

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,799
could go

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,159
and as you can see on the final version

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,279
of the design

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,679
the badges are at a 45 degree angle so

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,120
that

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,200
add-ons that you add onto the side of

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,720
the badge come out on the side like

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,679
ears so question is what can you do with

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,000
them

00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,960
in your package if you received a swag

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,399
badge

00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,120
you will have received three add-ons

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,399
there are two which look like the render

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,480
on the screen and these little

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,000
prototyping expansions

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,240
the idea with this is that you don't

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,640
need to design your own circuit board

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,480
to add functionality to the badge this

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,360
is equivalent to a prototyping shield

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,600
for an arduino

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,960
except that it's for a badge and the

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,799
breakouts around the edge

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,840
are for the power and i squared c

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,440
connections and the two digital pins

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,159
there are two of those in the package

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,600
one black one red just because we could

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,600
and there is also a an add-on which

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,399
looks like the little tux

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,240
which is really really cute now this one

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,039
was intended not to have any specific

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,320
functionality

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,399
it's a pcb but it doesn't have any

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,679
components on it

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,960
but then i think it was andy realized

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,320
very quickly

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,960
that if you had this plugged into the

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,039
correct port what he could do is bridge

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,760
across a solder jumper onto

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,159
the copper of the badge and you could

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,279
turn

00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,760
tux into a little touch sensor so tucks

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,080
can be

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,760
you know you can boop his snoot and the

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,880
badge can detect it

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,840
so if you want to experiment with that

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,880
we can talk you through that on spectrum

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,720
or

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,320
they'll probably be some information on

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,120
the wiki

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,600
when the time comes so the idea with

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,960
these

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:24,840
is that you can add extra functionality

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:27,360
and so this is an example of another

00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:29,039
sayo which i think this one was designed

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,080
by andrew nielsen who also did the

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,399
little tux

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,000
we haven't had this one fabricated but

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,760
that's just an example

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,039
of creating something that is visually

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,679
interesting that

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,279
adds something to the badge so the idea

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,320
is that you can use them to personalize

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,159
the badge

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:49,120
as well as add functionality so if you

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,640
have received the the sayos in your

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,679
package and you're wondering what to do

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,360
with them

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,000
what you can do is something like what i

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:59,919
did here where i added the mushroom

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:02,240
this is the red sayo

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,440
and it's got the pin soldered onto it

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,000
and all i did was

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,720
bluetack a bit of paper onto it so

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,679
that's just

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,200
adding a little bit of decoration onto

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,000
my badge and now i've got a mushroom

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,679
on my swag batch to go along with the

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,279
swagger and of course

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,720
uh you got to look out for the snake but

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,520
we've already got python in here so the

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,799
snake is

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,360
taken care of so i also

00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:28,240
designed a couple of others which we did

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,919
not end up including in the package

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,600
we ended up settling for just doing the

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,480
prototyping version

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,360
this is a screw connection simple add-on

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,200
so that you can

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,360
use a screwdriver to add wires in and

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,640
make connections to the badge

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,120
and this one has very large uh holes in

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
it

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,720
which are designed to take alligator

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,480
clips so if you had

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,320
alligator clips on jumper wires what you

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,159
could do is plug this into the badge

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,559
and then clip onto the edges and make

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,720
electrical connections

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,919
and this just gives you some idea of the

00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,760
different things that you can do with

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,799
these add-ons

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,960
so if you want to go to the next level

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,200
you can do some things like what are

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,559
seen here these are

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:12,640
both designed by john and a couple of

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,240
years ago john designed a solder

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,320
training kit called the solder rocket

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,000
and he's now done a version of that

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,679
which is in the form

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,279
of a sayo so on the left there you can

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:28,880
see the solder rocket

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,519
and it's got um it's got an led on the

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,080
bottom

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,919
instead of where the uh the rocket

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,080
thrust would come out

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,760
and it's got headers so that you can add

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,480
it onto a badge

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,080
and it can take power oh there's an

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,120
example right here fantastic

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,440
thank you so you can see here this is

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,559
the uh the little solder rocket

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,720
version of the simple add-on

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,399
it's a bit bright there it's blurring

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,840
out blowing out the camera but you can

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,720
see that there's a green led on the

00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,159
bottom

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,600
which is the you know the drive whatever

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,880
the thrust is coming out of the back of

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,320
that

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,320
what makes green i don't know

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,000
so uh if we switch back to the slides

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,440
for a second

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,200
you can see the solder rocket but you

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,399
can also see the

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,519
badge beats board on the right

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:25,360
and that is a series of stacked led

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:27,440
bar graphs so you can use that as like a

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,440
vu meter

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,200
so i think john hasn't got this one

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,919
quite working yet he was just working on

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,679
this

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,360
but the idea with this is that you can

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,240
have your badge

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,240
react to something like sound level and

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,760
then you can have a vu meter displayed

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,120
on your badge

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,279
with dancing leds now

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,279
the there is a term that you should look

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,000
for if you're interested in this sort of

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,120
thing

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,720
which is badge life and that is a term

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,559
that came out of defcon

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,559
which nicola mentioned right at the

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,799
start of the day is really where

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,960
this whole electronic conference badge

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:06,159
phenomena originated

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,720
and badge life includes development of

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,000
both

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,600
custom badges but also simple add-ons or

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,279
saos

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,519
and if you search for uh for badge life

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,200
you'll find an amazing array of

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,720
different badge designs

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,480
but also simple add-ons and because

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,000
well it's it's going too much to say

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,559
this is a standard

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,200
that the simple the simple add-on header

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,600
is a

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,039
convention i suppose a very loose

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,760
convention

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:40,480
so if you take your lca swag badge

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,159
and you solder the connector on here you

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,559
can then plug in

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,399
other simple add-ons now one thing to

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,159
note is that the first version of the

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,679
simple add-on standard

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,519
had four pins not six and

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,360
that was a little bit limited because it

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,720
was basically just power and i squared

00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,320
c the standard was extended uh

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,240
not all that long ago to add the extra

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,000
two pins so we're using the current

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,519
version of the standard which is the six

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,360
pin version

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,560
but it is backward compatible with the

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,240
four pin

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,679
it's just added the extra two pins on

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,119
the end so if you look at simple add-ons

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,599
you might find that some of them have

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,079
four pins and some have six

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,720
but it is backward compatible so if you

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,639
get a four pin simple add-on header

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,800
you can plug it into your swag badge and

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,919
it will work as long as you plug it into

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,200
the correct four pins

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,000
so pay attention to that oh and also

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:37,200
while i'm talking about

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,399
pin outs there is a trap because

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,639
the convention for the uh the pin out

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,280
evolved over time you'll see that there

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,440
is a little marker next to pin one

00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,119
but it is not the pin one that is on a

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,280
conventional

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,240
pin out so the result is that if you

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,159
look on the

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:59,359
swag badge the add-ons that we included

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,280
they have a pin one marker on them which

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,640
does not align with pin one on this

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,839
header

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,280
so don't let that trip you up you just

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,520
need to make sure that you put it in the

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,520
correct way around and it'll be fine

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,280
ignore the dots they will lead you

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,520
astray

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,040
so there is a lot you can do to extend

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,839
your swag badge

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,640
and make it do different things both in

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,359
terms of

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,960
modifying the software as nicola and

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,480
andy spoke about earlier

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,119
but also in terms of extending the

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,240
hardware and adding your own features

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,400
into it

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,320
so it's uh if you don't have much

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,839
experience with electronics

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,520
this is a really good way to get started

00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,560
because you can effectively think

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,960
of your conference badge as

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,599
a microcontroller development board it's

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,920
got the mcu on there there is wi-fi

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,960
you always it's got usb so you can

00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,680
upload a new code

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,359
run micropython it's got displays all

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,520
the basics are there

00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:56,880
and then with these headers you can add

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,560
your own bling

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,480
which could be as simple as adding some

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,359
leds on a simple

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,200
add-on header so it's very easy to get

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:09,119
started

00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,359
so thank you very much

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,400
and i think there were a couple of

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,480
questions

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,880
that might have been in the chat earlier

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,240
and nicola you had some questions well

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,400
lads why don't you come and

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,720
join me okay the camera on paper

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,599
when old schools put us all in uh so

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,880
paul schultz

00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:32,000
he wanted to know why are there holes

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,440
next to the sliders what are they there

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,560
for and now i know that there was some

00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,880
reasons because i have indeed

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,480
asked this question before uh and there

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,520
are good reasons and i don't know what

00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,400
they are

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,560
tell us i my recollection was there were

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,720
cable ties

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,160
cable ties cable ties if you solder

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,359
something onto it if you've got a cable

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,839
tie around that it gives you extra

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,760
support

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,760
okay i remember that was something

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,440
my recollection of it it might be one of

00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,640
those things where it's there and nobody

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,320
knows why

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:02,800
well part of it was mechanical stability

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,280
yes there were some early concepts that

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,480
involved

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,160
add-ons on the sides that turned it into

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,760
something like a game controller

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,079
so that you could hold it and use the

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,000
touch sensors and i think this was for

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,160
mechanical mounting so that you could

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,079
so if anybody out there is a 3d printer

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,760
what you could do is design and 3d print

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,000
a handle that goes on each side

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,680
and then screw it on through those holes

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,599
and then you can use this as a

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,720
little game controller that's pretty

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,640
cool

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,880
um trent lloyd was asking about the

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,480
charging led on the back so when you um

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,320
put in either power

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,800
or a battery that lead on the back there

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,079
can

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,000
flash or shine in different ways uh and

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,599
maybe it's a bit non-intuitive

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,920
we've all discussed in the chat room how

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,040
what it does is in fact standard

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,839
um but it does the the little um pin out

00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,440
on the board says

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,400
charging so what do what does it mean

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,839
when it's flashing what does it mean

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,000
when it's steady on

00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:00,240
i think andy might know this one okay

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,760
flashing is uh nothing's connected uh

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,000
solar is charging and it goes off and

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,599
it's charged

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,359
okay awesome and paul schultz again was

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,320
asking about pins or sockets on the

00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,520
badge and for the

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,760
for the posterity uh maybe we can get

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,880
the answer in the video

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:22,400
um pins or sockets sorry yeah

00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,359
sorry the standard on the standard on

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,000
the badge is the

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:27,040
socket yes so that your badge doesn't

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,119
stab you

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,200
yeah as a general raise rule also so

00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,960
you're not exposing power ground

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,920
yes yes and then the add-on has the pins

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,240
on the back

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,920
now one thing that is an interesting

00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,280
little offshoot of this this is chasing

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,520
a squirrel which i've been known to do

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,320
once or twice

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,320
so the idea is that badges became an i'm

00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,520
sorry sayo's became an add-on

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,760
for badges but sayos themselves have

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,839
become so amazing and so elaborate

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,040
that they are an artwork in their own

00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,520
right and some of them

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,599
are very complex so it is now actually

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,040
possible to buy desk stands which are

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,599
sayo trees

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,040
and all it is is a row of sayo sockets

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,320
sometimes at different angles which

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,400
provide power

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,079
and a desk stand so you can plug your

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,040
add-ons into it and have them displayed

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,640
on your desk and

00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,880
it up that was very good

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,320
it's a great squirrel right there's no

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,079
kind of further questions from the chat

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,640
although i'll be continuing to monitor

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,359
but

00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,640
you know if you guys would like to um

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,720
talk a little bit more

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,839
maybe about some of the additional

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,160
projects that we

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,760
came up with that we didn't have time to

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,119
finish so you know you mentioned the

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,760
game controller that i know

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,480
andrew was looking at uh i've looked at

00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,359
building

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,240
wings for my badge that would flap using

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,640
uh

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,480
electrically conductive wire what are

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,440
some of our other cunning plans that we

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,800
have

00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,520
that we would like people to do with

00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:55,040
their sails

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,480
i think i made mine well one that i had

00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,200
in mind which i didn't get to

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,160
was making a sayo which represented a

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,760
heart

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,520
and then have that linked to a heart

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,400
rate monitor so that it would show

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,640
heartbeat

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,200
in real time on the badge i think that

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,440
would be a cool thing to do

00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,119
also one thing that we talked about in

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,440
fact nicola and i talked about was

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,599
having some kind of a solenoid-based

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,119
party popper activation system

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,640
so that we could have people send

00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,079
messages to our badges and have it let

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,359
off a party popper

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,440
which could give you a bit of a shock if

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:29,119
you're not expecting it

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,160
no i do have one my solder rocket has a

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,760
dual form

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,400
three footprints on it effect or three

00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,880
uses one of which is the tiny pico nano

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,560
once again from unexpected maker so i

00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,560
thought it would be cool if you had four

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,599
solder rockets with tiny picos on them

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,720
and the base one you'd have ten cores on

00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,960
a single badge

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,240
ooh imagine a bale would actually help

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:53,440
those but still

00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:55,680
it would be cool no not very helpful

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,720
um yeah are there any other questions

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,720
coming from the chat

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,640
trent's asked for a little bit more

00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,280
information about the pin one thing he

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,839
says the

00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,880
pin one spot on his red and blackboard

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,240
seems to be

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:12,720
uh in the same place as the batch

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:15,280
yes yes it should have linked to the

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,560
standard documentation and documentation

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,560
all right i will try to get this up

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,599
close to the camera where you can see it

00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,680
if you're looking at the front of the

00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,680
badge and we'll use this

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,599
header as an example you can see that

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,720
there is a dot up there

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,640
signifying the orientation now i'm

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,760
holding the sayo in the same position

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,359
and unfortunately this is going to be

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,839
very small on your screen

00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,880
but the dot is not in the same position

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,680
this is

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,480
oriented to plug directly in but the dot

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:44,960
is actually

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:48,240
on the bottom near this pin here

00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,440
when it should be up near this pin here

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,760
so the one in order to avoid confusion

00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,880
because the sayo protos look identical

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,520
on the two sides

00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,480
it's very easy to get them back to front

00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,640
what i did was put

00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,760
text on the back that says pins this

00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,359
side

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,599
so the general rule is if you put the

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,640
pins on the side where it tells you to

00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:13,680
and you plug it in it'll be correct so

00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,680
ignore the dot just follow the pins

00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,079
and then someone was also asking about

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,920
um

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,000
i've lost the question because i'm very

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,290
clever like that

00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,639
uh

00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,639
[Music]

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,240
maybe you've vanished i don't know oh

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,560
the pads pads

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,400
like zero fifteen slash t3 what are they

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,440
for

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,200
so it's probably easiest to move

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,040
backwards for that one the t indicates

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,640
it's a touch pad

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,079
so it has uh the ability to view the

00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,000
capacitor you may not show

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,119
people where this is on the back of the

00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,400
bench

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,160
uh i'm just saying if we've got a

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,440
diagram of it with the pin out in the

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,400
slides anywhere

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,760
i suspect we don't that does sound like

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,720
the sort of useful information i would

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,079
have

00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,119
not included um

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:04,079
okay now this this slide here

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,280
actually yes i'm we are going to try

00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,640
something

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,800
we're going to try something dangerous

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,480
here and i'm going to switch to a

00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,319
different camera

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,119
so we are now looking at the overhead

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,119
camera yes

00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,520
and click that over flip it over you'll

00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,319
see

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,839
some little notes next to the pin

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:27,520
connections

00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:30,800
now as john was saying the

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,880
t indicates a touch input

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,400
so here's some test tees down this row

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,359
here

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,760
so you can see very small text on there

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,480
and some over here as well

00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:46,160
so in the code when you are referencing

00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,839
the touch inputs you can use those

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,680
uh yeah that helps you understand which

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,400
of the touch channels is associated with

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,000
the pins

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,440
i believe it's just an alias i think you

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,200
can still usually reference them

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:59,200
directly i have a reference as well

00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,960
yes interesting you know do we know two

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,960
of them are back to front

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,480
oh that's not good yeah eight and nine

00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,040
and reference backwards discovered the

00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,480
hard way

00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,000
i did all right

00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,760
uh i don't know if we answered that

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,160
question

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,880
we answered that question trent wanted

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,480
to know what the

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:21,680
the t indicated uh so there are some

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,640
a's okay so there are three different

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,760
types of label on the pins there there

00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,200
well actually for

00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,280
the a series shows the adc

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,880
which is analog to digital converter you

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,400
can see there is a dac

00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,079
the dac that's digital to analog

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,079
converter you can also

00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,520
see the t numbers those are the touch

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,400
channels

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,200
if it says pwm next to it then it is

00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,240
capable of

00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,599
pwm output so simulating an analog

00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,560
voltage

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,440
and the final number next to the pin is

00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,160
the direct

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:58,480
i o pin number like i o 27 i o 32 etc

00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,839
now one thing we haven't mentioned yet

00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,319
is that you will see that some of them

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:04,480
have a black border around them

00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,359
that border indicates that the pin is in

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,440
use

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,200
by one of the other headers like one of

00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,560
the cio headers

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,640
so you need to be careful when you are

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,079
picking which pins to use to not

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,040
conflict with something that's already

00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,880
in use

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,880
if you have a sayo that's plugged into

00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,880
one of the other headers

00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,560
it might be using io4 for example

00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,119
then you should not use that for

00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,359
something else at the same time

00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,720
and i think we are pretty much out of

00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:37,040
time now

00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:39,359
so we are now going to wrap up and uh

00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,200
nicola is going to do her mc duties hi

00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,680
it's lauren thank you very much john and

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,839
john

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,520
uh as you know we'll all be hanging out

00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,960
uh in the buff session

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,040
and you can catch us on spectrum if

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,839
you've got further questions but for now

00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,359
take a break

00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:52,880
stretch your legs don't forget to grab a

00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,480
drink of water and we'll be back soon

00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,200
for a killer talk about
