Open-hardware often (but not always) results in what we might call "soviet style" devices, that are highly functional, but perhaps not as visually appealing or polished in appearance as commercial equivalents.  However, this is not always the case.  Together with a bunch of similarly crazy folks, we have succeeded in making a complete community-designed and funded open-hardware computer, including a beautiful mechanical keyboard and injection moulded case. We are of course, talking about the MEGA65 retro computer.  

The MEGA65 is a re-creation of the never released Commodore(tm) 65 / 64DX computers, of which numerous prototypes existed. So our goal was to create something that looks just like the original, and that could share the joy of 1980s computing to both new and old audiences.

In this talk we discuss how we went about creating the physical form, culminating in a device that even owners of the original Commodore(tm) 65 prototypes agree is better and more polished. This will include how we tackled the design of the case, and getting that translated into working (and paid for!) injection moulds, as well as the full custom mechanical keyboard and its beautiful double-shot top and front printed key caps, and the full custom motherboard, and also how we managed to buy a bunch of 3.5" floppy drives in 2020 to go in the machines -- all without the stress and burden of running a traditional crowd-funding campaign.

The session will be a mix of sharing our path, together with open discussion so that folks who are thinking about making open hardware systems can pick our brains, so that we can help others along their open-hardware journeys.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

[Music]

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,880
good afternoon and welcome back to the

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,720
open hardware minicon

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,560
many of the projects that we feature at

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,880
the miniconf are

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,560
bare circuit boards and if you're very

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,480
lucky you might have a 3d printed case

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
to go with it or a laser cut case

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,519
but sometimes there are projects that

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,440
just take it to the next level

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,960
the talk this afternoon is going to be

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,760
about the mega 65

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,239
which is an epic project uh presented by

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,719
paul gardner stephen and martin streit

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,000
so thank you very much for coming along

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,239
i am very excited to see

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,200
what how this project came about because

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,920
the end result

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,360
is amazing so thank you very much and

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,360
take it away

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,719
thank you and thank you everyone for

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,600
tuning in today i hope you're having a

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,440
great conference

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,359
and hopefully the next 45 minutes or so

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,160
will be enjoyable and interesting as

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,000
well

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,359
so with it if you have any particular

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,840
aspects as we're going through that you

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,240
would like

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,680
us to talk more about we've asked the

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,799
kind volunteers to kind of pop those

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,960
through to us

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,240
in as near real time as we can and we

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,560
would love to be able to

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,320
uh to be responsive in that way because

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,320
we really wanted to benefit

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,759
uh all of you who are thinking about

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,040
making open hardware

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,880
so the mega 65

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,280
the project actually came about because

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,400
i used to own one of these commodore 65

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,840
prototypes uh that commodore uh had made

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,159
so commodore who made the commodore 64

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,680
and the 128 and the amiga

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,119
and then when they went bankrupt that

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,200
kind of emerged that they had these kind

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,119
of next generation commodore 64s called

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,640
the commodore 65

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,880
in prototype form and you know over time

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,960
they now worth you know probably 10 20

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,040
30 40 50 000

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,040
on the market if you have one and

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,040
because i used to own one

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,040
and i sold it actually to to do some

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,680
work with the server project

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,360
and afterwards was it was really fun

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,600
having one of those i'd like to

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,720
to make one in fpga and so the mega 65

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,720
is that process of saying let's make a

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,000
new commodore 65

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,440
in an fpga and as we started

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,200
thinking about what we wanted to do we

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,040
wanted it to be faster

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,120
we wanted it to be as compatible with

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,920
the commodore 64 as we could

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,239
and to really enjoy and be steeped in

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,840
that commodore 64 heritage

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,000
uh but we also wanted something that was

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,720
actually uh just a joy to use because

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,720
this is

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,239
in our mind this is the last 8-bit home

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,400
computer

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,560
that there is to come out uh you know

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,400
it's set there for the last 30 years

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,720
not being released and we've kind of

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,440
finished off or trying to finish off

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,400
uh what commodore left undone and so we

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,120
wanted it to you know

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,480
to have a nice keyboard good sound and

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,920
you know sd card for convenience all

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,560
those sorts of things and really just to

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,280
be

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,760
as fun a machine as we can and for it to

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,120
be

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,280
a fully open design as well uh and

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,319
i think as most of us that come along

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,159
with linuxconf

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,599
uh you know we we're aware of all the

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,120
reasons why open hardware and open

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,959
software are important

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,239
um but in the retro community we're also

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,560
keenly aware because there have been

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,159
projects that haven't been opened

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,159
and that as a result you actually can't

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,239
use the systems anymore

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,319
uh and so the c1 for example was a

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,440
commodore 64 in fpga that kind of

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,760
suffered that fate and you can't even

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,280
maintain it now because it's closed so

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,239
uh the openness was really important to

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,680
us uh from the beginning

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,280
so for those of you a little bit less

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,720
familiar with the uh

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,480
what commodore made in the 1980s

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,000
so in 1980 they released the vic-20

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,159
which was the first home computer to

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,080
sell more than a million units

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,760
and jack tramiel who was the head of

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,959
commodore at the time his

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,000
vision really was cheap and massive

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,920
volume

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,200
uh to get the price down uh vertical

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,280
integration all of those sorts of things

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,519
so the vic-20 was a great success

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,360
that then led to the commodore 64. in

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,959
true commodore cost saving fashion they

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,159
reused the case

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,400
and actually the first series of

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,840
commodore 64 even had vic-20 keyboards

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,000
in them as well

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,040
and that went on to be uh you know the

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,040
massive success

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,159
and it still kind of has that place in

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,040
culture

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,599
uh today and then a few years later

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,079
commodore released the commodore 128

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,560
which was a modest extension of the

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,919
commodore 64

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,919
and that also sold some millions of

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,040
units interestingly

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,639
it was much less profitable for

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,320
commodore than the commodore 64 was but

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,080
the story didn't finish at that point

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,320
there were rumors

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,960
in the late 80s of commodore making a

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,479
next generation commodore 64.

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,720
and that was kind of hyped up for a

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,000
while and then it kind of died away and

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,360
people thought oh maybe they didn't do

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,600
that but in actual fact commodore did

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,800
make a number of prototypes and as far

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,720
as we can tell

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,479
we're probably only months off actually

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,960
releasing the thing to the market before

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,000
they completely can the project

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,160
and so what we can see there at the

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,320
bottom is one of the original commodore

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,680
65 prototypes

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,600
uh and they have this distinctive kind

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,680
of shape with a front-facing disk drive

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,360
uh the largely commodore 64 keyboard

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,440
with a few more keys at the top

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,039
and blessing upon blessing the four-way

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,360
direction keys

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,479
in a sensible kind of way so it was

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,639
quite a

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,759
an interesting machine at the end of

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,759
that sort of 8-bit era

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,280
and so we set about trying to recreate

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,720
it and here

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,919
in this image we can actually see three

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,440
of our different prototyping stages

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,440
for the mega65 and we'll talk about all

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,080
the bits and pieces in this

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,520
a bit more in a moment and martin will

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,560
jump in

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,800
in that process as well the top left one

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,560
was our kind of cropped together

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,240
prototype around the first revision of

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,919
the motherboard that we made

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,680
and it's actually using a real commodore

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,520
65 keyboard

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,280
that we bought off ebay because there

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,880
was a pallet of those keyboards and i

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,320
think someone in eastern europe

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,080
bought them and kind of sells off some

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,080
every now and then so we

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,520
originally actually were making the the

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,000
machine to use

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,120
the real commodore 65 keyboards because

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
you know we believe that there was a

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,240
supply

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
we changed tack on that later the middle

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,280
machine

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,880
is one of the pre-series machines so

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,000
this has a second revision motherboard

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,759
that had a whole pile of the missing

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,240
things put in we will talk about

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,919
um it has our full custom keyboard for

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,639
the first time

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,520
and it has a vacuum formed prototype

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,520
case

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,759
to show what it's like and the one in

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,400
the bottom of the screen there

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,840
is actually in fact the one i have

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,840
sitting here with me

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,280
right now and so that's the third

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,960
revision motherboard

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,360
and that's with the actual injection

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,880
molded case and again the full custom

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,720
keyboard so we've kind of gone through

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,240
this process

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,800
to get to where we are now it wasn't all

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,440
just one go

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
and in fact the very first iteration was

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,880
not with a custom board we actually

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,800
started out with an off-the-shelf

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,880
fpga development board so the nexus 4

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,400
and this is actually what we implemented

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,160
the core in

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,280
to begin with but always with that view

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,880
that we wanted to go to

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,160
um a full custom board and uh

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,000
part of the reason that martin is with

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,319
me on the talk today

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,080
so i got to this point on my own and i

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,520
was having fun making this thing

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,400
but there was no way i was going to be

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,919
able to make a complete finished machine

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,880
and then martin and the other folks from

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,199
the museum of electronic games and art

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,919
in germany near frankfurt dropped me an

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,599
email said hey

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,240
we love what you're doing with this

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,680
commodore 65 recreation and would you

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,960
like to partner with us

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,880
to actually try and make the whole

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,120
machine and

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,400
this for me was not a question i needed

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,919
to think about

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,240
which is immediately yes you know it's

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,479
much more fun with a group of people

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,280
rather than on your own and it was

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,919
clear that we would be able to do much

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,919
much more

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,080
so the the first prototype motherboard

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,080
that was in that

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,840
clear acrylic case which actually was a

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,879
display cover for something completely

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,440
different

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,759
uh this was our first revision uh at the

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,599
board and so we kind of collected our

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,479
uh design uh requirements together

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,360
and uh the one of the great things that

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,800
came about through the museum of

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,000
electronic games and art

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,479
was actually that they were able to

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,319
reach out to some really good

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,879
manufacturers and partners in europe to

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,759
say hey let's actually look at making

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,160
something

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,199
and doing something really interesting

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,960
because of course there are many people

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,479
who are about the right age

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,120
to remember these 8-bit machines who are

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,800
now in sort of you know middle to senior

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,519
management positions

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,320
in these kinds of companies and so uh

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,000
you know

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,080
selling the vision of what we were

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,279
trying to do uh to these organizations

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,160
was one of the really great things

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,200
actually that

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,320
uh mega was able to uh to bring in quite

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,680
early and so

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,800
this motherboard is made by trends

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,880
uh in germany uh and so they actually

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,720
make the pcbs themselves and they do the

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,959
chicken picking and the circuit board

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,519
design layout and everything so they

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,200
very kindly did the design for these and

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,040
made us the prototype units uh we're a

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,800
little bit rushed

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,640
and so not everything we wanted was on

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,839
there including things like the sd card

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,080
reader that's what the

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,519
the wires that you can see on there are

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,519
actually connecting up but you can see

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,360
we already have joystick ports we have a

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,200
commodore 64 expansion port a commodore

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,000
64 disk drive port

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,519
uh vga digital video 100 megabit

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,839
ethernet

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,680
and at the far at the top there you can

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,120
see the 34 pin black floppy connector to

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,720
drive the internal

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,560
disk drive which uses a standard pc

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,560
drive rather than a funny commodore one

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,839
and then there's sort of you know

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,880
debugger interfaces and power and the

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,040
like

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,760
one of the other notable changes with

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,320
the compare the later ones is that the

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,519
power jack on this one is on the side

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,880
next to the power switch

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,880
on the later ones we actually move that

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,320
to face the back because we actually

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,600
found that it made it much nicer on the

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,760
desk to not have the

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,800
the cord uh kind of sticking out like

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,079
that

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,839
uh and again it's things that we're all

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:08,000
able to do with the

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,000
the close partnership that we had

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,680
so as we said we put it in the

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,240
leftover display case that i found at

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,320
the uni that someone was throwing out

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,480
just to have something to uh to hold it

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,680
uh and the original commodore 65

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,720
keyboard connected to that

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,720
and you can actually see in the box

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,160
there's even more wires in there because

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,760
we realized quite quickly that there was

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,800
a whole pile of things that we had left

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,959
off

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,160
that board including more pull-up

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,079
resistors than you can poke a stick at

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,760
but it was actually really helpful to to

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,640
you know confirm a bunch of design

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,279
decisions

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,160
and uh to be able to make good uh

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,160
progress

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,360
uh instead of just being on the um the

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,240
little nexus board that didn't have any

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,240
of these real ports

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,480
uh and again you can sort of see some of

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,440
the horrors in the case and

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,680
actually the other thing you can see

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,480
here on the um the genuine commodore 65

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,440
keyboard

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,839
you can see that i've actually had to

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,040
write the key labels on the top

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,440
because the keyboard that i got from

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,800
ebay didn't have the top

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,079
printing on there because they had

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,519
different variants for english and

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,640
german

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,079
and of course they had a whole pile of

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,640
keyboards made that had neither and then

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,800
they would actually you know

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,959
they obviously would do the printing a

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,800
bit later in the process

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,120
and so i kept writing on in pencil every

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,800
two or three days the um

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,480
uh you know the key labels and so q of

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,320
course lasted a lot longer than the

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,680
the keys under the home keys and things

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,760
uh where you type more frequently

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,040
so maybe i'll flip over to martin now to

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,959
talk about the um

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,920
this one yeah so um while paul had in

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,880
australia the

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,480
the case that he made from uh found

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,360
parts let's say

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,640
we actually worked on getting the case a

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,440
bit more to

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,160
the more like finished product and this

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,040
was the

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,320
first mega 65 prototype that we showed

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,519
at amiga 30

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,760
which was a event in germany

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,200
and you can still see the the powers

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,040
from the side

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,440
so this is the very first one and

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,800
there's also the mega logo on it

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,959
from the museum and so we

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,079
had that and if you can go to the next

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,720
slide there

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,360
um we can sort of see some other uh

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,240
folks that

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,000
are in the team and where that was

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,600
presented and people could try it and

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
play with it and

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,279
there's a whole bunch of videos online

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,959
some of it in german

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,760
some some folks from um from the days of

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,079
uh the commodore actually visited there

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,920
and

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:38,880
and there's some talks there and um

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,320
so that was um that's about five or six

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,639
years actually ago

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:48,000
and um if we go to the next one

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,480
we actually have um went back to the

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,839
board

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,639
um and um have now here the revision 2

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,360
board

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,560
and this one is was intended to be

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,200
feature complete

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,240
and most of the problems were fixed but

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,639
there were still some missing pull-ups

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,680
but we now have dual sd so there's one

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,000
in the bottom part

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,920
which is a full sd card slot and there

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,600
is a micro sd card slot in the

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:17,360
top right that you can see but

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:21,360
we discovered a couple of things that

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,320
there's only uh

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,720
floppy drive interface that can connect

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,720
it but

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,880
we wanted to have pc style wiring

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,040
and some of the details also paul will

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,440
jump in and correct me because

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,680
yeah so on the revision one we only had

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,680
the the motor and the select

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,519
lines for the first drive on the cable

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,120
and not for the second drive as well so

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,839
we fixed that

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,839
um on this second one i think

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,639
and then it was a couple of other parts

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,560
so and now we have here the

00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:02,399
arctic 7 100 t as an fpga on that

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:06,320
and what is on that board uh still

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:09,120
is an um a chip for the digital video

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,839
which you actually later removed in our

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,959
next

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,959
iteration yeah yes and and so

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,279
um that actually produced quite a

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,680
headache and we're basically talking

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,360
about

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,560
a digital video you might know as hdmi

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:28,639
and getting that

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,040
to work is quite a drama

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,199
which we see on on on the next slide

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,720
there

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,880
yeah so it was a massive drama so the um

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,399
we thought okay we'll do this the safe

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,279
and sensible way so we spoke with trends

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,839
and said oh

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,480
what part would you recommend to produce

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,680
hdmi compatible video

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,959
and they said oh you should use this one

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,800
we'll use it in a number of projects and

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,880
it worked perfectly

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,160
and so we thought okay yep excellent uh

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,519
and there was lots of instances like

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,360
this where having the partner of trends

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,000
was actually really helpful to

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,360
to make design decisions for the board

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,639
but what we found was that this

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,880
particular chip

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:09,600
doesn't work properly at 480p and 576p

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,360
it produces perfect hdmi at higher

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,120
resolutions

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,160
but it's just my feeling is that they

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,399
probably hadn't connected it to a um

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,800
a protocol analyzer at those low

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,040
resolutions and confirmed that the hdmi

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,240
audio worked properly because this is

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,760
actually what the problem was that the

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,240
audio would work on some monitors not

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,759
others and then other monitors would

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,040
partner me show a display and or sound

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,680
for a while and then the screen would go

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,000
blank

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,519
for half a second and come back again

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,959
and it really varied on the model of

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,199
monitors it was

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,199
really really painful and so i think we

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,839
spent what about 10 months

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,320
maybe even longer of me pulling my hair

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,399
out

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,079
trying to you know look at all the i

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,800
squared c programming information for

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,240
this chip

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,680
and you know have we left something out

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,000
we couldn't use the official driver

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,880
because

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,320
we had no embedded uh you know windows

00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,440
or linux operating system because the

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,079
mega 65 is

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,440
pure fpga implementing an 8-bit system

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,360
which was one of the design goals that

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,839
we wanted there is no

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,600
big cpu if you like in there and so this

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,600
is one of the areas where that was

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,120
a little bit annoying because we

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,399
couldn't just easily you know run their

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,079
driver and go look

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,399
we did it and it doesn't work um adv

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,440
were quite helpful on their forums uh

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,160
and if you

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,199
look at the mega 65 blog uh you'll see

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,720
there's some discussions that we had

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,560
with them around that

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,959
um in the end uh we actually

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,639
we took a bit of a punt we knew that

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,600
there were some other projects that had

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,839
had full open source hdmi compatible

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,680
implementations in fpga

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,320
uh just using the differential lines

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,160
from the fpga directly

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,320
and so we thought that this would be the

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,720
best way to do it and just get rid of

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,440
this chip that was causing us problems

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,560
um so we ordered a cheap fpga board that

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,560
had the

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,240
that wiring on it but didn't have a big

00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,680
enough fpga to run our whole course we

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,399
had to kind of you know cut it down and

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,240
just do a test

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,480
and so that was more compatible but it

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,079
still wasn't perfect at the time

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,400
uh but we had to make a decision did we

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,640
think we could get that one right

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,520
or did we think that we could get the um

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,480
the one with the

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,880
uh the complex proprietary hdmi driver

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,919
chip to work and in the end we made the

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,600
right decision

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,600
which was to go with the full open

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,640
implementation because we could indeed

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,240
debug it

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,919
and i've been keeping an eye out on ebay

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:33,360
for a while for hdmi protocol analyzers

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,760
and the end of life support

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,960
final end of life support for windows xp

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,720
was a blessing

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,360
because there are these digilent

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,720
protocol analyzers that will do hdmi 1.4

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,840
a

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,440
but they only work on windows xp nothing

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,960
new and nothing older

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,039
and so through the university i had to

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,039
arrange to get access to a windows xp

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,280
license and put it in a virtual machine

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,240
um unfortunately all the software for it

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,760
worked but i mean we could get the

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,760
protocol analyzer for

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,080
was under a thousand dollars instead of

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,160
about fifteen thousand dollars

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,600
and after having spent about three weeks

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,600
trying to get the pure

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,520
fpga implementation of hdmi working and

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,200
only getting it mostly working

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,120
it was what two or three days i think

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,960
martin and we had

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:20,640
perfect flawless uh hdmi

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,080
compatible output uh so we're actually

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,919
now in this really interesting situation

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,640
so we're not licensing the hdmi

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,200
trademark for the mega 65

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,559
we don't need to you can use any shape

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,160
connector you want

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,640
um but we can actually say that it's

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,640
hdmi tm compatible because we've

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,039
actually put it through

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,799
one of the official protocol analyzers

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,840
that are actually used for

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,080
hdmi compliance testing so we can say

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,679
that it has an hdmi compatible

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,320
display output and

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,679
yeah that whole process was as i said

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,799
that was the the better part of a year

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,799
of just pulling

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,400
hair out in the process actually there

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,640
were some changes we had to

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,640
do to get to that with the clocking and

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,559
everything in the fpga design

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,799
um but that's a whole other story happy

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,559
to talk to people about that

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,840
but less interesting from the the

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,840
hardware perspective

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:18,880
so all of that as i say was

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,280
finishing off while the revision 3

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,440
circuit board was being designed

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,000
during covert lockdown and while i was

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:29,440
living in the middle of the outback

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,640
um so this was logistically

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,080
uh a really interesting kind of process

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,960
so martin and the guys in germany were

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,200
gazing with

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,559
trends to get the the various remaining

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,360
fixes

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,640
uh put onto the board and we'll actually

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,160
we'll do a little bit of a tour of the

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,679
board in a moment martin can

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,760
pan a camera around and we can actually

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,919
talk about what's on the board

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,640
um but so that board was getting made

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,480
and the postal

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,919
system to deliver so we're living at

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,799
arcala at the very top of the flinders

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,559
ranges

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,320
for the post to get there it goes to a

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,159
private bag in port augusta from there

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,559
it hopefully and usually gets into the

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,400
right locked bag

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,080
and then the locked bag gets transported

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,039
to copley on a

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,679
friday and on a wednesday and then all

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,159
going well

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,000
on a monday and a thursday we get the

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,120
post actually physically come out to us

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,240
there at the village

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,840
and then we actually have to kind of

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,720
walk in uh from where we're living out

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,200
in the house

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,559
about a kilometer away into the village

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,280
and check whether there's any mail for

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,400
us so

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,080
it's a little bit of a convoluted

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,640
process and if it ends up in the wrong

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,159
bag

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,960
as we had one parcel that

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,559
ended up in a bag going to william creek

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,240
uh so it went from port augusta to

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,080
cooper pd cooper pd to william creek

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,080
william creek said this isn't for us

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,600
um put it back in the bag to cooper pd

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,880
cooper pd said what on earth is this

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,159
doing coming to us this should have gone

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,520
to port augusta they sent it back to

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,720
port augusta port augusta sent it back

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,480
to kuberpedi

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,559
cooper pd sent it back to port augusta

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,679
port augusta eventually sent it up to me

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,640
so it took

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,919
four or five weeks to get some bits and

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,320
pieces through

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,280
um the motherboard fortunately i think

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,600
came through

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,640
within a fortnight but again we were so

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,640
crunched for time

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,280
uh at that point so i had to work on

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,919
doing the fpga and the board bring up

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,360
remotely with the guys in germany uh so

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,320
i would generate a bitstream and they

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,919
would test it and

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,000
you know tell me whether the you know a

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,840
particular board function was working

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,240
so that we could if we had to we could

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,200
get a fourth revision of the board made

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,000
in a timely manner because what we had

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,440
uh

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,280
ticking was the dev kit

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,480
stage that we wanted to do we wanted to

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,600
get 25 machines

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,720
into the hands of developers uh

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,799
hopefully

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,320
um and also to generate a little bit of

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,840
additional revenue for us for the kind

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,039
of finishing tasks and things that we do

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,080
and we're totally open with the

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,799
community about that and they were

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,360
really

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,880
good and supportive with that and so

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,880
yeah we had this kind of whole

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,480
a bit of time crunch and then the board

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,200
turned up and we actually had it ninety

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,120
percent

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,320
uh already working and then it was just

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,159
the remaining bits and pieces that i

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,200
needed to do

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:04,080
from where i was so um

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,760
the the time zone difference uh is a

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,200
problem at times fortunately i'm often

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,080
up early and the guys in germany are up

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,360
late

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,039
and so it usually works out fairly well

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,400
and as i think many of us in the open

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,320
source community know that you know you

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,679
can have a distributed team

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,280
and if everyone is on the same kind of

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,559
page and you you know how you're working

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,120
this can actually work

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,919
uh really really well so maybe martin

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,400
would you like to

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,840
start doing a tour of the board with the

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,120
camera and i can talk about the the

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,200
components as we move around

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,840
i can do that um and so

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,280
okay yep so apologies i'm going to be

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,320
looking across to the side so that i can

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,159
see what

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,640
martin is showing here so

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,919
also what we're what we're seeing is an

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,840
r2 board so

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:53,039
um all the r3 boards went to developers

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,640
and so i only have an r2 board here

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,360
for the presentation but that's totally

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,559
fine and paul you can also direct me to

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,320
certain things like

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,600
sure so i guess start in one corner and

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,720
we'll just kind of we'll work our way

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,600
around i reckon

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,960
well i guess from our connections from

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,520
the outside i guess power

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,960
what we have on the side yep power uh

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
and the two joystick ports these are

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,840
standard

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,039
uh five volt atari commodore style

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,480
joystick ports

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,400
now one thing that we did realize and

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,200
this is a bit of a bummer is that

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,480
um we didn't think about some uh funny

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,080
things that can go in the joystick port

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,600
needing two-way communication so the

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,440
joystick ports are

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,480
input only on there now what we did

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,720
implement

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,480
on the revision3 board uh was support

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,200
for the commodore 64 mouse the commodore

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,600
64 mouse is the most bizarre thing

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,960
um because commodore tried to come up

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,200
with a way to make a mouse that would

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,520
work on a standard atari port

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,640
without needing a lot of cpu power and

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,559
so the way that she does that it

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,159
pretends to be a pair of paddles

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,840
and there's a microcontroller in the

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,440
mouse that

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,360
decides how long before it starts

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,279
pumping five volts onto the analog

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,559
input on the joystick port timing it

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,960
precisely

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,320
so that the analog to digital converter

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,240
in the commodore 64

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,720
can read out that it can actually read

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,640
out a six bit mouse position for x and y

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,159
uh each iteration so we had to implement

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,480
uh that logic which was a little bit

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,400
uh complicated uh but we were really

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,679
happy that we've got that working

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,400
and the reset button of course in that

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,080
bottom uh corner uh it's just a

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,760
convenience the commodore 64 never had

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,080
one the 128 did and

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,840
every later computer that commodore made

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,039
uh in the 8-bit line certainly had one

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,720
because it just made life

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,559
so much easier and next right next to

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,799
that there next to the screw

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,840
is an internal speaker connector that

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,320
we've put on there

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,760
on the revision three uh there's two of

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,039
those for stereo now

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,520
and we actually need to do on the

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,520
revision for um

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,799
or whether we can do it with a component

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,640
change we've got a problem with the

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,279
audio filters on that so if anyone

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,559
does dsp work we'd love to hear we the

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,559
filter we've got isn't actually

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,120
filtering out the high frequency noise

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,880
and that makes the speakers get hot uh

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,200
as they get 100 kilohertz

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,240
or even megahertz kind of speed coming

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,840
through

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,960
um the the next little connector there

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,600
four pin connector

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,279
is basically an i squared c header uh

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,080
that the guys that trends just added

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,200
um they said oh if we put something like

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,960
this on the people can make other kind

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,120
of interesting expansions and so we were

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,000
totally happy to have that on there

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,279
um in the middle we've got the battery

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,080
for the real-time clock

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,360
which is next to that cable connector uh

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,840
it's actually the real-time clock chip

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,159
and then the cable connector is to the

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,760
keyboard

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,360
so unlike the original c65 keyboard

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,880
we actually use a serial protocol to

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,480
talk to the keyboard

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,000
but the keyboard doesn't have a slow

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,840
microcontroller

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,440
it has another little fpga so our main

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,279
fpga on the main board is the xilinx

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,480
this one is a lattice

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,880
uh something that could be done with a

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,279
full open tooling

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,360
the nice thing with that is that we

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,880
still have effectively zero latency on

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,880
the keyboard

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,440
so i think we get a keyboard update

00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,000
every 50 kilohertz or so

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,240
um so you know this of the order of 20

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,760
microseconds of delay on the keyboard

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,840
which compares of course very favorably

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,320
to usb keyboards that can have

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,919
uh you know milliseconds and potentially

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,039
many milliseconds of

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:16,159
delay okay

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,559
so uh the big chip

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,279
next to the red led is the the main fpga

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,880
itself

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,840
so the revision 2 board is a little bit

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,919
unusual it's got the

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,200
100t uh fpga from xilinx

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,960
the revision 3 board we've actually

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,679
managed to go back to having the 200 t

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,640
which is a much bigger fpga which you're

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,919
really happy about so that's going to

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,760
let people port

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,360
many more different cores to it so we

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,880
can have an omega core without needing

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,720
any external ram

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,960
but we do also have an eight megabyte

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,480
external ram on there

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,720
okay so we've then got the

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,640
internal sd card slot which has just

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,320
moved out of view

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,600
next there are two standard p-mod

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,039
connectors that are directly connected

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,240
to the fpga

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,080
so you can put interesting things on

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,039
there a couple of leads which of course

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,960
we've got blinking

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,720
the chip you can see in the frame here

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,600
toward the bottom next to those two

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,039
headers

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,480
is a third fpga so trends

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:11,039
put this one on so that we basically

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,240
have brick proofing for end users

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,240
so this fpga can read a bit stream from

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,840
an sd card and can feed it to the xilinx

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,200
fpga at least when we implement the

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,520
bitstream to do that because again

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,960
there's no big cpu on here to do that

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,440
for us

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,440
to the left of that is the debug

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,279
connector for jtag for that

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,880
max 10 fpga so indeed it's a max10 fpga

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,600
from altera so we've got an altera

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,880
xylinx and a lattice fpga on this

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,760
project

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,799
which lots of hard disk space for the

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,039
software

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,440
and then with the green spot that's the

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,360
debug connector for the main xilinx fpga

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:51,360
so that's the

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:54,559
the digilent trends style connector

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,559
um and yeah this jtag it also has a

00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,080
serial board so the mega 65 has a serial

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,520
debug interface

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,520
uh right back from the beginning so

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,919
that's available on that via usb which

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,480
is really comfortable for development

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,320
uh on the lower right we've got the 34

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,399
pin floppy connector which

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,720
we know about and two power connectors

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,919
with five and 12 volts on them

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,279
which of course can be used for floppy

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,200
drives or indeed for other kind of

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,880
internal expansions so

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,399
there is plans to make an internal

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,000
expansion board that would have

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,600
uh you know for physical sid chips and

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,120
some of the missing commodore 64 ports

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,320
that we didn't put

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,159
on the main board to keep the price

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,720
under control

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,760
and so that might then draw 12 volts

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,240
from there for example to power

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,840
sid chips and that will be fine now to

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,080
the left of the green spot we've got the

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,520
100 megabit ethernet

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,919
and again there's no microcontroller

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,120
this is direct connected via a fire chip

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,520
into the fpga and we have our pure uh

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,720
vhdl open source 100 megabit ethernet

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,640
controller

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,799
um which is then available to the 8-bit

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,039
computer this is probably the

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,960
fastest 100 megabit ethernet that you

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,279
can get on any 8-bit machine

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,240
super low latency and and all that kind

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,200
of thing because it's all

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,720
pure in the fpga fabric the micro sd

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,720
slot to the right of that

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,480
so you can have two sd cards one that's

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,480
easier to change from the outside

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,919
to the right of that is the audio jack

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,720
we've got the wiring wrong on the rf2

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,559
board we fixed it on the ref 3 board

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,120
then to the left of ethernet we have the

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:22,000
hdmi compatible video output

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,960
and then we have the vga output and they

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,320
can both be driven

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,159
independently by the fpga

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,399
uh yep so you can see the the ports

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,720
there on the back so this is actually

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,919
uh useful we could actually put a debug

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,240
interface on one and have

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,679
the the live display on the other uh

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,200
because we have this kind of matrix mode

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,480
thing in the mega 65 that we've shown

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,240
before

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,600
where you it's hardware composited by

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,159
the fpga so you can

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,760
debug and change memory and view memory

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,880
uh and that's all good

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,120
but also if when we make a 128 core um

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,960
128 the commodore 128 was unusual in

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,880
that it had two video outputs that were

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,080
independent one for 80 column one for 40

00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,520
column and

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,600
some people who use that system really

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,799
like that feature and so we can actually

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,840
do that on the commodore on the mega 65

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,480
because we have these two fully

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,520
independent video outputs

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,840
then to the right of that we have the

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,559
commodore 64 disk drive

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,840
port so this is commodore's infamously

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:19,120
slow

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:22,640
ieee 488 without all the the speed

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,520
connector and the expansion port

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,080
uh and i think that's pretty much got us

00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,679
the lap

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:33,360
around the um uh the motherboard

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,440
and yeah so it's the

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,679
oh yes it's a no let me just check the

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,120
next slide whether we're

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:44,320
up to that i'm just going to hop through

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:47,360
a couple of the slides

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,840
um okay so stay on martin uh we'll talk

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,440
about the

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,440
injection molded case before we move on

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,360
to the dev kit um

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,520
so martin if you can show me the bring

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,039
that back into frame

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,200
so what martin's got here is one of the

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,159
first shots that came out from the

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,279
injection molding process for the cases

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,120
and because this is

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,960
what's going to be the final cases and

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,559
so we can see we've got the same ports

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,720
now just move it across toward the other

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,080
end we've got these cut outs

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,840
this was when we did the planning for

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,840
the expansion connector so the big

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,679
one on the right is for a user port

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,320
corner 64 user port

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,760
then it's composite video output

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,840
commodore 64 style

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,480
the next little one is for the commodore

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,919
65 disk drive expansion port

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,919
of which i think there are two known

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,000
disk drivers in existence

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,279
but someone reverse engineered the board

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,880
and then the last one is actually a

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,200
commodore 64 tape port

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,080
or just whatever people jolly will like

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,519
and so

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,679
we wanted for people to be able to pop

00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:45,039
these things out without having to

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,640
you know hack the case to pieces

00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:48,320
and we're able to get screw bosses and

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,760
things put everywhere

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,720
uh to support having uh the boards

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,880
you know we can have a board there and

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,240
have it really well supported for that

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,640
so thinking ahead

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,159
for these things um before the hardware

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,880
gets hard to change

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,200
is really worthwhile so we'll come back

00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,200
to how we got that case made in a moment

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:12,399
um but we'll go via the um

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,440
the dev kit process so

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:16,399
what we've got here is uh one of the dev

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,320
kit

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,080
machines so this is with the rev3 board

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,720
that has all of those corrections on it

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,519
which is the current revision in an

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,760
acrylic

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,120
case made by a plexi laser i think isn't

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,360
it in germany

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,399
yeah and yeah to to give a little

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:33,519
context um

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,679
so the um what you see there with the

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:38,159
process of making the case is

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,960
um many many iterations it's another

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,240
manufacturer

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,279
actually in austria that we found

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,120
and to

00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,679
when you do an injection molding so if

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,720
that's not um familiar to everyone

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,919
is that you get heavy machinery and

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:59,039
you mill out of a big block of metal

00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:02,720
the form and you put then the

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:05,279
plastic in it in a in hot state

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,240
and then press it and then you get out

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,559
the case

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,480
and these tools the tooling is super

00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:14,159
super expensive

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,480
and so you also want to get it right and

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,600
the the tooling we actually started a

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,880
crowdfunding for that

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,399
and we assumed that it will take us

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,519
quite some time to actually get the

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,480
funds together

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,159
and that this would give us actually at

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,679
least a year or more

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:34,480
to continue working on on the fpga side

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,519
and so the idea was okay so we have a

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,240
board

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,919
but we want to give this out to we want

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,159
to get this out to the community so they

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,440
can also develop on the software side

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,600
so but just giving out a board was like

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,720
that's not super cool so let's figure

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,840
out um

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,080
another way of how we can get a case

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,440
made early and of course people would

00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,840
probably think also about

00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,480
3d printing we did also that so there

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,039
are some

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,840
3d printed prototypes but it doesn't

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,559
work

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,000
well for such a case in in that size or

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,320
it's also

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,520
quite expensive in in that number that

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,280
you want to get so

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,119
we went through these stages to actually

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,839
see what we could do

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,440
and then also spoke back and forth with

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,200
a tooling manufacturer

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,720
while having a crowdfunding and um

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,119
with the crowdfunding we didn't actually

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,159
go for any of the major platforms

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,720
because we were like

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,200
oh no we don't want to give someone the

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,480
um

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,040
the percentage and also we don't want to

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,760
have this

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,159
30 day limit or something to get this

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,079
done

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,280
or you're not funded or something so we

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,760
actually went

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,800
retro style and made a high score board

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,399
and said like here

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:50,320
um you can like put in some coins into

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:54,879
um sort of the machine to to play game

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:59,040
and we started that in end of uh 2019

00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:02,079
and um what is it 65 days or the

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,800
the squaresome

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,760
we actually uh got this all funded which

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,920
was kind of

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,880
interesting because the community looked

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,480
at it and said like

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,400
after like a couple of weeks um or like

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,440
two weeks or something oh if this goes

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,720
like on like this it's going to be 20 20

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,320
30 or something

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,920
until the funding is there and we

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,599
produce a case um

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,680
we didn't include the graph but you can

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,320
find it online it's like it goes like a

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,839
line of

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,680
okay here's the funding and then it goes

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:32,560
like this so

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,800
someone was sort of super enthusiastic

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,079
and

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:39,119
actually just finished the funding uh

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,640
super fast and we were like oh okay so

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,599
now we can actually produce the

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,320
um the mold and for this mod we're

00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,000
talking about

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,240
60 to 70 000 euro uh just to give you

00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,119
uh a nice perspective and that was for

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,160
us something

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,760
okay we can't um kind of pay this

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,599
upfront so we actually asked the

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,720
community and the whole project is

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,119
with a community but on the second track

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:04,560
we need to get out some boards that are

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,119
also produced so we can

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,520
figure out what's going wrong and this

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,880
is where plexi laser came in and

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,079
they produce cases for various retro

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,720
machines

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,760
out of acrylic glass and they cut it and

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,520
bend it and have

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,800
some fun processes and they made one

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:28,480
custom for for us in that case

00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:31,839
and we could get 100 death kits out

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,160
last year end of last year and

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,720
so this is what you can see here and

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,960
it's in a nice acrylic shape

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,960
and it's also smaller so the the floppy

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,760
drive is on the side some people

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,560
really like that um we might consider

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,359
this small

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:52,720
form factor for future releases but

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,520
yeah that's kind of what you can see

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,560
here

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,520
and maybe we continue to the

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,520
next slide there so this is another team

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,800
member this is anton

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,119
and here it's a 15 minute video of

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,079
how to assemble this dev kit and this is

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,720
online one can see

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,920
it and can have some fun there's one

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,359
with music there's one

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:19,680
where he's only talking because

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:22,240
people needed to assemble that and

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,160
from the devkit we also want to talk

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,160
about some other parts that are there um

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,119
the keyboard is one of the

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,240
main features it's your user interface

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,040
on the retro machine

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,680
and this is something that is super

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,440
important

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:41,359
and um so on on this

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,480
um there they were couple produced

00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:47,839
for the um pre-series

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:51,839
and now we produce some for

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:54,400
also the developer kit and

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,119
i don't know it's it's basically the the

00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,079
standard

00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:03,119
um c64 c65 keyboard

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,800
and it has super nice keys and if we go

00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,520
maybe to the next slide i can

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,560
also say something about huh so as i'm

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
saying with the keywords

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,640
we're running out of time i think people

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,560
have got questions i think we've got 10

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,880
minutes including question time left

00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,640
oh yes um so we might just on the

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,200
keyboard uh save it a little bit more

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,240
and then

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,280
uh wrap it around so yep yeah cool

00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,200
so the um for us the the three key

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,480
pieces were the the motherboard the case

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,400
and the keyboard

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,079
and for the keyboard some other retro

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,000
projects have kind of made

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,119
it's quite an understandable compromise

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,320
of using a standard pc104 layout or

00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,560
you know one of these other standard

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:42,000
layouts and putting custom keycaps

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,520
on a mechanical keyboard um to get

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,720
part of me most of the way to the

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,560
original but we wanted something that

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,880
had the fidelity

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,000
to the original in every way and so we

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,480
actually

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
with gmk went through the process of

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,079
actually making this full custom

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,280
keyboard as i said it's got a cpld and

00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,640
fpga on the back rather than a

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,680
microcontroller

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,520
it has the layout we want and the um the

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,320
lock keys was a little bit of a drama we

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,040
couldn't get the

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,560
the locking cherry uh mx keys anymore

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,400
you used to be able to get them

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,240
but we can't anymore so we instead went

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,839
for ones with uh

00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,240
we put an led in so we can actually see

00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:19,200
whether it's uh it's on or not

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,000
and we used the clickiest mx keys we

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,839
could find

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,280
um compared to the less clicky ones for

00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,920
the rest of the keys

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,359
so there is a tactile difference you

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,560
feel the difference of the lock key just

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,480
like on an original

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,320
8-bit machine and you hear the

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,359
difference and with the light

00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,280
this is just a really nice

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,400
end result and the other thing that

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,680
we're able to do with working with gmk

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,040
is that we have the front printing on

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,079
the keys just like the original rather

00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,359
than kind of the

00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,200
uh you know the cheaper way of putting

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:49,440
those symbols on the top

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,320
um and those keys are double shot molded

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,119
as well so that

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,200
you never rub uh the thing off so

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,640
everyone who handles the mega 65

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,960
keyboard just falls in love with it and

00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,480
go

00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,839
and says oh why do i have to do cross

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,119
development for this machine why can't i

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,760
just type on the

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:04,800
uh the keyboard directly and for us

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,640
actually that

00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,240
recreating that joy of the 1980s getting

00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,000
a home computer experience is what we

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,160
set out to achieve

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,839
and we've put a lot of hard work into it

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,000
but it's just blown us away

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,960
at how much people have really kind of

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,800
you know

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,760
enjoyed that experience we've got people

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,800
who are sort of saying they haven't

00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,680
enjoyed coding

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,359
this much for 30 years as they kind of

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,480
go through that process again

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,079
of rediscovering what uh you know an

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,440
8-bit machine is capable of and the

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,280
simplicity of that and having the

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,960
beautiful form and it just

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,400
feeling right and nice and you turn it

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,680
on and it's on uh

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,000
and all of those sorts of things so um

00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,720
before we move to questions just wanna

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,200
you know

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:49,040
as always uh to the community you know

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,680
this is an open source project

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,960
uh the community uh is actively working

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,480
on making software for it on

00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,680
documentation the documentation we've

00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,040
also put a lot of work into making

00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,560
beautiful as well

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,400
in the original style it's now nearly a

00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,280
thousand page book

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,160
um it's a really it's just really fun uh

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,640
to work on

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,599
and if you have kind of retro nostalgia

00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,800
then you know

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,440
drop us a line or if you just want to

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,760
come and have a look if you go to

00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,119
mega65.org

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,359
there's a link to our discord server

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,599
there as well and you know

00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,040
we'd love to welcome more folks to you

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,160
know to come and join us on this crazy

00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,640
journey

00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,160
of making something which is you know

00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,960
it's a piece of history it's a piece of

00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,440
art

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,720
and it's just a really fun uh geeky kind

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,280
of device did you

00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,240
have anything last you wanted to add

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,480
mutton

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,359
no i i guess we can go to questions and

00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,040
see um

00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:39,680
what people want to know more about and

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,720
then we'll just do that so if

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:46,960
um i think if jonathan wants to

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,960
join and relay those questions

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,640
because otherwise we will talk for hours

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,760
yes

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,800
i'm back okay yeah we only have a couple

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,960
of minutes but there

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,400
are quite a few questions all right

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,480
because i'm uh

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,079
i'm gonna start with one of my own which

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,599
is really a personal question

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,440
there are many reasons for doing a

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,400
project like this what is

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,520
personally for you paul and martin why

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,520
did you undertake this

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,560
um lots of reasons

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,960
um part of it was just sellers remorse

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,119
and not having a commodore 65 anymore

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,800
um part of it was just it was just fun i

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,160
always wanted to make a commodore 64

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,560
accelerator

00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,520
and fpgas got big enough and cheap

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,040
enough

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,760
to do so yeah it was just it was all

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,240
about

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,359
fun from the beginning for me i think

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,520
okay great

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:43,599
and martin yeah i joined

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,280
the museum of electronic games and arts

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,400
as a photographer

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,319
at some point and i'm not in the c64

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,640
generation so i didn't

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,720
experience this as a child or as a

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,480
teenager or something

00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,800
and i photographed all this old hardware

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,720
from them and

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,319
i was part in the beginning then i

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,000
dropped out a little bit and then i

00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:08,160
joined back in

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:12,079
and i'm doing lots of video stuff photos

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,319
and also now to actually make this

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:16,319
and to work with all these companies we

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,319
set up also a small

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,440
company entity so we can actually do

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,640
this in

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,520
illegal and tax and whatever all these

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,079
things um when you work with lots of

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,440
money

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,520
and um with big companies and

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,960
it's just a community project out of

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,680
this museum and then

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,079
also with the folks and to to actually

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,839
make

00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,440
make a dream happen and we're working on

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,560
this for now six years

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,040
so it's just continue continue until you

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,400
actually

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,359
can finally release it so um

00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,400
and yeah that's that's just um why we're

00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,839
doing that

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,960
so it's an obsession that's what you're

00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:56,800
saying

00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,160
great now you mentioned setting up a

00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,359
company and all of that sort of sort of

00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,240
thing that ties into a couple of

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,880
questions

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:04,640
um so james sinclair asked how much was

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,480
the tooling for the case and at some

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,800
point you mentioned a fee of i think 60

00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,880
to 70 000 euros is that

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,560
that was the figure yeah a little over a

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,839
hundred thousand australian dollars

00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,720
um and that was cheap for getting it

00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,560
done properly

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,079
so this is a really interesting point we

00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,680
could have done it cheaper in china but

00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,720
then we wouldn't own the tools and have

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,440
control of them

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,319
and as it turned out with covert that

00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,520
was a very

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:31,359
good decision a problem likewise yeah a

00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,880
circuit board manufacturer happens in

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,480
germany

00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,319
so we were talking some of the other

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,119
retro projects and they were just

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,680
uh you know dead in the water yeah

00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,040
because

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:42,640
the chinese companies are saying we're

00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,000
not taking on any little projects for

00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,960
the next year they're focusing on the

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,000
big stuff to

00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,800
to keep them going um and to simplify

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,160
things and so

00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,319
yes yeah by a well for quality

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,160
rather than price there are other

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:58,800
benefits that have come in from that

00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:01,200
and so for small volume you know it's

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,480
it's not a bad way to do it anyway but

00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,520
it was the partnerships with those

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,040
companies that the

00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,200
the folks at mega were able to establish

00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,280
that have led us you know

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,280
to make a made in germany uh retro

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,240
computer in 2021.

00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,400
fantastic and uh james cameron asked

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,240
about the cost of the acrylic proto case

00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,839
that you made

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,440
uh that was a lot cheaper martin do you

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:24,000
remember i think it's the order of

00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,880
50 euros a piece or something something

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,560
like it's

00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,480
yeah something don't quote the exact

00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,520
figure but it's something like that

00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,319
yeah okay so the

00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,599
commodore 64 obviously has a a very big

00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:38,079
fan base and many

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:40,160
people that are obsessed with it so

00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,240
there has been a lot of work to

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,480
retrospectively document it but are

00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,960
there particular sources of information

00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,000
or resources that you found useful when

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,359
you're looking at things like the

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,560
commodore mouse interface and

00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:56,640
understanding how that works

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,000
um so michael style pagetable.com

00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,480
has a great blog where he kind of goes

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,400
through a whole lot of you know picking

00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,040
aspects of the commodore 64 apart in my

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,880
new detail um he's always a good read

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:08,560
um and some of it was just looking at

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,599
the the original commodore 64

00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,640
documentation

00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,720
is actually remarkably thorough

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,960
and it's actually it's a an approach

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,720
we've tried to take with the mega 65

00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,319
documentation our chipset guide is now

00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,520
500 pages or something long

00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:25,119
uh alone and it's not finished and so

00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,720
that level of detail we had all the

00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,280
timing diagrams everything of how it

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,119
worked

00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,480
and so we were able to you know to hack

00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,440
around with arduinos and things and

00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,520
actually make

00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,720
a replica mouse and make a replica mouse

00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,680
controller and show that we could

00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,880
actually

00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,240
uh do all of that that's fantastic well

00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,480
we're pretty much out of time but i have

00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,160
one final question for you which is is

00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,680
there anything else you want to achieve

00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,760
with this project or are you done at

00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,440
this point where is it going now

00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,599
tune into my talk tomorrow about digital

00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,480
sovereignty um and also the

00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,599
uh the megaphone which is kind of linked

00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,319
to that i'm not sure whether we can get

00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:58,079
the

00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,400
image up if i brought plow through to

00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,680
the end here somewhere

00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,760
um we were

00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,280
overly optimistic we've got a great

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,800
solitaire port by the way this actually

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,920
looks fantastic

00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,480
and the super responsive uh user guide

00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,240
and where's the it's going to take me so

00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,520
long to get to the slides

00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,000
oh here we are second board for the

00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:23,040
megaphone so we're making

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,119
a pure 8-bit smartphone

00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,400
that's secure and fully sovereign oh

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,640
that's amazing more about that

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,160
in the in the talk tomorrow yes okay

00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,760

interested in following up this project

00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:50,079
have a look at mega 65

00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,640
and i believe you have a discord and

00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,200
other

00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,480
resources a little navbar at the top uh

00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,599
you'll find the discord link will be

00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,599
there for a little while

00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,640
straight after the talk perfect thank
