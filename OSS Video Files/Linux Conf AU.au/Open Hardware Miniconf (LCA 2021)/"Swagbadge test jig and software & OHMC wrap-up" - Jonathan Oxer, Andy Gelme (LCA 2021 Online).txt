Is there anything more disappointing than getting a new gizmo and plugging it in only to discover it doesn’t work? We really didn’t want you to feel that way, so we tested components individually and again once each completed badge was assembled.

Learn how we went about testing hundreds of badges in a time-effective manner, and hear a tale of failures found and quirks uncovered, and what we did to recover.

We’ll also give a wrapup for OHMC2021, the future for Swagbadge, our vision for Dagbadge and what we have in mind for the wider community.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

[Music]

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,720
welcome back for our last session of the

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,560
open hardware mini conference uh

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,359
ironically many while many of you have

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,359
been asking

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,039
when our much promised firmware update

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,680
is coming the reason that we haven't

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,039
done it yet

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,040
is because we are testing it

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,680
because we don't want to fail and risk

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,800
potentially breaking all of your badges

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,239
so um the people who've been with the

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,399
open hardware team the longest

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,239
john oxer and andy gilmer are here to

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,719
give you the final session for today

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,960
about

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,480
testing the swag badge looking at how we

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,840
made sure that what we gave you and

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,039
shipped out to you was going to be

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,320
functional

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,399
and then we'll be finishing off with a

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,079
few notes about what we see for uh

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,360
the open hardware mini conference into

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,239
the future and what we'd like to do with

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,520
the badge

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:04,079
so i will pass it over to our esteemed

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,079
hosts

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,320
great thanks nicola okay so

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,560
uh when i started putting together the

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,040
first couple of badges

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,840
i discovered a problem i assembled the

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,600
first 10

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,960
and discovered that three of them didn't

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,960
work for various reasons

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,400
one of the displays didn't work or there

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,840
was something wrong with it

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,240
and we had a very high failure rate and

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,920
basically the problem is that failure

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,600
rates compound

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
if you have a probability of a certain

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,560
thing failing and you have multiples of

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,720
them

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,880
then the probability of something

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,640
working is actually the inverse

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,240
so the probability of at least one of

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,200
your devices working

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,600
is one minus the probability of none of

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,960
the

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,759
the parts failing so

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,759
what i found was that the oled screens

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,520
and there are two displays on it

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,439
had a failure rate of somewhere around

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,280
eight points i think it was eight point

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,439
seven percent

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,399
uh yeah eight point seven percent so the

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,119
pass rate for the oleds was 91.3 percent

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,399
which is

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,480
terrible it's a really really low yield

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,000
so what happened was that i ended up

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,840
having to build a tester

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,200
for the parts before we actually

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,000
assembled the boards

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,520
and when you look at the 91.3 pass rate

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,599
we've got two of them

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,200
and then there were also some of the

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,640
lowlands that failed we had about a two

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,080
percent failure rate

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,599
when you multiply all those together you

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,640
get about an 81.7 percent pass rate

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,480
once you combine those parts and so

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,879
what we couldn't afford to do was

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,640
assemble hundreds and hundreds of badges

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,920
and then discover that 18.3 percent of

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,040
them had failed

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,319
that was no good so what i had to do was

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,360
pre-test every single oled and every

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,360
lowland before we assemble the badges

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,040
and then test the complete assembly

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,280
afterwards as well

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,080
and this is what my bench looked like

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,200
this is

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,879
failed oleds and unfortunately they

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,519
can't really be reworked because the

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,519
values seem to be in the controller chip

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,879
which is under a block of a pop a blob

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,640
of epoxy on the back

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,640
of the display so they're basically doa

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,680
and just nothing that can be done with

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,599
them so

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,440
these all end up getting bundled up and

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,280
going in the bin unfortunately

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,200
but at least i tested every single

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,040
display before we got to the point of

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,959
assembling the boards

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,159
and this is the result of testing

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,319
lowlands

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,879
so what we did was uh un bag

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,720
hundreds of lowlands plug them in and

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,480
flash micropython onto them

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,640
before anything else was connected and

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,959
any assembly was done

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,080
so that we knew that the lowland itself

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,239
was functional

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,599
at least in terms of its usb interface

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,720
and being able to put

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,000
code onto it so the

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,000
thing then is that once the whole badge

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,879
is assembled we also need to test it

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,640
as a complete assembly and the way you

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,200
normally connect to circuit boards for

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,000
tests

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,080
is using things called pogo pins these

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,040
are little spring-loaded test pins with

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,439
a point on the end

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,400
that make contact with the circuit board

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,560
and allow you to make test connections

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,799
pogo pins come in a variety of different

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,160
sizes and different

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,560
tip types depending on what you're

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,680
making contact with the ones i normally

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,520
use are the b1

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,040
q2 and lm3 and the lm3 in particular is

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,400
very useful because it allows you to

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,080
make contact

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,040
with circular um plated through holes on

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,400
a board

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,400
and it makes very good electrical

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,479
connection because of the little

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,880
ridges the little sharp ridges that run

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:44,479
down the side now these are normally

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,320
used with a custom

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,560
made test jig which is used in the

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,800
factory but there is a little trick that

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,160
i used for this particular project which

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,800
simplifies the process

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,759
of building a test jig now anytime that

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
you build

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,639
a project you typically will get a

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,840
number of bare pcbs that you

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,600
assemble yourself and so this is a trick

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,080
that i've used a number of times

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,120
which is to build a test jig using bare

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,759
pcbs without the normal parts fitted

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,639
and what you can see here are two of the

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,639
version one pcbs from the badge

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,320
and i bolted them together with 12

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,520
millimeter spacers

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,479
and then soldered pogo pins into

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,000
the test points on this particular on

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,560
the circuit board

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,840
and then i've also soldered a lollin 32

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,680
on it

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,360
now if you look at your batch you'll see

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,800
that it's got the sayo headers where you

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,720
plug things in

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,080
they are connected through to i o pins

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,199
on the lowland

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,160
so all of the points that we want to

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,240
test

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,759
are connected in some way back to the

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,919
microcontroller

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,039
and by building a structure like this it

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,000
keeps the

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,759
pins aligned very nicely because of the

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
space between the two boards

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,560
it provides very good lateral support

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,880
and they end up very accurately placed

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,319
so i also 3d printed some little guides

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,600
that clip into the side

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,560
in fact what i do is super glue them in

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,160
and if anybody is interested in the

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,039
designs for all of this i'm happy to

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,800
share it

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,080
and so what happens is that you place

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,160
the board

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,440
that you want to test so in this case a

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,919
badge

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,479
on top of the structure it's guided into

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,600
place

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,440
by those three d printed structures and

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,880
you push it down onto the pogo pins

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,199
which are spring-loaded

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,800
and they then make contact so once you

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,639
have the contact in place you can then

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,880
do electrical testing

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,840
with whatever your device under so your

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,840
device under test

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,520
in this case the badge can be tested by

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,919
the test jig

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,000
and here you can see a view from the

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,759
side so the little plastic structures

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,080
provide a depth guide so if you push the

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,599
the badge down until it sits on those

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,800
little flat edges

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,479
it depresses all of the pogo pins enough

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,319
to make good electrical connection

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:05,440
with the target board and so

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,759
in fact the if um av can make me full

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,840
screen i have one of them right here

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,599
so this is the tester that i used for

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,319
testing those 300

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,840
odd badges and you can see that there is

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,800
a little notch in the bottom of these

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,880
guides

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,199
so the way it works is that i just sit

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,919
the badge down into the bottom notches

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,680
push it down and then that is now

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,759
electrically connected

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,759
we then have a usb connection available

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,800
to the badge that we're going to test

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,840
and we have a usb

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,440
connection to the lowland on the test

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,840
device itself

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,039
now the way the test is conducted is

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,280
quite clever

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,880
and that is all done using some code

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,199
that andy wrote

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:50,319
so if we just go back to the slide so

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,720
this is what it looks like with the

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,080
board on the tester ready to have the

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,319
test executed

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,199
you can see the two usb cables coming

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,400
down there

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,560
because both the lowland on the shield

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,680
i'm sorry on the badge and the lowland

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,560
in the tester

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,039
are connected to a host computer and

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,759
that

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,520
is where andy's magic software comes in

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,919
so i'm going to hand over to him

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,039
to explain how he manages that side of

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,160
it

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,120
um that's so key for the move forward

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,960
just spacebar

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,639
just spacebar should do it great yeah

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,240
okay

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,039
okay so um normally with the mini comps

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,680
we

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,800
produce between 30 and 50 kits and we're

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,320
there on the day we have a

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,159
we get a lot of help from everyone

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,760
everyone previous alumni and so on to

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,519
help newcomers often build these

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,719
the workshop kits and if there's any

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,519
problems on the day we can sort of fix

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,200
them there

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,640
this year was obviously not like that we

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,680
were shipping um

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,560
not just 30 or 50 but nearly 300 kits or

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,480
complete

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,080
boards and they had to work we didn't

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,000
have to deal with um

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,959
uh oh we didn't want anyone to receive

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,800
something that's broken and it could

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,360
just be just one pin wrong could um

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,480
uh spoil the whole thing so so we had to

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,560
completely test every

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,480
every pin and every function button and

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,640
oled and so on on the board

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,399
and uh from john's experience with um

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,600
producing working with chinese factories

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,279
to assemble to um

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,720
have things fully assembled for um

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,120
commercial sale

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,240
and i've had sort of a a glancingly

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,600
similar experience

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,680
is we understood that um this whole

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,200
process of um of

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,800
testing the past and testing the whole

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,480
thing and then most importantly using

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,680
automated testing to foot to to a

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,720
complete test that's what we sort of

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,240
emulated

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,320
so as john mentioned we've got a

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,600
modified swag badge it does the the

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,080
board to test

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,680
and uh and then and then swag badges so

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,640
so we want to use the same software we

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,920
didn't want to have right

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,680
two different sorry two bits of it

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,519
firmware and also we didn't want to be

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,200
flashing um all the boards once we've

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,560
one we find one set of firmware

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,160
the test firmware and then another set

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,279
of firmware and then things could go

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,560
wrong there so if we if we

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,399
thought we could just all incorporate

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,080
this into the the firm we shipped

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,080
the testing process we're going to do

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,160
flash once we test it also gives the

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,200
software exercise and then once we know

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,959
the board is good

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
in the in the you know we pack it and

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,360
and send it no more no we don't touch it

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,240
again

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,440
uh the other thing we was able to use

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,360
this process for

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,680
was also the time we could put a unique

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,279
encryption key onto every every board

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,880
which we're not taking advantage of yet

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,480
but i mean it was also part of the

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,519
logistical process about uniquely

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,279
identifying a board

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,120
we knew who was going to and that also

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,640
means we've we've basically done the um

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,160
like a uh a cheap uh pgp

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,920
uh key sharing party you know we've

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,640
already shared shared the secrets with

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,440
you

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,360
okay so um so the next thing that we do

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,000
is we had a piece of host side python

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,040
that talked out both the serial ports um

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,880
and

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,640
and basically talked to a set of

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,640
functions on both of the the board that

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,079
was testing and the board under test

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,440
so if you look in the um if you if you

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,760
do look in the repository and under

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,200
scripts there's a file called tester.pie

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,680
that's the host side program that

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,360
basically oversee your port sends

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,800
commands basically to the python repo so

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,200
it basically waits for the machines to

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,480
boot

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,920
it looks at what's what's coming up from

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,120
the serial port and it basically

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,959
understands where

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,320
where the micropython the ico firmware

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,440
is in terms of buildings it's all right

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,880
it's now ready to go

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,480
let's test it's almost like as if we

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,560
were if we were typing

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,480
functions uh python functions on the on

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,680
the machine and these these functions do

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,360
things like basically

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,720
set all the pins to values set one pin

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,680
to value check the pins

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,839
write something to the other so

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,720
basically every aspect of the machine

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,240
can be set through these little

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,959
functions which is simply as if a person

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
was typing them

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,839
except we've automated the process and

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,959
the sort of things we test for is

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,200
basically all we say

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,959
set all the pins low are they all low

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,200
set them all high are they high

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,399
um set one pin and you want to make sure

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,440
that you didn't another pin didn't get

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,000
set you know you might say well it got

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,760
set did

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,720
did the neighbor get set so we're doing

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,440
all these um uh

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,480
cross testing thanks john it's so uh

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,480
what does one need

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,600
um and and so that's that's what that

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,640
that firm we did so it's fairly

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,959
extensive

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,000
um and that that and then and so all the

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,639
functions that actually on the

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,560
on the form on the uh swag badges is in

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,839
uh liberco test.hi

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,079
and that's that's all that's all there

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,839
so that was basically the software

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,279
process is there much more we can say

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,000
about that well one thing i just wanted

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,880
to add to that

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,079
is an issue of scale and that is

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,839
something that really hit us

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,240
andy mentioned earlier that we've gone

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,000
from producing 30 to 50 of something to

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,880
producing 300 of it

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,399
and numbers multiply out very rapidly so

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,480
the process of taking

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,639
a badge and putting it on a tester if

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,000
you imagine that it takes say one minute

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,720
to put it on plug in the usb cable run

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,399
the test process take it out put it

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,160
aside and be ready for the next one so

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,639
one minute to do that

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,920
when you have 300 to do all of a sudden

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,440
you're talking about

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,040
many many hours of work so it's not just

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,959
i'm going to sit here for 20 minutes and

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,760
test them it's i'm going to sit here for

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,519
a day

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,200
and test them because it takes a minute

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,279
per device so

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,040
everything scales up and anything you

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,600
can do to improve the efficiency of the

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,480
process

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,399
is a big win similarly for the whole the

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,399
whole assembly process um

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,320
you know it's one thing for for us to

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,279
have 30 kids or 50 kids all being built

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,639
at once at the auction

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,480
hmc in the mornings has happened for the

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,680
last 10 11 years it's a whole other

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,240
thing when all of a sudden we

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,720
have to build all about 300. that's

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,720
that's crazy the scales or flashing

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,880
micro python onto each of the lowlands

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,680
which takes around 52 seconds

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,120
and there's five hours gone yep yeah

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,240
these numbers will burn into our brains

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,600
yes

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,560
all right so get to the next thing oh

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,680
that keyboard

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,440
sorry so many keyboards cool

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,040
so um as we come to come to the

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,360
conclusion today something we wanted to

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,399
just

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,000
briefly mention was um uh what what what

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,920
what happens from here so we've um

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,200
as the hmc's been running for many years

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
it was originally the arduino mini

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,519
conference and

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,040
um hopefully there's been many many

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,600
projects and and a lot of

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,240
everyone's in a lot of value these um i

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,399
was thinking

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,360
what comes what comes next and so it's

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,800
always been a challenge for us to

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,279
basically have projects that cater for

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,000
both newcomers and also the people who

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,680
um amazingly come back year after year

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,680
we really enjoy their company

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,800
and so choices of the projects the the

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,880
activities and the content

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,360
was always quite challenging so it'd be

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,040
good to get some feedback on that

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,720
and also we realize there's other people

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,480
um like alice at the distiller who's

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,000
also putting lots of effort over the

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,519
years who also

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,160
have an interest in providing workshops

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,079
and um how can we work together to um

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,079
uh you know create better better open

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,839
hardware experiences in subsequent years

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,040
um we we attempt each year to um

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,360
address a broader audience more

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,839
diversity uh internally our own team um

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,120
we've benefited greatly this year and i

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,839
said last year from uh

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,040
nicholas involvement wow what a um

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,079
powerhouse nicholas been

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:37,199
um even just today um so

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,079
uh and this year because um badges were

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,920
effectively going to

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,199
all registrants so we didn't have to

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,320
think as much about the diversity of the

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,639
attendees

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,440
but it's still in their minds um and

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,920
then uh

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,720
another question comes like um many

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,120
person months

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,480
uh go into what is effectively a one day

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,079
event for most people

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,079
and uh for us um we were in melbourne

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,600
uh we were locked down and then yeah to

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,279
have been given a project for us to work

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,440
on kept us you know

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,800
it was a fantastic opportunity but it's

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,560
a lot of effort one day

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,639
and so what we're trying to do is um

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,600
make sure that these projects have um

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,959
longer term objectives and um and and

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,399
good consequences

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,240
and so one thing is like well what if

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,279
what we're doing for this

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,959
for today and everyone's been

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,959
participating in is um

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,560
uh really a trial run for maybe another

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,240
conference badge so um

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,240
be interesting to see what it's like

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,279
that eventuates something to be paper

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,279
and uh

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,120
and uh firmware completed before the the

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,519
date the due date

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,959
so um have you got other things wrong uh

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,240
no i was just going to quickly answer a

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,440
couple of questions

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,040
on the chat so daryl asked does the

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,959
testing stop after the first test

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,639
failure or does it continue in the case

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,120
that the issue may be fixable

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,720
so what it does is run all of the tests

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,199
and then gives you a pass fail at the

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,839
end

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,079
but it also tells you what test failed

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,440
it is verbose in terms of its output so

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,279
you can see for example

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,880
if a particular io pin had a short

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,279
circuit to something else you would be

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,759
able to pick up what the fault is

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,279
in the output of the test and there was

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,240
also a question i think it was martin

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,040
asked

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,839
how many did we have to rework uh not

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,399
very many

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,759
18 things yeah i reworked a couple at

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,880
the start

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,759
but then once i started uh doing the

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,040
pre-testing of

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,600
all of the modules our yield rate went

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,800
way up

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,320
so we only had a couple that failed

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,160
after the point where the badge had been

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,839
fully assembled yeah

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,920
so that was definitely worthwhile doing

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,240
the pre-testing yeah frankly it was a

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,320
fairly simple board as things go

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,000
the people who did the assembly uh john

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,519
and andrew are very meticulous and

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,920
experienced

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,440
the solder masks were great so in this

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,880
case the chances for failure were

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,040
actually reasonably low

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,959
even so we still have to test everything

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,720
yeah there was a question from david

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,560
david thornley you said did you plan for

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,800
the test jig in the initial pcb design

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,639
or cleverly repurposed the pcb

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,240
and it was a matter of repurposing the

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,399
pcb

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,000
i've and this is a trick that i've done

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,400
a number of times before i've built

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,039
many many test jeeps like uh i don't

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,679
know like 40 or 50 different test jigs

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,360
and building sometimes what i'll do is

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,160
design a custom pcb which is

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,079
specifically

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,000
for the test jig in fact i've got like a

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,959
dozen custom test jigs just up here on

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,559
the shelf

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,439
but this particular trick of reusing the

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,799
the pcb from the project as a way of

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,960
making the test jeep

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,160
is very useful and that's a good trick

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,360
so that was one of the reasons i wanted

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,919
to show it today

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,520
is give other people ideas of how to

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,120
build your own test jigs

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,720
without necessarily going to the trouble

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,679
of building something custom

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,679
you can use spare bare pcbs with some 3d

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,840
printed brackets and some pogo fins

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,840
and make yourself a test jig

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,480
great i think we are pretty much at the

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,400
end of the day

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,400
one more slide one more slide yes

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,240
so um we just want to say thanks so very

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,679
very very very much

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,760
um particularly to andrea nielsen

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,520
andrew is one of those people who does

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,799
incredible things behind the scenes

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,799
if you have been along to an open

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,000
hardware mini conf the last couple of

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,960
years you have seen

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,360
his amazing work his mechanical design

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,400
and

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,080
um there and of course uh john who was

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,960
here earlier today who did

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,080
a lot of the work um we have we have to

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,160
thank astra for

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,840
being moral support for late night

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,880
coding sessions

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,280
and of course andy and nicola and uh

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,360
there is also john

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,320
john man like you know can you not see

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,919
the gear that's here

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,600
here's the reason that you know all the

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,960
things even got made because he's got a

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,840
little pick and place machine and all

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,919
the gadgets

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,240
john is a legend hardly but thank you

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,080
and there are many other people who

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,960
contributed as well this has been a

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,160
multi-month

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,640
process with many people uh helping out

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,760
in

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,919
our in our slack and providing feedback

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,080
and helping with software and

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,240
and input into the design along the way

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,600
also thanks to the lca organizers

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,039
and the av team who have been amazing

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,000
so ah yes hey thank you i think chris

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,679
and luke i think it is

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,200
just so pay no attention to the man

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,000
behind the curtain

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,520
it's uh trying to organize an event like

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,799
this when you don't have a back channel

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,240
that involves just

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,480
walking up to people and asking

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,280
questions

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,000
yes thanks guys really appreciate it uh

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,640
is

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,080
it makes it so much harder so they've

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,000
done a fantastic job of

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,600
working behind the scenes to make what

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,360
you see possible

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,880
so thank you very much for being part of

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,679
the open hardware mini conference this

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,400
year

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,200
and there is going to be a breakout room

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,080
in

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,039
uh in venulis on the left hand side

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,000
there is a menu

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,280
for the open hardware mini conf i think

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,440
that is going to be running

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,120
for the duration of the conference and

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,520
that will be a place for us to jump on

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,919
we can do video or audio or text chat

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,679
and we can help you with whatever you

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,880
need to do with setting up your badge

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,240
so anything else particularly if you're

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,039
stuck like if you cut you can't get off

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,159
square one

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,880
um let's organize a like a a screen

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,320
share or something

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,440
to really get you get you going we don't

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,640
when you're stuck with a you know

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,400
getting nowhere

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,200
get get in touch and if those people

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,240
have got ideas or want to put um

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,240
pull requests and things like that

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,440
please let them and also if you

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,440
i've noticed some questions like some

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,559
great ideas like um how can you

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,000
like uh control pixels or um turn the

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,840
leds on over mqt

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,200
um oh it's been uh so many i've written

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,000
them all down but they keep all those

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,000
ideas coming

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,120
yeah thanks and the software release

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,120
it'll be there

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,400
now but i will i want to say one more
