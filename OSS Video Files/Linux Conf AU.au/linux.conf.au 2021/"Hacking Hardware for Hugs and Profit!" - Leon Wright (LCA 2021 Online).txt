Title: "Hacking Hardware for Hugs and Profit!" - Leon Wright (LCA 2021 Online)
Publication date: 2021-01-30

https://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/108/

Late one evening at LCA2017, Leon found himself in his room and exhausted from the day's social interactions. Earlier he'd been bouncing some ideas around for something he could hack into his badge. Armed with a ESP8266, a bag of electronics, and vague understanding of C++; The 'Hug Detecting' badge was born!

Through this journey you will learn about the challenges faced when building adhoc hardware into a conference badge, literally load testing, Twitter shadow bans, and much much more. So hang around for a glance into how a whimsical project turned into a novel way of managing and overcoming social anxiety.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,560
welcome back to the open hardware mini

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,359
conf

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,760
next up nicholas are in the background

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,279
next up is the man i wish i could be

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,920
leon on this side this side of me

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,359
uh leon is also a regular at the open

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,680
hardware mini conf

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,360
and many of you will have seen the a

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,880
previous version of this project at a

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,200
previous lca

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,360
so leon is going to be talking about

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,040
hardware hacking for hugs and profit

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,960
he's the the man that i wish we could

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,920
hug in person but we can't this year so

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,640
leon

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,160
please tell us about your project thank

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,440
you very much

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,480
so as uh john introduced and thank you

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,280
um i'm leon wright devops engineer at

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,399
pet circle

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,039
we're hiring um

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,039
and uh

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,600
let me see i'm i've got a few interests

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,760
but a lot of it

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,600
relating to open hardware in particular

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,840
home automation

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,119
electronics and i really love bridging

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,759
the digital and physical worlds

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,200
and not only that bringing a bit of

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,119
whimsy into a world

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,880
that can be quite challenging and

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:31,680
well i do love to hug people and

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,680
although this is about all i can do

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,320
right now

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,720
so i wish i could hug you all but for

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,720
today

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,439
um

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,439
they'll be virtual

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,759
so let me tell you a bit about this

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,720
project and its journey

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,720
but first you might be thinking why

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,920
it was late tuesday night lca

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,719
2017 hobart it was

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,079
in the probably some of the best dorm

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,720
accommodation i've stayed in

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,879
today and i was sitting alone by myself

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,560
because at the time i was recovering

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,120
from ptsd

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,080
which i mostly experienced as acute

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,040
anxiety

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,959
which led to a bit of shyness and quite

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,520
a lot of sensory overload

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,959
but i desperately wanted to talk to all

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,040
the really cool people at the conference

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,640
about open hardware

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,599
now once i was in conversations i was

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,800
you know mostly fine but even to this

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,800
day

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,120
i still kind of find it hard to start

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,319
conversations

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,599
i had a bunch of gear and for the life

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,840
of me

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:51,840
i can't recall but i had a bright idea

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:56,480
that idea being make my badge

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,480
tell the internet i got a hug

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,400
now my first attempt involved shoving an

00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,959
esp8266

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,440
through the holder stabbing a bunch of

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,560
holes

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,000
in my fingers in the process um

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,760
they mostly recovered

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,560
and a sharp ir range sensor

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,239
now at the time that ir range center was

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,280
beyond my capabilities i

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,760
couldn't figure it out i did however

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,400
attend

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,519
alistair da silver's automate your home

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,959
with mqtt

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,840
tutorial which came with a

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,840
whole bunch of goodies

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,000
now quick tangent when i was writing the

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,040
initial code

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,319
i learned whilst hugging a pillow

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,159
in my dorm at 1am because waking up a

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,720
delegate for a hug seemed like a bad

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,319
idea

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,400
at best and probably a code of conduct

00:03:52,319 --> 00:04:00,159
violation at worst hugging

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,480
becomes quite intimate extremely fast

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,959
like between 700 and a thousand

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,280
milliseconds

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,120
so my lazy first attempt with a

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,480
five-second timeout

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,840
required more thought

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,759
anyway after visiting lt

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,880
at the front desk who seemed quite

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,840
perplexed

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,960
at my request for an extra badge holder

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,199
i wired up a

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,840
binary ir switch and a couple of free

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,680
pixels from free

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,560
and version one was born but it kind of

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,520
lost its state every time i got a hug

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,960
so after bumping into angus gratin from

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,280
expressive

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,720
he was intrigued so i brought up my

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,160
github repo

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,160
on my phone and showed him

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,800
can you see the hug the hug

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,800
i talk a lot about hugs can you see the

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,080
bug

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,720
i couldn't after a bit of a skim angus

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,360
noted

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,520
i tripped up on a trap for young players

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,880
turns out my last minute code for my

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,800
pretty lights

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,800
was trying to iterate past the end of an

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
array

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,720
and that corrupts your memory

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,520
a one character changed later and it was

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,639
fixed

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,639
hugs could continue

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,919
so i flashed that fix to the badge

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,280
during the next talk

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,800
and whilst it was an extremely

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,919
unreliable

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,000
concept it generated

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,840
interactions with an ease i didn't even

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,120
think was possible

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,639
not only that the energy and the people

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:53,120
i encountered was overwhelming

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:56,160
in the best kind of way

00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:00,400
sydney lca 2018 rolled around this time

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,039
hardware reliability was supplant

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,600
expressive had recently released esp32

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,160
and

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,880
i really wanted to play around with it

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,639
so i had

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,680
a bunch of those and had purchased a

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,880
bunch of vl

00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:16,720
6180 x timer flight sensors

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,639
and the first iteration of my hug

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,039
algorithm came to fruition

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,680
along with that the esp32 dev boards

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,360
have

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,960
often have charge controllers which

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,319
meant i could lose the uh

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,800
usb power bank and cable in my pocket

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:38,080
and carry a battery

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,319
unfortunately it worked a little bit too

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,319
well

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,919
fortunately though it wasn't a joyless

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,440
person

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,680
rather an upset twitter algorithm

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,440
my twitter account did recover later

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,680
that day

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,240
after actually tweeting something other

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,240
than hugs

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,440
now post conference i'd paid for a

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,000
ticket to brain candy live and sprung

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,560
for the

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,400
extra meet and greet package so i got to

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,840
meet adam savage and michael thesource

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,919
stevens after the show

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,360
which was just an utterly incredible

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,080
experience

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,360
not only that adam was extremely

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,880
interested in my batch

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,560
and he asked so many questions that i

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,560
kind of felt guilty for holding up the

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,599
line a bit

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,520
and yes i did get a hug from both of

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,639
them

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:33,039
tweet sauce first and then

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,039
adam savage which was just epic

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,599
now lca 2019 at christchurch

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,880
packing to create this badge was getting

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,240
serious

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,120
i'm still kind of surprised there

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,479
weren't more questions to ask by

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,080
security about the amount of lipo cells

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,280
in my carry-on for an international

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,479
flight

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,840
i did check i was under the

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,840
max allowed just

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,800
construction was also getting pretty

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,960
serious as well i'd uh

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,280
built myself a little extraction fan and

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,840
brought a decent soldering iron

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,840
well i've got a better one now

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,240
and with not much i wanted to change on

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
the hardware front

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,599
i wanted to address the infrastructure

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,400
behind the badge

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,080
so with a good amount of aws devops

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,039
under my belt

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,159
what better opportunity than to over

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:35,599
engineer the bejesus out of this thing

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,839
so behind the badge sat

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,800
an ecs cluster with three docker

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,839
containers

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,440
mqtt for message transport the actual

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,640
hug bot

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,240
and a badge heartbeat service which was

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,240
actually suggested during that

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,640
conference by another delegate

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,000
because i kept looking down to see if it

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,320
was actually working

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,519
and uh and then i'd hug someone and it

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,040
wouldn't go off and

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,640
he was like why don't you add a

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,920
heartbeat so you know your whole stacked

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,720
working i'm like

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,720
wow that's a fantastic idea and uh

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,560
implemented in the in

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,279
about 10 minutes at the next talk

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,000
it also had a proper hug domain and

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,440
let's encrypt

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,600
ssl certificates and i managed to add

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:27,600
quality checking to my hotel room

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,399
which successfully prevented my account

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,959
uh from being shadow banned and for the

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,320
shy

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,160
huggers amongst us i know who you are

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,600
it allowed them to game things to get a

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,080
better score

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,120
there was a quite frequently they'd look

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,240
at twitter and go

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,880
hmm i'm not happy with that can i hug

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,640
you again

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,640
and i'm like of course

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,839
unfortunately i wasn't very organized

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,320
before the conference

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,880
and none of the senses i ordered and i

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,160
ordered

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,160
from about seven ebay stores

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,560
um arrived so i had a lot of trouble

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,800
with

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,560
broken solder pads because i rescued a

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,440
couple of spare sensors from

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,440
previous badges

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,760
but it did last the entire conference

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:21,200
until just after my lightning talk at

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,240
2019 where a final exuberant hug from

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,600
opal

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,600
proved to be its undoing

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,279
lca 2020 on the gold coast i didn't

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,680
quite get my badge

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,079
built as quickly as i would have hoped

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,720
between procrastinating my games minicom

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,279
talk

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,120
by redoing the entire devops for the

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:44,560
badge

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,160
and then actually finishing the talk

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,480
it meant i had to leave quite a mess

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,200
uh and i was staying in accommodation

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,800
that was to be cleaned in my absence

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,800
i thought it best to leave a note

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,040
yeah i can't see anything too dangerous

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,000
there i left all the batteries unplugged

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,920
that's usually a good idea

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,760
but maybe i can't save it the same for

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:15,120
the badge it's a bit of a mess back

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:17,600
there too

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,839
now it didn't take a lot of photos at uh

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,839
lca 20

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:27,040
last lca but all my sensors

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,640
for lca 2019 did eventually arrive

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,360
i still have enough for like eight

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,360
conferences

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,720
i also changed up the visual feedback

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,360
the heart on the previous badge was cool

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,440
and all

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,040
but it didn't give people immediate

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,880
feedback

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,959
they'd sort of like give me a hug and

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,880
look at the heart and then try to extend

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:50,000
make it bigger and you know by that

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,560
stage the hug was counted

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,839
now i was wondering if the lipo was

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,279
going to be enough for this little

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,279
little strip of uh leds and

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,200
you know after the first hug and their

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,279
entire head glowed

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,760
um i knew that i was on to a good

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,760
concept

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,040
so beyond stabbing my fingers many times

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,040
what other problems have i had

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,880
soldering breadboard wires through

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,639
badges works great

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,320
until you get a set that don't seem to

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,399
take solder because they're

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,200
made out of some crappy metal and you

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,600
don't have any flux on you

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,720
people trying to fake a hug although i

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,279
did add

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,279
um invalid hug detection code to my

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,839
algorithm

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:40,800
um building subject protecting

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,120
detecting hugs needs to be robust

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,079
people will try to get a high score by

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,959
increasing

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,959
the currently unmeasured squeeze factor

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,920
badges don't really make great circuit

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,079
boards

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,079
unless they're actually circuit boards

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,720
uh you can carry 150 watts of

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,360
spare batteries on an international

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,959
flight

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,959
which is quite a few lipo cells

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,959
and fortunately no major fires

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,680
and well this leads me to maybe a bit

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,959
more of a whimsical front

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,720
more continuation of the whimsical front

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,000
really

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,680
i've bought things like blower fans

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,839
built battery packs

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,839
made noise boxes

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,199
just so i could chase my friends around

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,240
in a t-rex suit

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:46,160
that made maintained optimal comical

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,160
floppiness for up to 14 hours

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,959
now to the less whimsical

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,079
i've built sensors around my office uh

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,079
for presence detection

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,720
uh iot control for my formal workplace's

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,360
gate

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,560
because i was sick of calling people to

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,079
let me in

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,000
and by the time i left pretty much

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,920
everyone was using it

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,440
it was still pretty much in that taped

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,440
up state on the windowsill

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,240
no motion temperature sensors and mood

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,839
lighting for my

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,760
actually that's probably mostly

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,959
whimsical

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:28,399
um buying a lot of off-the-shelf

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,639
uh mirabella genio lights and

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,079
flashing them with tasmoto so i could

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,440
have control over my

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,440
own devices in my own house

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,040
building protopy prototype sensor boards

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,360
for my house

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:46,399
to replace the old security system which

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,399
hadn't worked in years

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,079
and even contributing to tasmoto to fix

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,079
a broken driver

00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,240
and with now i i've lost count

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,839
of how many devices i've got connected

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,399
to my iot network

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,399
it's a lot

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,199
and even building my own custom circuit

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,320
boards

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,120
um and that pretty much worked first

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,920
time

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,079
uh on my lap bench at least i did get

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,120
some connectors around the wrong way

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,120
uh and the uh the voltage

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,959
in my lab was different to the voltage

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,320
in that that board's little

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,199
um to the left and i took the hours to

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,480
figure out why

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:35,519
that wasn't working but i got there

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,680
and my current project is to add a pid

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,680
controller to my coffee machine and

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,320
connect it to my home automation

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,759
because it doesn't quite keep stable

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,079
enough coffee uh

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,079
coffee stable enough temperature to get

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,920
optimum coffee extraction

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,279
and i kind of want to pre-warm it before

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,320
i leave my desk which is

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:58,480
actually in my little

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,480
office in a shed in my backyard

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,480
now at the beginning in the beginning

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,920
this talk i mentioned not being able to

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,000
integrate with a sensor

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,279
and pictured was up until the last

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,079
couple of years the

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,759
pretty much the extent of my gear a

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,880
soldering iron that i've had for nearly

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,000
20 years

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,519
and a dmm made in the late 70s

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,199
my dad bought me when i was a kid to now

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,639
contributing to open source compiling my

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,680
own

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,880
custom excuse me uh custom turmoil

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,880
based firmware um and even

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,680
designing and getting my own circuit

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,639
boards manufactured

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,079
if socializing is a challenge for you

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,720
find something you're into

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,839
and lean into it there will be others

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:51,279
intrigued

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:53,199
interested or even into the same things

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,800
i also want to give a bit of a shout out

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:58,079
to opal for being my

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,600
top code contributor and metric wise

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,839
likely my top hugger angus grat for

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,000
taking the time to help me with my code

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,720
and

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,520
mark wolfe for helping me out when i

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,240
squared c

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:16,720
seemed just beyond me and all of you

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,120
your interests helped me reconnect with

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,160
a world that i'd long

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,039
felt disconnected from and last but not

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,799
least

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,039
john and andy and the rest of the open

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,319
hardware team forgive me a chance to

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,319
embellish in my whimsy

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:39,280
also always make sure

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,880
you get your wiring correct lest you

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:47,760
at 1am let the smoke out of your just

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:51,919
completed badge

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,640
so uh right uh that's that's uh

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,400
my talk on hacking hardware for hugs and

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,559
profit i hope you got something out of

00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,559
it

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,080
fantastic thanks leon

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,919
it's uh it's been really cool to see the

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,120
uh the development of this project over

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,960
the last few years

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,160
and to get to test it out a few times in

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,080
person

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,240
yeah i look forward to testing it out

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,679
again yeah

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,320
i have plans yeah um

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,880
there was a question from adam which is

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,960
uh

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,640
it's my question as well which is how is

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,670
this awesome and how do i become awesome

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,520
like you

00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:30,480
[Laughter]

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,840
be yourself you're already assassinated

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,960
exactly

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,880
um katie just asked can i have a hug

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,000
unfortunately that's not possible right

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,000
now

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,799
so um

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,200
so there was a question from jenny who

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,760
asked can i buy a hug detector or find

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,679
instructions on making one somewhere so

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,360
that is a great question if people want

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,360
to do this sort of thing themselves

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,640
where can they look for more information

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,840
uh so the

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:04,160
source code and the project is

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,120
on um my github page techman83

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,600
and it's called being hugged the

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,160
hardware design

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,320
is not really designed it's kind of just

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,200
me hacking it together at one o'clock in

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,200
the morning

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,000
yeah and trying not to set my dorm on

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,000
fire um

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,880
but i do have plans to build something a

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,880
bit more

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,799
in advance of future conferences so i

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,320
have some ideas

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,840
okay um we're just about out of time but

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,919
just quickly another question from

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,880
irving which was have you thought of

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,720
adding nfc

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,280
so two of these hug badges can tweet

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,679
each other's names

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,400
that's a fairly good idea um well no

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,919
very good idea

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,320
i had uh people have suggested like

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,400
recognition and stuff like that but um

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,120
there's obviously privacy uh

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,320
uh yes considerations but if i had

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,559
multiple hug badges

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,799
out in the wild they could talk to each

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,799
other

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,200
well hmm lca 2022 hmm

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,000
okay nfc might be a challenge because

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,720
you've got to be

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,200
like a bit more well aligned yeah but

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,960
maybe

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,960
maybe some bluetooth le or something

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,440
potential that's fantastic well thank

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,880
you very much leon

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,400
it's really cool to see the things that

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,600
you've been building and it's always

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,039
great to have you involved in the open

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,600
hardware mini conf

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,200
so for everybody else we are going to a

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,280
lunch break now

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,520
and we will be back after lunch with a

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,320
session about the hardware of the swag

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,919
badge

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,760
and then we have a couple of really

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,679
interesting projects to talk about

so hang around for the rest of the day

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,080
