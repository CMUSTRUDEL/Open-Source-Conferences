Authentication and IDM technologies are at the core of our system and network security. Whether it's logging into our personal laptop, or a corporate website, authentication is how we define roles and privileges to our users and ourselves. Opensource has a number of IDM offerings, as do corporate offerings. In this talk, we'll explore some of the history of these projects and what they offer, the direction that authentication and security is moving in. We'll also introduce Kanidm, a new opensource IDM system that has been created to adapt to these changes in IDM and security, and talk about what it's achieved in a short space of time, and what the future holds for it.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,400
hi everyone

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,400
it's so good to have you back here i

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,400
hope you had a chance to grab some lunch

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,119
or if you're in a time zone that doesn't

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,560
work so well for here maybe have a nap

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,720
next up we have william brown from seuss

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,160
and he's talking about a project that

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,800
has the cutest crab

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,840
holding a passport as an icon that i've

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,280
ever seen

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,719
thanks so much for being here william

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,480
great thank no thank you very much for

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,960
having me and give me that introduction

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,320
um and thanks everyone for coming along

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,920
to watch

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,559
i'm here to talk to you today about my

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,840
life amongst the authentications

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,239
uh so who am i my name is william brown

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,440
i'm a senior software engineer at souza

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,440
labs

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,199
my online nickname as you'll more often

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,600
see me is first year

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,119
i'm a member of the 389 directory server

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,519
team which is one of the major open

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,159
source

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,960
ldap servers and identity products i'm

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,720
based in

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,400
brisbane which is in queensland

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,960
australia which means the time zone i

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,200
mean is

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,560
utc plus 10. so the best way to get in

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,680
contact with me if you have any

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,920
questions at all

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,320
is email and that my email is w brown

00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,400
souza.de so

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,920
how i got involved in the 309 directory

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,720
server project is actually a little bit

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,720
of a story

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,000
and and a lot of people think that

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,759
identity management

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,439
uh developers are a bit of an endangered

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,840
species you know many people think that

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,079
idm is this you know solved problem

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,520
that you know we've already found all

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,280
the solutions just get your identity as

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,640
a service and move on but

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,560
i don't really think that's the case and

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,840
really i my passion for identity

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,520
management really started when i was a

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,119
student at the university of adelaide as

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,119
pictured here at the computer science

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,799
department when i was a student there

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,880
and i was never really allowed to learn

00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,079
a lot about programming or computers

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,280
until i was uh at the age of 17 when i

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,280
was kicked out of home by my

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,640
delightful family as i'll call them um

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,520
with my newfound freedom i i really

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,640
wanted to learn

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,080
a lot more about it and

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,680
you know what really fascinated me when

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,280
i became involved with the computer

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,200
science group was how do these computer

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,239
science lab machines work

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,920
you know they were all uh running linux

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,080
desktops and they just could

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,680
magically find your home directory and

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,200
you could log into all of them and do

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,080
all this stuff and i was so fascinated

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,400
by that so

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,400
actually i started a project and and i

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,280
tried to recreate the university's

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,200
lab machines at home and so i learned a

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,840
lot about nfs and auto mount

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,879
desktops networking how to do pxe boot

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,879
installs

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,000
but the only thing i could never really

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,440
figure out was

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,959
how the machines log in so one day i saw

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,879
the technician who was actually

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,200
responsible for installing the machines

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,000
in the lab and and i approached him

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,360
and i explained what my project was and

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,560
he helpfully sat me down

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,480
and he explained pam and ldap to me

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,720
ldap is a binary protocol very similar

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,720
to something like sql or http

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,760
that allows accessing a directory

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,080
database

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,000
it's similar to a phone directory and it

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,519
contains users and groups

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,720
it also has the ability to check for

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,319
passwords and accounts the data isn't

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,560
structured as a table like in something

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,319
like sql but much closer to json

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,840
where you have objects containing key

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,840
value pairs

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,959
the content of what key value pairs can

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,599
exist is defined by a schema

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,959
in addition these objects or entries can

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,879
be structured into a tree

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,680
allowing hierarchical organization and

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:43,120
searching capability

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,959
ldap was created in 1997 as a successor

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,400
to the directory access protocol

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,760
part of the x 500 standards x 500 was a

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,360
series of standards created by the

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,799
international telecom union

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,920
and it covers a whole bunch of different

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,159
topics like x 509 certificates

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,120
and this is why ldap dns looks so

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,200
similar to

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,560
elder uh sorry ldapdns looks so similar

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,799
to certificate dns

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,959
they were designed to be interchangeable

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,400
x509 was actually intended to be the

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,239
authentication mechanism

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,920
for which you would use to update an

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,000
x500 directory

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,160
but then when web browsers came along

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and uh became much more popular there

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,639
needed to be a simple method of

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,560
uh exchanging certificates between

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,160
machines and this is where x509 really

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,560
broke out and into its own

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,800
uh especially with ca stores as we know

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,880
them today

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,840
since then ldap has become the linga

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,000
franca of

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,199
identity where almost all software in

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,199
some staple form

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,040
has the ability to access ldap as an

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,040
authentication and identity source

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,240
the other major authentication protocol

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,560
of similar age

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,800
uh which was invented in the 1980s its

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,320
current incantation v5 was invented in

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,759
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,040
uh is kobros ssl and tls

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,759
uh weren't created until 1995. and back

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,120
in the 90s and early 2000s

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,199
cryptographic operations were still

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
expensive on cpus so people resisted

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,560
using tls on all connections unless it

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,840
was really needed

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,160
and so this led to kerbos being

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,080
developed as a way to authenticate over

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,759
a network where any person could be

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,360
intercepting and reading your traffic

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,560
so cobros allows you to authenticate

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,680
without ever actually sending your

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,720
password over the network

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,479
using a set of cryptographic operations

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,479
it was also then later made possible for

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,960
cobros to install network encryption

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,320
layers

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,240
very similar to um what what happens

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,919
today with tls

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,840
and this means that cobrows can act as a

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,120
root of trust for your enterprise

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,240
and and like all of these technologies

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,680
have really developed over time

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
and they all have very different

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,160
implementations and uses

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,759
and i eventually you know was my passion

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,120
in identity management eventually

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,320
led me to become part of the system

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,960
administration team at the university of

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,440
adelaide

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,199
and i got to see these really in action

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,440
pictured here was the production

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,720
sun directory server which was what we

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,319
were using at the time

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,639
and i was involved in the project to

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,000
migrate at the very tail end of it for

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,440
to migrate from the sun directory

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,360
service to the red hat directory servers

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,240
which we then started to use

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,360
um the other major authentication system

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,520
we had at the university was

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,039
windows or microsoft active directory

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,479
which is a combination of ldap and

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,800
cobras

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,479
our unix ldap servers through the red

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,880
hat directory servers

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,199
they provide identity to our websites

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,639
our macs our linux infrastructure

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,240
and you know these are the websites that

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,560
every student is logging into

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,800
for all of their coursework uh all the

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,880
time so they're very very busy systems

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,560
an active directory authenticated our

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,280
thousands of workstations that run

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,120
campus

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,960
and our wi-fi with radius and and you

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,400
know again universities are very busy

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,520
when it comes to wireless infrastructure

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,600
we generally had about

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,520
20 000 or more devices on the wi-fi at

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,199
any point in time

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,960
and to me it was so interesting to see

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,440
how important and

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,120
these technologies were you know these

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,080
systems were processing thousands of

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,240
operations per

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,880
second and they were so critical to the

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,280
university's ability to function

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,479
and that if active directory or ldap

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
ever stopped working the whole

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,199
university would have

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,800
essentially stopped they're so

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,039
fundamental and important

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,400
and this was really reflected in how

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,520
they're configured to be highly

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,599
available

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,960
and and you know even in disaster

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,199
recovery plans

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,720
uh after the core network ldap and after

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,520
active directory were the next services

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,960
to be restored

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,319
because everything else depends on them

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,080
but because we were using red hat

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,840
directory server and the upstream

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,199
project for that being the open source

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,639
389 directory server

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,240
i was able to contribute to the project

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,000
because it's open source

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,039
so my very first contribution as

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,440
pictured here uh in february of 2015

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,960
was to add some extra constr ability to

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,440
do some uniqueness constraints

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,039
in in one of the the plug-ins and one of

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,960
the developers noriko

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,639
she was super lovely and she helped me

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,479
out so much to get this code

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,160
actually in a mergeable state over over

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,319
the course of a couple of months

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,080
and you know after that experience of

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,400
being helped so much by

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,080
by her you know i decided to continue to

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,240
contribute and and i had started to

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,960
develop a bunch of python administration

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,879
tools

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,560
for three at nine as part of my work at

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,319
university of adelaide and so i began to

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,639
contribute some of these things when i

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,319
when i found the time

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,800
it was then when i met fraser tordell at

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,120
pycon au in 2015

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,639
uh and and we talked about some of this

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,160
work he encouraged me that i should

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,479
apply to work at red hat

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,520
and i was successful in this i moved to

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,879
brisbane and

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,479
and i've i worked at red hat for a

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,240
number of years and then i left red hat

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,519
and now i work at souza continuing my

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,200
work as part of the 389 team

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,440
and this was really exciting for me

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,120
because the 389 team who is

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,560
mostly pictured here not everyone was

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,399
was present in this photo

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,720
uh they're all lovely people and and

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,240
they all really care about their work

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,920
and doing the best possible for

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,839
customers and the identities of the

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,360
people that we store in this software

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,880
and you know beyond just holding each

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,480
other to a high standard of work you

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,120
know the kindness that this team has

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,360
showed

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,800
and their their patience is really

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,519
exceptional to me as a community and it

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,880
makes me very happy to be part of that

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,800
and being part of that team meant that i

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,800
got to see even more places where ldap

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,959
had ended up

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,399
as a nosql-like database with eventually

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,640
consistent replication

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,720
it could be found in so many places from

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,480
authentication at universities

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,959
to supermarkets and businesses around

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,279
the world to finance for storing account

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,959
details and authenticating transactions

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,640
and even telco for storing phone

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,680
subscriber dating and validating phone

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,640
handsets

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,080
and even more part of our work as a team

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
is to continually make this project

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
better

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,080
and the last five years i can really

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,000
assert that's happened with and many

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,680
aspects of the 389 project have

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,480
have really improved with inspiration

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,800
from so many places

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,640
and one of those places was in fact uh

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,839
russell keith mcgee's talk at pike on a

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,720
u and unfortunately i can't remember

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,560
what year but

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,399
uh he gave a really interesting talk on

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,399
on names and identities because

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,760
he has a problem with his name and that

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,519
is that a lot of software

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,959
doesn't like his name because it

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,560
contains hyphen

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,320
which generally is referred to as a

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,160
non-ascii character

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,440
and in fact a lot of problems happen

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,160
with names that have

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,600
non-ascii characters in a lot of

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,720
software systems

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,000
but there's a lot of other really

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,680
interesting things about names around

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,920
the world names of this really amazing

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,480
reflection of society and culture

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,079
for example we have names that are

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,440
include things like son daughter or

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,040
child of and in fact these names

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,079
depending on grammatical context

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,279
can even change we have some names that

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,440
have different order

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,200
we have the family name first and then

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,560
the given name second and in fact you

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,600
generally refer to the individual by

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,959
their family name

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,640
unless you're very close to them at

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,240
which point you're allowed to use the

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,959
the given name

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,360
some cultures have multiple family names

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,640
so

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,600
in in spain uh you have two family names

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,440
inherited

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,959
one from your one parent one from the

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
other parent and then

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,160
you get one of each of them and then

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,839
when you have a child you get to choose

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,880
which of your two family names you hand

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,720
on to your child

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,560
and i think it's a really like cool

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,959
cultural thing

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,640
there are some countries that even have

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,399
nicknames as a culturally preferred

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,399
element for example in thailand

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,320
where this individual you know while he

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,600
has a legal name they probably want to

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,279
be referred to as something else so we

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,200
need to be able to account for that

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,120
and of course then we have individuals

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,000
who don't have any family name at all

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,079
and they just

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,680
choose to have a given name and this is

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,399
no means an exhaustive list

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,160
of all the different uh interesting

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,079
aspects of names around the world

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,600
but russell gave this talk about names

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,079
and how systems couldn't accept them and

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,839
so

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,120
i decided to walk away from this and say

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,320
okay how does ldap

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,440
handle these names can we you know store

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,519
all of this data properly so

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,640
as mentioned ldap structures everything

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,519
with schema

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,160
and so i decided to look at the schema

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,360
for

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,240
uh a person in ldap and as we can see

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,600
here

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,279
there's an attribute called given name

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,800
which is the part of a person's name

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,560
that is not their surname

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,560
we have surname which is the name

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,639
strings for the family names of a person

00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,680
and we have the person object class

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,519
which is the basis

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,880
for an entry that represents a human

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,800
being and

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,320
the person object class is actually

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,200
inherited by a large number of other

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,360
object classes

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,320
all throughout active directory and ldap

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,720
standards and you know

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,240
fundamentally you know at some point in

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,240
the stack that's going to be

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,040
used but the problem is that it has this

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,320
requirement for must surname

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,120
and that's problematic because you know

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,160
um we don't know if the person doesn't

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,680
have a surname or not so

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,560
there's probably better ways that we can

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,480
represent names here

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,480
so in 389 we decided to update this

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,320
and so we actually wrote our own schema

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,120
and we updated this and we made it so

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,120
that we have now

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,480
a display name which is the preferred

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,680
name of a person

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,680
to be used when they want to be

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,680
displayed we have the legal name

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,360
which is their legal name as referred to

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,160
on a government identity

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,480
and then within the ns person type which

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,760
we now attempt to use by default in 389

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,959
as much as possible

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,040
um you must have a display name and you

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,399
may have a legal name of course you can

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,440
depending on business constraints you

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,160
could make that a must

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,360
but by default we don't request it and i

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,920
think this is a really good way of

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,480
actually

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,760
handling these names and it can actually

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,240
account for all of this all of the

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,720
fields i've just mentioned are all utf-8

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,160
and can do case insensitive searching

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,200
and they are case preserving as well

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,320
which is really good

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,120
so we can actually represent all of

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,360
these names but but this change actually

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,279
came against resistance

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,880
and that resistance came from someone

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,079
who was not a member of the identity

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,040
management community it was actually

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,480
someone who is

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,040
extremely uh senior and well-known

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,160
within

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,920
a a very major open source distribution

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,760
and this individual actually came into

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,040
our mailing list and said

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,560
their concern was where there are

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,240
affordances for front-end developers to

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,000
create usable interfaces on top of this

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,040
and i went what

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,560
what do you mean i said well how can i

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,399
sort by last name

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,839
we need to be able to you know identify

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,399
the last name i was like

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,959
but you can't do that here are the last

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,959
names or the family names

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,480
you know some of these for example

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,240
isabino osman

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,920
that name might change based on

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,600
grammatical context and

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,199
it's arguable whether the bin is part of

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,680
the last name or not given i think that

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,440
is the

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,800
i believe that's malaysian for of um

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
so is that part of last name or not what

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,880
about teller they don't have a last name

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,320
what about maria which of her two family

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,800
names should we sort by

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,440
like this whole concept was you know i

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,720
feel like

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,360
it was a uh not not possible to satisfy

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,040
but

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,880
this change almost actually never got

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,560
through because of this resistance

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,160
to to this and that was you know

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,800
thankfully it did pass and we did get it

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,120
in in

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,399
2018 but it was very demoralizing to see

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,839
this kind of resistance

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,199
coming from open source against this

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:49,680
kind of progressive change

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,680
so you know moving on um

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,360
a uh different area that i've

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,440
expressed interest in if you were

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,120
watching my talk last year about

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,800
multi-factor authentication is of course

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,480
multi-factor authentication

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,639
and so you know ldap today doesn't

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,800
support it so we want to support it

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,160
so we have the right way to do

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,079
multi-factor authentication which is

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,199
where you have a split password and

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,639
thotp field and given the password you

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,240
know you put out a password field given

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,120
the tsp put that in top field you can

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,839
check it

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,519
and as we as was discussed at more

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,680
length in the talk last year

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,000
the incorrect method of handling this is

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,880
to combine these two fields together

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,480
so and the reason for this is that it

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,079
just breaks password managers you know

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,360
you've got a dynamic element at the end

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,880
and a static element at the front most

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,160
password managers believe that it's a

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,000
single hole string and now there's a

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,959
dynamic element it can't actually save

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,040
store and autofill this and it also

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,519
confuses users because there's now

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,959
uh overlapping inputs within one field

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,560
so it can be confusing as to what is

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,720
actually required here

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,600
so this is the ui that we want to be

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,680
presented

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,279
and the ui that is often created can be

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,759
a reflection of the api

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,560
as we create it as developers and so as

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,240
an ldap server we want to offer an api

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,920
that is reflective of the user

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,920
interaction that we have here

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,320
on the left hand side of screen with the

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,480
separate fields

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,839
so if we wanted to add this to ldap we

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,360
we have a look at the authentication

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,600
mechanism to ldap now in ldap it's

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,000
called bind request

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,639
and we have two choices we have password

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,040
only

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,399
which is called simple and that uses

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,759
what is called an octet string or a

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,040
utf-8 string

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,399
or we have cecil which is the simple

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,440
authentication and

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,639
security layer so if we just did this

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,480
with the password field

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,639
the problem is that we're now recreating

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,000
that that poor ux on the right and

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,959
that's not going to encourage people to

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,920
do the right thing as

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,360
as developers if we use sasso however

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,040
the problem is that while it has simple

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,240
in its name it's anything but

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,720
um it's a very large and complicated

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,839
project

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,800
and very much inactive in a lot of ways

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,480
and so extending sassel to do totp would

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,079
be a difficult exercise

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,759
let alone getting everyone's clients

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,199
updated to also be able to do this as

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,000
well

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,240
so why not just extend the ldap protocol

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,600
why not add native totp support

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,919
into this authentication group so

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,839
the problem is that ldap has a defunct

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,720
ietf working group and two attempts to

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,400
revive it

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,160
as i'm aware of in the last five or six

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,160
years have both failed

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,559
and in fact there's really only one ldap

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,839
client library within open source

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,760
there's a few others here and there but

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,440
the majority of the time when your

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,120
open source system is talking to an ldap

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,880
server you're using

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,320
ldap which is owned by the openid

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,520
project

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,640
and the problem with the openldap

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,240
project is because they have a

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,559
monoculture over this library

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,240
we need to convince them to accept any

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,520
changes that we make

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,480
and the problem is that they have a

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,760
community which has a bit of a

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,039
reputation and this is reading

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,400
this is one of their males from their

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,679
mailing list and just to read an excerpt

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,440
it says

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,440
you will be charted mocked and

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,960
denigrated there is such a thing as a

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,559
stupid question

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,960
you will be publicly mocked and made

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,880
unwelcome this is entirely intentional

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,360
and by design

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,559
and this this not a community that i

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,320
want to work with

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,160
this is not a community that says we

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,400
would like to

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,600
grow and change and develop as people

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,960
that to make

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,799
things better for our users and so

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,679
wanting to contribute to the opened up

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,360
library to add something like tutp

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,520
let alone anything else that we may want

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,080
to do is suddenly becomes a much harder

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,080
proposition

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,320
and if we really look at the

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,160
technologies

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,400
in open source identity management we

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,000
can really start to see that things are

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,880
getting a little bit stagnant in some

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,960
ways

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,200
the four major open source identity

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,320
management projects really are

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,440
openld app from 1997 the 389 project

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,080
from 2005

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,679
free rpa which is a combination of uh

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,840
389 and kebros

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,760
and then samba 4 which is an open source

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,480
reimplementation of

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,360
microsoft's active directory standards

00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,280
now

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,480
the problem with with these open source

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,240
identity management

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,240
projects is that unfortunately because

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,720
one of the majority major projects

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,799
uh in openldap especially has that

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,559
reputation of being unwelcoming

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,080
you know people aren't exactly willing

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,080
to want to contribute and

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,000
realistically these apis are just hard

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,840
to use they're binary protocols

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,600
they're very gnarly the documentation is

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,280
often poor at best

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,600
even the tooling in the command lines

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,840
confuse me and i work on the stuff

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,360
like how does it feel to a new user you

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,200
know it must look like

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,559
you know they're climbing up an ice wall

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,919
that's vertical

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,840
and it's just people find ldap part two

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,559
is let alone kerberos most people

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,840
you know if if you say okay use kurbos

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,120
they'll their eyes will glaze over and

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,640
they'll run for the hills

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,240
um you know like most developers

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,240
look they will integrate with an ldap

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,840
api begrudgingly but they'll do it

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,679
but you never see someone saying yeah

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,000
let's implement native kerbros and gss

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,679
api

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,600
now stack that's a great idea no one

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,919
does it because it's just too hard

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,000
and really the world is moving away from

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,200
these things you know

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,200
people want http apis people want

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,640
introspectible systems they want to be

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,320
able to investigate these things they

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,039
want something that's clearer

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,000
simpler and much more human friendly and

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,679
and we aren't

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,520
really doing a good job of delivering

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,960
that today

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,120
but there's also a lot of parallel

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,559
changes that are going on in the world

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,159
some really interesting stuff has been

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,080
coming out in especially the web

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,640
oriented areas of identity with things

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,240
like oauth and open id in 2005

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,880
then we start to see identities of

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,559
service projects like g suite octa ortho

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,080
you know as we've heard from other

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,960
attendees you know the identity is a

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,159
service where you just

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,000
cloud vendor will just host all your

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,799
identities and everything happens

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,559
azure id was around earlier but azure

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,080
adsync really made it possible for

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,679
people to take their on-premise active

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,080
directory which is you know the backbone

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,240
of

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,120
corporate identity and put it into the

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,559
cloud

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,840
and then we even see these really cool

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,559
developments in the last couple of years

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,880
around

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,720
you know uh cryptographic authenticators

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,840
like windows hello web or then things

00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,880
like that you know all of this

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,080
advancement

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,000
is going on in in these areas

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,679
and they're becoming so popular due to

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,799
their ease of use in in

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,120
like not only cryptographic

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,600
authenticators but just their apis

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:13,440
these identity as a service projects and

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,039
they're really advancing the state of

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,159
what an identity management

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,280
system should be but it feels like this

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,200
gap between

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,400
all of these ldap and kerberos focused

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,880
projects

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,640
and the more modern http focused

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,080
projects this feels like there's a gap

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,640
between them and it's just

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,320
continually widening and you know as

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,240
much as we have made improvements in the

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,600
389 team and we've done a lot to make

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,840
the project better

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,280
it's just not enough to catch up with

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,520
what's going on on the other side of the

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,559
world

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,919
and so i was you know really

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,280
disappointed in this

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,720
you know this is really difficult for me

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,480
because i really care about identity

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,280
management i really care about what i do

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,840
and and you know to just feel like i was

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,039
you know

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,640
struggling in this you know i really

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,440
wanted to stop having to say no to

00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,440
things you know

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,520
i'm tired of saying no we don't have a

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,360
rest api no we don't have

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,720
totp you know i really wanted to start

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,880
being able to say yes

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,159
why can't we have these things why can't

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,440
we have an open source identity

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,679
management system that's as good as

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,200
your id or you know any of the others

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,799
but you can run it yourself like free

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,480
rpa or some before

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,919
you know they're supported all of these

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,400
nice http

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,080
apis first and foremost but also your

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,640
existing infrastructure integrations

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,679
to traditional and unix deployments you

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,840
know

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,000
could we break away from this ldap and

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,440
kerberos mindset that in a way was

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,240
limiting our thinking about what

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,760
identity management could be

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:41,840
so in september of 2018

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,840
i decided to start a new project

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,440
and this is where i started the cunning

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,840
dm project

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,039
county jam is a identity management

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,440
system

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,640
fully written in rust which aims to be

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,120
you know

00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,840
what i i believe and other some others

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,440
believe is

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,600
is the open source identity management

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,000
of of potentially the future

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,799
and there's a lot of lessons that as a

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,400
project we

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,480
have been able to take from the

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,400
successes and mistakes

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,919
of the existing open source and

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,799
proprietary idm

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,840
projects there's a lot of development

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,760
that still needs to occur

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,960
it's still a young project but it can do

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,320
a lot of things that you might expect

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,200
from a traditional identity management

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,120
system

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,799
for example we have unix system

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,600
integration we have pamin and switch

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,760
libraries

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,159
which were inspired by triple sd but it

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,960
fixes a lot of the the performance

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,679
and reliability issues that existed

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,280
there

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,039
and and these modules have even passed

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,640
uh security screening by the product

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,279
security teams at um

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,320
sousa as well it has radius integration

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,200
for your wi-fi

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,960
and your uh vpns so that you can

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,640
continue to authenticate

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,559
network infrastructure services through

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,400
something like honey it has a read on

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:57,360
the ldap gateway for

00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,000
application integrations that maybe you

00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,600
know

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,840
aren't going to speak something else

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,120
like maybe oauth or something like that

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,960
but we also have many parts that are

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,320
only found in newer identity management

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,640
systems like

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,440
you know we have a rest api first and we

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,880
want to add

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,600
skim in the future we have capability

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,120
for a lot of

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,039
really interesting security features

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,880
like password bad listing

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,720
and high quality password checking using

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,039
things like zxcvbn

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,880
we have an entry recycle bin so that you

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,039
know if you make a mistake you can undo

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,720
your changes and get things back you

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,679
know and it really just has like a

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,840
really simple

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,120
set of configurations and design details

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,640
and the protocols

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,919
uh just to make things a bit more

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,679
efficient and really learning from some

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,279
of the mistakes of say like 389 which

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,960
has a much bigger configuration

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,400
and there's much much more to come

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,159
there's some really cool stuff though

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,360
again where we've been inspired

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,760
and like one of these sources of

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,200
inspiration was jeremy stott's lca talk

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,600
last year

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,480
so we already have the capability to do

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,799
free ipa

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,840
like ssh public key distribution within

00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,760
your infrastructure

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,039
so you can upload your ssh public key

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,720
into honey

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,799
and then the unix client will then be

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,520
able to read that encase it

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,320
to authenticate you but in the future we

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,960
want to add

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,000
sshca support which will allow for

00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,679
ephemeral

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,360
or permission limited ssh

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,720
authentication which i think is a really

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,080
cool thing and you know this is the kind

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,720
of technology that we only see

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,880
in like uh other iam systems

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,120
we have a lot of really interesting tech

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,559
in terms of concurrent data structures

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,559
and

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,559
multi-threading and high performance

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,360
database technology

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,960
we even invented a transactional caging

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,960
system where we have a cache

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,240
that is multi-view concurrently

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,640
concurrently readable

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,520
and actually is acid compliant and can

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,880
be rolled back

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:50,480
during re uh read and write operations

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,000
and this fully transactional design of

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,159
the server was actually inspired by zfs

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,760
with this mentality that everything

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,320
should always be correct at

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,120
every stage of of the pipeline in the

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,799
process and

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,120
you know we even created data structures

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,799
to help allow us to do this

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,159
and just because of this you know it

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,760
means that there's very little blocking

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,600
within the server so our performance is

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,400
already very close to 3.9 directory

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,240
server

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,320
via the ldap gateway with very little

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,080
work on optimization

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,960
i believe on a four core machine with

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:24,400
eight gig of ram i was benching at

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,080
32 000 searches per second on a database

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,600
with 100 000 users

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,080
and 4 000 authentications per second

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,159
which is the kind of numbers that a

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,120
server would need to be able to sustain

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,919
authentication

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,799
for an entire university or other large

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,480
organization

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,000
so this bodes really well in terms of

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,960
the architecture that we've laid down

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,640
for the project to continue to grow

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,080
we're also the first identity management

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,520
system especially within open source we

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,440
actually have a query optimizer

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,120
which sounds like it shouldn't be you

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,320
know a thing but we do and

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,320
that actually helps a lot as well

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,600
devices are you know part of your

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,799
authentication and that's

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:08,159
like this idea and this mindset

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:10,080
that was in the project from day one um

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,240
and because multi-factor authentication

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,480
was planned from very early on

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,080
uh we knew that we needed to structure

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,880
certain things in certain ways and this

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,720
is why

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,200
we also created the webwork end library

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,840
for rust and that library today

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,720
already supports touch id windows hello

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:28,240
yup keys and a few others

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,760
and we've just actually finished

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,520
wrapping up some of the server side

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,039
components to do web authent and there's

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,240
just a little bit of polish in the cli

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,360
tools that needs to happen to make it a

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,080
little bit nicer but

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,399
web authent is now supported as a either

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,559
a sole authentication mechanism or as

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,120
with a multi-factor with passwords and

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,559
things like that

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,919
and we want to have things like you know

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,360
the ability to express proper like

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,679
security and account policies that say

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,919
yeah

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,440
this person needs a verified token like

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,919
something like touch id or this one can

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,159
be just

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,840
a yubikey things like that you know

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,600
really being able to embed

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,440
this kind of advanced uh policy

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,880
into these projects which we can't do

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,960
today

00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,399
and another extension of the devices as

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,679
part of authentication that i think is

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,279
really interesting is that

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,279
the way that our radius integration

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,720
actually works so

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,039
a lot of people when they hear radius

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,760
they you know that ms chatv2

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,559
is really the only supported um radius

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,640
protocol

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,840
for wi-fi devices and ms chatv2

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,320
necessitates

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,080
you storing password hashes as ntlm or

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,520
md4 which is known to be

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,720
broken cryptographically or plain text

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,039
so instead of storing your main account

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,440
password in one of these formats

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,399
so that we can do radius for you which

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,399
may expose your

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,000
account to some kind of compromise we

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,000
actually give your account a separate

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,919
radius password and what this means is

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,279
that uh

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,200
we can generate that password on the

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,480
server and when

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,480
you want to

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,039
use that you can retrieve it and we have

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,799
these ideas about automatic enrollment

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,000
of those profiles such as displaying qr

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,200
code so you can scan and it will

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,279
automatically join your phone to the

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,799
wi-fi and add all the radius details

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,080
it means that you can change the radius

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,559
password without breaking your main

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,600
account

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,039
you can change your main account

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,799
password without breaking your phone's

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,640
access to the wi-fi

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,159
and it also just limits damage in a

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,360
compromise that the compromise of the

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,200
radius account

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,960
does not compromise your main account

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,679
password and this really helps to bring

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,080
in this

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,000
device as a part of identity mentality

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,200
which is really cool that your

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,480
authentication to the network is

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,440
separate to your authentication from

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,320
anything else

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,720
and there's so much more to improve on

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,799
um

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,880
in how we authenticate using devices as

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,000
part of that

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,000
and there's a lot of other really

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,720
interesting design details in in the

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,399
project

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,960
especially with how we've done the unix

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,960
integration

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:53,600
so it's really common in a unix

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,279
system for the home directory to come

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,120
from something like an nfs or a samba

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:59,120
server and it might be exported from a

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,200
server with say like vol homes

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,559
username and then we mount using

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,080
username as the primary key

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:08,159
and then we mount that to our client

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:10,480
we'd say home w brown in this example

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,960
a common problem however is when people

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,799
go to change their username

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,840
because this is effectively the primary

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:21,200
key when we change that username

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,200
we have a a situation where the the

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,240
mount cannot be found so if i've changed

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,480
my name to

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,440
william jones and my username said w

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,960
jones

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,120
unless there was a process running on

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,559
the actual exported nfs server to update

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,559
w brown to w jones

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,159
this is not going to work and and this

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,840
is going to break and so often what this

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,360
leads to is a lot of um

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,360
sites will say no you can't change your

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,080
username or a username changes this

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,679
really big arduous complex policy thing

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,200
and there's all these different areas

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,320
and then once you do the username change

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,559
your account is just

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,320
broken for the rest of time and i don't

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,080
really think that's acceptable from an

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,360
identity management system

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,840
anyone should be able to change their

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,480
username at any time i'm not the name

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,279
police

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,360
change your name my job is to make it so

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,039
that works

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,440
so the way that we approach this in

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,559
cunning is slightly different

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,640
we uh make it so that your home

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,760
directory is actually based on the uuid

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,200
of your account

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,840
and a upcoming feature is that on

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,919
logins will automatically add a sim link

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,360
of slash home slash your username to the

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,960
uuid of

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,880
your home folder so this means that your

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,279
nfs server is now exporting all of the

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,799
home directories by uuid

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:34,080
and so what this means is that if you do

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,399
change your username

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,600
all we have to do is update that sim

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,000
link and

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,200
suddenly no more pain and in fact this

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,440
also encourages

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,720
developers to you know to really see

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,919
that um

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,600
the uu idea is how you should be uh

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,440
foreign king into something like carne

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,360
dm and

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,960
you know user name changes are something

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,159
any individual with incarnate dm can

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,720
initiate on their own

00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,159
at any point in time everyone has the

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,279
ability to change their own username

00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,399
with the constraint that it must be

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,559
unique but that's a

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,840
that's a different technical thing but

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,919
part of the reason okay so

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,679
but allowing people to change their

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,559
usernames is one of those things that

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,640
you know

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,679
seems like a detail that a lot of people

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,279
wouldn't put a lot of

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:16,799
energy and effort into but the reason

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,200
why we've done this

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,039
is you know as a project from very early

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,279
on we added something

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,399
and that is a statement about the ethics

00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,120
and rights

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,120
and and how we want to approach our work

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,200
and you know to read from it it says

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,039
carnegiem is a project that will store

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,760
process and present people's personal

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,679
data

00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,679
that means we have a responsibility to

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,200
respect the data of all people who could

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,320
be using our system

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,440
many who interact indirect indirectly or

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,000
do not have

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,919
choice in this platform an example of

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,440
that when i say don't have choice is

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,200
when you get a new job and you go to

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,919
that business you can't choose if

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,159
they're using

00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,039
active directory or 389 or something

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,919
else

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,320
you have to just deal with whatever they

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,159
have

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,519
and if that means that that whatever

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,200
they have doesn't want to let you change

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,919
your name well

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,480
that's not good enough you know and so

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,600
for me

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,840
i know that there's going to be a lot of

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,320
people in that situation and so our job

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,080
is to make sure that we write a project

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,320
that says no people can change their

00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,320
names and and by having this is

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,919
as a fundamental part of our project

00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,159
when this kind of thing comes up

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,080
where if we've made a mistake in how we

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,840
represent an individual

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,600
the onus and the responsibility is now

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,960
on us that we need to make tough

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,039
engineering decisions

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,120
to fix that problem and this is why the

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,200
project from very early on has had

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,480
a lot of capability and infrastructure

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,480
for in place

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,679
on upgrade migrations at almost every

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,519
level of the stack

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,799
so that if we do make this mistake

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,240
because i guarantee

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,440
i'm not perfect i'm going to make a

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,880
mistake somewhere we're going to need to

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,880
change something

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,320
but we have to be able to do it because

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,679
we need to make sure that we are

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,039
representing identities in the right way

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,760
and i think that's what's like super

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:59,679
cool about identity management you know

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,840
it's kind of everywhere and it affects

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,120
all of us you know

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,880
idm is something that we have to

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,679
interact with every day

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,240
and this is what makes ibm exciting you

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,320
know

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,679
every single one of us is a person our

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,760
identity is in

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,599
software all around the world you know

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,560
from our laptops to a website that we

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,119
log into to

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,159
you know order online books or our

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,679
workplaces

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,599
these all have identity management

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,159
systems they underpin

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,520
the like everything to do with modern

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,919
computer security

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,280
and just so much and it should be

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:32,560
accessible to all of us

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,919
you know if we are going to be

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,440
represented in this it should be

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,599
accessible

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,760
and that's why i'm i'm really you know

00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,320
excited to be working on this project

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,839
and and that's why it has so many uh

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,119
like interesting components in fact

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,240
cunningjam is a bit of an umbrella

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,119
project it has the main identity project

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,359
but it also has

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,200
five other sub projects and there have

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,919
been seven other major contributors

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,879
and uh since september 2019 when i open

00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,599
sourced it

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,640
uh there's been more than 340 commits to

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,960
the project

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,720
and there's also just been so many other

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,640
non-code contributions that have been

00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,800
just as valuable into the project and

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,000
and support and encouragement of

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,760
so many people um within it and and you

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,760
know some of these sub projects uh

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,440
are things like the web or thin server

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,119
side library for rust we've got a

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,040
web authentic soft token for automated

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,240
testing we have concurrent data

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,320
structures we have

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,160
compressed database indexes for high

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,880
speed set operations

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,480
um and now can't remember the last one i

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,760
think it's the ldap bindings for us

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,520
um and then we've got the khani project

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,880
but that's what's so interesting right

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,320
you know and this is again why i find

00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,359
idm exciting

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,079
it spans so many cool areas you know all

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,560
the way from

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,720
social and cultural you know aspects of

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,800
humanity and how people want to be

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,320
represented and how we as a society need

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,440
to continually learn and develop to

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,680
improve that

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,800
to human interaction and user experience

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,800
to make sure that people can

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,079
authenticate to their software securely

00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,320
to api design and high performance

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,359
multi-threaded concurrent systems and

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,079
databases

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,680
and and so much more like idm is such a

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,320
cool technology

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,240
and it's such an unsolved problem and

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,040
and so that's why i'm so passionate

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,880
about

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,440
what i work on and and continuing my

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,560
work with both cunning and 389

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,320
so i think i'm actually a little bit

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,640
early but i really want to thank you all

00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,280
for for coming and spending time

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,960
to uh listen to my presentation i'm

00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,359
sorry i'm a bit early my office is

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,599
actually

00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,960
really warm it says 31 on my temperature

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,240
meter that's why i'm i'm sweating a

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,400
little bit i can't turn on the fan it

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,440
makes too much noise

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,119
but thank you very much oh thank you

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:39,119
that was a fantastic talk

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,079
um i have to say that anyone that works

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,079
in enterprise

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,680
would have been nodding along with so

00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,920
many things that you've said because i

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,680
certainly was

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,280
yeah well that's that's one of those

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,520
things i think that well

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,520
even just more broadly i feel like um

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,040
having a different set of experiences is

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,720
so valuable for so many

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,400
different areas like even with identity

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,839
management a broad range of experiences

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,119
are needed for something like this my

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:08,960
background is in

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,160
uh online education i used to be part of

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,760
the online education team at uni

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,400
adelaide and then i went to the sysadmin

00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,760
team

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,240
and then that gave me a lot of insight

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,920
being a customer of the idm project and

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,839
then being a developer of it and then

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,440
you know you also you know i've had help

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,800
from someone who does statistics on on

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,640
this project and you know

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,400
people from web development backgrounds

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,720
and all these other stuff it's it's

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,720
it's so good to have broad you know

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,079
experiences to bring all those different

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,560
things in into work

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,520
and that's why again i find it so cool

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,000
like

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,920
yeah you know just just yeah yeah

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,200
question we do we do have time for

00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,240
questions and

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,880
we do have questions oh so

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,920
the first one i've got is from jenny

00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,200
she's asking

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,920
if candy has is able to handle

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,240
people that have more than one legal

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,240
name

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:03,920
oh that's a good one today it doesn't

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,119
but that's easy to do and if you open

00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,320
that issue on github

00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,000
that one's actually an easy fix so

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,040
if you don't open the issue on github i

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,440
will i'm going to write a note

00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,440
all right

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,560
i'm sure we've got these questions

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,520
written down so that's fine you don't

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,440
need to write it down

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,880
we'll give you them in chat afterwards

00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,880
the next question comes from

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:31,280
alyssa um and and

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,119
they have started off with an apology if

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,040
it was addressed there sorry um

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,480
the question is does it retain a

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,920
historical record of

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,800
prior names to track users um otherwise

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,839
it could be

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:48,640
it could be abused count compromise

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:51,839
so today we don't track that but

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,440
um i've thought about it it would be

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,960
possible to add i think that that would

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,800
be the kind of extension

00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,280
to the project which you would

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,480
optionally want to turn on because

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:02,640
there's a lot of situations where you

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,000
deploy an idm and you don't

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,880
want to track people's past

00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,400
names for various reasons but to have

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,680
that functionality for in terms of what

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,119
you say in terms of security for

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,000
tracking account compromise and what the

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,079
person's name was

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,839
at some point yep that that's easy to

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,920
add um

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,359
unless you went on to ask if the

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,160
usernames could be

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,839
reused and if so it was possible to

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,520
prevent that to block reuse of

00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:32,240
usernames yeah that'd be dual

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,560
easy yep cool again that's the kind of

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,640
like

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,960
input that's really useful and again if

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,320
you want to open that issue on github

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,560
please do because that's the kind of

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,280
thing that that's really interesting and

00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,000
and something that we can solve nice

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,320
nice

00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,280
um i've got a question from martin

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,480
vizier

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,000
um martin asked observes that there's

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,000
some

00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:55,920
organizations that feel that it

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,440
isn't for an identity management

00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,480
solution to push an

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,079
ethic on them can you think of the right

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,160
can you think of the rights that the

00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:08,079
company might have in such a situation

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,599
i didn't phrase that question all that

00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,319
clearly as in

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,240
uh i i think the question they might be

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:15,839
asking is more about

00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,000
would a business want to use a piece of

00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,200
software that's so opinionated

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,040
might be yeah that's a good way of

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,720
practicing that because that's

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,040
realistically what it is is that you

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,560
know

00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,640
carnegie m is opinionated and it's

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:31,119
opinionated in

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:34,160
a very specific way so

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:36,319
while these features do exist

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,319
you can disable them but i don't

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,960
encourage it because we want to do the

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:42,480
right thing

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,480
out of the box by default um

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,599
but you know the things about for

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,160
example people being able to change

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,079
their own

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,599
name at any time or username anytime

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,359
that's an access control

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,720
that exists within the server and the

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,079
access controls

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,760
you know you can disable that access

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,800
control if you want to disallow people

00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,079
from doing that

00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,440
but again i don't like i know that there

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,440
are businesses that say oh

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,359
we have these special requirements that

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,079
make it so that we have to be able to

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,839
stop user name changes and i say are

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,319
your needs that special

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,160
or is it that you just don't want to

00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:16,160
have to fix all of your other processes

00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,400
that would break if you allow it yeah

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,359
and so that's kind of why i'm kind of

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,880
pushing on the

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,880
doing something really opinionated is

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,440
because this way we can kind of drag

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,920
stuff forward into a state where i think

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,599
it's

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,280
more reflective and representative of

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,240
people because people want to change for

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,680
example again

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,200
name is a good one because that's really

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,240
the contentious one i think for a lot of

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,599
businesses if you change

00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,880
someone's username you can break

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,319
databases and stuff like that because

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,920
they use these foreign keys and

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:41,040
yeah and i've seen this at my workplace

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,319
people change their names because they

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,680
get married people change their names

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:46,079
people want to change their names

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,599
they can't avoid that you know yeah you

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,720
can't avoid people changing their names

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,040
it is impossible

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,040
you know and so to to try and say oh the

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,480
idm project should disallow it because

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,280
our business disallows it well is that

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,240
right

00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,440
we need to reflect like computers don't

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,440
exist without humans

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,200
computers exist because of human

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,680
interaction and we need them

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,079
and so our computers should not be

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,920
dictating to us how our society lives

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,359
and how our cultures exist and should be

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,079
represented but our computer should be

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,640
in support

00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,079
of you know these social and cultural

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,560
constructs that exist as humans and you

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,960
know what

00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,240
humans are complicated humans and messy

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,920
is it fair to say william that

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,839
this is kind of a downstream decision

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,319
it's not up to your software to make

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,680
that

00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:31,280
yeah it's absolutely in a way yeah

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,640
if yeah like we like i said we have a

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,839
set of opinions that is trying to

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:37,520
reflect

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,200
um how we should uh interact with people

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,599
you can choose to ignore them if you

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,520
want but i really don't recommend it

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,200
um so like all of this stuff the way

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,359
that it's structured like you could uh

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,200
change up the uh some of the types and

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,520
remove some of the fields and change it

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,720
but

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,160
um yeah we do try to do the right thing

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,040
by default so i think that's what

00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,680
they're saying

00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,720
yeah yeah um tom wants to know kind of

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,720
on a similar line

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,319
what sort of capacity does kandam have

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:07,520
for custom or extended user attributes

00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,640
yep easy so kanye jam has a

00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,200
uh similar

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,160
like my background is in ldap i'm always

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,359
going to be

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,800
um a little bit influenced by that um

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,720
and so one of the things about ldap that

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,880
is good is that the object classing

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,400
model and the attribute schema model

00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,760
does have some really nice properties

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,040
it's just also at the same time very

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,160
complicated so we have a

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,839
very highly simplified schema model

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,520
and then slightly inspired a bit by

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,839
active directory so all you have to do

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,920
is

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,119
all you can do is you just add your own

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,839
attributes and classes

00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,599
and you can add your own attributes and

00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:43,359
they have strong types in the background

00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,440
and data validation and a whole bunch of

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,800
other really nice things

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,480
and you can say with a single value

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,839
multi-value

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,520
i've got some thoughts about making it

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:52,240
so you can cap the number of values for

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,480
some stuff

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,880
to prevent certain types of attacks but

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,480
yeah extensibility is absolutely there

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,160
um if you want to add your own custom

00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,880
data fields because that's a very common

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,400
thing that

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,599
identity management and businesses need

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,400
is they need to add their own data

00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,160
fields

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,920
so yeah that was always and

00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,520
we've only got one more minute to go so

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,119
we're going to take i think just one

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:15,440
last question sorry to everyone

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,200
else that's been asking questions um

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,359
this one comes

00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,560
my email wrong at souza.de and i'm in

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,000
the chat so please

00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:24,079
email me and i'd love to hear from you

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,880
there we go we will be able to join you

00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,800
in chat

00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:28,319
uh so the last question is if the old

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,000
app bridge is read-only how can you

00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,359
connect id client machines to a canon

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,880
domain

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,960
don't okay that was the speedrun version

00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,119
uh i don't want to cut sound before's

00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,839
lunch i'm not going to try and implement

00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,119
windows joining to kanye dm so that is

00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:45,119
something where i want to make carne

00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,800
diem to say some before synchronization

00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,520
because samba 4 does what it does really

00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,760
well

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,040
to reimplement make windows join happen

00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,880
i'd need to re-implement all of sun

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,720
before and that is a undertaking that i

00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,000
don't want to do

00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,000
thank you very much william this has

00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,680
been a great truck um

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,359
stick around everyone we have another

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,359
great talk coming up we've got aaron

boxer and marcus adele

00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,920
they're going to be talking about open

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,240
sourcing ai powered video analytics

00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:12,079
that's at 2 25 so we've got a 10 minute

00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:16,160
