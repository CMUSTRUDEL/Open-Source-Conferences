Description: 
	Robyn Willison

https://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/112/

We would like to showcase Makerspace Adelaide with a walk through of the space and a talk about how we got to where we are now. https://makerspaceadelaide.org/ where the funding came from and what became our ethos.

The 4 main areas of the Makerspace are, Electronics, Digital Fabrication, Workshop and Textiles.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

and some soldering equipment we're

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,039
making up some kits

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,840
for um kids to do during the school

my trolley's getting stuck

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:16,160
we have a classroom where

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,199
the adelaide people are sitting

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,720
waiting for me to come walking through

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,160
classroom will be

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,000
used for school groups

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,000

for local groups hack a space meet here

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,880
and so walking through

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:55,360
everyone can wave it's it's coming into

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,360
focus now you can always

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,000
and at the moment we have a covered

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:16,000
rating of 24 for this room but it can

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:19,199
hold more than that

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,680
and we'll be making some of our 3d

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:26,800
printers available for the room

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,800
as well as computers and electronics

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:45,840
courses

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:45,840
and heading out to the workshop

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,280
we have cnc

00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:03,440
and drill presses and bandsaws

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,240
a dremel finishing area and we started

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,240
doing some

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:16,639
3d printing smoothing so a heating bed

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,639
and smoothing chamber

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,520
karbatek supplied some of the woodwork

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:27,840
equipment here

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,840
and we have the wood working area there

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:41,519
and we have a metal work area at the

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:55,839
back

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:55,839
with welding equipment

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,600
and a nice metal work lathe there as

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
well

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
um

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,480
storage area for supplies

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,480
and tools

00:09:47,760 --> 00:10:05,839
and work benches for people to work at

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,399
sometimes we have people bring in their

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:28,160
projects when they've had problems

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,920
and if we have the volunteers available

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,839
then people

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,839
are able to help

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:48,079
and there's the obligatory chemical

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,079
storage

00:10:50,480 --> 00:11:01,839
bathrooms the like heading through to

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,839
the kitchen

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
this

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:22,320
we had a board room but found it wasn't

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,480
being used that much

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,839
so we're starting to make it into a

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,839
chill-out room

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,320
and our multimedia room

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,160
is in the making

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:59,360
it's open lots of boxes in there

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,480
at the moment hackerspace are moving in

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,160
so we have their their storage but we

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,639
have the beginnings of our

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,639
multimedia room green screen

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:32,000
et cetera the doors along the hallway

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:35,040
are storage rooms and supply room

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,839
commonly called the room of requirement

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,839
and back to the foyer

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,880
so if anyone has any questions

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,839
otherwise i'll head back to john thank

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,839
you very much

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,880
that's an amazing tour thank you robin

00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,440
uh i think i echo the sentiments of

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,839
everybody

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,160
in the chat when i say that is the

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,279
coolest and probably the best organized

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,120
hacker space i've ever seen

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,720
although katie did make a comment saying

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,480
the camera angle is low so you can't see

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,120
the mess on the desks

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:20,240
oh right i got my camera angle right

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,800
it's very impressive um so alasdair

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,440
asked a couple of questions yes he asked

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,720
whether

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,720
trotec donated the laser cutter that is

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,120
the original fablab laser cutter and yes

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,279
it was a donation from trotec

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,040
great and for the space that you've got

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,639
are you renting that commercially or is

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,160
there some kind of discounted space

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,399
available

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,639
this is a commercial rental um the

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,959
original grant for the rent came from

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,399
green industry south australia

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,079
and so we promote the circular economy

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:55,040
in south australia

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:58,160
and um recycling refurbishing reusing

00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:01,440
of all products

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,720
excellent okay well thank you very much

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,680
for that tour robin

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,199
it's uh someone in the the chat also

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,720
commented i think the membership of

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,760
adelaide maker space is going to double

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,279
after this tour

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,720
so you'll probably have many people

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,839
wanting to come along and see it in

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,560
person

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,120
um

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,560
that's great well thank you very much

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,120
and um

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,720
to everybody else on the uh the mini

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,199
conf we're going to have a brief break

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,279
and change over for the last session

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,399
so um hang in there and we're getting

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,959
