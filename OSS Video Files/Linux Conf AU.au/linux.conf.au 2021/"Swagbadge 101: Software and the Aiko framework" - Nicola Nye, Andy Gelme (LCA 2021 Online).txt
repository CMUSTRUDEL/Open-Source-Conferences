If you’re not a badge expert and you want to make the most out of your Swagbadge, this talk is for you!

Nicola will talk through getting started, from the moment you opened the packet and the stickers fell out, to the time the badge is up and running and displaying information on the screens, and give some pointers on what to do next to make it your own and how to get help on it during LCA2021 and beyond. Andy will discuss the Aiko framework that powers a lot of the badge hardware. Why do we need a framework on top of MicroPython? What services it provides and how you can use it to extend your badge’s functionality.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
