Microwatt is an open-source POWER CPU implementation which can run on cheap FPGAs, bringing new level of accessibility to POWER.  In the last year, we have added to Microwatt features such as a memory management unit, privilege modes, interrupts, a floating-point unit, an interrupt controller and a level-2 cache, so that now it can boot Linux.  This presentation will outline these new additions to Microwatt and talk about some interesting applications for Microwatt.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
