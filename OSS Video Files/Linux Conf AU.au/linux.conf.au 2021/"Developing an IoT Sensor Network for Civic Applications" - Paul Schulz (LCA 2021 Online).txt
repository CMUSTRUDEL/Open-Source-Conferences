In 2020, along with everything else going on, the Public Libraries in Port
Adelaide Enfield, as part of it's STEM program started to build a IoT Sensor
network.

The IoT Sensor network builds on a collection of technology and other council
projects to provide a network which is available for use by the council
and local community alike. The Port Adelaide Enfield Libraries, via their STEM programs, aim to use free and open source software to produce a sustainable community resource.

This presentation will discuss the background and some of the challenges faced
by the project; technologically, commercially and socially.

Technology discussed: LoRaWAN, Arduino, The Things Network, NodeRED, Graphana

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
