https://lca2021.linux.org.au/schedule/presentation/68/

In 2020, along with everything else going on, the Public Libraries in Port
Adelaide Enfield, as part of it's STEM program started to build a IoT Sensor
network.

The IoT Sensor network builds on a collection of technology and other council
projects to provide a network which is available for use by the council
and local community alike. The Port Adelaide Enfield Libraries, via their STEM programs, aim to use free and open source software to produce a sustainable community resource.

This presentation will discuss the background and some of the challenges faced
by the project; technologically, commercially and socially.

Technology discussed: LoRaWAN, Arduino, The Things Network, NodeRED, Graphana

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

[Music]

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,039
i'm back we're excited to have up next

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,279
paul schultz who's presenting

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,960
developing an iot sensor network for

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,279
civic applications

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,119
so paul is an avid user of free and open

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,920
software in a variety of industries and

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,080
projects

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,359
and has had a trifle patch accepted into

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,280
the linux kernel

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,120
today's talk is about the stem program

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,840
at the public libraries in port adelaide

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,760
enfield

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,920
which started to build an iot sensor

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,600
network and the challenges faced by that

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,280
project

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
paul is happy to take questions at the

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,000
end of the presentation so please post

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,840
questions in venulis a reminder that we

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,600
have the venulis question tab which is

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,239
just alongside the chat tab there and

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,239
we'll be

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,600
we'll get to those at the end over to

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,800
you paul

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,120
thank you very much while we're here

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,840
i might also get you to pop in where

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,439
you're from

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,400
um we might use that a bit later

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,000
so what i'll be talking about is this

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,840
iot sensor network that we look

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,799
we're working at we're working on um

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,119
and so thanks to port adelaide enfield

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,400
council particularly stem programs

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,960
they'll get a bit of a mention at the

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,360
end because we're using this

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,000
also as part of an outreach and

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:33,200
community education program

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,759
so my background i gave a talk in 2017

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,600
about an art installation that we did

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,759
with

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,079
some cosmic ray detectors that were

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,920
distributed and we used a

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,200
wi-fi network to get the data back and

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,880
this sort of extends

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,240
this project kind of extends on some of

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,280
that work

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,880
what other network can we use to collect

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,360
sensor data and i ended up working with

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,399
robert hart a similar uh who worked on

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,399
that project

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,439
with with the libraries to see what we

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,520
could do

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,280
um with regards to collecting

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,560
data from the environment and what sort

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,239
of applications

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,840
we could use that for so just a quick

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,440
rundown of where port the city of port

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,400
adelaide enfield is

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,959
hopefully you can see that large area in

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,480
the middle of the first map

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,720
it's quite a large council um

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,000
with with the usual residential and

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,120
commercial

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
to manufacturing and large open areas

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,760
empty spaces as well as the port area

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,440
you see in the top left hand corner

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,200
so it's quite a diverse council area

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:46,400
there's also waste and

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,560
waste handling services and other

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,800
type of commercial industrial

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,160
areas in there as well so it's quite a

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,599
diverse

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,680
place to try this stuff in firstly some

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,159
definitions

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,800
i'll be talking about laura radio that's

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,560
the actual

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,120
little radio transceivers and you will

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,040
see some pictures of those in a sec

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,239
that does the point-to-point

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,840
communication

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,840
laura wan is the

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,680
long-range wan protocol that runs on

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,599
top of the laura laura radio stack

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,519
these things are picked up by lorawan

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,319
gateways which are put out into the

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,120
environment

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,760
which listen for these radio signals

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,120
from your lorawan devices or nodes which

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,120
which are they out there collecting the

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,480
data for you

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,480
we made use of something called the

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,400
things network

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,519
which is a one particular service that

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,560
runs on top of the

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,080
laura wan so lorawan itself

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,680
can be implemented as a private network

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,080
or as a private service

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,280
or as a public service as the things

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,840
network does

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,799
the things industry is that is based on

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,040
the things network

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,840
technology um and it provides more

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,720
robust

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,040
commercial type of applications um so

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:14,560
commercial type of infrastructure

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,560
for businesses within the things network

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,440
itself they differentiate between

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,880
applications

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,320
which are what you how you collect your

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,040
data

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,000
and devices which send data to the

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,520
applications so those two things

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,120
usually um are within

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,520
the things defined within the things

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,639
network um

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,840
as well as as mentioned your gateways uh

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,840
you're also registered with the things

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,040
network so the think network

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,680
website allows you to handle your own

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,639
gateways applications and devices and as

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,280
well as users

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:58,000
as well why are we doing this

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,040
or why why have uh this sort of networks

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,639
in place

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,639
um they

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:11,120
having um sensors out in the environment

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,800
is something that's is useful to people

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,680
uh and it's um becoming more and more

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,560
ubiquitous

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,600
um and we'll see in a bit how ubiquitous

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,720
and how

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,800
um it's already out there and

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,919
and we should be able to start using it

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,360
um and

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,199
the more people that get involved and

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,360
the more

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,600
uh the more this stuff

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,199
gets deployed the the more useful it's

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,440
going to be for everyone involved

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,560
so what sort of applications are there

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,759
this is in a local

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,039
playground up here in adelaide another

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:53,360
council

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:56,800
tea tree tea tree galley and it's a bin

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,479
um and

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,479
it's got solar power on top it crashes

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,080
the rubbish as you put it in

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,759
and it's got a sensor that will report

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,199
when it's full

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,560
um so that the council workers don't

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,000
have to know when that they get there

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,919
they've got something to empty

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,199
it also means that um it only gets

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,319
emptied when it needs to be emptied um

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,840
so that's sort of the sort of community

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,840
council services that you might see

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,240
with with these applications are things

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,440
like barbecues

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,319
is the working traffic management

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,240
cars traveling on roads as mentioned

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,600
with the bin bus and waste management

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,800
also parking sensors for vehicles

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,280
we're talking about environmental

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,520
sensors air quality

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,599
temperature humidity environmental noise

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,199
soil moisture in parks and gardens

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,319
watering etc

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,120
lights you could use it to

00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,639
monitor broken lights and maybe even

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,639
sort of radioactivity and

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,759
pollutants in terms of citizen science

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,360
um there's been a bit of work or

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,800
interest around the place in terms of

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,160
nesting boxes

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,960
um the use bee hotels you could monitor

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,039
how

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,520
how popular they are or where the

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,720
activity is

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,720
commercial applications

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,160
we've got metering so

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,639
the network could be used to look at

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,520
your water electricity gas metering

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,520
vending machines

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,639
health and safety

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,880
we've got

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,520
things like panic buttons

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,520
or

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,039
gps units um

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,599
monitoring location you can

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,360
for instance have an offside picture

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,360
later of a fob that does gps

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,759
so you might need might want to asset

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,039
manage your assets

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,720
and monitor that way and then personal

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,440
i've ticked the one on the end because

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,039
um one of the one of the ways this was

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,879
in which this technology is going to

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,400
come out um is

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,479
so with amazon that they have something

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,560
called sidewalk which is going to be

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,919
included in their

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,599
it was launched last year is going to be

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,240
included in their um

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,759
home management stuff um they will

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,200
include they're looking including laura

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,839
wan

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,279
connectivity and the what the the

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,640
application they're particularly pushing

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,279
is pet monitoring so you can

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,039
tell where your pet is and keep track of

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,720
animals

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,279
i don't know if it extends to doorbells

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,480
but that's not something to

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:54,320
um to look out for

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,040
okay what's been used in the past

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,519
um we've got like i'm saying with the

00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,519
with our

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,360
case of the art installation we used a

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,720
wi-fi network

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,959
um to pull the data in

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,120
in industry they use they've used radio

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,440
networks with scada

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,120
and also direct radio links i just the

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,959
difference between those two

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,040
that i've considered there is radio

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,040
network would be a hub and spoke in a

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,040
direct radio link

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,160
would just be a point some point to

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,080
point link sometimes around the place

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,680
uh you'll see a small yagi antenna

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,800
attached to a pole attached to a green

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,640
box

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,959
which would be a directed radio link

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,120
back for some form of data

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,080
control and and collection and then

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,200
there's always the

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,680
sim cards um

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,120
and mobile phones the mobile phone

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,720
network

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,080
but that can get expensive if you want

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,680
to roll out a whole bunch of stuff and

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,680
you've got to register them somehow

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,519
if you're looking at this sort of

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,720
network what sort of things to consider

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,720
when i first wrote this

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,000
i only had four when i first wrote this

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,920
um

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,519
but saying there are a large number of

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,720
possible solutions that we could have

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,800
considered low power wide area networks

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,240
uh have been around for a while and if

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,519
you have a look at the wikipedia page

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,360
for the dash seven

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,360
protocol that actually gives a good list

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,000
of and compare comparison between the

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,120
ones the ones that are available

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,640
including laura wan so we

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,560
one thing that we think that we're not

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,959
interested in is commercial vendor

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,959
lock-in

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,480
we want this to be as useful to as many

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,000
people as we can

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,959
cost-effective it needs to be

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,519
do what it says and get value for money

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,640
um

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:53,839
councils are spending our money the um

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,560
rate payers so it needs to be useful

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,000
um and i added robustness after some

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,920
other talks that i heard here at

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,519
conference because

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,720
what we were looking at for is something

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,120
that will continue to work

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,720
and laura wan actually meets that

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,160
requirement quite well in an interesting

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,279
way

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,320
and finally organizational culture

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,920
with the with the council um i was very

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,839
happy to to hear some of the talks with

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,760
the go glam mini conf

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,200
um because we're all sort of on the same

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,839
page um

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,839
councils love to be able to

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
put

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:36,320
things in place that benefit everyone

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,920
spend the money wisely and and help

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,959
everyone

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:44,480
and laura wan technology actually can do

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,480
that in quite a interesting way

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,680
compared to your wireless networks and

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,519
your

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,959
3g and phone etc

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,680
some of the groups that were involved in

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,680
this program

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,920
the stem programs with with the port

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,200
adelaide input libraries

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,200
so i was involved there as a volunteer

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,720
when this all happened airstream

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,320
wireless is a large

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,959
community wireless network in adelaide

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,399
and we partnered with them to help put

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,160
up some of the put up

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,079
and manage some of the access points

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,839
that were deployed

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,360
the growing data foundation was another

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,959
organization they

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,839
so they sponsor the things network

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,279
here in adelaide in the user group and

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,519
also hackerspace adelaide who are full

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,959
of useful

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,240
people to know when it comes to doing

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,360
electronics so there was

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,839
all right i'm going to talk about the

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,600
global network so what is

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,399
laura wan and here's a bit of a

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,959
diagram so that the end nodes the things

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,000
you put

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:55,120
out into the environment are on the left

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,120
you have a set of um gateways

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,480
that listen to the radio transmissions

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,480
the laura radios

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,240
in the middle in the middle there and

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,360
then they connect to the internet

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,000
either again by 3g or by hardwired

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,880
typically

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,399
they'll be hardwired in um and they get

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,680
they the the packets they go through a

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,399
network server they're getting

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,360
end up at the application server so in

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,880
the

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,360
definitions of the earlier

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,639
the things network is an application

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,399
server

00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,399
but other companies can register their

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,240
own so for instance schneider electric

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,279
have a regis

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,320
registered service registered provider

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:39,199
for some some corporate type thing

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,760
but the things network is the one that

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,360
allows

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,120
people to register their devices and

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,880
their their gateways

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,600
as community members and then start

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,639
using the network straight away

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,760
um and if so with laura wan when people

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,000
deploy a gateway they're actually

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,839
allowing other people to use it so

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,240
it's not the gateways aren't tied to

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,519
particular

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,519
applications or particular users or the

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,079
person that deployed the gateway

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,199
those gateways will listen to anybody's

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,480
laura wan

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:14,720
device and whichever one they whenever

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,720
they hear a packet from a lurawan device

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,160
they'll forward that on to

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,760
the network and eventually the

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,839
application server

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,279
and you'll see that in the diagram the

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,320
um the payload

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,040
the data that gets shipped is secured by

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,600
aes

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,760
and i'll sort of that'll come up briefly

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,199
in a sec

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,959
and then the backbones themselves

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,440
between the gateways

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,920
and the network servers are transmitted

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,760
by s with an ssl encryption as well

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,519
so there's sort of a double layer of

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,040
encryption but

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,320
the um it's end to end from the node

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,320
to the application server

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,320
when you want to connect a device to the

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,760
things network

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,560
there's a couple of things you need to

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:03,120
know and typically the device id and the

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,839
application id so the application

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,839
id is your particular application that

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,800
you're using to collect the data

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,720
and the device id will be an id either

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,680
written on the outside of the box

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,120
of the device if you purchase one or

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,120
something that you need to program in

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,040
to get the your particular sensor onto

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,480
the network you can do it in two ways

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,959
there's the first activation by

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,000
personalization which is essentially

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:35,360
putting the specific encoding

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,320
keys onto your device and that's only

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,320
one directional

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,480
so that means that the device can

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,320
transmit data back to the network

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,240
but it won't receive um

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,480
back channel data from the network to

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,320
the node so you'd be using that

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,519
if you just wanted to have devices

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,920
transmitting

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,639
and then being picked up and all that

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,440
and it would

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,959
it's in that mode you can actually save

00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,759
power because all the device does is

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,639
transmit

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,959
a packet and then and then stop um it's

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,160
not

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:09,279
as secure or

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,759
it's not as easy to secure i should say

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,120
um if the device gets rebooted for

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,560
whatever reason

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,440
um it will

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,360
certainly when the ones that we built

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,360
and it's not keeping track of

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,680
packet numbers you can suffer from

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,399
replay attacks in that mode

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,160
the other particular mode is this

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,920
over-the-air authentication

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:38,720
requiring bi-directional communication

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:41,199
so the gateways can transmit back to the

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,199
devices in that case you need the device

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,240
id an application id

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,839
and then a shared secret between

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,600
your device and the application called

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,320
the application key

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,920
and with those three bits of information

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,800
you can get your device

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,800
onto the network

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,360
in terms of the radio itself

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,039
this is what's used in australia the

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,079
this australian

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,240
915 megahertz

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,679
and the the devices will transmit on a

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,039
particular

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,559
packet on a particular frequency band

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,280
as indicated there and there's a whole

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,600
bunch of them

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,039
and then they will listen so the green

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,640
they can transmit on the blue or the

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,720
green

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,640
the blue are sort of wider bandwidth

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,640
which give you a longer range

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,559
and the gateways will listen to all of

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,679
that and then once i've heard a packet

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,960
there's an opportunity for

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,880
data to be transmitted back to the

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,720
device which happens on the

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,720
with the yellow frequency bands and the

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,080
devices need to listen to those

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,799
for that data to come back and that

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,440
waterfall in the top right is the sped

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,200
spreads

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,720
the sorry the chirp spread spectrum

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,360
um signal of a laura device

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,120
so that's not specifically laura wan

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,960
that's just a lora

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,240
signal as seen in a waterfall if you

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,520
were to record the frequency spectrum

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,679
um for those that are interested

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,080
okay so now if we're looking at the

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,960
that's that happens globally so

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,840
that this frequency was specifically for

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,000
australia

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,280
but there's a similar plans by different

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,840
countries in different countries all

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,880
around the world

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:31,280
how do we make use of that

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,280
in the local area um so

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,600
this is a map uh

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,039
excellent um and i'm gonna actually

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,559
attempt the demo gods

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:44,000
and we're gonna go to a live version of

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,799
this so i'm going to stop that

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,799
and share again

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,640
and i've someone's they've kindly

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,240
forward to me three locations of

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,039
people so we've got

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,080
um altona and victoria so we might just

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,640
zoom over

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,679
so so this particular tool here is the

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,480
things network

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,480
sorry the things network mapper ship it

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:16,559
and if we go to

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,559
i'm not exactly sure where altona is

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,039
maybe someone can tell me um but if

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,160
you're looking in melbourne there's

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,160
there's for instance all the

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:31,600
particular access points in melbourne

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,960
and if you click on one uh it'll tell

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,640
you so

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,640
so people have set these one up set

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:43,039
these gateways up registered them with

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,039
the things network and

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,240
they appear on the map you might

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,919
quite sometimes people

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,000
put the so mesh there's a particular

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,160
company that's doing this

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,160
um i'm trying to think where the

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:08,480
that's another council one

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,480
anyway

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,600
um so and then sort of the coverage of

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,679
melbourne so in the cbd

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,960
um it shows some of the coverage of

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,840
where you should be able to

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,840
where these

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:30,240
gateways will pick up a signal

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,240
um so melbourne we've got

00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,679
uh

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,559
we'll have a look a quick look at

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,559
brisbane fly past sydney

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,600
let's see what we've got so these are

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,840
some locations that people said they

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,840
were coming in from

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,600
not sure what's going on come on

00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,600
brisbane

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,919
i'm sure then i'm sure there's some iot

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,240
gateways there's some

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,600
laura wang gateway is there somewhere oh

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,679
there we go

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,400
all right and so there's a bit of a

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,400
coverage there

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:18,720
uh yeah so another say qut

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,919
um we'll see mesh come up again because

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,000
that's they're quite a

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,919
um they have their own solution

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,840
um which they provide to people and

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,480
that's one of the providers that

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,919
got picked out for the puerto ric we'll

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,080
put adelaide in for council two at one

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:39,760
stage

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:42,960
okay um i'll fly back to adelaide

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,320
so if you're if you've got um if you

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,960
would like to find out what your

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,960
coverage is

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:56,640
you can use the ttn map

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,640
to um see what

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,919
uh what gateway's around and what you

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,360
can see what i wanted to point out

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:07,039
um was so the tea tree gully council

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,440
which had that bin

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,960
um have actually been quite proactive in

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,440
the gateways that they

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,799
deployed so all these um

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,280
gateways in here from the tea tree

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,280
gallery council that's the civic center

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:31,039
for instance i've in my hope valley

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:34,240
um and then the in our particular area

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:36,799
this is the gateway we've got set up

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,720
so this is this is once within the

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,559
library itself

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,320
um at enfield and then we've got one

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,760
down this end

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:50,000
again this is and this was done by

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:53,360
meshed if i put our lead in field

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,640
okay um so yeah that's a good

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:59,120
this is a useful tool um to go in and

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,720
have a look and i'll talk about how some

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,280
of this stuff is also mapped so the

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,039
things network web page itself

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:10,799
also has a map

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:13,039
but it doesn't show coverage so

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,039
um

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,559
and so here it was a picture i took

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,880
earlier

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,000
of the coverage around sort of the the

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:30,480
adelaide northern adelaide area

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:34,080
um the way this particular map works

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,360
is if you have a node connected with the

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,760
things network

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,760
when it gets detected

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,600
when it when it sends out a packet that

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,159
gets detected by the network the network

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,600
actually

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:53,200
also reports signal strength

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,240
and so the thing what you can do is

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:59,600
um install the things the things mapper

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,559
mobile app on your phone um while you've

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,039
got the

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,039
the particular node or the lorawan

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,760
device

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,960
with you and it uses both of those bits

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,440
of information

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,720
from the mobile app and what's recorded

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,840
by the things network

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,679
to record the signal strength location

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,360
and eventually you end up so you just

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:21,520
wander around with this thing receiving

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,200
sending and receiving packets

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,679
and it builds up the map so it's well

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,600
worth having a look at

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,919
the website and if you're interested in

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,120
in seeing where your particular

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,000
because it has a map where your

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,559
particular device is getting picked up

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,200
it'll show you which gateways can see

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,200
your device

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,360
so moving on

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:50,159
the commercial solutions

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:54,080
um out there there are a few

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:58,559
um and this one was

00:24:54,080 --> 00:25:00,400
so with the there was a smart cities

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,679
project several councils in adelaide got

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,279
together and decided they want to

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:08,240
investigate this

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:12,559
technology and they had a contract with

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,320
um nesht

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,240
who have their they provide everything

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,279
they're sort of incomplete turnkey

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,400
solution

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:24,080
um and there's another uh sort of

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,159
smart city set up uh a separate um

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,440
account with the things network see in

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,159
this case

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,159
we had two

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,520
providers of this network one one did

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,880
the laura gateways

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,880
and provided some additional sensors as

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,919
well so there's parking sensors and the

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,679
other one

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,400
provided some bin bin sensors

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,760
and they end up going through a set of

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,520
servers

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,520
so very similar to the way that the

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,640
the conference ban the conference badge

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,919
works the data ends up in an mqtt

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:09,120
server provided by the things network

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,840
you can you pull the data from that into

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,840
some sort of

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:18,159
database in which case they're using

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,159
um

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,240
what do they got there this they're

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,200
using postgres

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,960
um and then pulling it into grafana

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,640
which allows you to plot the data and

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,080
see trends etc

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,720
um that's certainly doable and these

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
guys

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,840
these peak pekka organizations and

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,520
companies have their have set up their

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,120
own

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,080
scripts and things to do this but it's

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,080
not particularly open

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,600
if we want to add another device using

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,279
the meshed account for instance they

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,840
will charge us um

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,840
if you want to experiment with something

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,039
uh we get it we get a bill

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,440
um if we want to put a sensor somewhere

00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,440
that

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,480
hasn't got any coverage via the laura

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,679
gateway that's

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:11,279
in the area maybe a bit far we um

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:14,240
for instance with with some new bins um

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,320
there they would charge us to put a new

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,000
gateway in to cover that area if

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,320
if we were wanting to get them to do the

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,240
service i mean fair enough but it's not

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,799
particularly flexible and easy to

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,799
to do and

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,919
how do we how do we use this to um

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:38,320
improve um

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,320
and allow people to use this technology

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,559
um this was an example of the gateways

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,000
that were

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,720
put in and used um at this stage there

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,240
wasn't

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,200
the um there wasn't the gateway at

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,440
enfield

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,640
um but you can see that we had some down

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,960
on the coast

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,000
we're two two there down the enfield

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,120
civic center

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,919
um sort of various directions

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,120
the parks library green acres library

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,320
and then

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,279
a valley view as well with a sort of

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,279
community center there

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,760
these um so these were and these were

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,760
put in by meshed

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:29,520
um what's the alternative oh we

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:32,480
we dreamt something up um

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,480
we've got a raspberry pi that's running

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,399
um

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,320
node-red influx db and grafana

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,919
so all the services are running on a

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,480
single raspberry pi

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,559
which talks to the things network via

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,200
mqtt

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,080
um and then in addition to that the the

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,159
other piece of

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,200
the software that proved useful is

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,840
something called

00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:01,279
zero tier which is a virtual vpn

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:01,279
um freely available

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,799
which allows allows you to connect and

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,799
view the

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,919
the web page on that particular

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,399
raspberry pi

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,600
um if you're on the same network and

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,080
that's been that's been particularly

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,440
useful

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:19,200
for getting in getting um connecting up

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:22,799
just uh devices and um

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:27,600
that might be behind firewalls and and

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:29,360
masquerading interfaces etc

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,039
and then we can connect whatever devices

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,520
we want

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,320
to the things network and they just get

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,120
picked up

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,120
by the node red

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,520
so what sort of sensors were we looking

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,919
at

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,039
um these were three that were purchased

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,840
um which we could just

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:50,000
add uh when you when you just pick your

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,200
company dragino

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,840
dragino when they make it um

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,840
you can

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,000
uh that you get the

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,000
um

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,840
the the device id

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,960
put that into the things network they

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,640
also include

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,640
a application id so the application and

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,399
the things network that you're using

00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:26,880
that gets mapped to an mq

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:28,480
mq mqtt channels um

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,919
they pre-register the device and it

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,399
comes with the device so to get

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,360
to put the device on you just need the

00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,840
device id

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:38,559
and you register a new application id

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,039
and away you go

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,679
these these things actually have a

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,159
battery in them and are designed to last

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,799
with that battery up for up to 10 years

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,760
so they're quite long lived

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,559
other than the the gps location at the

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,200
end that would

00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,880
that needs sort of daily recharging

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,200
these other two devices

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,679
um are just designed to sit there and

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,039
transmit periodically

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,600
um this distance measuring sensor

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,919
um is something fairly that they make

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,519
that's fairly standard it's very generic

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,519
you can open it up and you can replace

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,519
that sensor with something else

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,600
that has more than one channel in there

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,000
temperatures humidity etc

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,919
and you can they use that one model with

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,840
a whole bunch of different sensors

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,760
and you can reflash the firmware and

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,720
just use it for other things as well

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,440
which is

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:35,600
good to know

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,600
uh

00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:42,799
[Music]

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:47,039
okay so i just lost my place

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:49,679
moving on um this

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,320
here was what we came up with for our

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,440
first

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,200
internal stem program uh in terms of

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,679
what we used it's an arduino shield that

00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:02,880
has the lorawan

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,880
radio there in the middle um

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,640
you can see some of the things that the

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,559
sort of the

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:14,799
weight connects up and reasonably cheap

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:16,320
at forty dollars for an iot shop

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,760
that particular board in the middle

00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,080
radio board you can use yourself is only

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,440
worth a couple of dollars

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,360
but this came complete and you could

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,240
plug it on to arduino and be off and

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,320
running

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,840
reasonably quickly i say reasonably

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,840
quickly because the particular

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,360
library that we use with it is sort of

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,600
been forked and forked again

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,039
and then finally someone went and set it

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,640
up for the australian

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,799
band but it works quite quite

00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,240
easily once once you've sorted out that

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,600
the issue so if you've got any questions

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,880
about using this one

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,880
more than happy to answer them

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,960
we ended up using these

00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,519
in our workshop we ran two two sets of

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,519
workshops

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,399
for people in the library on how to

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,240
connect it to the running through how to

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,799
connect it to the law aware network

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,480
and then collect data from it and end up

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:16,240
graphing it so

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,159
um this with particular sensors that

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,320
setups that we used so the picture on

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:24,320
the left is a moisture sensor

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:27,440
just powered by a usb battery

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,919
um and then transmitting the data to

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,600
laura

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:34,640
to by the lorawan shield

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,840
and the one on the right um

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,840
had a couple of temperature and humidity

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,840
sensors

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,240
which which the arduino collected and

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,679
then transmitted

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,399
with packets the

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,799
once you've got the data into laura in

00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:58,320
by laura wan and the things network

00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,240
you can just pull it out via mqtt

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,919
messages

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:07,200
the node on the top left there is the

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,720
node-red mqtt client

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,720
it subscribes to a particular

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:18,480
to a particular topic in mqtt and that

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,599
the data just simply flows through that

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,919
particular

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,079
setting there so you can see that in the

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,079
pink pinkish

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,200
nodes in the middle there um those

00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,440
dragino

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,639
first the top two are for the ones we

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,760
purchased

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:38,000
uh the decrypt io sensor one was

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:40,480
is the temperature sensor um

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,119
you can you pull out the code into j you

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,639
pull out the data into a json format

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,720
and then format it up and then it gets

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,960
pushed into

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,560
an influx db database at the bottom

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,159
bottom right

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:57,280
so at the end of the day um

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,359
the data this this tool just allows you

00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,680
to pull the data in decode it and then

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,359
push

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:05,440
into your time series database

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,040
and that's the result so this was taken

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,800
the week last week

00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,480
after running it for a little bit and

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,960
you can just see the

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,800
the temperature and and the humidity

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,000
values of the two

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,480
sensors that are on that particular

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,480
device

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:30,320
what next like i say we ran the

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:33,119
the two sets of workshops um

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,200
actually if you're interested in

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:39,280
following you can follow that link there

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,839
that gives a full rendition of the four

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,839
workshops in each series and how and

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,200
what's involved in pulling everything to

00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,960
get pulling every together to make those

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,680
devices work

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,119
we delivered those two workshops and had

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,400
quite a few people

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,760
quite a few people interested

00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,240
and where do we go from here um

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,160
so this and some may have seen this from

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:04,000
maybe um

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,359
jonathan oxford maybe but it's uh the

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,440
air quality sensor

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,960
and here i've just i'm just accessing it

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,240
via serial

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,720
um so this is sort of what we're up to

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,599
in terms of progress um and then i'm

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,960
going to look at

00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,119
what we're going to how we're going to

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,160
get this um

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:25,280
into uh laura

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,800
into the lorawan network

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:32,640
but as you see sort of the data there

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,160
every 10 seconds it transmits a packet

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,920
of

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,400
32 bit bytes of data and if you decode

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,640
that

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,440
it's got the the various particle sizes

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:45,359
that this device detects

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,680
so it actually there's a little fan in

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:51,520
it that samples the air

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,520
with the laser and will report

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,480
what the what the air quality or what

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,960
particles are available in the

00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,320
in the laser these are some of the

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,000
boards that we're looking at combining

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,839
with it

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,119
i'll talk about the top one in a moment

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,920
but the the helic

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,240
automation one is a nice cheap little

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,240
board

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,640
with it with the display in it so you

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,320
could use that to display the

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,079
as well as sending it over laura you

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,599
could also use it to display the air

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,240
quality in real time

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,119
but the one at the bottom this tt go t

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:29,440
beam

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:31,119
with the esp32 has a battery in the back

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,560
so for instance we could hook up a solar

00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,480
panel

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,480
with the battery and put it out in the

00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,000
environment

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,800
with the air quality sensor it has a gps

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,839
location so we can make a bunch of these

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,079
and then they could report where they

00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,480
are

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,359
and what their air quality is maybe once

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,000
an hour or so

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,960
um and that's that's kind of where we

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,800
want to get to

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,079
want to get to next is is actually

00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,079
develop some of these

00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,720
sensors in addition to the ones that you

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,720
can just buy

00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:08,720
um

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:09,200
so very quickly um just some other

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,599
project

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,720
projects that are related that that top

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:17,680
board

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:21,040
um shown here is actually from the

00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:24,560
the foster sat project

00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:27,760
it uses a similar it's not using laura

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,760
wan but it's using a similar

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,119
a similar idea

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,960
to be able to talk to a satellite so

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,000
these are low earth orbit satellites

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,440
they're going to be quite

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,520
small that they're just working on at

00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,560
the moment

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,720
which will fly over twice a day

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,680
and it could be useful to pick up data

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,680
from sensors

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,200
and then transmit them back down so the

00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,800
the lora

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,240
radios in this case would end up going

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,200
up to the satellite and coming back down

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,320
again

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,560
and these particular boards are being

00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:00,640
used as their ground station boards

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,640
as you see them there with power

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,680
and then something just similar

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,440
technology

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,920
um with regards to using mqtt messaging

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,240
node

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,520
node-red and micropython uh are in

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,640
things like the swag badge

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,800
test motor mentions it super house tv

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,320
and then another bit of tongue-in-cheek

00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,760
but i'm looking at

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,160
implementing some of this stuff sort of

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,760
stuff at home as well

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,640
in the super chuck house um

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,520
finally um some other things to to think

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,800
about

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,200
um uh what are the legalities

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,880
so the radio spectrum itself um while

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,079
it's um

00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,400
ism um and so

00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,760
not it's type license you don't need to

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,599
need to

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,599
get a license specifically it's included

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,280
in the radio

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,720
there are considerations about how many

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,720
and how much data you can send

00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:00,560
um uh you don't want to be flooding the

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,520
the network um if you can't can help it

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,560
because it's a

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:08,720
a common good

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,319
at a commons

00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,000
and then there's also things like what

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:13,839
what can you monitor or

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,240
what what where do we consider

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,839
monitoring in public spaces etc

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,760
um and if you're putting out all these

00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:25,119
sensors what's the community acceptance

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:29,119
the community benefits going to be um

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:31,839
uh what what how else what can we do

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,800
that's new here um if we're collecting

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,880
this data

00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,839
and i say i've put down monetizing data

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,440
collection

00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:43,839
um can we

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,839
do useful things with it that will

00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,960
make them make make this data

00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:56,160
um

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:58,880
like worth something um

00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:00,400
and then as part of that what do we do

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,599
if we've got these sensors out there how

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,119
do we look after them

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,760
and how to recycle them at the end of

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,520
their at the end of their life

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,640
so there's all sorts of things that need

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,800
to be considered if we're going to

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,520
deploy a whole bunch of these things

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,319
um so i'll be more than happy to to hear

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,359
if anyone's got any comments about that

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,680
uh finally um um

00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:22,880
there's a this is non-sponsored plug the

00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,280
things conference

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,920
is actually happening um starts tonight

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,280
so if you're

00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,800
a a student you can get um with a

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,920
universe email account you can get free

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,000
access

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,480
um the the talks start at mid from

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,200
midnight our conference time tonight

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,480
because it's based in europe um and they

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,680
go through some of this stuff in the

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,359
first couple of talks

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,280
as well so if you're happy if you if

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,920
you're up then i want to follow up on

00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,040
some of this

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,200
these things from engineers and people

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,200
that

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,119
deal with this stuff all the time then

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,880
you can

00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,240
log in to their register and log into

00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,000
there

00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,440
and then finally thanks to robert hart

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,720
for taking me on as a

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,000
volunteer and helping us with these stem

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,160
programs

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,599
it's been a great experience pulling all

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,560
this stuff together

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,760
and while covid hasn't helped it's kept

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,480
my mind off

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,240
other things so thank you again to the

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,839
put out and for libraries

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,839
for that and with that

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,160
i'll ask for questions

00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,280
thank you very much that was an

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,480
absolutely

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,680
amazing presentation very very thorough

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,040
um i loved the map that was really great

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,280
it worked really well

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,720
yeah it was very good it's great to see

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:48,079
melvin on screen

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:50,880
uh just um there's been a lot of chat

00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,839
on the on the venulis side i just have a

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,079
quick question that i

00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:58,079
wanted to ask um what can you see as

00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,319
would be the main driver to really bring

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,000
this bring this sort of forward more do

00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,640
you see more sort of local government

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,240
buy-in

00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,839
or more industry buy-in or collaboration

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,760
in that way

00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:13,760
um what the benefit

00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,440
and this is the fit that with a lot with

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,160
i think with um

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,880
councils and libraries is that the when

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,079
you put a

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,079
gateway in um

00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:25,520
not only can for instance for a council

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,040
not only can the council use it for

00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,960
their council applications like bin

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,920
monitoring

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,240
traffic monitoring etc but anyone that

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,200
is in that area

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,280
can use it for their own senses and

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,800
things as well

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,400
the the new lot the

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,839
recently that the sensors have come out

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,520
also have power management

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,119
sort of built in as well so the sensors

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,800
will

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,440
um uh use less power and hence give

00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,760
themselves

00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,880
more life if they if they notice that

00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,240
they're being

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,440
received well um so so the more gateways

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,440
that get put in

00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,280
the better the whole network will work

00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,680
because the

00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,480
because your senses can be a lower

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:11,599
powered

00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,760
uh sorry and your your nodes um

00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,880
and that that goes in nicely to our next

00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,280
question coming from

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,960
the audience what advice would you give

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,720
for those wanting to contribute a

00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,920
gateway

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,480
um just put it in um make sure you've

00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,079
you've got one that does uh multiple

00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,880
channels there are there are cheap ones

00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,960
around

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,800
that are single channel only they since

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,200
for instance they would use the

00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:38,319
that arduino shield but in a gateway

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,319
gateway configuration

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,240
but they're not really that useful you

00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,680
want one that does

if you can't i mean it can maybe maybe

00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:05,040
there's an opportunity for

00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:08,400
