GO GLAM wrap: What did we learn today and what's next?

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

[Music]

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,880
i'm back go glammers

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,080
uh you've made it to the end of the day

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,960
well done

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,960
um so what we've got for you today or

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,400
this afternoon or this final session

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,080
is hugh and i basically having a

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,760
conversation um

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,199
we're doing a little bit of a wrap just

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,200
reflecting on the day

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,559
and answering that important question of

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,840
what's next

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,520
um so hugh i might just ask you

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,559
what you learned today so many things

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,000
bonnie so many things

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,399
i learned that the open source values of

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,960
accessibility transparency and ownership

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,320
are also values that can help enable

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,840
native sovereignty or indigenous

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,280
sovereignty in online technology

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,400
and i learned that our

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,840
natakanu project team

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,000
started with the problem that the people

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,680
they were trying to

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,360
assist had actually identified

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,000
themselves and then worked with those

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,479
people

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,920
to um to produce the solution rather

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,880
than

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,400
uh having building the solution and then

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,400
and then kind of looking for problems to

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,920
solve with it i guess which uh

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,880
so often happens that was uh that was a

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,000
pretty exciting way

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,040
to start the day um

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,479
what did i learn from mark uh

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,320
i liked mark's approach

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,680
that uh the thing that he likes the most

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,799
about his his uh

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,079
tall is that it works which i thought

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,680
i thought you know set yourself

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,360
achievable goals this is right

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,320
absolutely it's just more victories

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,759
yeah exactly exactly i also learned that

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,759
many people in our audience

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,000
uh were really mad that mark hadn't

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,000
invented the open journal matcher about

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,960
10 years ago before they started writing

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,759
their thesis

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,840
that was absolutely a theme i i saw just

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,680
outrage after outrage or

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,680
how that could have been come on mark

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,800
what are you doing man i was

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,800
disappointed mark

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:25,760
um and i also actually really liked

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,760
um mark's kind of insight that

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,840
every software project is built on a

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,080
pile of assumptions

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,120
and even if you're making software

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,760
yourself if you

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,120
you're nearly always building that on

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,760
top of things that other people have

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,280
built

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,800
and you're therefore building it on top

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,920
of their assumptions even if your

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,920
assumptions

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,599
are different which i thought was an

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,879
important point to make

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,080
i think for me um like i completely

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,519
agree that

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,440
what was really impressive i think

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,000
throughout all the private presentations

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,319
was

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,760
it's not just about the project it's

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,480
also unpacking

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,599
the um the thinking and the ideology

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,280
behind it as well

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,640
do you know do you know what i mean like

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,560
so often absolutely

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,840
yeah i think with a lot of glam stuff we

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,680
see this is what we

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,040
you know this is the project this was

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,400
the very measurable

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,599
deliverable outcome and this is why you

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,360
should do it too

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,920
um whereas we we saw a bit more of that

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,280
um definitely critical thinking but just

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,319
even unpacking

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,519
um the thinking behind it so

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,000
you know with our first project it's

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,080
it's um you know it's not it's maybe not

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
the specific project but definitely

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,000
um taking on board the way it was

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,760
approached that kind of thing it's it's

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,400
with mark's project of

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,120
um really unpacking um our own

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,959
positioning

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,480
and as you said when we build on the

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,720
work of others we're

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,159
um to some extent inheriting that

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,480
privileged position or the

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,439
um well the assumptions that go with

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,560
that so i think

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,239
that kind of stuff is really interesting

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,080
as we move forward

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,599
for sure i think it's been really

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,360
exciting to see that that was a

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,560
consistent theme through

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,680
through all our projects i mean uh even

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,480
i mean liz talked about this a lot um

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,560
explaining to people the why not just

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,320
the how um

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,000
but that as you say also um is important

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,440
when we're thinking about it's not just

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,560
important in teaching people skills it's

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,080
also important in

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,000
thinking about the products we're using

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,360
in the systems we're using why was it

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
built that way what are the assumptions

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,080
sitting behind

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,840
that what are the expectations

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,120
which is why i liked

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,800
mike's talk so much about akisto and

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,720
the the kind of why for that is

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,400
we have no idea what technology people

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,199
are going to be using in 20 years but we

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,960
know that we

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,880
they're going to want to access this

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,720
research that is being

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,000
and this data that has been created now

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,639
so

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,880
how can we create a system that is

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,160
really flexible and usable

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,199
but doesn't expect that the same

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,080
technology stack is even going to exist

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,080
for future researchers which i thought

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,840
was a really um

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,840
smart way of of thinking about it

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,960
yeah i completely agree i think again

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,759
that sort of

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,360
we're thinking you know in the past the

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,280
present and the future

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,400
there's sort of this lineal thing

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,759
happening and i think

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,080
that sort of deeper deeper approach to

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,000
projects is is really interesting so

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,120
that was really great to see

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,759
um so in terms of so i mean

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,360
we could continue speaking about what we

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,840
learned because there was just so much

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,440
and

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,199
um i can't wait to sort of go back into

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,520
the chat and have a look and

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,120
um really you know now that some of the

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,800
nerves have eased be able to actually

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,360
watch the presentations and

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,039
go oh yeah okay um as opposed to sitting

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,240
here going oh is everything working

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,160
um so big full day in terms of of

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,639
learnings and lots to take away

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,360
um that other question that we have in

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,880
terms

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,000
of what's next yeah and this is

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,520
this is the whole theme of um of

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,160
lca 2021 um what's next is

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,199
was sort of the theme we were presented

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,720
with when we

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,400
when we pitched go glam i said mini conf

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,600
and we asked all of our speakers to talk

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
about what's next i don't think they've

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,319
all

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
done that pretty well i mean i think for

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,120
natacano what's next

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,440
is i mean we had a bit of talk during

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,960
that

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,400
and shortly after that presentation

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,319
about oh this tool would be really

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,280
fantastic in this other context

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,720
and that that may well be true but

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,280
personally i think what's next

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,120
is that we all need to really learn from

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,240
the as you said the approach that they

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,039
took

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,000
um what's going to work in the local

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,960
context

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,520
for the local community that you're

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,080
working

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,800
with and you've got to work with the

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,639
people who

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,240
are your future users and it's got to be

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,080
led by them i think that's

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,680
for me that's that's what's next is for

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,520
us all to think about

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,039
what are the processes we normally use

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,400
when we're developing projects and what

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,080
can we learn from that

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,520
about how we do that i think what's next

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,840
what i think what mark is hoping is

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,840
what's next is that we all put in

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,240
amazing pull requests into open journal

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,160
manager and help him to make it

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,440
even more awesome uh what's what's next

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,039
for my project is

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,479
is kind of the same thing i would love

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,160
to to get some data from people and

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,560
the great thing is that liz has taught

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,120
everybody how to do that now so

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,919
um you know what's next is that you can

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,479
you can all

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,319
you can all get onto github and um start

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,319
issuing full requests right

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,479
but i mean that's the you know like if

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,479
we if we take that a step further

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,680
i mean in terms of what's next it's

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,199
about creating those

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,560
skilled communities um and collaborating

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,400
on projects um and i think that's

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,160
you know that's incredibly important to

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,680
start i mean really we're talking

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,160
we start to get into the realm of

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,440
collectivism right and that

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,400
i think challenges a lot of the ways

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,840
our institutions and employment i'm just

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,479
going to lay it out now cue

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,360
i'm just going to say that the way

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,840
things have been

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,240
have been very much about the individual

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,639
and you know precarious employment

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,160
um pits us against each other and when

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,599
we work in glam

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,400
knowledge is currency right so sharing

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,120
isn't

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,879
fostered because if i share it with you

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,080
and then you and i compete for the next

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,680
contract

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,680
i've really done myself a mischief right

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,120
so maybe i withhold that information

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,240
because i don't know when the next job

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,719
contract's going to come

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,159
so if we can fight against that with

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,680
active sharing

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,720
um skill set skill set building

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,839
collaborative projects um a sense of

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,600
community i think that's

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,040
incredibly powerful but also potentially

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,680
subversive

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,720
i i totally agree and i think it's um to

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,519
go a step further

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,720
it's not just pitting individual workers

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,040
against each other but this is what

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,279
happens with institutions as well

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,560
uh we all all of our institutions talk

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,680
about how they love to be collaborative

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,519
and they're all about

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,959
making information freely available and

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,320
yet

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,760
those of us who work in cultural

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,959
organizations and higher education

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,480
organizations know

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,760
that the reality is a little bit

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,720
different it's highly competitive

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,720
everyone's competing for funding

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,279
and every organization wants to be the

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,320
first one to do something not

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:35,440
not the second one to

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,760
update the documentation or you know

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,519
make make the incremental bit important

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,640
improvements in the background that

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,399
um you know funders and and big decision

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,320
makers don't notice so

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,560
maybe you're right that is what's next

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,200
is for us well think about

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,160
uh what we can do to change that culture

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,120
i guess

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,760
yeah so i mean i guess it's i and i i

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,360
think i

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,200
might have touched on it earlier just

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,160
sort of in passing is

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
is that idea of an open source mindset

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,720
and

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,680
how many uh shared attributes there are

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,120
with

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,760
the way we um you know if we would

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,040
describe

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,000
libraries at their best

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,880
there's a lot of shared attributes there

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,920
so

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,680
i think fundamentally it's in us

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,120
as glam workers do you know what i mean

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,959
like fundamentally those

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:32,000
open source um open knowledge

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,920
all of that open mindset is with

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,040
us and and probably what drew us to the

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,760
profession

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,040
um it's about possibly you know like how

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,959
do we bring that

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,600
into the institution or how are we able

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,760
to enact that as glam workers

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,880
does that make sense it makes sense to

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,320
me hopefully it makes sense for

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,920
everybody else i mean it's really about

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,279
how do we get our institutions to

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,800
actually

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,079
um really do

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,480
what our professions and our

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,000
organizations say that we're all about

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,079
you know how do we make it actually

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,680
about that not just

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,880
talking about that i think we have i

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,240
know you may have missed some of this

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,880
bonnie because you haven't

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,839
been as in the chat as i've been able to

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,600
be

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,920
um but we've already seen a little bit

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,640
of that today so um

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,120
mike obviously talked about akisto and

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,480
and

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,519
um the various use cases for that and

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,040
simon uh in the chats

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,360
was saying oh this actually could be

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,680
really useful for a cmo

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,800
maybe i should look into this so you

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,160
know we may have already made a

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,519
connection there

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,120
um we've uh molly talked about

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,200
the fact that the university of tasmania

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,560
has has openly shared all of their amica

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,320
documentation and that was

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,160
really helpful for the state library of

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,800
western australia now you know

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,519
personally i think we should all make a

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,120
big deal

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,040
of thanking utas for doing that

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,720
and kind of highlighting this and that

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,079
is a really fantastic thing to do that's

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,000
probably say

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,680
um you know the state library of us in

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,839
australia hours and hours

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,160
of time kind of fiddling about trying to

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,920
do stuff um yes so

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,760
we can and we've talked about that this

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,959
in previous

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,480
uh previous iterations of go glam

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:21,200
um you know uh making

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,760
making our institutions practices really

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,880
generous

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,000
and then making a big deal about it so

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,279
that we sort of

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,399
um you know the nice way would be to say

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,519
we sort of normalize it but um i suppose

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,000
another way of thinking about it is we

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,000
kind of shame shame some of our less

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,600
generous organizations into being a

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,320
little more generous in their

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,600
behaviour yeah yeah i think i think

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,000
celebrating

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,079
um you know celebrating genuineness and

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,320
generousness and openness

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:55,519
as core values of the profession um

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,079
is really powerful i think um

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,839
just just on those connections and again

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,279
you're absolutely right i didn't sort of

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,000
get to jump into

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,880
the chat um because of the things were

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,279
going on

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,519
um so i'm doing a great job hosting is

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,519
funny

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,720
oh it was easy when all the presenters

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,720
were amazing um

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,920
but you know you and i both attended the

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,040
two previous

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:24,480
um glam mini conferences

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,800
um and one of the the really um

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,399
you know that i couldn't stop talking

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,680
about and what i continued to look

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,480
forward to

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,839
was the interactions the building upon

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,519
um

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,760
knowledge shared during the day and this

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,760
building of a community that occurred at

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,519
the two previous events

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,120
um in your opinion do you think we've

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,920
managed to achieve

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,880
some of that today in our online

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,880
environment so

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,880
we're not we're not sharing sandwiches

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,360
but do you think we've got

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,800
that you know it's interesting i i

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,279
wonder if we'll be able to

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,720
better this in some way in in future i

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,079
feel like

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,920
we've either equaled or actually

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,399
surpassed um the way that we've done

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,800
this in the past

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,519
um i've seen in the chat that there's

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,440
there's been

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,279
people have been connected with other

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,880
glam techie networks that they didn't

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,399
realize existed or

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,920
or you know there's been a few like oh

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,360
you should talk to this person

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,959
they're they're really interested in

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,839
similar things to you or did you know

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,040
about this tool

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:32,720
it seems kind of similar um

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,519
i've i've already seen on on

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,360
on github some people who are here i've

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,079
noticed have been

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,680
in in the repositories of some of the uh

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,120
projects that have been talked about

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,560
already i myself have already had a pull

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,199
request from somebody who's

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,399
here at this videoconf to improve my map

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,639
already

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,240
um so you know it's all happening that's

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,920
wonderful i mean that's that's the

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,959
outcome that we wanted so i think

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,680
in in in summing up um

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,639
now because we're out of time here i i

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,680
wanted to say

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,639
thank you to you um as co-organizer

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,199
you've done

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,880
so much work um liaising with all of our

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,519
wonderful presenters so thank you for

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,320
