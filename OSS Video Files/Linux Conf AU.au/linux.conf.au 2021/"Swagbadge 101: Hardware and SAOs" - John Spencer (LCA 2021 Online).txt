This is the open hardware miniconf, so let’s talk about the hardware on the badge. Find out what our goal was for the badge, and why we chose the components we used. We’ll discuss the ways you can extend your badge with hardware, whether that’s working with the onboard microcontroller, or adding a simple add-on (SAO). We’ll talk about our SAO protoboards, the Tux SAO and other SAO extensions you can build and buy to enhance your badge life.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/
