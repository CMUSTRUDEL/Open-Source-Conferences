Iâ€™m the main maintainer and creator of GKernelCI. 
GKernelCI was born 4 years ago with the necessity to have a standardized and automatic way of testing Gentoo Kernel sources.
Test results of Gentoo Kernel sources are used by the Gentoo Kernel team to double-check each Gentoo Kernel source's release. 
GKernelCI is becoming a fundamental step of Gentoo sources release. 
With GKernelCI v.2[4] we are not only introducing new features but also compatibility with KernelCI using Kcidb (kernelci.org common database tools). 
KernelCI is the Linux Foundation project currently used for testing the Linux Kernel and sending upstream feedback. 
GKernelCI v.2 will join efforts with Kcidb tool to send feedback from Gentoo kernel sources. 
Other features that will be implemented with GKernelCI v.2 are:
-the usage of docker for better, faster, more-repeatable environments
-the usage of lava for a more standardized testing and simplify testing on embedded systems
GKernelCI v.2 is also trying to be more important during not only the release of the Gentoo kernel sources but also with the stabilization of them Gentoo kernel related packages.
GKernelCI v.1 is currently hosted courtesy of mjeveritt[2] at [3]
The GKernelCI is an open source project. 
The GkernelCI code can be found here[1]

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
