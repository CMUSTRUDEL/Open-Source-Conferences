The world is frankly a bit of a mess right now, and doesn't look like sorting out any time soon.  The post-WW-II / post-Cold War-I period of prosperity seems to have come to an end, and the unfortunately predictable result is geo-political turmoil, and the rising popularity of "strong" and "charismatic" leaders, not disimilarly to 100 years ago in Europe.  But in those 100 years, technology has come a long way, such that oppression by malevolent governments has become much easier to achieve, and much harder to escape, if we rely on off-the-shelf solutions.    In short, the Digital Summer may be drawing to a close, and a Digital Winter looks likely to blow in to many countries.
 
But its not all doom and gloom:  The open-source community offers hope, through its ability to create solutions that are decentralised and self-sufficient.  The Digital Summer is still with us, and so we have time to create effective solutions. We need systems that exhibit "Digital Sovereignty".  By this, we mean systems that cannot be subjugated, subverted or supplanted by hostile third-party actors, such as state-level actors.  In short, we need systems that will let people keep on communicating when the proverbial hits the oscillatory.

In this talk I will explain more of these ideas of Digital Sovereignty, the Digital Winter, and how we can work to shorten (or potentially avoid it) and how I am working to create a digitally sovereign smart-phone, as an example of a Digitally Sovereign device.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

[Music]

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,960
good afternoon

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,680
in the conference time zone tux theater

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,199
um

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,840
next up we have paul gardner stephen

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,400
to talk about digital sovereignty which

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,400
is an

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,240
excellent follow-up from our last talk

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,640
here in tux theater

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,960
so paul has been writing open source

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,880
software since the late 1990s

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,719
and is best known for the servomesh

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,120
off-grid communication systems

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,280
the 64-net system for connecting

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,239
commodore 64 computers to more boring

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,719
computers

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,200
making and using a working shoe phone

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,280
the mega 65 retro computer and most

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,800
recently making a commodore 64

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,239
compatible smartphone

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,520
the megaphone welcome paul

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,359
thank you and thank you for everyone

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,879
who's tuning in and i hope you have a

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,800
a good afternoon and had a great

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,080
conference so far so

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,720
um yeah today i really want to talk

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,720
about digital sovereignty which uh

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,159
yeah it kind of follows on uh from what

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,600
dawn has been saying and i think it's

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,080
really touching on a bunch of things

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,240
that many of us have kind of

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,840
been aware of in a lot of ways but i

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,320
think is actually becoming increasingly

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,479
important in 2020 has kind of

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,840
reminded us of the importance of this

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,920
so just a quick bit of outline um

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,439
the first bit my apologies is a little

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,079
bit depressing because we kind of talk

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
about the

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,520
you know the context that we find

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,759
ourselves in these times and

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,560
how that's kind of degraded from what it

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,600
might have been 20 30 years ago

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,880
in terms of freedoms and various things

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,960
and that then kind of leads into this

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,720
idea of the coming digital winter that

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,759
i'll explain a little bit more

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,600
and then i really want to talk about

00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,880
what our role in the open source and

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,079
open hardware community

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,759
is to if we can actually potentially

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,640
even prevent a digital winter from ever

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,119
occurring

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,159
but if it must occur to make it as short

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:05,600
and as shallow

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,759
as possible and for it to be delayed

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,119
as long as we can and then to look

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,160
forward to the next coming digital

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,520
spring

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,520
as we come out the other side of that

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,520
so if we look at the world at the moment

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,480
uh i think it's quite

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,000
apparent to us the the pax americana is

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,640
really starting to fall apart in

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,800
in quite a significant way that the

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,319
undisputed hegemony of the united states

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,239
following world war ii and particularly

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,959
following the end of the cold war

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,360
um has come to an end russia is back as

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,000
a

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,959
a superpower and now china is stepping

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
back up

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,080
again also to be a superpower because of

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,480
course china was the superpower

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,480
for the longest time in history if we go

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,800
back into uh

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,280
you know to the dark ages in europe and

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,280
and going back from there

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,040
and so we don't have the stability that

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,800
a single hegemony brings for better or

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,599
worse whoever's in charge right

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,879
it doesn't matter who the hegemon is uh

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,080
that it tends to lead to a kind of

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,519
stability because they kind of think

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
okay this is how it is it's not being

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,319
contested

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,000
it's not being disputed in any

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,440
significant way on the geopolitical

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,879
scene

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,959
but we've seen that that's no longer the

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,800
case you know china is flexing its

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,159
muscles russia

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,200
is doing so again as well and yeah

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,720
this has led to a world that has become

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,720
unsettled

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,840
and in fact we really we're back into a

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,040
new cold war

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,200
uh you know but we feel this

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,560
particularly here in australia that

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,319
uh you know china and australian

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,200
relations have come to a bit of a low at

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,720
the moment

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,480
over a variety of things and i think

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,159
that really has reached um

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,200
cold war kind of levels hopefully we can

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,799
actually back out of that i think we

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,920
have a good chance

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,440
and of course russia china and the

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,239
united states are all sparring against

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,080
each other

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,879
in different ways um and covert 19 has

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,239
amplified a lot of the existing problems

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,879
that were already in the world

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,400
uh you know the there's poverty and

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,280
inequality and

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,799
uh people living in uh you know really

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,599
untenable and undignified

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,319
conditions uh are now made even more

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,519
vulnerable

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,840
by this and the hollowing out of the

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,720
middle class over the last 20 years

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,840
uh has also really been uh you know

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,680
further driven with

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,280
with covert where you know those who

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,000
have secure employment versus those who

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,959
don't

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,720
are affected in very different ways and

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,280
the risk is that people lose

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,759
hope in the current system and start

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,880
looking

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,960
for other people to come you know for a

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,520
you know a political savior

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,400
uh to to turn their uh you know their

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,919
prospects around and

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,160
we saw in the united states in the past

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,440
four years exactly this coming out the

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,919
hollowing out

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,440
of middle class blue collar america and

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,639
manufacturing and all those sorts of

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,000
things

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,400
um was a direct leading factor into

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,160
the trump phenomenon he was able to use

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,000
that large group of disenfranchised

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,880
people and promise them

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,479
better jobs better prospects and that's

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,320
why a lot of his emphasis was on you

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,000
know stopping companies taking their

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,120
uh their you know their product

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,720
manufacture out of the united states

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,160
because it was exactly this group of

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,800
disenfranchised

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,000
people who had become hopeless who were

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,280
drawn to him

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,120
uh not necessarily because they thought

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,240
that he was uh you know

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,360
an honest and trustworthy man but they

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,520
will have thought to themselves well

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,520
we've tried the alternatives for the

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,080
past 20 30 40 years

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,240
and none of that worked maybe this will

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,280
and that's a very dangerous place

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,400
for a society to reach

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,080
because it leads to these you know

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,000
charismatic leaders who are perceived as

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,560
strong by these people who think that

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,160
they might be a champion for their need

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,600
and it can in recent history actually

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,240
see that this is you know what's led to

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,600
putin

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,000
uh in russia uh and you know

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,400
putin has effectively captured the

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,120
russian democratic system

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,560
um and we saw almost uh the same kind of

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,840
thing happening with trump in the united

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,720
states

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,199
um china is a little bit different uh in

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,479
that

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,880
you know there's a bunch of cultural

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,280
differences that lead and history

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,000
has led to a different kind of approach

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,479
but we still see

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,639
again that their willingness to embrace

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,960
who they see as a strong leader

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,199
to undo the shame that china suffered at

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,960
the hands of colonial powers

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,280
you know over the last 150 years

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,400
know there's this really common thread

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,160
in all of this

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,919
and so this is this junction we find

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,520
ourselves in the world that

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:32,000
all three global superpowers

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,360
are leading away from democracy to

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
whatever extent they had it to begin

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,240
with

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,360
and towards autocratic dictatorial

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,759
uh you know uh you know dominance by

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,720
these kind of you know strong leader

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,720
types as they're viewed

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,280
and this then leads to the the kind of

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,360
expected

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,479
uh results from that that you know truth

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,319
and the freedom of the press

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,840
are victims the interesting twist we've

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,560
actually seen in the united states under

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,160
trump

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,160
was not that the freedom of the press

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,759
itself was actually

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,599
uh greatly diminished but that with

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,360
social media and all of these kind of

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,039
tools that it's really quite possible to

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,880
make these kind of

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,319
echo chamber bubbles in which people

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,560
just won't look at

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,560
alternative views and so they get

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,960
reinforced they believe the lies that

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,400
they're being told by the propagandists

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,400
because they're actually ignoring the

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,319
sources that would tell them otherwise

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,080
whereas in the past you couldn't filter

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,599
out uh you know

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,000
the opinions to have only the ones that

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,280
you agreed with to such the extent

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,800
uh that's now possible um

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,400
but whatever the particular dynamics

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,400
there are parallels

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,000
it seems to me at least in the lead up

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,919
to world war ii

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,360
uh of this you know disenfranchisement

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,479
that you know germany under the treaty

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,639
of ourselves

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,160
uh was greatly impoverished uh that you

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,199
know they were looking for hope for

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,720
freedom from uh you know that

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,000
hopelessness in which they had found

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,360
themselves you know they didn't want to

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,960
think about how to mine gold out of

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,639
seawater anymore

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,560
they wanted to just you know get on with

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,720
life and enjoy

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,919
you know prosperous and relatively free

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,520
lives as

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,680
as we all do this is a very natural

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,520
human response

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,120
and so the loss of prosperity over the

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,479
last 20 years and the loss of hope

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,560
for many people is dangerous in

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,960
making people you know want these kind

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,960
of things

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,879
so freedom of the press uh is vital for

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,080
you know a healthy democracy this is

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,840
frequently said

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,039
but i would actually argue that it's not

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,320
sufficient to safeguard democracy

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,919
in the past it might have been but

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,440
certainly now again we talked about

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,080
these you know echo chambers and things

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,599
that

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,320
this is no longer the case that the

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,160
you know this echo chamber effect uh you

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,560
know can really result in

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,920
extreme polarization and segmentation

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,720
within a country

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,600
uh very much us and their mentality uh

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,040
in a way that just

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,240
in the past wasn't possible to do

00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,279
because you still had to kind of engage

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,560
with your neighbors and

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,120
you know you'd read newspapers that

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,560
would have a variety of opinions because

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,600
it was the one outlet and

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,040
you know you already had the thing there

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,720
and you know you're eating your egg and

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,920
bacon for breakfast and

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,279
you've read the articles that you really

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,240
like and you still kind of then would go

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,839
on and read or at least

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,399
see information that you disagreed with

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,200
and so the loss of that is actually

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,320
really quite

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,360
uh dangerous and so now you know we have

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,959
freedom of the press but anything that

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,760
you don't agree with gets labeled fake

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,600
news

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,959
uh and you know in the united states

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,920
both sides uh

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,399
were guilty of that to varying degrees

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,680
uh

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,839
that you know if you listen to

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,360
any one news outlet you would get a very

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,000
stilted view

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,000
of everything

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,519
so as we said all of this means that

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,120
liberal democracy is now at risk

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,720
so the echo chamber effect in the united

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,920
states led to you know

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,320
a coup d'etat in the united states

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,080
this is you know it was previously

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,880
almost unthinkable

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,800
but again you know you look back at you

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,279
know in the past it's similar kind of

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,120
things

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,519
and we see these kind of parallels you

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,600
know there's the reichstag fire

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,959
uh that was used to seize emergency

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,880
powers uh

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,200
in germany in the lead up to world war

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,959
ii was not very dissimilar to the course

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,959
in the united states

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,480
uh for you know the use of emergency

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,800
powers in the military to you know to

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,680
run

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,760
fair elections uh fortunately the united

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,160
states and the world has escaped that

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,200
uh on this occasion but the fact that it

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,560
came that close

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,640
should be a wake-up call to us uh that

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,200
uh you know these things are democracy

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,040
is actually a fragile beast and needs to

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,839
be cared for and we need to think about

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,079
how changing technology changing

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,360
circumstances

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,399
changes the defenses that we need to

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,800
create

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:58,640
for democracy because if we don't

00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,399
my fear is that you know the democratic

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,320
systems that we enjoy that protect our

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,880
freedoms to the maximum extent that

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,079
uh you know we seem to be able to master

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,600
out of political system it's not perfect

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,240
by any stretch

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,880
but it's less bad than any other that

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,360
now that

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,480
you know a whole country can be driven

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,839
and polarized

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,640
in the way that we saw in the united

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,120
states in the past four years

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,760
i'm not sure that democracy can survive

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,800
those kind of assaults

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,320
you know indefinitely hopefully we look

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,560
forward to four years of

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,600
uh you know relief from that in the

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,360
united states

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,720
uh whether or not you like the policies

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,000
of the two parties this is a separate

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,600
issue from

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,600
whether a group of people are going to

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,240
try and strengthen the democratic

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,240
uh processes so

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,240
yeah how do we protect this going

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,120
forward because

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,519
one of the other really key things that

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,440
uh

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,839
you know history shows us is actually

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,959
that the post-world war

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,800
ii prosperity and freedom enjoyed in

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,560
many places around the world not by in

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,880
all of them by any stretch

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,720
but there was such widespread personal

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,959
freedom and prosperity

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,639
that's led to many good things is an

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,480
aberration in history when you look at

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,680
the dark ages and you had feudal systems

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,440
you look at

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,680
uh you know the roman system and you had

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,079
these massive underclasses of slaves and

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,399
servants and things and so

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,360
you know it is an aberration in history

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,519
that we had

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,399
a long period of relative peace

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,760
prosperity

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:32,079
and freedom it will not continue

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,519
if we take it for granted we have to

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,000
nurture it we have to let it grow we

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,839
have to

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,079
heal its wounds when it when it gets

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,120
wounds

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:44,079
and we have to do what we can

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,680
to prevent what will happen if it fails

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,880
and to deal with that contingency

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,120
because if we don't

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,399
have contingencies for that it's much

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,720
easier in fact

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,720
for these things to happen that you know

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,079
countries have a military force

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,600
um in the best sense actually not to

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,560
attack other military but actually to

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,440
you know to pretend

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,959
protect yeah to prevent other militaries

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,720
from wanting to attack them

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,000
uh you know the swiss stayed neutral in

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,240
world war ii

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,760
not because they said we are neutral

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,279
they stayed neutral because hitler

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,399
couldn't find a way

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,519
to invade switzerland um it was just too

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,720
much work because

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,040
you know switzerland had itself it was

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,200
armed neutrality it wasn't uh

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,560
defenseless neutrality

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,160
because defense's neutrality doesn't

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,440
survive in the modern world as as much

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,519
as that my

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,560
grieve uh perhaps all of us in fact it

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,320
certainly agrees with me that

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,600
it seems to not be possible so where we

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,800
are at the moment i would say that we're

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,079
in this kind of what i would call a

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,839
digital autumn

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,360
the digital summer uh is behind us where

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,320
you know we could start to create these

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,480
things because actually the interesting

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,320
thing is in the summer the early summer

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,839
there's actually not much fruit things

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,040
are growing but you're not harvesting

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,600
very much

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,160
um but the hope the excitement is there

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,560
and the

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,320
you know we work hard and so i would say

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,720
you know the 70s

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,480
uh through to you know 10th century or

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,880
soon after was

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,800
the digital summer and of course when

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,079
the summer ends and the autumn starts

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,120
this is a little bit hard to tell and

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,519
varies

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,959
based on weather not just on climate but

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,199
i would say that we are now firmly in

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,680
the digital winter where

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,199
the digital went to the digital autumn

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,160
there's lots of digital fruit on the

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,279
trees if you like there's all these

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,720
things that we've been able to create

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,199
and it's now really easy to kind of you

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,959
know

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,040
pick the fruit and make a tasty tart we

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,399
can make things out of them

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,040
and that's really great and we can we

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,560
can get our fill from that really easily

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,320
and this is wonderful you know the

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,920
autumn is a great i love this time of

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,079
year in australia as well

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,360
you know even in the summer we have the

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,560
stone fruit and everything come in and

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,399
then later in

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,000
early autumn we get some of the other

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,320
kind of fruit coming in

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,720
uh and and the days are lovely and warm

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,760
still the days are still long enough

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,000
the autumn is a lovely time but the

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:58,240
winter will come

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,440
and when the winter comes then we stop

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,560
you know there's no more fruit on the

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,839
tree this is kind of

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,279
you know the definition of winter you

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,720
save during the summer and the autumn so

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,120
that you have something to eat

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,000
during the winter and so from a

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,480
technological

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,160
and freedom perspective we have to be

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,279
saving away

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,560
the things that will let us uh you know

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,600
preserve

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,880
the benefits and you know to keep us

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,839
healthy and alive when there's nothing

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,000
new can be created when

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,079
censorship uh you know prevents us

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,759
from you know being able to innovate

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,839
freely from making

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,759
sovereign technologies where you know we

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,680
as the users are in control this is what

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,920
digital sovereignty refers to is

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,720
the ability for us to make technologies

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,120
that

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:48,079
are servant to us not to someone else

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,600
and so you know we see in china already

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,000
that the heavy censorship that's going

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,240
on

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,440
means that the chinese people are not

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,680
free to innovate

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,759
to make means of free you know

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,800
unfettered communications

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,560
amongst people there but we may actually

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,160
see much worse effects we actually see

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,240
things like the collapse of

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,079
supply chains or at least their

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,240
subjugation and control so that it's no

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,639
longer possible to actually make

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,079
digitally sovereign hardware uh you know

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,519
at the moment you can get any pcb you

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,440
like made and it's probably not going to

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,519
be backdoored in manufacture

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,440
um that may change or you may have to

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,560
you know to make a new

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,880
you know piece of digital equipment it

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,680
may have to be approved by

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,639
you know a large company or a government

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,519
agency or something

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,800
there's a variety of kind of dystopian

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,079
outcomes

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,600
that are not entirely unrealistic

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,360
as we kind of look at what's already

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,519
happening

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,720
and so you know in this we fear that

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,680
richard stillman's kind of you know

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,320
dystopia

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,839
of control of digital systems will have

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,880
come to pass

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,240
that uh you know the ability for people

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,920
to

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,320
uh you know to have freedom in this

00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,920
will have evaporated uh you know it will

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,959
have fallen from the trees as the fruit

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,199
has and so

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,640
all digital systems in a digital winter

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,520
or very nearly all of them all the ones

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,880
that matter

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,400
will be controlled by some kind of

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,360
dominating powers we know whether that's

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,959
a

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,600
corporate capture of state or whether

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:17,280
it's actually uh political capture

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,679
uh by dictatorships uh or the like

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,520
in all cases the freedom of innovation

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,839
will have curtailed

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,199
and digital you know the dictatorial

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,400
states the dominating powers will be

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,839
able to monitor

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,200
all communications among citizens look

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,160
at what we do with our mobile phones for

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,120
communications is

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,400
the main source if that were being you

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,600
know if encryption were no longer

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,240
possible and if

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,520
you know there were folks monitoring all

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,039
communication in your social network

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,480
graph and all of these things

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,919
in a greater way and in a more

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,360
malevolent way than actually already

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,679
happens today

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,280
it's going to be really hard for society

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,320
to escape

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,520
from that kind of dictatorship because

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,600
you won't even have the tools to

00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:00,320
communicate with one another

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,000
and you know all of the the ai and all

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,480
the algorithms that can already

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,919
you know predict with uncanny accuracy

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,440
uh you know political

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,039
uh dispositions and all those things

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,080
just the fact that you're not using them

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,679
and not being you know uh uh you know

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,120
i mean consumer of these technologies in

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,080
the way that they want will actually

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,039
flag you as a percent potential descent

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,000
so yeah it's as i said the beginning

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,120
part of this talk is a little bit

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,320
depressing in that we're

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,760
talking about these things but it's not

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,600
without hope

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,960
in fact quite the the contrary i am

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,520
optimistic

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,480
that we can in the very least greatly

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,640
delay

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,240
a digital winter from coming and that we

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,960
may even be able to avoid it completely

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,400
and then

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,080
even if we can't avoid it we can

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:48,240
certainly make it less severe

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,280
and to do you know that to its maximum

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,760
extent we need to be

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,960
creating now self-sovereign digital

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,799
systems that are

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,960
able to be under the complete control of

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,559
their creators and their users

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,880
rather than throughout the users rather

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,039
than the creators um

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,400
or in the role of a user i should say a

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,679
user may create something for themselves

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,880
and that's good and fine

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,160
but when they're using it they have to

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,360
be in full control and if someone else

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,200
is using it that other person needs to

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,280
be in full control

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,039
because this will enable us to keep

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,320
tyrannies accountable

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,280
and prevent them even from actually

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,480
emerging in many cases

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,080
what's interesting in this is that we

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,919
actually have to assume that these

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,520
dominating powers will actually be the

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,840
primary adversary

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,600
for the continued uh availability of

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,200
these kinds of systems

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,880
so it means that the systems that are

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,240
created if we want them to survive into

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
a digital winter have to be simple

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,400
enough

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,320
for a single developer to actually

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,760
maintain the security of

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,039
in a really proactive and reliable kind

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,679
of manner

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,039
and the commercial sector is not going

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,640
to fill this role

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,720
the incentives for them are not there to

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,400
do this in fact uh you know

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,919
to make more complicated software that

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,000
is feature-rich rather than secure

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,360
we've known for decades that this is how

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
uh you know this is what makes the most

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,120
commercial sense for companies

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,880
and so uh you know

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,480
it doesn't fall to the commercial sector

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,360
it falls to the open source

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,120
community as in the past creating free

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,559
operating systems and things has

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,400
uh you know to create considerable

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,559
social benefit and

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,440
improved human condition so we need to

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,760
be creating

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,520
simple secure survivable and sustainable

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,440
systems if we want them to work into a

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,840
digital winter

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,080
it has to be simple enough to actually

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,320
be maintainable by a single person

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,679
ideally because in the worst case you

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,280
may have to

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,880
maintain your systems yourself while

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,960
you're trying to communicate with other

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,240
like-minded people

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,919
um you know not to undermine government

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,280
but rather to actually to continue to

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,320
support the freedoms that we have and

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,080
enjoy

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,600
and you know and a government that's

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,400
held to account is always a government

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,320
that will govern

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,559
the most responsibly so we're all about

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,120
strengthening government

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,159
uh you know strengthening not just that

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,480
we have a government but actually that

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,320
the way that they behave is actually

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,240
as strong in the true sense of actually

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,600
being a robust

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,640
and sensible government so yeah it needs

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,240
to be simple enough that we can actually

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,840
maintain

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,679
and if an attacker gets in this will

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,559
inevitably happen you need to be able to

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,400
kick them back out again

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,400
and we have to assume that security

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,000
vulnerabilities will be actively sought

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,080
out and weaponized

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,559
uh to undermine and to monitor dissent

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,200
uh because that's what you know we see

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,480
this in

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,679
in other places i mean even like in

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,720
russia at the moment with the the

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,039
protests around the

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,360
um uh the imprisonment uh of the um

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,640
uh the anti-corruption guy that you know

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,840
the phone and internet are kind of you

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,960
know popping out again in places in

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,840
russia because again this is a really

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,120
effective way to to try and control

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,200
people

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,559
and the other thing that we see of

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,559
course in this and i think

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,320
dawn's talk uh touched on this as well

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,240
is that we actually just can't trust

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,679
modern machines

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,280
and i've spoken about this in previous

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,480
talks so on media.cc.ccc.de the chaos

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,840
computer club site you'll

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,600
find a couple of talks by myself there

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,240
on this topic and also in the lca

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,520
archives

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,799
uh as well and just the mere existence

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,799
that we have things like the intel

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,360
management engine

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,880
actually means that you just can't trust

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,600
these machines because they have a way

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,320
for

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:22,080
things to get in and to persist and to

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,960
hide from you as the user of the

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,440
computer

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,039
that you are not able to touch or to

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,760
deal with

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,320
and in saying that i'm really glad that

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,159
there are

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,840
initiatives to try and you know noble

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,960
the um the management engine and those

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,400
sorts of things

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,760
i don't want to discourage those in any

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,799
way shape or form but i think we would

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,720
be foolish

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,039
to have that as our only approach to

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,400
ensure that we can continue to have

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,200
the means of communications and

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,200
computation should a digital winter come

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,480
and indeed to discourage people from

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,000
attempting to actually bring into force

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,840
a digital winter by making it

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,840
much less feasible to do

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,159
so in this space myself and people that

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,080
i work with

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,600
kind of working on a bunch of things uh

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,840
in this space

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,000
um the mega 65 retro computer that i

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,240
spoke about yesterday

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,679
is partly just because it's really fun

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,120
and it's kind of historically

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:18,559
uh you know of interest but

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,960
for me as a you know you know a

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,280
humanitarian and social innovator the

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,360
fact that it is a computer that has no

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,760
32-bit cpu or anything like that in

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,320
there that can be subverted

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,240
uh you know if you don't connect the

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:36,000
jtag debug interface

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,400
you can't subvert the machine

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,120
and that's actually uh really important

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,799
to me

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,480
and that it's simple enough that you can

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,039
make software that can do use

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,400
you know that can be maintained or that

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,440
you can at least find out how people are

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,880
you know

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,960
subverting it and of course you can

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,919
easily revert the system back to

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,279
uh to its original state as well uh and

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,480
so this is

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,559
quite significant and it's still useful

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,000
enough uh so i think the that last talk

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,400
that i gave at lca

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,919
in 2019 um i actually delivered using an

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,279
earlier prototype with omega 65 we made

00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,120
our own slide software for it

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,880
it's quite funny if you go back and

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,559
watch it

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,159
and then we have the megaphone is

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,440
another one of these initiatives

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:18,080
which is really kind of the mega 65 with

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,600
cellular and other radio communications

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,200
uh channel is built in

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,080
but in a really sandboxed way and again

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,799
encourage you to have a look at the

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,279
talks

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,120
uh particularly the ones on media.cc.de

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,760
if that's of interest to you how we

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,400
have gone about making that uh so that

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
you know

00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,679
instead of having a secure enclave and

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,320
trying to make a trustable computer

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,080
around that

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,840
which you have a secure simple computer

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,360
uh the computer is the enclave

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,039
and we have these exclaves that are

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,480
actually the communications things that

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,480
we don't trust

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,080
and we don't let the cellular modem on

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,279
the same bus and we can depower it and

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,039
physically remove it all these sorts of

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,520
things so

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,799
that's designed to provide secure mobile

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,080
communications and a little bit of

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,200
compute

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,840
and then of course we have the several

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,440
mesh peer-to-peer

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,000
you know ad hoc wireless communication

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,440
system marrying that with the megaphone

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,960
actually lets us create a fully

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,640
sovereign communication system that is

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,640
fully distributed

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,919
again using the uhf radio bays or other

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,080
radio types

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,600
in there or infrared linked

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,320
point-to-point links

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,279
it creates the way for communications to

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,520
continue

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,640
in a fully off-grid manner even if all

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,320
infrastructure is

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,760
disabled monitored or otherwise so i

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,080
mean these things were kind of

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,080
you know i think initially started in uh

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,919
you know disaster mitigation

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,600
uh and really actually this is you know

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,159
what we're still working on is

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,039
uh mitigating natural disasters and

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:40,000
disasters caused by the fail you know

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:42,159
the capture or failure of governments to

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,520
uh you know to protect uh

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,520
the constitutional rights and

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,880
expectations that we have in our various

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,480
countries

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,159
um so yeah that's some of the things

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,240
that we're doing um and

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,760
you know the mega 65 stuff is designed

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,320
to be very simple we've written dollars

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,760
in

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,279
basic uh in a few weeks as an example

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,880
this is much more maintainable than for

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,559
example an android distribution

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,760
or even a linux phone distribution where

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,240
you've got millions and billions of

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,679
lines of code

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,600
so more generally then um

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,440
what do we see the role of the open

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,840
community being

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,279
in these days of the digital autumn and

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,880
i would say above all else

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,480
we should actually just use those days

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,799
wisely

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,799
and create the tools think about where

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,360
the gaps are

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,200
that can help to protect these things

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,640
and help to ensure that people have

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,279
freedom of communications freedom of

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,520
innovation going forward

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,960
um a key i think one thing that perhaps

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,080
we haven't as a cause i think

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,760
what i've just talked about actually we

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,799
already do quite well as a community in

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,240
many ways

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,559
but i think we perhaps need to value

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,200
simplicity and graceful degradation

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,400
uh more than might naturally come to

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,760
mind

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,520
i'm not saying that we're not doing it i

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,360
think we're already doing this in

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,200
all sorts of things but we need to have

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,559
a really conscious thought process about

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,880
saying okay

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,559
what can i make in this that can work

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,279
when there is no internet what can i

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,039
make that is a really simple subset of

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,159
this that can actually be

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,440
much more you know robustly trusted from

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,480
security because we know that the bugs

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,159
will come in

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,240
uh and it would have what you depending

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,799
on what you're making is to

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,279
uh what form and to what extent that's

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,279
possible

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,480
but i would also say as we try and make

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
these things because we're making them

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,320
in

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,880
to make simple systems rather than

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,360
complex systems you do have to lose

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,679
some functionality sometimes or some

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,679
automation of actions in there

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,159
and if we're making simpler computers

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,760
with simpler cpus

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,159
then some things might take a little bit

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,679
longer to to happen as well

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,559
um but it's actually it's quite fun to

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,120
create them

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,159
and actually it's often quite fun uh to

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,600
use them and you kind of often

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,640
rediscovered things from the past as

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,919
well that were fun back then that we

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,679
kind of forgot

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,600
uh you know the simple joy of playing

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,640
solitaire uh that many of us haven't

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,559
forgotten either

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,000
um on the mega 65 when that was

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,240
implemented it was just like yeah

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,520
you know you don't need to necessarily

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,320
always have

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,399
uh crazy complicated games uh multi you

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,480
know massive multiplayer online games

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,679
to have a bit of fun um doesn't mean

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,520
that we might try and make a massive

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,320
multiplayer online game for the mega 65

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,799
as well

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,320
we'll have to think about how we do that

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,159
in a system that's that simple

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,679
uh but again this is the kind of the fun

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,279
of that and the challenge of working

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,640
within constraints

00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:29,200
uh is actually very real

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,000
as well but overall actually want us to

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
be optimistic

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,440
and hopeful i started with the

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,120
depressing bit because i wanted to get

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,120
that out the way

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,480
because as an open source the open

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,600
source community and open hardware

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,240
community

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,279
what we have achieved collectively in

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,799
the past

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,559
you know 50 odd years is simply

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,520
incredible

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,960
you know if we imagine if we took linux

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,960
off the scene

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,399
um we would have windows as a

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,360
proprietary system

00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,440
os x as another proprietary system it

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,360
would be much easier for those operating

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,039
systems to have locked out unauthorized

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,360
developers from making things

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,880
instead because uh you know there are

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,240
alternatives that are

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,159
less locked down that they've had to

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,559
actually be more tolerant

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,600
of third-party developers and that kind

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,000
of thing

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,679
and so we've already achieved great

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,360
victories in ensuring the freedom to

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,720
innovate the freedom to communicate the

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,120
freedom to

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,480
use computers as our servants rather

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,600
than

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,960
as the servants of uh you know

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,360
large vested interests

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,080
there's more to be done absolutely but

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,200
we've already achieved a great deal so

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,840
be optimistic be hopeful we can and are

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,200
making a difference um and encourage and

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,720
support one another again

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,360
as a community i think we already do

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,360
this to a large degree

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,039
but i just encourage us to think again

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,360
more about how we can

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,080
do that more and say hey do you reckon

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,120
that we could

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,480
do you know implement

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,559
you know such and such in you know

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,679
a really simple way that is you know

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,880
fully distributed and

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,559
you know and can stand up to these kind

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,440
of attacks can we reduce the size of

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,120
this

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,640
uh and the complexity while still

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,000
maintaining the vast majority of the

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,240
benefit of that

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,520
um we actually had a coding challenge

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,960
that one of the supporters of the mega

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,480
65 has been running

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,159
it's just still open so if anyone wants

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,640
a really

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,679
fun and slightly addictive challenge the

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,440
challenge is to draw a very simple

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,799
pattern on a commodore 64

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,880
to run the commodore 64 emulator you

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:34,799
don't need any hardware in as few

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,240
bytes as possible and you know

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,840
the first kind of attempts were sort of

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,360
around a couple of hundred bytes

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,039
so it's drawing a spiral that kind of

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,840
goes in around the screen i think the

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,200
smallest

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,480
it is now is like 52 bytes um it's crazy

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,480
but it's just

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,320
uh it's highly addictive to kind of you

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,360
know go through can i save another byte

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,200
somewhere

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,240
um and well we don't necessarily have to

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,799
do that level of insane optimization

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,240
thinking about well in a word processor

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,320
what's actually the 90

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,679
we need or in slide software what's the

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,159
90 uh that we need

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,720
and so this can be uh you know a really

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,880
fun

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,559
uh kind of process uh to be in and we

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,320
can encourage one another to

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,840
to think about how we can make the

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,399
things that we're making

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,760
uh more resilient in the face of uh you

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,760
know digital winter conditions

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,600
so before we go to questions i really

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,799
just want to to finish

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,279
with a little uh exit out of a one of my

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,600
favorite

00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:32,799
uh german songs silver monster silver

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,840
moon is the english translation of the

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,840
band name

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,360
and had this uh song called time for

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,760
optimists

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,679
and it's really they wrote it uh in the

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,159
last couple of years and so

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,919
it's just reflecting on seeing the you

00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,559
know the challenges in the world around

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:48,399
us

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,679
but actually not giving into it actually

00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,640
saying you know what this is actually a

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,760
time where

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,399
optimism hope and you know and moving

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,640
forward is

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,760
actually most needed because it you know

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,360
we feel the need for it the most and so

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,360
you know they sing so every day

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,360
something new to the press

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,120
but i doubt i'm the only one who feels

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,440
that they're gonna bust

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,240
it feels like everything is pointless

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,000
and the world

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:17,840
seems terribly unjust but it's a time

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:22,000
for optimists high time for optimists

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,000
it's time for optimus

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,200
and on that i'd love to hear any

00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:31,360
questions that people have to hear the

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,880
optimism that we as a community have and

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,640
as we wrestle with these kind of

00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,919
uh issues and how to make the world a

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:43,840
better place so

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:43,840
thank you

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,750
i think you're muted uh thank you paul

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,880
um

00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:49,880
[Music]

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,399
i still have the wrong headphones on and

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,320
i'm no no you're fine now sorry

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,760
just at the beginning i think so i can

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,200
hear you fine now

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:05,440
there we go now i'm now i'm on track

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:09,200
thank you paul um for that

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,200
terrifying but

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,840
yeah trying to not be too terrifying

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,640
talk

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,840
um we do have a question coming in

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,760
already

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,919
uh so the question is

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,960
how do we grow communities that are

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,120
interested in

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,120
digital resilience but are also

00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,640
inclusive of the perspectives and needs

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,279
of people who aren't

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,960
computing slash electronics nerds and or

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,360
those who aren't as intensely worried

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,840
about privacy

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,480
wow okay so this is one of the the

00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,159
age-old

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,159
challenges that we face effectively the

00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,200
question is how do we get people to care

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,440
more

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,640
about you know what we see of the you

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,000
know everything that's going on with

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,039
technology and the capture by vested

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,480
interest and all of these sorts of

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,600
things um

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,519
i think one of the things that we can

00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,919
really usefully do at the moment

00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,640
is actually um talk to people about

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,720
what's happened

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,320
you know when 2020 comes up right and

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,519
people talk about you know the attempted

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,240
coup in the united states and all these

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,600
sorts of things

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,600
interesting also whether they're for or

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:10,320
against it is actually uh

00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,679
secondary in this but in both cases they

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,240
actually see

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,919
that you know the resilience of systems

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,800
is actually not as great as we thought

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,000
you know america

00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,839
almost fell to a coup

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,040
and so i think that can be a really

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,560
helpful uh

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,159
point i think just reminding people

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,800
whenever you get creepy ads and stuff on

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,040
things going yeah

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,839
you know why that's coming up uh you

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,520
know and

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,720
just remind them kind of the whole sort

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,720
of boiling frog thing

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,480
yeah it's an ongoing challenge that we

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,000
have

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,000
to to make people aware of these things

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,280
i think in the technology community

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,440
to get people thinking more about

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,919
resilient systems

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,119
is a little bit easier again you have to

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,159
kind of sell

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,359
people the vision one of the things that

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,720
was actually quite interesting with the

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,200
mega 65

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,200
is that we've sold that vision actually

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,720
partly because it's really really fun

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,400
uh you know we've targeted the commodore

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,640
64 community who still

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,480
exists and make games and crazy things

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,480
that seem impossible on an 8-bit machine

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,839
with 64 kilobytes

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,760
and so for them part of the joy is

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,040
actually making these things

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,160
and so even when we made the slide

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,480
software that we used a couple of years

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,240
ago to give the presentation it was so

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,560
much fun for everyone involved and it

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,000
was

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,320
hopefully for for folks that were

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,720
watching um to see something that just

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,160
seemed

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,280
utterly absurd and impossible to achieve

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,760
so i think

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,880
you know yes find the opportunities to

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,960
talk about the things

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,599
you know the things in that we see out

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,200
in society around us that need to be

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,640
uh undermined i think you know some of

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,880
the power grabs that we see

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,800
government doing when we're not watching

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,040
uh like peter dutton trying to get all

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,079
the powers in the world for asia

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,760
i think there are many more people who

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,520
if they think about those things

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,680
actually go hang on this isn't right

00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,720
and so it's yeah just finding those

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,040
points where

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,119
uh it makes sense to people and they can

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,800
comprehend the need

00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,560
because we can't expect people just to

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,280
understand the technical issues

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,280
from the outset

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,079
i think you're muted again or at least i

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,079
can't hear you

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,960
i'm on mute just going through the like

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,680
online conference bingo

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,160
yeah yeah now i've probably filled a row

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,800
on people's bingo cards already

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,280
um the question is have you heard the

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,359
term

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,960
symbiosine and i hope i pronounced that

00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,400
correctly

00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:40,000
no i haven't if someone would like to

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,240
to tell me what it is uh we'll move

00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,680
on to the next question and maybe maybe

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,480
something will come in from the chat

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,200
explaining that later uh the next

00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,359
question

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,320
is megaphone is a terrible search term

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,800
have you considered

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,640
something more unique like mega 65

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,640
phones for seo reasons

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,240
otherwise i just get a lot of portable

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,520
pa systems

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,680
good indeed indeed

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,920
um we would love to have someone come up

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,760
with an even better name than just mega

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,680
65 phone for us

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,880
um you know come join our marketing team

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,079
uh and yeah and join in the fun

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,280
yeah i think that's a call for

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:24,720
contributors question there

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,280
um we've got another question how do we

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,119
encourage

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,480
people to take an interest in these

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,320
issues without scaring them

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,839
and or prevent them from taking measures

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,960
to protect their privacy

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:38,400
because it is too difficult

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:41,280
yeah i'm not sure that

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,800
we actually can rouse a large fraction

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,560
of society

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,240
to these issues without scaring them to

00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,760
some degree

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,640
but i think one of the great strengths

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,160
that we have in the open source

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,400
community is that we

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,880
we have a history of uh and uh of

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,400
seeing where you know the the thing is

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,280
that we're concerned about

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,000
but actually not peddling fear but

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,839
actually peddling

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,920
hope for a better way and so

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:12,240
you know we don't just throw hands at me

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,640
and go oh privacy is terrible on google

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,760
uh search for example you know where

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,000
equipment says hey

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,040
have a look at duckduckgo it does the

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,480
same as

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,480
your favorite search engine that is not

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,720
privacy respecting but you won't get

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,079
creepy ads

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,680
and so i think that is kind of

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,000
the best way is actually to show people

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,800
what the better way is

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,200
uh and talk about you know that better

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,839
space that it brings us into

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,680
uh rather than focusing on the feedback

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,119
because fear is

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,440
it's rarely a good motivator uh

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,040
again we look at you know when these you

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,400
know charismatic despots

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,480
come about actually because they're

00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,880
successful in peddling fear

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,680
uh and you know and peddling that there

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,960
is you know

00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,880
an asana them uh in there so

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,040
yeah you know be positive be optimistic

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,160
be hopeful and you know and point to to

00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,040
the good things and

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,440
let's us in the uh the open source space

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,359
make

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,800
things that are attractive so one of the

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,400
interesting things that gets attraction

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,000
with the the megaphone

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,240
um is actually the fact that it boots in

00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,760
two seconds um

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,040
that you know a phone that you don't

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,359
have to wait three minutes to reboot and

00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,359
you're

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,480
like oh that's really nice and

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,480
interesting

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,599
um and it can have a much longer battery

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,800
life because we can actually put a

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:28,240
battery in that

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,040
we're not quite so cost sensitive about

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,320
because we're not trying to make

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,520
something which is the cheapest phone

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,760
out there

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,119
um so yeah i think you can find these

00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,119
kind of opportunities to

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,400
provide that positive angle and i think

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,839
that's always the best that we can and

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,599
ought to be looking to do with the open

00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:46,560
source community

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,359
it's great um we still have five minutes

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,960
for questions

00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:51,760
oh here we have another one but yes we

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
have

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,400
we probably have time for another

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,599
question or two after this so keep

00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,400
typing them in everyone

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,720
question open source has been popular in

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,119
more disadvantaged areas of the world

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,640
do you see update uptake sorry from

00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,160
heavily populated parts of the world

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,319
with difficult governments is a thing

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,640
that may route around restrictions by

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:14,880
corporations or their own governments

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,520
poor parts of spain and south america

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,040
areas in asia india etc

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,560
okay so one of the really interesting

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,280
things that we experienced with the

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,440
server project over time

00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,640
is that when we had it on the google

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,040
play store if you need to get it back up

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,480
there

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,000
um if there's an android developer who'd

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,040
like to help us with that we'd welcome

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,280
that contribution

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,240
um but we the the install stats would

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,839
actually show us

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,680
where things were going wrong around the

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,520
world we would see a burst of

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,119
installs somewhere and then we would

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,839
hear a few days later about you know

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:43,920
developing

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,960
uh you know political or other issues in

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,960
places so i think

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,800
we actually already see this and the

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,560
challenge with the digital winter

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,319
is we can get to the point where it's no

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,920
longer possible for people to do that if

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,200
this is happening in a widespread enough

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,520
or an effective enough manner with

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,440
internet filtering for example

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,200
and so it's a little bit of a continuum

00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,240
right um

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,119
so you know we do what we can now for

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,520
now and

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,599
going forward and in this kind of

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,839
digital autumn it's possible

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,119
and indeed it will happen that people

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,880
can you know kind of get recruited to

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,560
being aware that this is an issue

00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,400
and start doing what they can whether

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,599
that's you know promoting these things

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,359
in their communities or whether it's

00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,359
contributing to the technologies or both

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:32,880
the next question which i'm sure

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:35,760
is a challenging one do you have

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,560
any good and memorable ideas to answer

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,560
answer the

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,240
unfortunately still very persistent and

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:44,319
widespread argument

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:44,319
why should anyone care about my data

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,839
i i think you can just point to america

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,359
and say

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,040
it doesn't matter which side of the

00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,359
political divide that you might even

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,079
fall in that because i think we need to

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,599
be transcendent of party politics

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,760
completely

00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,599
but that the what's clear is that the

00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,440
breakdown in civil society

00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,280
has actually come about because of the

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,480
formation of these echo chambers and the

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,240
echo chambers

00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,240
come about only because of the deep

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,720
mining of the data of how people use the

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,839
social media and that kind of thing

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,440
the use of our data is being applied to

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:22,800
profit companies

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,839
uh in return for dividing us against one

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,079
another

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,440
uh so even aside from all of the other

00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,160
you know creepy ads and that kind of

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,160
thing

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,920
that our the fabric of our society is

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,680
being torn apart

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,680
by separating us into these echo

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,000
chambers as a result of the use of our

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,000
data

00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,920
that leads into the next question

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,920
what sort of things could we do

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,920
digitally that would make us

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,480
for example australia uh

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,520
i think that i'm not quite sure what

00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,640
that word is meant to be

00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,200
but safe okay

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,400
so again we're looking at the different

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,480
kind of threats

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,000
um i think in australia that we have

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,119
natural disaster as a threat

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,760
and that we need technology they can

00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,359
respond to that um but also i think

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,079
we need to encourage people

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,520
to hold our government more to account

00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,079
because i think they get a bit of a free

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,680
ride at times and particularly

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,079
for me as a personal concern is peter

00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,119
dutton adding new powers to asia

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,960
it doesn't matter whether that he's

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,720
liberal or labor i don't care about that

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,520
but the fact that these powers are being

00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,359
added

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,640
without effective oversight and without

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,040
grandfathering even though they're

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,319
responding to temporary issues

00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,440
um that makes me worried so just

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:44,560
getting the word out um

00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,079
and yeah just

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:48,079
making sure that we have the means to

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,960
communicate and to share when

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,920
governments are doing stupid things to

00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,599
be able to

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,119
share our displeasure you know

00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,359
communicate that back to

00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,280
our politicians as well so that they

00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:01,839
know that people care

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,200
um i think these sorts of things would

00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,680
be quite well i think we have a lot of

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,560
space

00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,480
in australia to have some good technical

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,839
innovations that support the strength of

00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,160
democracy

00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,960
uh while it's still quite strong so you

00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,560
know ways to

00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,760
to remind people that actually you know

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,359
preferential voting means you don't vote

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,680
for one of the two big parties first

00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,960
all of these sorts of things uh or you

00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,880
know having a

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,960
i'd love to see a website that let

00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,960
people collectively say how they think

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,040
the federal budget should be spent

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,000
and then show in aggregate how people's

00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,079
decisions

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,599
would actually look and talk about how

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,800
you know this is all a compromise

00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,240
situation

00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,599
uh with everyone's needs wanting to be

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,640
met you know i might not want to fund

00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,160
something but you might not want to find

00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,079
something that i care about

00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,920
but overall we're actually all getting

00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,680
mostly what we're after

00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,200
so that people have a better

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,920
understanding of uh

00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,200
you know of what democracy is so that

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,200
they don't end up as divided

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,680
unfortunately everyone i think we've run

00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,440
out of time for more questions even

00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,839

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,599
