The partners, UHU Labos Nomades, Wapikoni Mobile, Concordia University, Mailys Flamand and Mauve will re-tell the story of the creation of the Natakanu Project. We will explore how open source, peer to peer architecture and Indigenous leadership has allowed us to claim and create space for Indigenous artists. Building on each other's strengths, the partners created a decentralized sharing platform capable of operating off grid, a common case in Indigenous communities across Canada. The platform is now a place for Indigenous artists to 'visit each other' (Natakanu in Innu) and to continue to challenge relationships with colonial GLAM institutions.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

creation of the natakanu project

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,399
and how open source peer-to-peer

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,719
architecture and

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,000
indigenous leadership has allowed them

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,480
to claim and create

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,719
space for indigenous artists and to

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,879
continue to challenge relationships

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,879
with the colonial glam institutions

00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,880
located in montreal canada

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,280
and i'm in charge of indigenous

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,600
community engagement at the university

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,799
i'm also a member of the euron wendat

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,680
nation

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,600
um today i will be presenting with my

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,000
collaborators our project which

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,640
which is called natakanu but before we

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,560
do so

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,079
i would like to also do a bit of a

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,240
territorial acknowledgement

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,520
um so if you if you could go to the next

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,680
slide please

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,159
so um we would like to acknowledge that

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,880
we're on unseated indigenous lands

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,040
the ghanaian nation is recognized as the

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,439
custodians of the lands and waters on

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,479
which

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,960
we are gathering for us here

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,000
um in montreal today so montreal or

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,840
georgia gay

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,240
is historically known as a gathering

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,079
place for many first nations and today

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,840
it's home to a diverse population of

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,000
indigenous and other peoples

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,000
so we respect the continued connections

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,320
with the past present and future

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,159
and are in our ongoing relationship with

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,600
indigenous and other people within the

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,360
montreal community

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,959
so this is a lan acknowledgement that

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,720
has been produced by concordia

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,360
university by a group called the

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,280
indigenous

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,160
directions in which i'm a member

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,160
um if today so today for our

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,200
presentation

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,800
we will hopefully

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,200
demonstrate how and why institutional

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,360
and community collaboration with the

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,480
help of open and free technologies

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,239
can contribute to decolonization and to

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,440
indigenous cultural sovereignty

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,920
if next night please

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,560
just um we will each introduce ourselves

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,040
before we speak but this is a clip of us

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,720
then a new team and i will now pass it

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,040
on to ariel

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,360
who will talk about the the nataki new

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,360
project

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,040
hi everyone thank you javier for this

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,840
introduction so

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,920
i'm ariel budonabe i'm working at

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,120
wapikoni mobile as a technical

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,840
coordinator for the three past years

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,560
um so yeah i'm here to give you a bit of

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,840
a background

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,159
about natakanu and a little bit more of

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,120
the

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,879
uh of the y behind the project you know

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,680
and the main question i wanted to

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,159
address to give a little bit of a

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,280
kind of a big picture about what what it

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,000
came up about

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,680
is that idea that question that always

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,599
choked me when i was working with first

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,159
nations all around canada

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,799
and and that i want to explore with you

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,799
is is

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,720
why and what are the interests for

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,120
indigenous organizations to

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,440
to use free and open peer-to-peer

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,480
software or technologies

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,120
and i think the main reason be

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,360
that we we use those technologies and in

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,120
the case of netacanu that we went

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,720
through that pipeline of project it

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,879
because those

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,080
as you know those those technologies are

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,200
built on values of

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,920
accessibility transparency and most

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,439
importantly

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,480
ownership and i think that

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:14,959
those values create a space from which

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,720
narrative sovereignty is possible and

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,840
that was very the focus

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:24,320
of our project was creating a space for

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:27,360
narrative sovereignty but in cyberspace

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,280
so for us tech in itself is

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,960
a cultural object you know it's an

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,000
expression of your of your way of

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,040
existing

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,759
and indigenous lead initiatives or

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,000
artists

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,759
should have a possibility to define

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,720
their own way of existing

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,120
in technology or with technology in and

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,240
within cyberspace

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,160
so i think that we went with those

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,720
those technologies and the peer-to-peer

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,560
architecture because it was giving us

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,479
the the space for this narrative

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,759
sovereignty to be possible

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,639
and with those tools we built um

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,160
as i would call it a simple file sharing

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,840
transfer

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,680
app as it is so it's just a space where

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,280
people can connect with each other on

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,720
the peer-to-peer

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,120
on the peer-to-peer web and just

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,160
start a conversation on how they can

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,120
exchange files

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,240
and see what they can do online and

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,479
offline

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,440
so those kind of software let them tell

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,720
their own stories

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,360
cheryl shared their own data and there's

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,240
no one

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,039
else like listening on the other end

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,000
it's always

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,919
peer-to-peer so that's says it all and

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,320
that really respect the

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,520
intellectual property of the people are

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,039
that are using it and

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,800
in indigenous situation this

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,120
this is always and working with

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
institutions that are non-indigenous

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,880
this is always a challenge respecting

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,600
intellectual property

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,000
and that was kind of a center point for

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,800
netacanu it was building a file sharing

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,680
platform

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,080
for people to be able to share what they

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,080
want

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,160
when they want with whom they want and

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,479
having always the full control

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,199
of who's on the other end and who's are

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,319
who are they

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,280
talking to so wapikoni

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,880
is doing that same thing with cinema for

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,280
like 15 years ago so we

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,400
we would we were like let's do that same

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,800
thing but with

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,440
technologies and with digital digital

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,520
media

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,199
so that's a little bit how the the the

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,919
idea of natakanu when

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,840
went about and it was really about

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,479
creating some collaboration with

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,160
other other indigenous initiatives that

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,520
that you're going to see and stefan is

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,560
going to talk a bit more

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,120
about it was creating some

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,840
some dots with them to see if there's

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,120
there

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,440
is there any kind of kind of

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,759
same ground that we can cover with this

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,880
kind of tool where people can just

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,440
share easily uh files within an

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,639
indigenous community or a workshop or

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,560
whatever activities

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,720
they're they're going through as artists

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,840
or organization

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,319
and also in the same same path

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,840
this this initiative that we built also

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,880
addressed the kind of div

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,080
the digital divide or the inequality

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,000
access to infrastructure in general in

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,199
different indigenous communities around

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,599
canada and the world

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,960
the access to internet infrastructure

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,199
computers

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,080
and any kind of material that you can

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,400
build on

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,240
with natakanu the the goal was to be

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,280
able to run that software

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,520
with just like an old cheap router and

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,720
two computers and then you good to go

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,960
you can share you know

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,880
so that was a bit the idea behind the

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,520
project and i'm gonna leave

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,759
genjiv talk a bit more about the role

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,120
the roles of the institution beyond the

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:53,520
this movement of sovereignty and decline

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,680
decolonization thank you ariel

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,879
um so yeah before we start speaking

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,319
about uh

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,319
like the tech aspect of our project um

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,759
i want to just maybe take a bit of a

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,800
step back and touch on

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,520
like the role of institutions and in

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,560
in supporting projects like this so i

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,280
came on board

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,960
at the beginning of the project and as i

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,520
said i worked for a university

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,680
so at concordia we have made a

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,199
commitment to really be like an active

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,520
citizen and be engaged

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,000
in communities and i think that that's

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,960
one like key important element to

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
to to the positionality that i had in

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,680
this project

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,519
um and so for us like

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,399
being a part of community means that

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,519
we're we're opening our doors and and

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,000
and we have dedicated positions uh

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,880
within the university such as as mine

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,399
who

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,720
are there to really support like

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,399
community engage work

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,560
um and we also engage

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,320
like on the on the screen you're seeing

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,440
different ways to be engaged like we

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,240
we do our first financial support or or

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,600
even like just

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,640
our own uh presence to a project

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
um but we try to to engage in in a

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,800
various

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,760
ways and one really important aspect of

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,519
the way that we

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,880
do our engagement in in our institution

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,279
is by always thinking about the process

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,920
of decolonization

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,000
um so we have like committed to really

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,440
address the colonial past of of the

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,320
institution and

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,519
and to address the power imbalances and

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,760
and see how

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,360
we can really value indigenous

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,959
knowledges and methodologies and

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,720
encourage

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,880
projects that are indigenous led and

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,240
really makes space for indigenous

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,440
people at the university so with these

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,240
sort of

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,800
commitments in mind this is like the way

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,360
that i

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,839
have been approaching this project is to

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,680
be an

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,680
active member of this team of like

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,440
really participating in

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,160
in all of the different steps of the

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,320
project and making the resources of the

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,680
university available which means like if

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,480
we need to

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,200
hold an event for to test out the

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,560
platform then we can do so on campus

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,920
and have access to material and

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,560
you know have make sure that the

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,360
partners can really benefit from

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,040
the resources that an institution uh

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,839
like a university have and

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,959
you know a lot of times institutions uh

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,800
like university has

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,440
have a lot of means so i think it's it's

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:34,000
a part of of this too of like

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:37,600
of sharing these resources um

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
and so i think maybe i

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,000
will stop there so i'm losing my my

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,880
my lineup my thoughts um

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,800
but i'll just say that um if you want to

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,519
know more a bit about the way that we

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,360
having been engaging in decolonization

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,800
at the end of the presentation there'll

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,000
be some references

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,320
so you can uh get in touch with me

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,279
and then i will pass it on to my list

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,920
who will tell you

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,160
more specifically about the objectives

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,640
of the platform and the processes behind

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,640
natakin

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,680
hi my name is mailis

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:21,279
i'm from the nation that's kamek and inu

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:25,279
it's uh from manuwan and mastroyats

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:28,399
i also work for neri montreal

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:32,240
as a cultural animator i'm also

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:36,320
a collaborator for this project

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,680
so the objective of the platform

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,640
is a safe space for sharing with your

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,440
peers

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,320
so the platform that spans and

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,920
registrants will be able to share with

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,519
each other in a complete safety

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,360
and you can share any type of data with

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,639
no one listening

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,320
so it means that it can be audio or

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:07,120
video files even jpeg

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:10,639
and pdf if it's illustration project

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:14,320
and the access with or without internet

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,120
because in communities connection can be

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,160
a major

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:22,079
issues and the

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,440
ability to to determine your own circle

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,519
of sharing so it's like a b being part

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,240
of a virtual group

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,000
but with the real people in front of

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,839
their screen

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,040
and the end-to-end encryption

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,320
it means that all that inside the app

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:46,240
is protect and encrypt to

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,519
reinforce the idea to the for

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,720
a safe space and the

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,600
solution to the inequal access to

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,160
internet computers materials for

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,600
indigenous communities

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,480
so the platform is created for that

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,440
so i will let micro legal move to

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,880
explain the creation of the platform

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,839
uh the tech stuff but but first before

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,320
uh

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,320
i will talk about the visual aspect

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:24,160
so the visual aspect of the

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,880
software of the platform we find a

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,920
cool color palette with a little touch

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,600
of

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,760
warm color if we look at the beige color

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,200
so we want the color to represent the

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,199
nature

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:42,240
and then environment side that we find

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:45,120
very well in your communities

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,079
so if we think of the cans in the forest

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,440
and

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,519
the prospector tents so i wanted the

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,120
platform to represent the

00:13:51,519 --> 00:14:03,839
young indigenous people from each nation

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:03,839
and also elders

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,040
[Music]

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,079
thank you miles so as we said we wanted

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,639
to talk a bit

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,079
about how the tech behind the natakana

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,120
app works

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,880
so given our objectives we went with an

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,639
architecture that would keep data

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,959
locally and would share it directly

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,399
between peers

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,000
so what that is called these days is

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,440
local first software and it looks

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,920
something like this

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,360
so over here we have uh three cool

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,079
friends that want to connect to each

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,040
other

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,560
and as you can see there's no central uh

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,720
place that they're connecting through

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,320
they're all exchanging data directly

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,560
with each other

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,399
um the same way that we would exchange

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,839
our oral histories or

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,959
information from person to person

00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:00,320
as well what's interesting is that if

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:02,079
one of the emojis say goes to sleep

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,000
and isn't available anymore the

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,800
conversation can keep going without

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,079
having to

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,120
um have any downtime and

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,000
as well we can see this uh nerd emoji

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,839
down here

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
oh uh they're not even connected to

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,240
anyone but it doesn't matter because

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,040
everything works locally first on their

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,040
network

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,639
it works offline and if somebody has a

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,480
copy of some information

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,839
that's available to them regardless of

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,040
whether uh

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:34,560
the peer that actually created that um

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:38,639
information is online or not um

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:42,720
oops my slides messed up

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:46,160
oh no technical issues

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,320
gotta love them um

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,639
all right sorry about that so this is

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,880
also in contrast to kind of the standard

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,000
for software out there using the cloud

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,560
or centralized systems so generally

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,680
in these systems all your interactions

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,320
are mediated through

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,920
some sort of server on the internet if

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,800
you want to connect to anybody

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,600
you need to go through a server that's

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,519
probably somewhere in the u.s

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,279
and that means that the company that

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,240
runs the service effectively

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,199
controls all of your data and its uptime

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,959
is what actually

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,240
determines whether your data is

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,880
available or not

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,920
so say that cloud is unavailable for

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,160
some reason

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,160
so for instance either their servers are

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,000
shut down or you don't have access to

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,040
internet or anything else

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,519
um everybody is kind of out of luck they

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,279
can't

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,720
connect to each other even though

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,560
they're both right there

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,720
so with the peer-to-peer foundations in

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,680
natacano we can be more resilient to

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,040
these sort of failure cases while also

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,600
providing users with

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,639
more privacy since by default the only

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,279
ones that can

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,399
access data is themselves and only the

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,320
people that they connect to

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,040
directly so one other thing about the

00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,720
technology

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,959
that i really enjoyed was the actual

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,720
process of developing it

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,000
so we went through cycles where we'd

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,039
start about talking about

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,039
what we wanted um and having my

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,480
colleagues in montreal kind of like

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,000
set the path of what was actually needed

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,720
thinking about how we can actually

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,400
implement what was necessary

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,199
sitting down and coding thing and then

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,360
kind of verifying with everyone that

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,120
stuff was working and getting feedback

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,760
so this really helped validate some

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,160
ideas

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,480
and really helped see where things were

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,360
too complicated or where things could be

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,640
simplified

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,520
early on so with kind of the end result

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,320
of our project

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,840
was i you only needed like three clicks

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,360
to create an account

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,360
create a folder to share your

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,720
information put some data and then

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
someone could just see it on another

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,039
computer

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,640
without having any sort of account

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,000
management without having to set up

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,799
third party

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,360
service providers or password backups or

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,440
anything

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,960
uh just kind of like set it up and have

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,039
it work for everyone

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,000
so this is possible thanks to open

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,440
source tools like

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,240
the electron javascript framework for

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,440
building the

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,400
actual user interface and

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,320
github for tracking the history of the

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,880
software and collaborating with people

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,760
amongst the team and as well existing

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,080
open source

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,919
protocols specifically we use the

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,440
hypercore protocol for the actual

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,679
peer-to-peer connections

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,440
which kind of let us build on existing

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,559
foundations that worked

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,520
with uh what we wanted to do so

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,039
um one of the other advantages was this

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,919
is a case where

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,280
um the indigenous community has an

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,520
actual need where

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,440
having things being more local having

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,160
things be in the control of the actual

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,720
people

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,000
creating data um that's an actual use

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,840
case that people need and

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,039
peer-to-peer and local first tech

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,360
happens to

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,440
be in a position where that's exactly

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,720
what it delivers by default and in fact

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,720
it makes it hard

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,480
to not do that when you kind of build

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,799
your foundations on local first

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,120
and connecting people directly to each

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,039
other it's a lot harder for someone to

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,559
aggregate all of the data in one place

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,400
or kind of

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,160
prevent people from being in control of

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,039
their own communities

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,440
um so with that in mind um stefan is

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,720
going to

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,960
talk about what this actually meant

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,520
in practice after we had the app in

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:28,240
people's hands

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,240
thank you move uh

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,960
uh hi everyone i'm stefan nepton from uh

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,919
inu abinaki nation and co-founder with

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,039
my partner

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,039
andrea gonzalez

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,000
um in this topic i will explain

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,120
uh the importance and the the reason why

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,240
we created the netacanu platform project

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,120
for uh democratizing and decolonizing

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,080
the first nation

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,000
art with open source tool made by

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,520
aboriginal artists for

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,520
aboriginal artists

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,440
is an aboriginal initiative whose vision

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,240
is to support the

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,360
academic perseverance of first nation

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,480
youth by digital art workshop

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,000
we propose to create an essential bridge

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,480
between the elders

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,280
and the present generation and between

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,480
the land

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,240
and the community true art workshop

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:35,360
for decolonizing aboriginal heart

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:39,200
second slide please

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:42,480
project matakan the mexican site

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,120
is an uh an atacama nation

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,679
international intel generational

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:50,400
cultural transmission camp

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,200
the site is about one hour from mana one

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,640
community

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,720
really deep in the land accessible only

00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,799
only by boat we were invited to give a

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,240
digital workshop

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:07,440
in a place where there's no electricity

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,120
uh only a few hours a day by solar panel

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:14,240
and no no no network no wi-fi we

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,520
use only uh our cell phone camera

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,799
and a freeware for uh our activities

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,330
uh it was a challenge i can see

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,880
i can't say that um

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,880
[Music]

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,480
in this week we made some great

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,960
workshops such as

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,720
digital photography photograph

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,159
photography

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,960
light painting and we experimented a

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,960
verimetric video capture with an old

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,600
xbox kinect camera

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:46,720
during an elder speech about the

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:50,559
territory and his secret

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,559
a second slide please

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,799
but the main workshop we gave was the

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,679
photogrammetry of

00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:02,880
mini canoe we made with birch bark

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:06,240
we learned first how to get the resource

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,799
in the wood we bring hull uh what we

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,919
need

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:14,240
and the elders uh show us how

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,240
in the past we made the real canoe

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:21,120
we made a mini version of the real one

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:24,640
and after that we made a photogrammetry

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,120
of the object we just created

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,919
the photogrammetry is a technique for

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,240
creating

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,799
3d digital object from picture

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,840
so we took a bunch of picture of the

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,120
canoe

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,080
from all is angle and with the help from

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,120
the

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,600
artificial intelligence from a freeware

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:47,440
called

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,880
zephyr 3df we create um

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,440
a digital canoe so you can you can see

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,650
it on

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,880
on the slide

00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,600
[Music]

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,520
this 3d object was integrated into a

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,120
video game environment but

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:06,880
anyway this 3d asset can

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:11,039
can use can be used for a movie

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:14,880
augmented reality uh virtual reality

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:17,120
uh any digital project this workshop

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,640
with this workshop is specially symbolic

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,760
for mergium context

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,400
we can digitally reappropriate our

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,080
cultural

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:29,919
object by photogrammetry

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:33,600
um next slide please

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,200
the netacanu project is a response to a

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,919
real problem

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,960
that we had during our workshop in the

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,080
land

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,279
where connecting connectivity and the

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,320
internet was

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:49,200
inaccessible uh is

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,080
an incredible technological advance that

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,679
hallow heart

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:57,360
to be shared between aboriginal artists

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:59,600
it leads to decolonization enchantment

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,320
and protection of the heritage of the

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,320
first people

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,880
in the future uh in the future we would

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,919
like to

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,240
facilitate uh sharing a bigger project

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,760
for

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:18,960
more specific asset format by example

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:21,120
uh for volumetric filming and 3d assets

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,559
we would like to be able to preview 3d

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,320
mesh into the platform

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,000
like sketchfab eventually

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,080
we would like to have a communication

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,360
space by chatting or video

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,640
and finally uh why not having uh our own

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,679
space for

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,400
displaying art piece uh from the creator

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,919
directly

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,919
uh from the platform

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:49,360
so um so that's it for me uh

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,559
thank you very much uh i appreciate a

00:24:49,360 --> 00:25:01,840
lot and

00:24:50,559 --> 00:25:01,840
ariel is your turn

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,720
oh um arielle sorry to interrupt but

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,720
you're muted

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:40,080
my gosh sorry about that everyone

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,520
okay so i was saying thank you thank you

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,720
really much stefan

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,799
um for uh giving us the the the real

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,880
kind of implementation on the ground of

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,679
the software of natakanu

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,679
and as i was saying when i was muted is

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,799
that it's really cool to see that

00:25:53,679 --> 00:26:00,880
one kind of initiative kind of bring

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,880
brought to the table different partners

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,000
the concordia university might islama as

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,120
an artist and as a design

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,600
web designer move and we

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,520
this group really came about with this

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,640
this idea of collaboration

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,600
and we we were really kind of focused on

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,840
on that and we

00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,720
we were able to to have a software that

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,480
was kind of going through

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,080
through those goals and making it easier

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,600
for our activities

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,600
on the land and we can now say that this

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,039
software and this open source

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,919
peer-to-peer protocols

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,600
have really helped us doing our way with

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,600
art with our workshops

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,640
and everything and there's kind of so

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,840
much thing that

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,720
now we can see that we can do with those

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:51,120
same kind of kind of tools so those same

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,120
technologies so stefan talk

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,279
really about what what what he

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,520
envisioned that we can do with this

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,720
and there's so much more things that we

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,480
can do so

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,480
and one of the first that we were

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,159
thinking of the bat and also

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,440
like speaking just before that about is

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,200
that making

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,760
the making this tool and the

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,320
peer-to-peer web just easier for people

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,840
to kind of be able to play around with

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,080
you know just having a way

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,120
a door to enter with it and just be able

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,000
to tweak

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,600
something and do do some practical

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,679
coding and practical stuff

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,799
with something that is already existing

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,960
within the same

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,080
within the same mind frame of connecting

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,559
people directly

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,000
within one of each other and being kind

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,480
of direct contact but

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,640
there's so much more than just a file

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,600
transfer application that we can do with

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,559
this there's

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,200
and really what we want is give those

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,279
primitive

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,480
those tech primitive to people so they

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,880
can find

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,919
what they want to build with because

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,960
that's really

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,520
really really the question and after

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,799
that we can also look up to local mesh

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,080
network you know so

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,320
we can also see if there's a way to

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,360
bridge those two technologies and

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,840
not just be within a local

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,559
approach but also a local in the way we

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,679
built

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,840
the actual network and that could

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,799
enable people to have their own workshop

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,200
for people to

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,520
to make their their own first local

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,039
first thing as i was saying

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,840
and we will now want to like work with

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,640
different other indigenous organizations

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,360
to see

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,320
if this platform can fit other needs you

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,600
know is

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,480
is there anything in the gaming industry

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,760
in the uh video film production as what

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,640
pikoni is

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,679
uh for us there are really a lot a lot

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,720
more things that

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:48,240
that we can do and we're just now open

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,039
for for seeing what's what's the future

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,399
