The partners, UHU Labos Nomades, Wapikoni Mobile, Concordia University, Mailys Flamand and Mauve will re-tell the story of the creation of the Natakanu Project. We will explore how open source, peer to peer architecture and Indigenous leadership has allowed us to claim and create space for Indigenous artists. Building on each other's strengths, the partners created a decentralized sharing platform capable of operating off grid, a common case in Indigenous communities across Canada. The platform is now a place for Indigenous artists to 'visit each other' (Natakanu in Innu) and to continue to challenge relationships with colonial GLAM institutions.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
