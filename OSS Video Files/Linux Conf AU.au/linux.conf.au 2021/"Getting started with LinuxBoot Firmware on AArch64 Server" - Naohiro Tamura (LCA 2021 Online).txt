LinuxBoot is one of implementations of Open Systems Firmware (OSF) in Open Compute Project.
The primary goal of OSF is to increase security in Mega Datacenter by making use of Linux as firmware instead of vendor proprietary's.

LinuxBoot consists of Linux Kernel and Initramfs and it can be based on either UEFI PEI, coreboot, U-boot, or Slim Bootloader at this moment.
Linux Kernel requires patch in some cases, and Initramfs can be chosen from either u-root or heads.

If we try LinuxBoot on AArch64 Server defined in ARM SBBR spec, it won't be simple to make Final OS boot from LinuxBoot flashrom since LinuxBoot document is far behind source code and AArch64 implementation is far behind x86_64 as of writing.

This talk discusses LinuxBoot overview, demonstrates to boot CentOS AArch64 from LinuxBoot flashrom in QEMU on x86_64, and finally reveals the biggest and AArch64 peculiar issue we need to solve, that is kernel decompression issue x86_64 doesn't have.

Attendees will get familiar with how to:
- create AArch64 OVMF 32MB Firmware File System
- configure LinuxBoot Kernel and Initramfs
- inject LinuxBoot into AArch64 64MB flashrom
- boot Final OS from local disk
- debug LinuxBoot AArch64 Kernel using QEMU and GDB on x86_64

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
