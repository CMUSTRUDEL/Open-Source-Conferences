So you've started a new community. This could be anything from a new open source project you've started to develop, or a meetup group you're trying to form for people in your local area who are interested in the same sort of things as you. You want others to participate in this community; humans are social creatures, after all. In order for this to be a safe and inclusive community, though, you'll need to have some guidelines on how people should interact, what behaviours are acceptable, and how disputes and conflicts are resolved. The start of this process should be a code of conduct, paired with an incident response procedure. This talk will explain how critically important these things are to maintaining your community, and how to go about implementing them.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

peoples today

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,520
so my background is actually as a linux

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,040
systems admin

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,560
but i spent quite a lot of time as a

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,040
community organizer

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,600
and in that capacity i've written and

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,520
you know

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,119
worked on and modified codes of conduct

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,280
for several organizations

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,200
i've spent two years on the linuxconf

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,799
australia safety team

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,200
uh it's been a bunch of time researching

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,439
diversity inclusion and communication

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,560
um i'm not a lawyer though um so please

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,240
don't take any of this as

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,119
legal advice um so this is a quick

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,720
overview of what we're going to be

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,759
covering today um we're going to go

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,720
through the purposes of a code of

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,760
conduct

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,560
how to apply it um how to respond to

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,480
incidents

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
and we're going to review a code of

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,879
conduct how to you know get an

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,800
idea of how ideal it is um

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,480
so the professional accountants in

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,520
business committee defines a code of

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,319
conduct as

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,319
principles values standards or rules of

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,000
behavior that guide the decisions

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,400
procedures and systems of an

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,080
organization in a way that a

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,160
contributes to the welfare of its key

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,280
stakeholders and b respects the rights

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,720
of all constituents

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,280
affected by its operations um so codes

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,280
of conduct

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,720
are especially important for new people

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,400
in the community

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,680
and marginalized and underrepresented

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,120
community members such as

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,920
underrepresented genders

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,200
or sexualities abilities races and

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,599
religions

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,879
um codes of conduct need to apply to

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,879
everyone within your compute

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,640
your community um if they don't apply

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,920
equal equally to everyone then they're

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,000
not going to do their job and they're

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,200
going to create a power imbalance

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,800
so when you're if you're developing a

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,319
code of conduct you have to your

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,560
community leadership has to be on board

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,560
with it

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,959
so what do you put in a code of conduct

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,879
um the idea the ideal things to have in

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,959
your code of conduct are

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,480
what is this code of conduct for you

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,920
know like

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,760
what is that what is our intent with

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,319
having a code of conduct

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,799
um where does this code of conduct apply

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,480
does it

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,159
you know does it apply to if we're

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,680
having an in-person event does it only

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,680
apply to the event itself

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,840
does it apply to the online spaces

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:46,000
surrounding the event such as

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,000
um chat rooms mailing lists

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,080
or you know use of you know

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,519
communication between

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,000
attendees on twitter so defining that

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,200
scope

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,560
is important you should include

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,920
what is defined as unacceptable behavior

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,200
according to your code of conduct so

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,120
people know

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,480
have a clear guideline of like this is

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,760
not um

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,760
this is unacceptable within this

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,280
community um

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,519
and you should include consequences of

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,160
you know violation of of those

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,880
um behaviors so how are you going to

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,199
respond

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,600
to to those kinds of you know violations

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,360
um and you know what different

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,400
severities are there

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,360
um you should also uh

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,960
include information on how and to whom

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,680
incidents should be reported

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,720
and this should be you know it ideally

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,520
it makes sense to have

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,479
a reasonable detail about this process

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,000
um

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,520
including what kind of information might

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,240
need to be included so having a template

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,080
for that

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,919
um it would be ideal um

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,680
you should also list who is going to be

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,160
handling reports and this

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,880
ideally should include individual names

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,840
for

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,520
the people who are doing that um this

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,960
can help to ensure that

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,960
um people might trust certain people

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,479
on your the committee of people who is

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
organizing the code of conduct people

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,880
might trust

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,320
some people over others or there might

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
be one of the people on that team who

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,280
has actually

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,039
been involved in an incident and you

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,919
need to and people need to know you know

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,919
that that is the case

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,360
um so you also ideally you should be

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,479
making a commitment to take reports

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,800
seriously

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:33,520
um and to recuse members who have

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,120
uh people who are handling any incidents

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,320
um that may have a conflict of interest

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,600
so somebody who might be

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,360
the partner of the person who is

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,560
reporting the incident or

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,800
you know one of the people who was being

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,360
accused of something or whatever

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,800
um just being you know being aware of of

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
how that kind of stuff might play out

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,840
and

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,280
you know it may not be an issue but it

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,000
may be a perceived issue so

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,039
potentially keeping those people out of

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,400
the decision process

00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,319
would be best it also

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,199
makes sense to include emergency contact

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,840
details for emergency services

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,080
for wherever you are um if you look at

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,759
the um the way the linux australia code

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,080
of conduct has been presented

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,120
uh for the past two days you can see

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,520
that you know

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,280
it also included emergency services

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,720
information for

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,479
places all around the world so that's

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,080
you know that's a really great way of

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,080
just reminding people of that

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,240
information um

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,759
and any related documents that might be

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,280
similar to your code of conduct that

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,080
might kind of be adjacent to it

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,000
for example um here is the etiquette to

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,319
use on our mailing list and here is you

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,720
know

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,479
how best to reach out to other attendees

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,160
if you'd like to make contact with them

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,280
that should not be necessarily within

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,199
your code of conduct because you want to

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,240
kind of keep it fairly decluttered and

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,240
easy to read

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,919
but it is totally fine to link to that

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,199
information from your code of conduct if

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,199
you think it's sufficiently related

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:59,120
so how does a code of conduct work um

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,199
a code of conduct works by education

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,720
which describes the expected standards

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,319
of behavior

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,000
norm following which is a kind of peer

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,440
pressure based on other people's

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
behavior to ensure that

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,639
you know people are exhibiting the

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,400
behavior that you want to see and

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,840
other people can see it being exhibited

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,800
and are therefore more likely to follow

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,960
it

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,960
um attraction and repulsion which is to

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,199
say that people will self-select

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,120
into or out of your community based on

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,759
your code of conduct if somebody

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,560
is interested in joining your community

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,960
and

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,840
one of part of your processes include

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,360
showing

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,039
them the code of conduct before they

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,759
join they might look at it and say oh

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,039
actually

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,400
i don't feel comfortable adhering to

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,919
this code of conduct or i don't trust

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,599
this code of conduct or whatever

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,039
and they will just not join your

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,240
community in the first place and then

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,440
you know you've got a whole lot of

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,160
problems that you don't have to deal

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,599
with

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:51,280
with a mismatching expectations and um

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,759
and desires deterrence

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,400
is another um another feature which

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,360
creates

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,000
consequences for unacceptable behavior

00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,919
and boundary

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,440
setting which keeps unsafe people

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,800
outside of the community for example if

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,400
they behave unacceptably

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,639
and you need to exclude somebody from

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,599
your community to keep the rest of your

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,039
your um community safe um you know

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,840
that's a reasonable boundary for you to

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,840
try and set

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,440
the paradox of tolerance states that a

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,560
tolerant society must be tolerant of

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,440
everything except

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,960
intolerance itself and this is something

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,520
to keep in mind

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,960
when um crafting a code of conduct

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,560
because

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,719
while ideally we want to be able to be

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,440
tolerant of all of all things

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,279
um that also means that we're intolerant

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,200
of things that are harmful to people

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,159
so um if a community tolerates

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,399
intolerance

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,279
it will eventually be taken over by the

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,000
the intolerant

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:51,920
so applying a code of conduct helps to

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,920
protect a tolerant community from that

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,000
destruction

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:59,440
[Music]

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,040
so a code of conduct does have limits um

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,720
it cannot punish wrongdoing um

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,560
because you code of conducts are not law

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,240
and the communities in which we are

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,000
trying to apply them are not equivalent

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,240
to wider society

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,240
um that is a whole different scope to

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,600
a law for or you know in a you know

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,160
in a state or country or whatever um

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,760
so the only thing that a code of conduct

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,800
can do insofar as punishment is

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,959
excluding

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,399
harmful people from the community um

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,120
anything that you know might be

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,440
considered illegal needs to be deferred

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,399
to

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,120
law enforcement and handled outside of

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,880
that scope

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,560
um your volunteers or people who are

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,240
put implementing your code of conduct do

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,440
not have necessarily have

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,920
the training or the time um to

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,600
commit to that kind of you know that

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,800
kind of work

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,720
um further uh code of conduct can't

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,240
really implement transformative or

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,959
restorative justice

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,200
um that's best suited for a society

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,560
where exclusion from that society would

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,200
harm both an individual

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,079
and the society um because of the

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,839
difference between

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,200
society as a whole and any given

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,839
community that a code of conduct is

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,160
applied

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,680
applied to transformative and

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,720
restorative justice aren't necessarily

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,399
going to work in that

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,680
environment they cannot

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,839
protect communities from external harm

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,440
again that requires a lot of training

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,200
and a lot of effort

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,120
um and it's not a thing that is

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
necessarily worth you putting that time

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,680
in for you know

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,200
setting boundaries on what your code of

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,079
conduct is capable of doing is important

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,600
so that you don't burn out your

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,200
volunteers or your members who are

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,680
dealing with the code of conduct

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,720
um so keep it so that it only works

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,720
within your community

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,839
um codes of conduct can't mediate um

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,760
the trouble with mediation is that it

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,920
changes the question

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,120
what do we do about this harmful person

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,040
to oh well

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,640
let's try and help these two people get

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,160
along because they're not getting along

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,519
and if we can't help them getting along

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,360
oh well you know it's just a conflict

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,040
between two people it's not indicative

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,640
of a problem within our community

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,120
um and that means that

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,279
you're not keeping the rest of the

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,040
community safe

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,120
and finally codes of conduct cannot

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,360
force apologies or forgiveness

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,160
um these things only work if they are

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,480
voluntary

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,839
sincere and demonstrate an understanding

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,160
of wrongdoing and a commitment to

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,040
to improve you can't you know i i've

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,120
seen people

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,560
particularly talking to children say oh

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,320
say sorry for that thing that you have

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,600
just done to that person

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:44,720
but if it's not you know if it's not

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
sincere then it's kind of empty um and

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,440
so

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,800
we need to leave that kind of stuff to

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,800
to people to volunteer to do

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,240
so a quick summary

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,839
codes of conduct both protect and apply

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,160
to all members of community

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,040
um they should list goals unacceptable

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,519
behaviors

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,880
consequences and um reporting

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,200
instructions or process as well as

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,760
related documents

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
they work via education non-following

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,480
attraction and repulsion

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,480
deterrence and boundary setting

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,880
tolerating intolerance will lead to

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,760
badness

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,800
and codes of conduct cannot be easily

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,880
used to punish

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,720
and act justice operate outside the

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,880
community or force apologies or

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,680
forgiveness

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,880
so how do we apply a code of conduct i

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,880
have a really dry throat

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,560
okay so when it comes to applying a code

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,839
of conduct

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,519
the first thing that makes sense to do

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,560
is to publish it after you've written it

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,040
that is

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,240
um ideally it should be the first one of

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,720
the first things that your community

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,079
members

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:56,240
see um this

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:58,560
makes it easy for you to

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,360
uh say you know if somebody does behave

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,839
you know in a way

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,560
that is contrary to your code of conduct

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,839
it's easy

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,600
easy for you to be able to say hey you

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,320
agreed to this when you signed up

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,519
so we're not going to accept the excuse

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,480
that you didn't know this was

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,160
unacceptable behavior

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,160
so ideally it should be easy to find it

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,800
should be maybe on the top level

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,880
website menu or linked from the footers

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,480
of emailing lists

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,560
if you've got a physical event posting

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,959
it on posters around the venue or links

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,639
to it

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,399
at least and referencing it as a

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:35,360
required reading for community signup

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:37,200
forms is also useful

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,639
um when it comes to actually putting

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,639
your code of conduct into practice

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,279
it makes sense to have a code of conduct

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,839
committee or a safety team

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,320
um so this team responds to incident

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,880
reports

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,639
this team needs to be supported by the

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,519
community leadership

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,040
and not overruled by leadership except

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,040
in very rare circumstances

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,800
and for the most part the leadership

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,160
should be able to trust the conduct

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,079
committee to do their job

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,000
and not step in and take over um

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,760
ideally a safety team should be

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,880
hand-picked

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,079
and like specifying specific people and

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,279
saying hey would you be interested in

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,959
doing this thing

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,480
um because if you don't explicitly

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,160
choose people often

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,519
this responsibility falls back to

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,199
marginalized members

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,800
who have been oppressed who have dealt

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,839
with issues that

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,440
they want to prevent happening in future

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,959
and so they're going to step up to make

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,480
the community better for themselves but

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,480
they don't necessarily have as much

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,240
energy to do that as people who

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,480
aren't dealing with with that oppression

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,160
or marginalization

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,600
um so as i said in previous slides uh

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,090
also the code of conduct committee

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,320
should be listed um

00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,320
[Music]

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,120
in reporting instructions so that people

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,720
know who will be handling their report

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,399
um and it should be usually a handful of

00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,920
people on the team

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,240
um some recommendations that i've seen

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,320
are to have between three and six people

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,199
um and replacing them with an overlap

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,199
such that you might you know have

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,480
people placed replaced every six months

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,040
but only replace

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,519
half of the team that way you've got

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,000
that

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,040
that knowledge that is being passed on

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,880
rather than just

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,320
starting a clean slate and not having

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,600
people who are aware of what's happened

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,600
in the past six to 12 months

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,600
and ideally a committee of this type

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,920
should be

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,720
a diverse group of people which should

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,800
include

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,759
marginalized folks who are familiar with

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,880
oppression

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,600
um but are also supported by

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,519
outspoken people who are likely to take

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,759
reports seriously and follow through

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,279
and respected community members which

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,160
will increase the chances the community

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,759
will accept

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,759
any decisions that the committee makes

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,279
so when it comes to communicating

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,880
between within the community

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,920
um and within the committee uh committee

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,040
communication um ideally should be done

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,199
via a

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,800
an efficient channel such as instant

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,639
messaging

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,839
this is particularly relevant for

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,360
in-person events

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,160
uh or events that are happening over a

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,959
weekend like this online conference

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,320
um to deal with stuff that pops up

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,560
urgently

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,160
um ideally it makes sense to also tran

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,360
um trade contact details

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,880
of people within the within the

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,759
committee so that they can contact each

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,040
other outside

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,199
of that chat if necessary um

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,639
it's worth thinking about who will

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,600
communicate

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,680
um code of conduct committee decisions

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,759
to the rest of the community

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,279
um and who will review these kinds of

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,000
updates so are you going to delegate a

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,320
chairperson

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,240
of your code of conduct committee who is

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,040
the spokesperson

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,240
um and who will you know send emails out

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,639
to the mailing list and say hey we've

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,920
had an

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,160
incident and this is what we've done

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,959
about it um and are you going to have

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,639
somebody who

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,240
sits behind them and just double checks

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,399
that what they're sending out is

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,160
makes sense um and how are you going to

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,680
sign off those updates you know are you

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,520
going to sign them off as

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,199
you know the code of conduct committee

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,959
or as the

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,120
you know the organizing committee of the

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,919
event thinking carefully about that kind

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,919
of stuff is important

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,360
um inevitably if you have to make

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,760
decisions as a code of conduct committee

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,799
um and announce them

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,760
um some people are going to

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,520
disagree with those decisions and it's

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,520
worth keeping in mind that

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,880
in most communities there are some

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,039
members who have got

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,960
nothing better to do than to argue and

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,600
to like pick apart

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,400
um the decisions that people have made

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,360
um

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,000
and you know it's worth remembering that

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,600
everything is

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,600
better in height you know everything is

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,520
20 20 in hindsight

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,960
and the committee needs to think about

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,120
their decisions but also

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,799
for the most part should be able to

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,280
stand by them

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,320
and you don't necessarily have a lot of

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,320
time

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,000
and effort available to go and argue

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,360
with people who have disagreed with your

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,640
decision

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,039
um so entering dialogue about decisions

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,039
also dilutes their resolution um and it

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,720
can cause stress and exasperation and it

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,280
could cause you to make mistakes

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,080
um if you're discussing the resolution

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,160
of

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,039
an incident over email on a mailing list

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,320
for example you might end up

00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,760
accidentally sharing too much detail

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,240
about it which might

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,600
cause the participants in the incident

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,960
to be identified which you don't want

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,320
and there's there's potential for a lot

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,600
of bite shedding where people are going

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,880
to talk about you know how this should

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,160
be handled and how they shouldn't be

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,039
handled and

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,320
you know ultimately those people are not

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,280
likely to be on your conduct

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,000
team because the people of contact team

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,720
have been chosen very

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,039
specifically and their decisions need to

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,559
be trusted for the most part

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:54,000
um charles's rules of argument argument

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:57,039
um is a good guide

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,640
for this kind of thing um and for the

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,919
purposes of this kind of

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,720
communication the basic tenets are that

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,480
you should avoid

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,160
engaging with strong strong

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,640
disagreements

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,720
um await people's initial reactions to

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,960
an announcement if necessary

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,000
post a response once to follow up and

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,480
clarify

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
um so you know wait for any any feedback

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,960
and then respond to all of them

00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,240
in one fell swoop don't provide

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,520
additional detail or

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,919
about the incidents or their response

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,880
um avoid entering one one-on-one

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,200
arguments

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,240
um and redirect any community-wide

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,840
discussions that are happening on a

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,240
mailing list or a public chat room or

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,440
whatever

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,240
redirect them to smaller venues to um

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,360
to limit their impact and ensure that

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,679
everything doesn't end up in a huge

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,679
argument

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,799
so to summarize that section um

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,880
it makes sense to comment uh to

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,679
prominently publish your code of conduct

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,600
um your incident reporting procedure and

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,760
the list of committee members

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,600
um committee should be supported by

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,480
leadership and it should be a handful of

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,720
members who

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,480
are you know who have been oppressed who

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,400
are outspoken and who are well respected

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,159
by the community um

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,159
it makes sense to publish your outcomes

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,960
of your code of your code of conduct

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,480
um incidents um and if you have to

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,919
follow up to clarify anything try and do

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,200
so only once

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,840
um and then basically refrain from

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,840
additional discussion

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,000
so when it comes to responding an

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,679
incident responding to an incident sorry

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,240
we'll go into a little bit more detail

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,159
about crafting incident response guides

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,919
um which will outline the process to

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,559
follow when responding to an incident

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,559
as they arise

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,679
okay so um when it comes to

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,600
developing an instant response guide it

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,400
work it's worth investigating

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,400
existing guides um to see what's

00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,840
available uh there is one on the geek

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,200
feminism wiki but there are a bunch of

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,080
other ones that i'm going to link to in

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,080
the references section

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,600
treating an incident response guide like

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,919
a legal code

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,919
is going to get you in trouble because

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,600
you're likely to encounter issues

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,440
where something doesn't quite adhere to

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,120
the code of conduct or doesn't quite

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,200
breach the code of conduct or doesn't

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,799
quite fit into a neat box

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,320
and so you need to be able to adapt to

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,840
that kind of thing you know

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,600
when it comes to laws they have been

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,919
very carefully thought out and they are

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,880
you know pages and pages and pages and

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,400
pages long

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,320
you don't necessarily have the time and

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,360
energy to go and develop something quite

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,200
that refined

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,200
so being a little bit flexible in the

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,799
way you um

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,159
interpret your guide may be important um

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,919
in your guide it makes sense to commit

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,120
to deadlines for responses and

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,480
resolutions

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,120
dealing with incident responses can be

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,679
really exhausting um and it's stressful

00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,120
and it's hard work and we don't

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,480
necessarily really want to be doing it

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
but we do want to have our communities

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,400
be safe

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,640
and as a result because we don't

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,280
necessarily want to be doing it it's

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,559
sometimes hard to overcome the desire to

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,240
drag our feet a little bit

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,320
and just sit on things and think about

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,400
them and not necessarily take action

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,520
so having clear deadlines that we have

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,080
committed to

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,520
um are really important to like push us

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,600
into action to actually resolve these

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,960
things in a timely manner

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,720
um publish an overview

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,400
of your response process so that people

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,080
have a bit of an idea of

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,400
what's going to happen if they submit a

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,440
report and how it's going to be handled

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,880
um and mention that

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,640
you have an internal guide but don't

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,440
necessarily publish the internal guide

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,960
again

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,880
people might then want to go and pick

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,159
your internal guide apart and say oh why

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,600
are you doing this or why

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,159
why have you got this decision in there

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,640
and you know and they might try and

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,760
get really specific and again you don't

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,559
necessarily have the time

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:58,000
to go and put so much detail in there

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,000
that it looks like a law book

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,799
it should also include information about

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,280
how to address non-unanimous decisions

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,679
so

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,320
if you've got six people on your team

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,320
and

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,080
five people think that you should

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,840
respond to an issue an issue in this way

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,679
but one person disagrees

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,760
how do you deal with that what happens

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,400
if three people have one decision and

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,799
three people

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,840
think the other you know what process

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:24,080
have you got for resolving those

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:27,200
um those uncertainties

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,200
um it makes sense to record any

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,600
responses that you make to incidents

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,640
um de-anonymize so that you don't have

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
all the information about the

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,000
participants

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,440
but having a you know a history of like

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,480
here is how we responded

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,919
to this type of incident can help to

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,480
inform how you respond to them

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,840
in in future or maybe how you don't

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,960
respond to them because that turned out

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,840
not to work as well as you would have

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,600
liked

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,440
um and you need to be prepared to update

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,880
your incident response guide

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,600
um and the policy where necessary um you

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,000
may find

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,039
that it doesn't cover a particular

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,320
instance of

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,400
um something that that's come up and you

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,840
need to be able to adapt it on the fly

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,279
and you know one might argue that

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,840
changing something in the middle of an

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,240
incident is not necessarily

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,600
you know ideal but sometimes it might be

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,960
worth you thinking about doing you may

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,520
there may be no other option so i

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,000
wouldn't be

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,000
afraid of of doing that too much

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,240
so let's talk about actually responding

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,240
to an incident report

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,120
um this is you know there are plenty of

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,919
different ways to do this but this is

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,559
one process that i have seen used

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,679
um so step one is to start your deadline

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,120
clock to make sure

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:48,960
that you know if you've committed to

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,520
um announcing that an incident has

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,520
occurred

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,559
online you know so so an incident

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,360
happens

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,960
if you have committed to announcing that

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,919
incidents have occurred

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,440
um on your mailing list or whatever it

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,640
makes sense to set a deadline to do that

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
say okay we're going to do that within

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,799
three hours

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,840
or we are dealing with this issue we've

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,559
heard about this thing that has happened

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,760
at our event

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,679
and we're dealing with it so set

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,880
yourself a timeline for when does this

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,960
need to be done by

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,200
and then you might commit for example to

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,640
eight to three days of having an issue

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,159
completely resolved

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,760
um but timelines are variable it depends

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,880
on your event or your community

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,120
have a think about what's going to work

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,840
best but set those timelines that

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,880
and you know in a way that will work for

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,159
you

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,320
once you've set your start of your

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,960
deadline clock having specified those

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,600
times in your

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,960
in your process check that everyone is

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,480
safe

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,200
and do what needs to be done in order to

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,960
ensure that is the case

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,320
ensure that the report is written down

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,919
it may already be written down you may

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,000
have received it in writing

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,360
um but if it's not if you receive it

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,919
verbally just make sure that somebody

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,559
has written down what is going on

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,360
because our brains are not great when it

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,279
comes to

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,799
pressure sometimes and we can forget

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,480
little details so write it down as soon

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,240
as you can

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,400
um if you have to make an announcement

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,480
so for example if an event

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,000
if an incident happened at an event and

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,360
there were a few people around who saw

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,480
it or might have witnessed it it might

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,919
make sense to say

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,159
hey we know that this thing happened

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,679
we are working on resolving it just so

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,799
that people know that

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:23,679
it's not slipped under the radar

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,159
and finally for this section make sure

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,640
that

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,919
anybody on your conduct team doesn't

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,679
have a conflict of interest

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,679
with the people involved in the incident

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,360
and if so suggests that they step aside

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,080
or ask them to step aside

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,360
from this particular incident once

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,520
you've done all of that

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,279
you can organize a committee meeting for

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,559
the conduct committee or the safety team

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,600
to have a bit of a chat about

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:48,960
how this issue gets dealt with so set a

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,159
start setting a schedule and an agenda

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,240
for that

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,600
do any additional research that might be

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,200
going to talk to other people to get

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,720
some more information from them

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,120
without revealing too much information

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,480
about what you know um

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,400
and then once you've got all of the

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,679
information that you need meet as a

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,880
committee

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,279
um choose a response um

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,720
and take action now when it comes to

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,640
responses

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,760
um one bit of advice that i've seen used

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,440
is to have a list of approved responses

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,600
so here are responses that we've thought

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,760
about and we can see that they work well

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,520
for this particular type of incident

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,679
um and having a list of responses to

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,720
avoid so you might have on your list of

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,640
responses to avoid

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,320
you might say we're going to avoid you

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,919
know suggesting mediation

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,000
or requesting somebody to apologize

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,640
because we know that those don't work

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
um having these lists of things that we

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,440
are

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,039
that that we've we're comfortable

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,520
responding with and things that we

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,200
are going to avoid helps to make

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,000
decisions when you are not thinking

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,919
particularly clearly

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,080
because you're under stress you know

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,080
some incidents can be pretty harrowing

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,640
and when you're trying to enjoy an event

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,080
and are dealing with an incident it's a

00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,360
little tricky sometimes to think

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,460
straight about what should work

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,520
so having those list is really useful um

00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,240
[Music]

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,440
once you've taken chosen an action and

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,799
taken it

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,919
um inform the target of the incident and

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,559
the harasser

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,360
um or the perpetuator of the incident

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,760
let them know

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,399
of the response communicate that

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,200
response

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:23,440
to others so that might be hey you know

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,720
we saw this person who did this thing

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,159
and we have dealt with we have

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,399
ejected this person from the event

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,080
because this was a serious thing um

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:33,679
or whatever like just letting people

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,799
know that there are consequences and

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,480
that you have

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,840
um that you have dealt with the thing

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,000
helps to reinforce that the code of

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,679
conduct is meaningful

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,600
um and then you

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,039
respond to any any criticism that you

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,240
may receive for your

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,880
your response again respond sparingly

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,240
um make sure that your response that

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,919
you're um

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,320
in steps 12 and 13 make sure that your

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:02,080
communication and any criticism response

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,679
is concise and unambiguous um

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,080
but don't identify any individuals

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,080
involved

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:13,440
okay um so to summarize that section

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,960
um there's a lot here um

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,679
so response uh the response guide is

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,360
just that

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,640
it is a guide um it's not a legal code

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,600
if you think of it as a legal code

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,440
as i said you're going to get into

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,880
trouble and it's going to be really

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,080
exhausting

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,679
committing to deadlines is really

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,360
helpful because it makes sure that you

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,600
keep yourself accountable

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,440
to you know to deal with things in a

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,480
timely manner

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,320
um probably avoid

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,000
uploading publishing your internal

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,039
process because people will nitpick at

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,640
it

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:49,679
but publish an overview if necessary

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,320
keep records of your incident responses

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,200
update documentation where necessary um

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,840
even if that means

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,760
doing so during an incident maintain the

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,039
safety of the targets and of the wider

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,440
community

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:05,279
communicate any outcomes that are taken

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,279
and respond cautiously to criticism

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:12,640
so um just on the topic of

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:15,200
some codes of conduct um this

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,279
is that this table is um from a study

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,600
that was done in 2017

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,880
on codes of conduct used in open source

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,159
communities

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,000
i've detailed the reference in more

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:27,120
detail at the end of the slides

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,919
um it's uh it lists a popular code of

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,840
conducts

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,919
in descending order of popularity

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,240
according to hits on github

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,559
so these are the contributor covenant

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,679
the open code of conduct the python

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,000
citizen ubuntu django and geek feminism

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,440
codes of conduct

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,039
and you can see there the contributor

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,120
covenant has 40 almost 44 000 hits on

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,919
github alone

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,960
um so these are some codes of conduct

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,600
that you might be interested in looking

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,360
at

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,039
we're going to have a bit of a look here

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,640
at the contributor covenant given its

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,799
popularity

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,720
um so it's used by over 44 000

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,120
um or almost forty four thousand

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,799
communities around the world

00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,720
um and it's an example of a pretty good

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,919
code of conduct

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,799
so this is the unacceptable behavior

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,360
section

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,559
of the contributor covenant and it says

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,799
that the use of

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,640
unacceptable behavior includes the use

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:25,440
of sexualized language or imagery and

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,200
sexual attention or advances of any kind

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,799
trolling insulting or derogatory

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,320
comments and personal or political

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,960
attacks

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,480
public or private harassment publishing

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,320
others private information

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,799
such as a physical or email address

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,320
without their explicit permission

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,240
or other conduct which could be

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,559
reasonably considered inappropriate in a

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,840
professional setting

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,039
um so this is a clear list of

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:52,799
unacceptable behavior um

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:56,399
that is i think fairly unambiguous

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,960
um and the last point there other other

00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,240
conduct

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,240
which could be considered reasonably

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,200
inappropriate um

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,799
could be used if you have not

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,720
necessarily thought to include something

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,880
and there are like you could go into

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,960
excruciating detail about unacceptable

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,320
behavior but

00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,840
i think at some point you know we need

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,840
to come down to what is reasonable

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,240
um so the scope of the contributor

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,600
covenant this is also listed at the top

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,360
of their document

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,440
says that it applies within all

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,440
community spaces and also applies when

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,000
an individual is officially representing

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,320
the community

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,760
in public spaces examples of

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,240
representing a community

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,000
include using an official email address

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,480
posting via an official social media

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,559
account

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,279
or acting as an appointed representative

00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:45,360
at an online or offline event

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,519
um and they also go into a little bit of

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:50,559
detail about their process which i've

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,240
abbreviated significantly but they say

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,240
that instances of unacceptable behavior

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,399
may be reported to the community leaders

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,559
responsible for enforcement at

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,880
some contact method that you specify in

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:02,399
your version of this code of conduct

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,480
community leaders will follow these

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,440
community impact guidelines to determine

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,919
the consequences

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,279
for any action they deem in violation of

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,960
the code of conduct

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,799
so they've got four things listed here

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,519
correction warning

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,000
temporary ban or permanent ban in the

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,200
actual

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,159
contributor covenant they've got more

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,799
detail under each of those points

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,080
so this is clearly defining what's going

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,000
to happen

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,960
if we receive a conduct report and how

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,799
we're going to deal with it

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,480
so this hits most of the recommendations

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,399
for a code of conduct

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,240
it doesn't have space to list the

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,440
individuals handing reports but if you

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,480
were to adopt it you could easily add

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,120
that in

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,880
it doesn't explicitly promise uh to

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,799
avoid complexity of interest but again

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,760
you could add that in

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,799
and it does include a pledge to behave

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,679
constructively

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,159
so which is to say that people who agree

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,039
to this

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,480
this code of conduct are agreeing to

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,480
behave in a constructive way

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,600
so um the conclusion for this section is

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,799
um that we've decided we've talked sorry

00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,279
this is the conclusion for my entire

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,879
talk

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:12,159
um we've talked about what a code of

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,879
conduct is and what it should contain

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,480
how to apply a code of conduct how to

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,000
respond to an incident

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,679
and we've reviewed the contributor

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,119
covenant which is a good example of a

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,879
code of conduct

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,119
so i'm going to finish up by showing you

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:25,119
my

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,560
enormous reference slide um so a lot of

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,359
this talk

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,800
um a lot of the specific um detailed

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:36,000
processes in this talk

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,399
have been derived from how to respond to

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,200
reports of code of conduct violations by

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,639
val aurora

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,359
and mary gardner but other excellent

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,079
resources

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,760
also include sage sharp's github

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,000
repository code of conduct

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,679
template which this is a link which you

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,359
can pull from the

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,480
from the slide deck if you like and sage

00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,800
can also be hired to run workshops

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,839
on codes of conduct on how to develop

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,359
them and

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:05,839
implement them in your in your company

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,280
or community via their company otter

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,320
tech

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,640
their website is otter.technology

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,160
i found a couple of papers talking

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,520
discussing codes of conduct

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,880
um it's still a relatively new research

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,880
topic from what i can tell

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,800
um the one that i found the most

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,640
information in was

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,920
um codes of contact by open source

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,720
project which is the one from which i

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,119
linked that

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:33,200
um that uh table in earlier slides

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,200
um and then there's you know various

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,040
other information here as well

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:42,079
um so i'm going to leave it there

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,000
um with nine and a half minutes to go um

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,240
and take any questions that people have

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,240
got

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,119
thank you matt for that very useful talk

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:56,000
we have a few questions

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,920
for you so the first question is

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,119
when i have the right screen in front of

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,359
me

00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,400
you talk about not being able to apply

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,480
codes of conduct

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,480
outside the community but are there

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,079
situations where a code of conduct

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,400
should cover behavior outside the

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,480
community for example if someone stalks

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,280
a member of the community using outside

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,359
platforms

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,920
is it reasonable for the code of conduct

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,920
to cover that

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,320
if both of the people involved in the

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,920
situation

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,000
so that the pers the person being

00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,200
stalked and the stalker are part of the

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,160
community

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,800
then yes perhaps it does make sense to

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,160
um

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,520
ex to like exclude this um this harmful

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,800
person from the community because they

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,800
are demonstrating

00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,400
that they are harming some some other

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,079
person so you don't

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,839
you know you if you can avoid it you

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,119
want to try and avoid that person

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,040
doing similar things to other people in

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,720
your community um the main point that i

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,720
was getting at around

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,720
application outside of the community is

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,079
that if you know you've got a community

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,200
member

00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,560
who is being harassed by somebody who's

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,400
not part of the community

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,920
or you know is acting as

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,520
a spokesperson for the community on

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,119
social media or whatever

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,880
and is harassed by somebody else then

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,680
obviously your code of conduct has no

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,040
power

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,960
there um but

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,480
you know so for that for that that

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,839
stalker scenario like

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,079
all you can do the only

00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,000
the only way you can address that is to

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,800
exclude that person from your community

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,839
you know

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,839
or you know

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,079
you have to be able to send any further

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,560
stuff to

00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,480
you know to authorities to to the police

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,560
or whatever to to deal with

00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,760
you know and it's worth it's also worth

00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,040
noting that when it comes to

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,880
like reporting stuff to emergency

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,800
services um unless

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,400
there are people who are actually in

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,520
imminent danger it's worth

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,920
checking with the person who is

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,280
reporting this that they want you to do

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,480
that first because there may be reasons

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,960
they don't want that

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,920
but when it comes to like you know a

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,920
stalker or that kind of thing

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,440
you don't have a huge amount of power

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,880
except to exclude them from the from

00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,000
your community so you need to be able to

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,440
handle

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,119
you know the broader components of that

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,599
issue to you know

00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,839
to the law or whatever i hope that makes

00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,079
sense

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:17,200
i think i could follow that mostly it's

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,560
a tough tough

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,920
situation it really is the next

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:26,720
question is have you run into issues

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:29,280
around privacy or allegations slash

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,680
defamation accusations in relation to

00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,440
announcements about conduct decisions

00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,320
what kind of steps to avoid that have

00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,320
you seen in the past

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,400
have i run into issues around privacy

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,200
so can you repeat the beginning of the

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,520
question it was a bit lengthy

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,960
have you run into issues around privacy

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,520
or allegations

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,800
defamation accusations in relation to

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,640
announcements about conduct decisions

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,640
i don't think i've run into any of them

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,760
personally um

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,359
i suspect um if you were to i suspect

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,880
that there are instances of this

00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,280
if you have a look at um val aurora's

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,800
book

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,240
um there are various examples on the

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,520
back of that i don't recall whether any

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,640
of them cover this

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,839
um but

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,480
again it comes limited in what you can

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,000
do so

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,440
the things that need to be considered

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,440
are um

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,680
at all costs um

00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,280
[Music]

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,040
the conduct team should avoid

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,520
identifying anybody who's involved

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,520
in in an incident um

00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,800
unless it is detrimental to the

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,440
community to not do so so if you have to

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,560
say

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,000
you know if

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,160
so if you're excluding somebody from the

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,359
community you know and saying you know

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,720
this person has been kicked out of this

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,119
event you don't necessarily need to

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,880
identify them but if

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,599
if you don't have the power to do that

00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,280
or something similar

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,119
it may be worthwhile identifying the

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,000
person so people know to stay clear of

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:03,280
them

00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,440
you know but ideally you want to try and

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,800
avoid that

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,240
and thinking carefully about the

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,079
language that you would use for that is

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,440
obviously also important

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,319
um i'm going to kill my timer because i

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,599
don't need that anymore

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,880
um yeah that's that's a tricky question

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,839
to answer i don't know whether

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,839
i've done it justice

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,000
our next question is i often face people

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,920
telling me

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,920
oh if we don't need a code of conduct

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,000
for various organizations

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,200
any recommendations to get leadership to

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,319
buy into the

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:42,400
buy-in sorry to the value

00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:44,000
oh um yes uh so i suspect

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,280
plenty of these references would give

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,240
you information about why it is

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,160
important

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,000
um uh what have we got here i'm just

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,560
looking at my reference list so um val

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,599
aurora

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,040
and mary gardner's book is is good i

00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,800
think that sage sharp also has some

00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,440
information on their website probably

00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,599
about why

00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,119
codes of conduct are important um the

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,560
code of conduct handbook

00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,880
that's listed there as well probably has

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,079
info in it um

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,119
but the short the short answer

00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,520
i mean it's

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,440
it's it is tricky to to to get that

00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,160
buy-in if if people aren't already open

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,599
to it um

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,240
and i'd be happy to talk about that more

00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,720
offline um if we can talk if we've got a

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,400
little bit

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,160
some more specific details about you

00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,599
know what kind of arguments people have

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,839
had against it but

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:34,560
um in short

00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:35,839
people you know codes of conduct keep

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,720
people safe and they

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,359
you know there was um one of the papers

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,290
that i

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,440
didn't list here uh was about um

00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:47,280
[Music]

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:50,400
attraction uh um retention and

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,560
repulsion um and

00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,400
codes of conduct you know help people

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,720
feel invited into your community

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,800
if they can see that you know they're

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,319
going to be kept safe in that community

00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,160
because there is a code of conduct and

00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:03,440
it is being implemented you know it's

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,480
easy to say oh we don't need a code of

00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,000
conduct but

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,599
how do you know that people are not

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,560
opting out of your community or are not

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,440
keeping quiet

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,440
because you don't have one you know and

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,040
sure they're a lot of work but i think

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,040
the effort is worth it

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:28,319
i agree our next question

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,359
is um the asker often faces people being

00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:32,880
uncertain about

00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,880
what or when to report

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,520
any recommendations to get participant

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,319
buy-in

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:45,280
um look the general the general um

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,079
rule that i would use is if you are in

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,760
any way

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,160
suspect um thinking about reporting

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,359
something report it you know

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,000
being being open about

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,119
who is on your code of conduct team and

00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,920
trying to make them

00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,480
you know welcoming and you know for

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,200
example

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,880
in the past linux linuxconf have had the

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,800
people in the code of conduct team like

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,119
stand up in the plenary theater so that

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,920
people can identify them by face

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,200
um and do their best to make sure that

00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,560
that community is welcoming and there

00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,319
are plenty of ways to contact them via

00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:20,079
phone via email via

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:21,680
you know other mediums um making it easy

00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,880
for people to report things

00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,880
and explicitly stating that it is okay

00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,040
to report something even if you are not

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,319
sure you know it's better for us to know

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,960
that a thing has happened

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,400
even if it doesn't turn out to be a you

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,680
know a big deal or something that we can

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,680
do anything about

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,680
um it's worth us knowing about them

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,720
you know and reporting it isn't the end

00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,720
of the world you know just

00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:49,359
we can you know decide not to do

00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,560
something about an incident

00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:53,839
um but we can't make that call if we

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,640
don't know about it and the other thing

00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,440
to keep in mind

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,880
is if you experience something that made

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,240
you feel uncomfortable you might be able

00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,440
to say i'm just going to brush it off

00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,440
i'll just deal with it

00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:05,839
but what about if somebody else if the

00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,760
person who helped you experience that

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,240
does the same to somebody else you know

00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,760
like it's it's

00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,920
it is sometimes hard to report stuff i

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,440
totally get that but

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,960
it does also help to think about the

00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,280
wider community of

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,720
you know okay well i don't want this to

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,480
happen to somebody else so i'm going to

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,000
report it even if nothing comes of it

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,160
even if it didn't wasn't the biggest

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,720
deal for me um

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,599
i want to at least make the organizers

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,839
aware of this

00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,839
thing

00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,960
i think the last question we'll have

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,079
time for

00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,040
is what is the optimal level of

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,160
complexity

00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:47,599
for a code of conduct

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,359
um i would probably look

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,870
at the contributor covenant as a

00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:53,359
baseline for that um

00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:55,520
[Music]

00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,560
things to think about are how long does

00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,760
this take to read

00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:02,960
how hard is it to find information in um

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,200
and does it cover the

00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,079
top handful of scenarios that we might

00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,119
have to deal with

00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,119
in an elegant way um

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:13,760
if your code of conduct is more than an

00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,880
a4 page i think it's too long

00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,240
um and that may that may then

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,000
mean that you need to split certain

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,200
parts of it out you might have put in

00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,680
things about

00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,599
um you know too much detail about how

00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,280
this has been enforced or implemented

00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,960
and you might need to link off to that

00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,920
separate document

00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,720
um but yeah keeping it relatively short

00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,599
and simple

00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,599
is is ideal uh but again you need to

00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,839
have a bit of an idea of like

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,440
clearly defining at a minimum this is

00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:43,440
what unacceptable behavior looks like

00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,200
great but yeah check out check out the

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,119
contributor government as a baseline for

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,359
that

00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:52,960
thank you matt there is at least one

00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,720
more question i've got here

00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,040
so um everyone if you have more

00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:01,520
questions please head over

00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:03,520
to the tux theater post talk q a channel

00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,880
um where matt should be able to join you

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,400
in a few minutes

00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:11,359
um and thank you very much again matt

00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,119
for such a useful and practical talk on

00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:15,839
such an important topic

00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,839
