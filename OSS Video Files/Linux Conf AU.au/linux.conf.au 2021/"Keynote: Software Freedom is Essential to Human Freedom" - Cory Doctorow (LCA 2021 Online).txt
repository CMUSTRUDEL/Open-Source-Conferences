00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,320
HOST: I would like to introduce Cory Doctorow.

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:28,406
Now it's been a while since we've been trying to get Cory here and, um, it's been...

00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:34,265
Cory has been on my wish list since LCA Ballarat 2012 and we've been trying to get him ever since.

00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:41,160
Cory is a science fiction novelist, journalist, technology activist and is a special consultant to the EFF -

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,768
a not-for-profit social liberties group that defends freedom in technology law, standards and treaties. 

00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:53,841
Cory is... also co-founded the open source peer-to-peer software company Opencola

00:00:53,841 --> 00:01:00,640
and is also an award-winning author of 'Walkaway', 'Little Brother' and 'Information Doesn't Want to Be Free' among many others.

00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,917
His latest book, 'Attack Surface' is the standalone adult sequel to 'Little Brother'.

00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:12,501
Now please join me in finally welcoming Cory to LCA. Sit back, relax and enjoy

00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:17,106
and welcome to Linux Conf. AU Cory. Over to you.

00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:24,892
CORY: Well, thank you very much what a pleasure to be here, uh, at last. It is a long way to go from any of the places that I've lived;

00:01:24,892 --> 00:01:30,997
since you started asking me to Australia, although it is my... one of my favorite places to go.

00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:39,175
I have a like... even a favorite banana bread place in Melbourne, so I always welcome the chance when it arises.

00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:45,429
I wrestle with what to talk with you folks about today and I reckon that the thing that would work best

00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:53,468
is a talk I wrote about what it means to care about technology policy

00:01:53,468 --> 00:01:58,200
and the story that we have about the people who care about technology policy.

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,574
When I say policy, I mean like, how technology and the laws around it affect our lived experience.

00:02:04,574 --> 00:02:09,672
Questions of social justice and economic justice and so on.

00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:18,534
And there's a story today about the people who care about this stuff, that they were kind of blind techno optimists.

00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:24,583
Back in the old days, in the 1990s, when when this issue of Wired Magazine came out.

00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:29,993
I bought this on the intercity bus on my way to uni

00:02:29,993 --> 00:02:34,855
where I was doing an interdisciplinary degree with  a heavy emphasis on computer science

00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:37,335
and within like, a week I dropped out of uni. (LAUGHS)

00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:46,083
So, there's this story that the people who were reading these early articles and the people who were writing them were kind of 

00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:59,550
techno-optimist, digitally adult, naives who thought that if only we could give everyone a computer everything would be fine

00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:05,174
and that they completely failed to foresee all the possible  ways that our technology could become dystopian.

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,088
I happen to know some of those people now because I ended up working for the Electronic Frontier Foundation -

00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:16,879
 I'm about to start my 20th year (LAUGHS) with the Electronic Frontier Foundation -

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:24,801
and I happen to know them and I'm here to tell you, nobody starts an organization like the Electronic Frontier Foundation

00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:31,408
or any of the sister organizations around the world like Electronic Frontiers Australia or OpenMedia.ca

00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:36,402
or Quadrature du Net in France or Digital Rights Ireland or any of those other organizations,

00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:41,674
no one starts an organization like that because they think everything's going to be great.

00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:49,680
You start an organization like that because you were, on the one hand, yeah, legitimately excited about how amazing things could be

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,881
and on the other hand absolutely starkly terrified about how badly they can go.

00:03:55,881 --> 00:04:01,534
There's a great paper that public knowledge published a few years back by Michael Weinberger

00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:05,479
about copyrights patents and 3D printing and it has the best title.

00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:13,147
The title's so good I want it on my tombstone and that title is 'This Will All Be So Great If We Don’t Screw It Up'

00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:20,112
and that I think is the founding ethic of the early technological boosters.

00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:27,600
The people who cared about policy and who wanted not just to get technology into people's hands but to get tech policy right.

00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:32,883
And it's hard to realize now but back in the olden days when this was all getting started,

00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:40,000
technology was not the source of a stock bubble it was a kind of fringe activity

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,552
and the only reason to get involved with these clunky old computers  was not that you dreamt of untold riches

00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:51,043
but rather that you were just really passionate about it.

00:04:51,043 --> 00:04:59,280
That you sat down at the console for the first time and discovered something that made you say "Where have you been all my life?"

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,005
and then you just fell straight through the screen.

00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:08,907
I think that most of us can can recognize how that story unfolds.

00:05:08,907 --> 00:05:12,480
Think about the first time you write some code.

00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:19,096
Writing code is about crisply expressing your will

00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:28,019
and if you express your will with sufficient precision the computer will manifest your desires.

00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:36,872
That it will do what you told it to do forever at a price that's so low that it's indistinguishable from free

00:05:36,872 --> 00:05:42,966
and that once you add a modem to that computer, once it's connected to a network

00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:45,780
you can project that will around the world.

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:52,642
Not in the way that say, Mark Zuckerberg does where he waves a wand and says pivot to video and a million journalists lose their job

00:05:52,642 --> 00:06:00,468
but rather you can create some code that solves a problem you have or delights you

00:06:00,468 --> 00:06:10,824
and then everyone else in the world can just click a button and the code will do the trick that you taught it for them.

00:06:10,824 --> 00:06:15,562
We sometimes call software a recipe but it's not  quite like a recipe, you know.

00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:22,562
If your gran has the world's greatest pumpkin bread recipe and you perfect it and publish it

00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:31,675
and hand it around to other people they still have to get  the ingredients and follow the recipe correctly.

00:06:31,675 --> 00:06:36,711
Software is like a self-executing pumpkin bread recipe.

00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:42,209
You express your will with the precision, then you encapsulate it in code

00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:50,160
and then you give that code to someone else and rather than having to replicate your expertise, they press a button  

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,499
and pumpkin bread just starts emerging  from their computer. Digital pumpkin bread.

00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:02,644
And once you have the network it's not just  that you can spread your will around the world  

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,627
but also that you can discover communities.

00:07:05,627 --> 00:07:12,627
communities of people who have thinly distributed, hard to locate traits  that are important to you.

00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:22,089
People who know the words for the things that you've felt for all your life but have never been able to express.

00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,945
People who might understand that gender is not a binary or that Black Lives Matter

00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:35,427
or more toxically, that you can dress up like  you were extra in a civil war movie, get a tiki torch

00:07:35,427 --> 00:07:40,774
and march the streets of a midsize Southern-American city chanting "Jews will not replace us."

00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,689
But irrespective of how I feel about the community that you find, I think that we can all understand  

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,480
that when you find the people who  know the words for the thing you felt  

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,259
that that is a very compelling experience. It's a thing that makes you passionate

00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,199
And the thing that you get when you can write code  or choose what code you write

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,493
or find the people who can help you express who you are.

00:08:09,493 --> 00:08:15,321
The thing that that delivers, the word for what that delivers, I think, is self-determination. 

00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:25,417
This very powerful thing of being able to decide how your life is gonna go, how your day is gonna go,

00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:31,570
how even this societal matrix that you're embedded in will be structured.

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:37,760
That self-determination is the source of tremendous tremendous satisfaction

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:45,679
and it's very energizing when when you can  decide how your life is going to be lived.

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,035
And the fights that we had over technology policy, the first ones, they were all about self-determination.

00:08:55,035 --> 00:09:01,280
Like, you're here at this GNU Linux conference presumably you know the story  

00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:09,229
that Richard Stallman, a young bearded artificial  intelligence researcher walked into his lab at MIT one day 

00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:16,183
and the printer wasn't working the way he wanted it to and he went to fetch the paper tape that loaded the printer driver

00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:20,358
so that he could punch some new holes in it and make it do what he wanted to.

00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:26,177
And the drawer was locked and Richard said "Why is there a lock on this drawer?"

00:09:26,177 --> 00:09:31,992
and they said "From now on we lock the drawer. You run the printer driver or you don't run the printer driver.

00:09:31,993 --> 00:09:36,684
What you don't get to do is make the printer driver work the way you need it to work."

00:09:36,684 --> 00:09:39,815
No self-determination.

00:09:39,815 --> 00:09:46,723
And who can forget this classic of the genre, Bill Gates a member in good standing of the Homebrew Computer Club

00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:55,226
had just bought from a third party the foundation for DOS and adapted it lightly so that it would run on the 68k processor.

00:09:55,226 --> 00:10:02,430
And he found that his colleagues at the Homebrew Computer Club were doing to this code what they did to all the code!

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,564
They were tweaking it, they were changing it,  they were adapting it and they were building on it.

00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:15,900
And he wrote this notorious letter, right? The 99 theses nailed to the church door.

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,360
He wrote this notorious letter telling people to just knock it off.

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:28,160
Or you know... I know Australia had a funny  internet history in the early days of Usenet  

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,390
back when it was just a couple ISDNs linking the entire landmass to the rest of the world.

00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:39,663
But if you remember those days, you will remember the  story of the alt. * hierarchy.

00:10:39,663 --> 00:10:42,963
So, Usenet was what we had to talk to one another on the internet.

00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:48,084
It was the first social part of the internet and it was a bunch of message boards in a hierarchy.

00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:55,440
So you had soc.* for social stuff and you had rec.* for recreational stuff and you had sci.* for scientific stuff and comp.* for computer stuff.

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,697
And the way that Usenet ran, it was a store and forward distributed network

00:11:00,697 --> 00:11:07,532
and the raw compute, the storage and the network capacity for it

00:11:07,532 --> 00:11:14,878
was provided by a bunch of people who call themselves, only semi-jokingly, the backbone cabal.

00:11:14,878 --> 00:11:24,744
The backbone cabal were network admins and sysadmins at giant telecoms companies, research institutions, universities and government agencies

00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:32,891
and these firms generated phone bills every month that  were as thick as a phone book, you know, a whole ream of paper.

00:11:32,891 --> 00:11:39,859
And what these sysadmins worked out is that they could use this stored forward network to communicate with one another

00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:43,680
and the cost would just get lost in these giant bills.

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,240
And so, they ran Usenet under their boss's noses without anyone knowing about it,  

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,123
or at least not formally knowing about it, everyone had deniability

00:11:54,123 --> 00:12:00,880
but the one thing that they feared was that their bosses would someday wake up and discover not only that they were running Usenet  

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,147
but that it was stuff full of porn and bomb recipes.

00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:12,419
Because many of these were publicly funded institutions no one wanted a congressman standing up on the podium and saying

00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:20,751
"Why is the university of East Nowheresville spending thousands of dollars of our taxpayers money to pedal smut?"

00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:28,121
And so, although the Usenet ran as a democracy where whenever you wanted to add a new Usenet news group you would hold a vote,

00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:39,088
the backbone cabal held a veto over that vote where if they thought, for whatever reason, that the thing that the users of usenet wanted

00:12:39,088 --> 00:12:44,400
might bring the whole project down they could just override the democratic vote

00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,935
and say "You voted wrong, go vote again" or  "We're gonna do it different" or

00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:54,109
"Sorry you don't get that. You've reached the hard limit of our democracy"

00:12:54,109 --> 00:13:01,036
and mostly that was used for porn and bomb recipes and whatever but sometimes it was exercised very capriciously

00:13:01,036 --> 00:13:06,495
and the origin story of the alt.* hierarchy is that  there was a guy who was an avid chef 

00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:13,120
and he wanted to start a group about cooking, and he thought that it belonged in rec.* rec.cooking  

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,081
and the cabal thought that it belonged in talk.*  talk.dot cooking

00:13:18,081 --> 00:13:24,018
and when the cabal lost the vote and overrode it, this guy and his friends

00:13:24,018 --> 00:13:31,965
started a hobbyist alternative suite of message groups for Usenet called the alt.* hierarchy 

00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:34,324
that did not have any votes to create a news group.

00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:40,187
Anyone could create a news group. You could create redundant news groups, you could create news groups that no one would ever use,

00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:45,543
you could create stupid news groups, you could fill news groups with pornography, pirated software, bomb recipes, whatever.

00:13:45,543 --> 00:13:53,871
The first news group that was created on the alt.* hierarchy was alt.gourmand, right? It was for for cookery.

00:13:53,871 --> 00:14:02,960
Because this person wanted to have self-determination. Because he wanted to be able to talk about cooking  

00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:09,920
not just as a thing that you chatter about  but as a source of recreational satisfaction.

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,858
And it mattered to him. The self-determination question mattered to him enough that they effectively forked Usenet 

00:14:15,858 --> 00:14:20,613
and you know within a couple of years, alt.* was bigger than the whole rest of Usenet 

00:14:20,613 --> 00:14:26,532
because it turned out everyone wanted self-determination. Some of them wanted bomb recipes. 

00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,772
So, some of the some of the worst  nightmares of those early tech pioneers...

00:14:30,772 --> 00:14:34,272
Whoops! I went two slides... three slides! (VOCALISES SURPRISE)

00:14:34,272 --> 00:14:41,330
Some of the fears of those early digital rights pioneers have come to pass, right?

00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:47,823
We do have the thing that everyone dreamt of in those days. We have total technology penetration,

00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:50,720
It's very hard to get away from the internet these days,

00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:57,840
but with that has come absolute centralization,  surveillance and digital manipulation.

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,235
And the question I want to take up today in this talk is how were we dealt such a stinging defeat?

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:12,303
What was the blind spot that allowed technologists  who were alive to this to this consequence 

00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:19,275
and in fact dedicated themselves to building a free fair  and open technological infrastructure, ecosystem;

00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:26,789
what was it that caused us to fail so badly, to produce the world that the kiwi developer Tom Eastman calls

00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:32,468
"The world of five giant websites  each filled with screenshots of text from the other four"

00:15:32,468 --> 00:15:40,018
And I think that the blind spot was not a failure to understand that dystopia was always there in our technology,

00:15:40,018 --> 00:15:44,395
I think the blind spot was a failure to understand monopolism.

00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,875
Now that early commercial internet,

00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:54,029
that thing that we joined when we got our first Pcs and our first modems and got online,

00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:56,160
it was a very dynamic world.

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:03,773
Firms that had been absolute giants were eclipsed by startups that were literally started by a couple of people in a garage.

00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:09,279
New networking services rose out of nowhere and grew to dominate the sphere

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,520
only to be completely sidelined a few years later by a new competitor.

00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:21,231
it was an amazing time and it felt like the idea of monopolizing the internet was like monopolizing the air.

00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:24,534
Like, how could you hold it all? It would just slip through your fingers

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,633
but what we didn't understand or at least what I didn't understand as a kid,

00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:35,915
you know, I got my Apple II Plus in 1979, I was 8 years old. We got a modem in '82.

00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:43,582
What I didn't understand was the role that the department of justice and other anti-monopoly enforcers had played

00:16:43,582 --> 00:16:47,808
in creating that world that we were so excited to be living in.

00:16:47,808 --> 00:16:53,825
So, I wanna tell you what I didn't know back then. I want to tell you what was going on behind the scenes.

00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:56,545
So I got this modem around 1982.

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,068
1982 is also the year that the department of  justice broke up the monopoly telecoms company in the United States,

00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:06,569
AT&T, also known as the bell system.

00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:12,808
And the bell system had had a lot of projects, one was ensuring that long distance tariffs were as high as possible

00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:17,529
and another was ensuring that as few people as possible owned and used modems

00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:25,360
because they understood that the trajectory of modems was to take the services that they currently charged a premium for like long distance  

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,129
and just turn them into data services that they  could no longer extract a premium over.

00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:34,342
And so, when AT&T broken up, long-distance tariffs crashed

00:17:34,342 --> 00:17:43,160
modems proliferated, software to run bulletin board systems and network systems like Phytonet and Usenet became very commonplace

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:48,080
and although I was not even living in the country  where all that happened, I was living in Canada,

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:57,598
I benefited because my local SysOps were able to install BBS software on their Commodore 64 or their Apple II Plus

00:17:57,598 --> 00:18:04,852
because the software was being produced in this giant market that had suddenly been liberated from its monopolistic tyranny.

00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:11,536
And the BBS scene that grew up, grew up because the long distance tariffs had crashed

00:18:11,536 --> 00:18:20,000
so it became this very exciting time and it was filled with companies that no one had ever heard of before.

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:31,447
IBM produces this PC in 1984 and that PC comes loaded with an operating system that doesn't even come from IBM.

00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:37,176
Now, I don't want to speak ill of one of the conference's sponsors here but IBM was a a bully.

00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:43,017
IBM had been under antitrust investigation for 12 years. It wasn't even their first rodeo.

00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:47,120
But they've been under this antitrust investigation for 12 years

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,751
before the DOJ finally dropped the suit the same year that they decided to break up AT&T.

00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:56,208
It's a long story but basically Ronald Reagan's  Anti-trust Czar said

00:18:56,208 --> 00:19:00,754
we're going to break up one of these companies to see if we can get some competition here in America

00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:04,136
and they decided that AT&T would be easier to break up than IBM

00:19:04,136 --> 00:19:09,819
because AT&T had been integrated into the government for so long, had been a regulated monopoly for so long

00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:17,898
but IBM had spent 12 years in antitrust hell. Every single year of the IBM antitrust investigation,

00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:28,792
it spent more on its lawyers than the entire department of justice spent for every lawyer working on every antitrust case in the country.

00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:35,998
So, after 12 years they settled the case, said "Let this be a warning to you" and show them the door.

00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:41,808
So, IBM makes the IBM PC and they understood that the DOJ,

00:19:41,808 --> 00:19:45,576
one of the things that the Department of Justice had  been so angry at them about

00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:49,318
was the way that they leveraged their hardware to create software monopolies

00:19:49,318 --> 00:19:58,160
and they were like, if we make an operating system for this PC, the doj is going to tie our ankles to the bumper of its ute again  

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,101
and drive us up and down a gravel road for another 12 years

00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:07,793
so let's find a couple of beardy weirdies who can deliver an OS for us

00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:13,115
and so they found Microsoft, who bought some code from someone else, did a little light rewrite, sold it to IBM

00:20:13,115 --> 00:20:18,824
and suddenly became this company from out of nowhere that became a world dominating firm, right?

00:20:18,824 --> 00:20:30,234
IBM fields the pc in 1984 and almost as soon as the PC hits the market, the PC clone hits the market.

00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:36,695
The story of the PC clone is amazing! There was this virtuoso hardware engineer,

00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:39,600
this queer, punk, hardware engineer; a guy named Tom Jennings, who's a friend of mine these days.

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,525
He lives about five kilometers from my home here in Los Angeles county

00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:50,000
and Tom at the time was working for a company called Phoenix.

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,986
Phoenix got a copy of the spec sheet for the IBM PC ROM

00:20:56,986 --> 00:21:03,986
and tom used that to create a spec sheet for a new ROM which Phoenix then turned over to a team of Texas Instruments programmers.

00:21:03,986 --> 00:21:11,289
They didn't want Intel programmers because they wanted to  make sure that if anyone claimed that they'd copied Intel code 

00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:19,768
they could say not only did we not copy Intel code, this team literally had never seen Intel code before they made the ROM.

00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:25,383
And they made the ROM and they sold it to companies that again, came out of nowhere and roared to global scale.

00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:27,640
Dell, Gateway, Compaq

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:34,779
So here I am, this kid in Toronto, seeing the market  looking so dynamic looking so amazing.

00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:40,775
Seeing the people who just have this idea suddenly going global with it

00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:46,152
and thinking well, that's the way this stuff works, right? It's just... that's just how it goes.

00:21:46,152 --> 00:21:54,221
But the reason IBM didn't crush Tom Jennings and his boss at Phoenix like a bug

00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:58,272
was that they had been in antitrust hell for 12 years

00:21:58,272 --> 00:22:03,985
and they were terrified of being stuck back in anti-trust heall for another 12 years.

00:22:03,985 --> 00:22:13,234
So, Microsoft, this creature of antitrust, right? This firm that only exists because of vigorous antitrust becomes a monopolist.

00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:19,659
And so '92 the FTC and the DOJ opened their investigations into Microsoft saying,

00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:27,298
"It seems like you guys are doing the thing  that we busted IBM for.

00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:30,394
We want to come and have a look at your books and see what you're doing and so on.

00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:36,088
Now, it was too late to save Netscape but after seven years of antitrust hell,

00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:44,240
Microsoft was so terrorized by the experience that when a  couple of Stanford grads named Larry and Sergey  

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,665
decided to start a search engine based on citation analysis called Google

00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:54,400
Microsoft did not do to them what they'd done to Netscape. They didn't crush them like a bug.

00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,465
They just sort of folded their hands and watched as Google went on to eat their lunch. 

00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,680
so if you grew up in that time, I think you can be forgiven for feeling like there was something like  

00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:14,269
this platonic perfect market that we'd  often heard the theorists of markets discuss, right?  

00:23:14,269 --> 00:23:21,125
Where you had low capital costs to start a new firm, you just needed a cool idea and your keyboard

00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:24,720
and a lot of attentive debugging and you can make code.

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,606
You had a global audience and that global audience  had a really low switching cost.

00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:37,343
So this created a market where the best ideas turned into companies which would find customers and change the world.

00:23:37,343 --> 00:23:47,809
And if there was a firm that had a proprietary advantage because of its file formats, because of its data transmission tools or utilities

00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:53,722
because of the way that it managed its API's or what have you,

00:23:53,722 --> 00:23:57,551
All you needed to do was reverse engineer it, write a little bit of middleware

00:23:57,551 --> 00:24:01,506
and your new program could read and write their old programs data

00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:09,339
and what looked like a wild garden, all the data captured in  a proprietary file format, became a kind of feedlot

00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:14,560
where you could show up to all these customers  who are locked into the walled garden and say

00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:22,311
Look, you neatly organized potential customers for my product, mine is better and it reads and writes all the files that you've already created

00:24:22,311 --> 00:24:27,499
so come on over, jump the wall, I've brought a ladder and be my customer.

00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:34,160
So, what we didn't know, what we failed to appreciate, was that antitrust law

00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,240
was not a vigorous force that was  going to defend us in the future. 

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:45,840
Rather, that antitrust law had been shot in  the guts in 1980 by a guy named Robert Bork.

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,261
Come on, there you are. Robert Bork.

00:24:52,261 --> 00:24:54,880
Robert Bork was Ronald Reagan's court sorcerer.

00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,247
He was one of these people who was a theorist of these perfect markets that would somehow produce these great optimal outcomes

00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:09,847
and one of the things that Robert Bork was mightily sure of was this fringe idea that monopolies were good actually.

00:25:09,847 --> 00:25:20,378
That if you squinted really hard at the underlying documents that prohibited monopoly in markets,

00:25:20,378 --> 00:25:27,120
that what you would find is that the laws that had been written, had been written not to ban monopolies per se

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,144
but only to stop monopolies when they created consumer harms when they made prices go up

00:25:32,144 --> 00:25:37,162
and Bork promulgated this idea that you should only  prevent firms from creating monopolies

00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,719
when you could prove that they were going to raise prices.

00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:44,887
And then he set a standard for proving whether they would raise prices that made it effectively impossible

00:25:44,887 --> 00:25:52,919
and so for the next 40 years Ronald Reagan and his neoliberal allies around the world, including the Australian government of the day 

00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:58,158
and also the Thatcher government in the UK, the Mulroney government in Canada where I lived, Helmut Kohl in Germany

00:25:58,158 --> 00:26:07,605
and the whole suite of neoliberal influenced politicians, created the market conditions where you could do things that used to be radioactively illegal:

00:26:07,605 --> 00:26:14,565
create vertical monopolies, merge to monopoly, acquire your nascent competitors to neutralize them, and so on.

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,783
Now when people today talk about tech monopolization, especially people who like Robert Bork, 

00:26:21,783 --> 00:26:27,454
you'll often hear a story about these exotic phenomena that cause tech to become so concentrated.

00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:31,517
They'll say, "Oh, it's a network effect  that caused tech to become concentrated" or

00:26:31,517 --> 00:26:39,600
"It's a first mover effect!" or "It's a data moat!" but when  you look at the companies, that's not how they grew  

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,916
and it's not how they maintain their monopoly.

00:26:42,916 --> 00:26:49,314
The way that they grew and the way that they maintain their monopoly is not network effects, it's just moneyball.

00:26:49,314 --> 00:26:54,880
When you have unlimited access to the capital markets, when  you have as much cash as you could possibly need  

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,596
you can just buy your way to success.

00:26:57,596 --> 00:27:02,030
I mean, even if you're not very good at making stuff, you can buy your way to success.

00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:07,563
So, think about Google. Google is a company that has made one and a half successful products in-house.

00:27:07,563 --> 00:27:14,731
They made what we all I think can admit is a really world-beating search engine and a pretty good hotmail clone

00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:22,720
and everything else, the ad tech stack, the mobile operating system, all the other good stuff that makes them all that money, maps and so on, 

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,753
those are companies they bought. Companies that  they would have been prohibited from buying before Robert Bork

00:27:28,753 --> 00:27:36,150
and moreover all the stuff that they made in-house is in the google graveyard, right? It's stuff that just failed.

00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:41,921
Like, the most recent one is the wi-fi balloons which, you know, deflated. Today.

00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:53,128
Now, network effects are real. They are a thing. But due to interoperability, network effects are a double-edged sword.

00:27:53,128 --> 00:28:00,295
We're accustomed to thinking of interoperability even in the free and open source software world as a collaborative project, right?

00:28:00,295 --> 00:28:05,840
You want everyone to be able to read and write an HTTP header, so you go to the W3C, you join the working group,  

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,264
you help specify the header and you make a reference implementation and then everyone follows the reference implementation.

00:28:12,264 --> 00:28:16,480
And that is a really important source of interoperability.

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,004
but there's another kind of interoperability, one that's even more important to technology as we understand it today

00:28:23,004 --> 00:28:31,236
and that is in adversarial interoperability, what we the electronic frontier foundation call competitive compatibility.

00:28:31,236 --> 00:28:36,924
It shortens to com com which is easier than adversarial interoperability, which shortens to AI

00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:40,716
and there's already a technology that got to that acronym first.

00:28:40,716 --> 00:28:45,845
So, organizations like AT&T, which had the bell system

00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:52,881
they were able to use network effects to lock customers in and they had all kinds of things that they did

00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:57,695
that leveraged their lock-in to make more money, thanks to their network effects.

00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:05,045
One of the things that notoriously, the bell system did, was was felonize connecting   equipment to the network

00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:08,172
that hadn't been sold to  you by division of AT&T,

00:29:08,172 --> 00:29:14,800
and so phones, answering machines, modems, all the other things that we are now accustomed to plugging into our wall  

00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:20,000
AT&T was the sole supplier of and they wouldn't sell it to you they'd only lease it to you

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:28,401
so you had to buy it over and over again over  your career as a customer of the bell system.

00:29:28,401 --> 00:29:36,053
and once that rule was was softened thanks to overreach, now AT&T went after a company called Hush-A-Phone

00:29:36,053 --> 00:29:40,411
that made a little cup that fit over the mouthpiece of your phone

00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:43,395
so that no one could read your lips while you were talking on the phone

00:29:43,395 --> 00:29:50,183
and they said "Oh! Well this this device that you mechanically coupled to the bell system endangers the integrity of the network"

00:29:50,183 --> 00:29:55,727
and even their thoroughly captured regulators were like "Oh! Pull the other one, it's got bells on. Like, forget it!"

00:29:55,727 --> 00:30:01,360
and that's when they lost their monopoly over a mechanical coupling, shortly thereafter they lost a monopoly on electrical coupling  

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,628
and then it was effectively open season.

00:30:03,628 --> 00:30:10,183
And again you now had a bunch of people who had   standard RJ11 jacks in their homes that the bell system had provided,

00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:15,364
that had a standard dial tone, that had standard mouthpieces because everyone had the same phone

00:30:15,364 --> 00:30:18,008
and people could make accessories and new equipment for them

00:30:18,008 --> 00:30:24,057
and that network effect became a thing that cut against bell, not a thing that cut for bell.

00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:29,189
and it's not just the bell system, this is part of the story of every tech giant we know, right?

00:30:29,189 --> 00:30:34,388
Think about the iWork suite. When apple was losing the enterprise wars

00:30:34,388 --> 00:30:41,559
and when a shop that had a bunch of PCs and one Mac, just just couldn't exchange documents with them.

00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:44,862
The Mac versions of Office were cursed.

00:30:44,862 --> 00:30:53,815
If you were unwise enough to send your designer a Word file and they made the grave error of saving it on their Mac and sent it back to you,

00:30:53,815 --> 00:30:56,933
You would never be able to open it again.

00:30:56,933 --> 00:31:04,991
And Steve Jobs did not go on bent knee to Bill Gates and said "Please update the Office suite for the Mac"

00:31:04,991 --> 00:31:15,185
they just hired some coders who reverse engineered the entire file format and cloned it and made this adversarially interoperable version

00:31:15,185 --> 00:31:20,912
that reads and writes all their file formats and now everyone who had a Mac... or had a PC rather,

00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:25,421
could switch to the Mac and take their documents with them. And so the wall garden became a feed lot again.

00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:32,921
And it wasn't just them, Lexmark sued a rival called Static Control back when Lexmark was a division of IBM. Sorry IBM.

00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:39,399
They sued them for remanufacturing their toner cartridges and cloning the chip

00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:45,548
they had a little chip that had a 12-byte program that said either I'm a full cartridge or an empty cartridge

00:31:45,548 --> 00:31:50,857
and once all the toner was out it would say 'I'm an empty cartridge' and if you put more toner in

00:31:50,857 --> 00:31:55,028
it would still say 'I'm empty' and that wouldn't recognize and it wouldn't work in your printer.

00:31:55,028 --> 00:31:58,956
Well it turns out that a program that's only 12 bytes long is pretty easy to reverse engineer.

00:31:58,956 --> 00:32:02,574
They reverse engineered it, made their own chip. Hey, guess who owns Lexmark these days?

00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:07,520
Static Control. Right? That's what adversarial interoperability buys you.

00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:16,407
Facebook had a problem when it got started, a very Australian problem. That problem was called Rupert Murdoch

00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:20,320
Rupert Murdoch owned the dominant social network of the day, Myspace  

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,080
and you folks probably know that what Rupert Murdoch has, he expects to hold on to  

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,520
and it's not like you can just go and politely ask him to let his users come to Facebook.

00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,960
That's not what Zuck did, Zuck made a bot that  you gave your login credential and password to  

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,928
and it would just trot over to Myspace, login as you, scrape all your waiting messages, pop them into your Facebook inbox,

00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:46,343
let you reply to them, go back to Myspace and pop them back in.

00:32:46,343 --> 00:32:52,362
And now, all of those Myspace users were not a captive audience for Rupert Murdoch,

00:32:52,362 --> 00:32:58,650
they were a captive audience for the man who would dethrone the child, who would dethrone Rupert Murdoch.

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,353
So, a thing happened on the way to the second  decade of the 21st century,

00:33:02,353 --> 00:33:09,223
which is all this adversarial interoperability, all this competitive compatibility has been effectively eliminated or criminalised 

00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:17,999
thanks to patents, software copyrights, the rules against circumvention and bypassing DRM, enforceability of terms of service

00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:21,233
and then these new rights that are working their ways through the through the U.S courts

00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:28,042
where Oracle, thank god they're not one of your sponsors, is suing Google over copyright on API's

00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:33,044
which is an idea that's absolutely insane. Copyrights are not supposed to protect functional works. 

00:33:33,044 --> 00:33:38,081
If your API is not functional, you have a problem with your API.

00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:44,563
So, the thing that this does, is it allows these companies that scaled the ladder

00:33:44,563 --> 00:33:49,360
using adversarial interoperability,  to kick the ladder away when they reach the top.

00:33:52,487 --> 00:33:58,314
You may have heard all of these things  patents, copyrights, and so on called intellectual property 

00:33:58,314 --> 00:34:05,257
and you know that free culture advocates, they don't like the term intellectual property. They make fun of it when people use it

00:34:05,257 --> 00:34:11,388
and they say we should call it an author's monopoly, that's what the Victorians called it.

00:34:11,388 --> 00:34:19,178
And authors like me, creators like me, they get really pissy when when you say, "You should call it a Monopoly"

00:34:19,178 --> 00:34:22,261
because even though I do have a monopoly over the things that I write

00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:27,180
it's not a monopoly like Apple's monopoly or IBM's monopoly or Microsoft's monopoly or Google's monopoly.

00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:31,772
I don't get to set prices with my monopoly. The fact that the government gives me a copyright

00:34:31,772 --> 00:34:36,172
doesn't let me go to my publisher and tell them how much they're going to have to pay me for my book.

00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:42,037
but there is a funny thing that happens when you...

00:34:42,037 --> 00:34:46,835
There's a funny thing that happens when you have monopolized intermediaries -

00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:51,310
when you have monopolized publishers, record labels, software companies, tech platforms -

00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:56,374
it's that they can take all of these authors monopolies and they can aggregate them

00:34:56,374 --> 00:35:01,023
and if you're a monopolist whose business consists of a bunch of authors monopolies

00:35:01,023 --> 00:35:05,020
that were conjured into existence by people like me doing creative labor,

00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:11,691
then your monopoly becomes doubly sturdy, because not only do you have a monopoly that you can use to make more money with

00:35:11,691 --> 00:35:16,977
and to influence policy with, but you also have a monopoly that the government will defend for you

00:35:16,977 --> 00:35:22,560
because in order to to undermine your monopoly, to fight against your monopoly, someone has to violate your copyright  

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:29,101
They have to bypass your DRM to install a third party app or bypass your copyright to clone your API.

00:35:29,101 --> 00:35:34,640
And at that point, it's not you trying to rope someone into a contractual term,

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,280
the government is there for you to  enforce this property right on your behalf. 

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,094
So, I started this by saying that the internet  boosters were...

00:35:46,094 --> 00:35:50,250
Sorry, I've skipped a slide here. Let me just find my place here.

00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:58,000
I started this by saying that the internet boosters were not blind to the perils of technology, but maybe they were a little blind, right?  

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:03,334
Once all the money was out there in the system,  once there was effectively unlimited fortunes

00:36:03,334 --> 00:36:07,870
for people who got good at computers and made stuff for other people in corner markets,

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,179
people started to wonder whether they themselves  couldn't get their hands on some of that money. 

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,458
The myth of two guys in a garage that could topple a billion dollar giant and become billionaires themselves

00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:28,716
fired a lot of technologists imagination and also sidelined a lot of their consciences.

00:36:28,716 --> 00:36:33,179
But these days, those dreams are behind us, right?

00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:38,393
No matter how cool your ideas, you're probably not going to become a billionaire from it

00:36:38,393 --> 00:36:42,816
because no one wants to invest in anything that competes head-on with any of the big tech monopolists,

00:36:42,816 --> 00:36:49,097
even though they have double-digit year-on-year growth and billions of dollars in profits and vast margins,

00:36:49,097 --> 00:36:53,812
the investor class calls their businesses and the adjacent businesses the kill zone

00:36:53,812 --> 00:37:01,079
and they will not invest in it because they understand that those monopolies can snuff out those businesses anytime they want.

00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:03,707
And so our aperture has narrowed.

00:37:03,707 --> 00:37:09,498
The thing that we dream of when we think about doing a successful startup is being aqua hired by a tech giant.

00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:15,092
Instead of dreaming of billions of dollars or changing the world, we wonder if someday we might find a workplace

00:37:15,092 --> 00:37:18,240
where we have kombucha on tap and free massages on Wednesdays.

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,474
And now that the big tech companies are liberated  from the fear of losing their customers to their competitors,  

00:37:25,474 --> 00:37:33,264
they have pivoted to out and out and absolutely blatant manipulation, lock-in and abuse of those users.

00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:38,476
Now, there's a there's a thing about the code that does that manipulation, that lock in, that abuse.

00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:45,278
It's all being written by techies.  Techies who discovered their passion for code and for the field 

00:37:45,278 --> 00:37:51,462
When they felt the thrill of self-determination that comes  from writing code and projecting it around the world.

00:37:51,462 --> 00:37:56,568
And these people, their full-time job now - maybe your full-time job -

00:37:56,568 --> 00:38:03,857
is taking away that self-determination that thrilled you and set you on the course to who you are today.

00:38:03,857 --> 00:38:09,417
Taking that away from everyone else, making sure that they never feel that thrill.

00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:12,467
Now, this is a very important fracture line.

00:38:14,151 --> 00:38:21,490
In the last couple of years we have seen mass  walkouts of technologists from the largest firms.  

00:38:21,825 --> 00:38:25,520
Tech Won't Build It, No Tech For Ice, Tech Against Facial Recognition,

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:33,092
solidarity movements between Amazon tech workers and Amazon warehouse workers, union drives at Google and so on.

00:38:33,092 --> 00:38:40,205
Some of these were driven by their own working conditions, the sexual predators who were allowed to function with impunity at Google for example,

00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:45,212
but many were driven by a concern about the wider world that they were living in.

00:38:45,212 --> 00:38:51,680
Now there's a technologist who's a kind of precedent for this, the kind of ur-story of this, and his name is Robert Oppenheimer. 

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,102
Robert Oppenheimer is in some important way the father of the nuclear bomb

00:38:57,102 --> 00:39:03,252
and Oppenheimer managed the Manhattan Project and he was a brilliant physicist.

00:39:03,252 --> 00:39:07,146
And there were a lot of people who were brilliant physicists and there are a lot of people are brilliant managers

00:39:07,146 --> 00:39:11,586
but they were vanishingly few brilliant managers who were also  brilliant physicists

00:39:11,586 --> 00:39:17,557
and Oppenheimer at least, came to believe that but for his complicity the nuke never would have been built

00:39:17,557 --> 00:39:21,037
and Oppenheimer came to regret the nuclear bomb for the rest of his life.

00:39:21,037 --> 00:39:27,939
Indeed, after the first test at Los Alamos, Oppenheimer turned away from it and began to quote the Bhagavad Gita

00:39:27,939 --> 00:39:31,464
he said, "I am become death the destroyer of worlds"

00:39:31,464 --> 00:39:37,061
and he directed his life to fighting against the proliferation of nuclear weapons,

00:39:37,061 --> 00:39:40,147
something that Australians  have been an important part of.

00:39:40,147 --> 00:39:46,099
I used to volunteer every time Helen Caldicott came to town to be an usher in the theater when she spoke.

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,800
So I have spent a lot of my life trying to create Oppenheimer's.

00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,766
In 2006, I wrote a book called 'Little Brother', that came out in 2008.

00:39:56,766 --> 00:40:00,585
If you want to cut back to my camera there, it's this book, 'Little Brother in Homeland'

00:40:00,585 --> 00:40:03,987
and they're books about kids who seize the means of computation.

00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:10,269
Who use technology to enhance human freedom and fight against oppression

00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:16,031
and over the years since I've heard from a lot of readers who said that the way that they became technologists

00:40:16,031 --> 00:40:23,321
or human rights workers who work in the tech space or tech lawyers who who advocate for for human rights in the technological world

00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:28,103
was by reading 'Little Brother' and having that "It will all be so great if we don't screw it up" moment,

00:40:28,103 --> 00:40:35,103
being made alive to the peril and the promise of technology, how great it would be if we didn't screw it up.

00:40:35,103 --> 00:40:39,636
And it's been a source of great pride to me and great comfort.

00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:45,231
When I struggle at night to fall asleep because it seems like the whole world's going to hell in a handbasket,

00:40:45,231 --> 00:40:53,520
I can tell myself at least there are people working in the the field who care  about this stuff and are thinking about it  

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:57,936
because they read my book and that's that's a huge  source of comfort and pride.

00:40:57,936 --> 00:41:06,283
And it came to a head uh when the movie 'Citizenfour' came out,  Laura Poitras's Academy Award-winning documentary about Edward Snowden. 

00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:10,777
And Snowden is on the run.  He's leaving his hotel room in Hong Kong

00:41:10,777 --> 00:41:15,403
and he grabs the stuff he's brought with him and one  of the things he grabs and stuffs in his go   bag

00:41:15,403 --> 00:41:18,296
is 'Homeland', the sequel to 'Little Brother'.

00:41:18,296 --> 00:41:23,573
So I just published the third 'Little Brother' book, as you heard during the intro.

00:41:23,573 --> 00:41:29,600
It's this standalone sequel called uh attack surface and it's a book for adults

00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,905
and the thing that makes it a book for adults is not that it has sex in it.

00:41:32,905 --> 00:41:36,549
Actually doesn't have any sex in it. Little Brother has sex in it because it's for teenagers

00:41:36,549 --> 00:41:44,649
and teenagers go at it like rabbits. This has, not sex. It has coming of age. It has moral reckonings.

00:41:44,649 --> 00:41:51,927
It has a technologist whose life has been devoted to taking away people's freedom with technology,

00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:59,566
confronting what it means to have done that in her career. And I want to address a new generation of technologists,

00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:07,439
people who found themselves through one rationalization after another doing things that they never thought that they would do.

00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:13,158
and I think that's an urgent project because the author's monopoly, the IP,

00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:20,019
is now available not just to record labels or software shops but to everyone, thanks to our embedded system.s

00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:28,529
And what that means is that these technologies aren't just things that lock you in they're things where it's illegal to unlock yourself from them,

00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:32,120
where any attempt to  unlock yourself from them can land you in jail

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,280
Now, Im going to finish up here,  i know I'm at the end of time.  

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,855
And I'm going to finish up by trying to give you some hope.

00:42:40,855 --> 00:42:48,723
The early days of the ecology movement, did not have a movement at all, what it had were issues.

00:42:48,723 --> 00:42:53,648
There were some people who cared about owls and there were some people who cared about the ozone layer

00:42:53,648 --> 00:42:58,579
and there were some people who cared about fresh water but they didn't think that they were all on the same side,

00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:02,800
they thought that they were fighting three different issues and while the people over there who are fighting their issue  

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,851
might be nice people whose hearts were in  the right place

00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:11,338
they weren't fighting the same fight, and what changed... Whoops, I've gone one slide too far.

00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:14,480
What changed was the word 'ecology'.

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,720
The word ecology turned a thousand issues into one movement with a thousand ways to get involved. 

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:26,643
That first Earth Day and the consciousness that it raised, created a huge global movement

00:43:26,643 --> 00:43:28,970
where everyone had everyone else's back.

00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,978
You'll fight for owls and I'd fight for the ozone layer but I'd fight for owls too

00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:35,905
because I knew that you and I were fighting the same fight.

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,200
And we're approaching a moment like that with monopoly, because monopoly is not unique to tech.  

00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,656
Monopoly is in every field. It's in government services

00:43:44,656 --> 00:43:50,120
which is why the Carillion collapse was such a traumatic experience for people in the UK.

00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:58,552
It's in logistics. It's in N95 mass-manufacturing and ventilator manufacturing. It's in heavy earth-moving machinery.

00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:02,818
It's certainly in the energy sector and you and in Australia understand what it means

00:44:02,818 --> 00:44:06,969
when the energy sector has monopoly rents that it can mobilize to distort your policy.

00:44:06,969 --> 00:44:12,326
It's in beer, it's in professional wrestling, it's in spirits, it's in eyeglasses.

00:44:12,326 --> 00:44:15,767
Every field has become dominated by one or two or three companies.

00:44:15,767 --> 00:44:24,673
The U.S is struggling to fill vaccine orders, in part because there's only one company that makes glass bottles left in the United States

00:44:24,673 --> 00:44:31,164
and so that means that as we come to recognize that monopoly is at the root of all of our problems,

00:44:31,164 --> 00:44:37,328
that the consumer harm standard is a sociopath charter, we will come to realize that we have allies everywhere.

00:44:37,328 --> 00:44:45,088
People who don't know that they're angry about the internet being contracted  to five websites filled with screenshots of text from the other four,

00:44:45,088 --> 00:44:47,855
they think they're angry that there's only three record labels left

00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,572
and what they'll realize is that they're on the  same side as us.

00:44:52,572 --> 00:45:00,679
The tech giants like the story that there is something amazing about technology that made it monopolized.

00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:06,233
They will settle for being evil geniuses so long as they get to keep thinking of themselves as geniuses

00:45:06,233 --> 00:45:10,846
But the reality is, that we've been in this place before,

00:45:10,846 --> 00:45:15,987
that the tech giants are just three sociopaths in a trench coat,  they're not a giant at all.

00:45:15,987 --> 00:45:20,797
We know how to deal with monopolies, we dealt with them 100 years ago in the last gilded age.

00:45:20,797 --> 00:45:27,950
We have the toolkit. Tech has its own extra tools in the form of adversarial interoperability, all we need to do is mobilize it.

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,718
So, thank you very much for listening. Thank you for coming. Thank you to the organizers and the volunteers.

00:45:33,718 --> 00:45:39,520
It has been my absolute pleasure to talk to the Southern Hemisphere's Canada. (LAUGHS)

00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,760
Right down to the horrific treatment of the first nations people and the dominance the energy sector  

00:45:46,389 --> 00:45:52,240
I feel like I know your pain (LAUGHS) and I hope you have a wonderful rest of your conference.

00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,514
HOST: Thank you so much Cory. That was fantastic  and I think Tom Eastman who's actually in the conference

00:46:00,514 --> 00:46:02,741
is just celebrating the fact that he was quoted.

00:46:02,741 --> 00:46:04,476
CORY: Aww, I quote him all the time.
