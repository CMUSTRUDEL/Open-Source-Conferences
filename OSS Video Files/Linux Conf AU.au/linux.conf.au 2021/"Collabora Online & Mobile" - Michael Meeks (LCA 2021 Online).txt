Come hear how how Collabora Online has brought LibreOffice
technology to mobile devices and to your web-browser. Hear about:
* adding collaborative editing to a legacy-rich code-base
* Linux security / isolation pieces we use to make that sensible
* how we make that scalable & performant
* the exiting drop-offs of the Web APIs we have to use
* the joys of native JS mapping of UX
* business constraints on engineering: the use of map widgets, for document rendering: you are here → ←, and/or why we’re now Collabora Online.
And of course, get some updates on new user-experience changes, what’s coming next, and how to contribute to our mission of making Open Source rock!

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

welcome everyone

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,480
michael meeks is our next speaker and

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,359
he's speaking about collabora online and

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,039
mobile

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,439
today and he will be taking your

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,480
questions throughout his talk and

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,720
also at the end if this time

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,760
so michael is an enthusiastic open

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,640
source developer

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,559
he runs collabora's office division

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,040
leading collaborates online and office

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,040
products

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,200
supporting customers and consulting on

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,320
kernel development

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,920
alongside an extremely talented team he

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,280
serves as a director

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,960
of the document foundation and on the

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,280
libre office engineering

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,800
steering committee has contributed to

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,800
both odf

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,960
and ooxml standardization

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,559
prior to calabra he gained a wide

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,760
experience as a novel

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,439
soos distinguished engineer working on

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,280
various pieces of free software

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,640
infrastructure

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,000
across the linux stack from the base

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,680
system boot time

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,080
migo nome corber nautilus evolution

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,520
and open source accessibility among

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,600
others

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,200
hear how collaborate online has brought

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,439
libreoffice technology

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,960
to mobile devices and to your web

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,200
browser

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,560
here about adding collaborative editing

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,479
linux security

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,920
business constraints and the latest

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,640
updates

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,280
thanks michael thank you carly uh

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,000
wonderful

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,439
so that's me probably more than he

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,920
wanted to know and here's what i'm going

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,079
to say

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,360
so i'm going to tell you it first but

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,840
maybe that'll help

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,720
um say before i get into quite how it

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,640
works i probably

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,479
want to refresh people's memories in

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,000
case they haven't yet experienced the

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,719
joys of what actually

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,479
the software is so uh let me do that um

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,680
not terribly technical but perhaps

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,320
interesting

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,319
so caleb online is really built on top

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,160
of the awesome libreoffice technology

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,640
underneath there that does all of the

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,239
well much of the hard work here and say

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,440
we provide something on uh

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,480
pc uh obviously mobile and uh well

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,200
tablet

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,319
stuff and it's it's free it's all open

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,319
source it's secure

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,000
interoperable you can collaboratively

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,840
edit as you expect and you can control

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,040
your documents uh on premise and it's

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,200
really a rich

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,640
a wizzy wig editor so i mean here's a

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,160
word processor piece

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,760
and what can you see well you can see

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,080
things you can't do elsewhere say for

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,959
example

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,879
office 365 doesn't have redlining um

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,480
kind of useful in collaborative document

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,560
editing to see who changed warden

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,760
and when something but you know doesn't

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,440
have it amazing so

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,879
so we do little little features like

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,280
that are kind of useful

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,440
um slides you know pretty nice if you

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,440
want to be changing your presentation

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,040
uh master pages or your you know your

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,560
slide layouts in various ways

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,280
and we can do it and you know google

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,599
docs can't and microsoft office can't

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,959
um yeah similarly very powerful

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,400
spreadsheet so you know there's a nice

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,640
you know real spreadsheet engine at the

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,120
back end there obviously uh very useful

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,680
uh

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,360
collaborative work uh financial planning

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,080
creative accounting whatever it is you

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,080
want to do

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,519
i'm obviously working nicely on tablets

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,599
as well um there

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,480
um various bits pulled out and of course

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,680
mobile phones too with a sort of um

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,720
single thumb whatever user experience

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,319
with lots and lots of

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,840
uh functionality there again you know

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,040
things actually try changing a slide

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,080
layout on

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,120
google docs on a phone so you know some

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,200
some pretty rich

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,040
rich stuff there kind of cool so

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,400
well that's what it is another way of

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,760
looking at it is that it's built on top

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
of the libreoffice technology so of

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,000
course you've got that excellent

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,040
interoperability of microsoft

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,239
that comes from libreoffice um

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,840
but actually if you look at the

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,000
competing products out there in the you

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,799
know the proprietary space office 365

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,840
and google docs are really

00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:58,799
re-implementations and very much cut

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,400
down and

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,239
you know they there's a lot of things

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,080
that they don't do so actually we can

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,560
you know we can compete with them and do

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,200
actually far better in many many areas

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,040
um line is kind of a micro service a big

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,480
micro service like it's stateless to a

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,000
large degree you know keep state while

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,680
you're editing a document and it

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,040
saves it away and then you tear it down

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,040
and it's gone

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,400
so um so it really needs something else

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,199
to actually work so it needs to

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,680
integrate with

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,400
file sync and share um so okay next

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,240
cloud c file

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,560
you know there's a moodle lots of these

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,680
things can can embed collaborate online

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,000
inside there and get

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,360
get that benefit um it's quite popular

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,400
so 50 million

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,960
over 50 55 i don't know i get what it is

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,720
now

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,080
uh docker pulls which is which is

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,919
encouraging and

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,600
you know this is this is freedom applied

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,199
so you know use free software get

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,080
control of your documents digital

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,160
sovereignty

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,280
and so on i mean it's also a pragmatic

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,040
solution so you know

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,560
uh yeah as it says the best line of code

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,199
is the one we didn't have to write

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,000
um times you know ten to the seven lines

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,479
of code that's

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,160
already there in libreoffice um much

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,880
better to reuse them than rewrite them

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,440
in a type

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,919
unsafe language like a javascript for

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,759
example

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,759
a disaster of a language everything

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,720
that's wrong about programming codified

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,240
in one

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,880
language you know everything in global

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,600
variables regular expressions searching

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,800
i mean just anyway it's a disaster and

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,840
the architecture

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,680
from another perspective is

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,199
fundamentally a bet on cpu threads and

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,039
network getting cheaper

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,400
this has traditionally been a good bet

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,000
and you know we work with amd and

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,520
various people to optimize for

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,880
bigger and bigger and more exciting more

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,880
threaded processors and so on

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,960
a last way to look at it before i uh

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,479
jump on how we do it is that um

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,479
you know it allows you then to share

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,000
your odf documents

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,320
with everybody so you can use adf

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,680
everywhere or you can use openxml or doc

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,479
or whatever but it all appears in the

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,800
web browser

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,280
you know you get a url and not uh

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,639
install this to use that

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,080
so you know all those deployment

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,880
benefits and so on getting odf

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,720
everywhere

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,319
without needing to encourage the user to

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,080
install something

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,840
whether it's on their phone or tablet or

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,840
pc or something so

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,280
cool stuff um hopefully an end to the i

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,319
couldn't open your the document you

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,120
emailed me

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,240
just send a link and and you're done um

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,560
so that's kind of cool

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,600
but how do we get there how is it even

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,280
possible

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,160
well the first thing we did really was

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,160
to wrap that old libreoffice code

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,600
oh which is modernizing and growing and

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,639
pretty excitingly

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,639
um with a very simple cnc plus api

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,240
so that exposes all of the the good

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,840
stuff in libreoffice the file format

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,360
filters tiled rendering

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,600
um you know editing the editing

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,800
functionality and we made a um

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,960
actually you don't need to link to

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,680
anything it's a header only api

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,039
so it's all in line and it grabs hunts

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,680
around your system finds

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,199
a libreoffice core grabs that and then

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,440
allows you to use it in

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,280
exciting ways and if you ever wondered

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,240
you know what this window new window

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,680
menu does inside your libreoffice

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,080
we basically reuse that this

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,240
multi-window this model view

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,400
controller-ish

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,240
sort of stuff in libreoffice to provide

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,000
this collaborative editing experience

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,080
obviously it was never really designed

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,960
to have multiple controllers um but

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,800
we're working

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,800
working we work with that we strobe that

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,360
in an interesting way

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,520
and our first designer first cut here uh

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,440
was quite cute so we use the the

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,080
leaflet web map widget so it's really a

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,599
map

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,199
so quick amusingly you'll see your

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,280
document twips

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,199
uh so a twit is a twentieth of an inch

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,680
point of course an inch pointed a point

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,120
is um

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,280
well you know the seventy second of an

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,960
inch and so on um the number of units we

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,599
have inside and the conversions between

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,919
quite fun

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,919
but just to add insult to injury once

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,120
you've got hundreds of millimeters and

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,360
twips and points and so on um we then

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,599
convert it to latitude and longitude

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,199
which is the obvious the obvious unit

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,599
for documents and then we showed as a

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,720
map

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,240
and it works really well um but nowadays

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,599
we're rewriting that to replace it by

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,840
perhaps a more uh

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,039
you know coordinately friendly easier to

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,160
maintain and develop

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,319
uh um canvas-based canvas-based

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,520
view instead but anyway we connect that

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,599
browser piece

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,120
through a websocket to this websocket

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,240
demon that then manages a whole load of

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,440
libreoffice kits and i'll talk about

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,479
that in a little bit

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,919
um and so uh you know we push pixels to

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:11,680
the client but the client is pretty

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,360
smart it knows about documents it knows

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,240
what kind of document it's in it can do

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,639
a lot of things

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,560
on the client that then don't require

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,319
going back to the server and indeed

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,080
you know if we if we want to we can

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,560
cache stuff on the on the server so that

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,360
we don't

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,080
even need the libreoffice sitting around

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,840
much of the time

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,360
which is which is kind of cool and the

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,120
things that you would think would suck

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,560
for a remote remoting solution you're

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,159
like cursor blinking

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,760
and it should we be sending blinking

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,599
cursors over the wire you know is that

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,279
is that more pixels to come

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,640
um or you know surrounds for cell

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,640
selections you know we send those

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,640
separately uh text selections

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,480
uh object selection so you can move and

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,360
drag and pan and zoom and

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,399
all of these things select and move

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,399
around the document

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,880
uh nice and quickly which is which is

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,279
kind of cool

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,360
um so so the great thing is that we use

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,200
all of these standard web apis

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,080
isn't that isn't that brilliant so that

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,279
one thing runs everywhere

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,120
unfortunately there's a whole load of

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,800
really horrible parts to the web and one

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
of these is keyboard input we spent

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,600
months

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,440
discovering that all of these uh

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,560
standards that supposedly make

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,560
everything wonderful

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,440
i mean you would think that if you had a

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,720
text box and you're typing into it

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,080
or or even that you didn't have a text

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,680
box you were typing into a web browser

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,640
you would be able to reliably get key

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,519
events

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,320
and see what happens but no this is not

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,760
possible

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,200
you you hide a key entry behind it and

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,200
you know you move it around so

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,880
accessibility technologies are happy

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,560
and you know you should be able to get

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,880
key events out of this thing

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,560
um and there's there's a whole load of

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,920
really promising different events you

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,640
can connect to and listen to and

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,800
several strata of of different apis from

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,560
you know uh but but the reality is that

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,240
even you know sort of adjacent versions

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,080
of the same browser just do different

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,920
weird and wonderful things and it's

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,440
simply not possible to detect

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,920
this stuff without someone typing at the

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,920
keyboard i just mind blowing brokenness

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,040
so you can't reliably construct the text

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,519
say well what do you do

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,120
you have um an entry that's hidden uh

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,720
just a normal entry the space and then a

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,519
different space and you force the cursor

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,800
into the middle

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,160
and that's actually quite hard because

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,640
on a mobile device your keyboard is an

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,040
actual

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,240
outer process another program and it

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,839
likes to go wait a minute you don't want

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,360
to put your cursor there and move it for

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,079
you and so then you fight it to put it

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,240
back again

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,920
and bingo all as well and the reason you

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,600
need two spaces is that otherwise you

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,120
can't tell delete from backspace and if

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,120
your cursor is at the beginning of an

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,800
entry you just don't get events so but

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,920
either way by diffing these things

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,640
and doing the you know unicode uh to

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,200
you know ucs utf-16 conversion and then

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,959
trying to

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,240
deal with combining you can just about

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,399
somehow get keyboard

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,160
input which is kind of cool and then you

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,160
think what about copy and paste

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,720
and you go and try the alternatives this

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,079
is a google docs in in chrome which

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,560
you'd think would work well

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,360
a copy to the left paste to the right um

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,600
this is uh

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,480
office microsoft office again copy to

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,959
the left

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,079
uh paste the right pretty um pretty

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,600
problematic

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,600
and and beyond that i mean you know you

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,399
can only get html text rtf and raw

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
pixels

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,000
i mean not like any image format you can

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,200
put metadata to um

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
but just the the unbelievable brokenness

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,120
here there's all of this

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,440
pseudo security junk in there and you

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,040
need to create things and focus them and

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,720
have timeouts and exec

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,560
commands to do things and then catch

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,480
events and try and work out if you

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,160
actually manage to circumvent the

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,519
ridiculous ways they try and stop you do

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,720
any of these things

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,120
and hey many times you can which is

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,440
kind of totally pointless um but often

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,160
you see these kind of dialogues

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,760
ie 11 had this fantastic approach uh you

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,880
know i have so many bad things to say

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,000
about a11 but they knew what they're

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,720
doing clipboards

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,160
should you allow access to it yeah do

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,880
you trust this page to read your

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
clipboard

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,440
well that would be kind of kind of

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,959
useful if you know you trust the

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
software

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,760
um but they're trying to avoid you know

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,279
people sitting in the background pulling

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,639
your clipboard constantly and stealing

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,399
all your information you know down a

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,279
websocket and stashing it somewhere else

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,279
fair enough

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,279
um and so of course you know chrome

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,639
google ship chrome uh by default

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,959
you know their security teams are

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,480
paranoid they lock it right down so that

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,000
you can't touch your clipboard

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,920
which is great but then the same company

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,720
ships the plugin for google docs

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,720
either basically undoes that uh so you

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,399
know so that you then can use copy and

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,720
paste in your context menus

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,519
and there's all of these weird ac the

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,680
security batch

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,519
situation is just uh it's it's a bit of

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,800
a joke to have one part of the company

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,120
undermining another part of the company

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
and

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,480
you know not connecting but anyway in

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,360
the end of the day since none of this

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,399
really works

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,079
um all you can really do is uh sort of

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,000
shove a back channel into your html

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,639
under the hood to try and make things

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,440
uh work nicely so so we we can actually

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,399
do our rich

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,800
copy paste very nicely uh but it's

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,720
pretty

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,560
it's pretty funky uh behind the scenes

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,240
uh you know you have to refetch the data

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,120
in all of the myriad of formats we

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,560
support

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,959
and you know to the clients and then

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,720
push it back to wherever it's going to

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,720
but that works that works pretty nicely

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,600
so mobile um yeah mobile is good fun

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,760
right so

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,600
i don't know um you you'd think it would

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,320
be easy getting it to work on mobile

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,519
ultimately we we uh have tried for a

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,200
long time to do this

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,120
um about a decade together i think the

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,720
document foundation funded our first

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,720
attempt there with this fenech we use

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,440
the fenech browser a base because that

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,279
provided a nice tiled rendering

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,920
you know infrastructure underneath and

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,279
we wrote our ui in java

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,600
that's great of course until you want to

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,279
port it to ios

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,120
and you know it really took a decade i

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,480
mean so cross-compilation obviously is

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,600
not not a trivial thing

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,880
um but we got that sorted uh the android

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,120
c plus plus libraries

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,480
uh broken so you know you had to search

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,399
around memory find bits of broken

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,199
assembler and patch them dynamically

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,120
in in line while you're doing it um

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,040
libreoffice has this wonderful you know

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,720
modular system where you can dynamically

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,600
load bits of code as you need them very

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,440
efficient

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,519
um you know reduces the amount of code

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,040
you need to ship and problem is android

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,399
has this limit or at least had this

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,279
limit of fixed limit

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,399
compiled in 96 shared libraries and and

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,000
an unknown of system

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,839
number of system libraries so you really

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,959
don't know quite quite how many shed

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,160
libraries you get

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,920
and the best thing is you can't tell

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,720
either so it just crashes when you get

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,240
hit the limit

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,079
um which is which is kind of good you

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,519
know dl open segfault

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:23,360
end of app um so then huge

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,959
infrastructural change inside to try and

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,320
re-architect and not use these shared

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,440
libraries and be able to link it all

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,279
into one big

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,600
a blob and then garbage collect stuff we

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,680
don't use out of it using the linker

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,639
so in the end a much better solution but

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,480
um yeah

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,680
pretty nice a lot of profiling work

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,120
there

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,199
but ultimately this java thing didn't

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,000
work terribly well and

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,519
we needed a mobile ui for a responsive

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,160
ui anyway for our

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,040
online stuff so well so we embedded a

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,800
webkit

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,160
switched to online uh using libreoffice

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,839
kit and it's all easy right

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,600
except well of course you need a new

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,040
user experience so for years i've been

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,120
you know talking about

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,079
the joys of glade and repurposing user

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,160
experiences well

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,160
many years ago two decades ago

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,839
repurposing your ui for different form

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,360
factors and hey we're actually doing it

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,160
so the sidebar here

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,639
um which you may see is familiar from

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,639
well

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,480
um libreoffice uh people people know it

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,760
um we can now wrap that as you can see

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,760
on the left into these uh

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,600
this palette where there's uh let me try

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,000
and get my mouse so this is essentially

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,399
the

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,760
sidebar headings here uh and inside them

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,279
we we wrap and present

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,519
you know obviously a different look but

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,880
a similar arrangement um to

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,320
to the sidebars though which for that

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,199
provides a lot of the the raw

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,720
functionality

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,360
that we can bring and you know just a

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,160
much better a better way of doing

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,920
doing things than well the alternatives

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,720
so making the secure well how do we do

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,839
that

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,680
um so well

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,120
see one of the ironies here of course is

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,639
that we need capabilities in order to

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,480
secure ourselves and then we drop them

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,000
again but lots of containment strategies

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,000
don't like to give you the capabilities

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,680
you like uh so so you know you want to

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,040
be able to ch root that's really

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,639
kind of important um but you know some

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,759
paranoids won't allow you to do the

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,959
things you need to do but

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,040
in the ideal situation we see h root um

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,720
we copy our document into this ch root

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,399
we have a setcomp epf filter that

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,160
filters all your system calls

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,600
and all the dodgy ones we we don't allow

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,560
i guess this is kind of standard for a

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,399
container

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,600
solution you know if you look at docker

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,199
or things like this

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,360
but inside rch there's just nothing

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,399
there's no shell there's no useful

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,320
capabilities

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,320
there's just a handful of nss shared

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,480
libraries things that we can't easily

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,839
um pre-load because the system really

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,160
looks for them a few fonts

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,399
and your document data so knock yourself

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,120
out you know escape

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,320
escape our code you know try and find uh

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,079
some uh you know

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,079
stack smash and you'll find you have

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,639
access to absolutely nothing

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,160
which is kind of nice and pixels pour

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,399
out of that at speed

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,079
but but what speed you know how can we

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,639
make this efficient on scale i'm sure

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,560
many of you've

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,959
used libreoffice and there's often a

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,079
perception from the pre-ssd world but

00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,920
it's very big

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,440
and and you know i've worked a lot on

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,800
accelerating at startup but

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,959
you know have you ever started a java

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,520
application you know and yet our java

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,919
servers

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,839
you know once started up and jitted all

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,520
that stuff are actually relatively fast

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,839
um and we we have a similar thing here

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,400
so we we actually put a lot of

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,079
we burn a lot of resource as we start up

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,039
um to make sure that incremental

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,280
uh clients are much smaller say we you

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,559
know we link everything as we as we

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,120
start we load all our config

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,919
dictionaries all of this good stuff

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,559
and we we choo chew up memory uh in

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,559
order to

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,480
uh be able to copy on write it or you

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,799
know clone it into all the children

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,320
and then we fork it's a pretty nice tool

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,880
here that we wrote as well for looking

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,640
at

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,160
um you can give it a process and it will

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,039
look at its parent process that it

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,880
forked from

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,080
and it would analyze all of the pages

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,400
and show you where

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,280
you've touched pages that caused them to

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,440
be copied

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,039
and it'll do a hex dump and a decimal

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,760
dampen so here you can see actually this

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,799
is a

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,400
this is a one of our string classes

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,000
uh and it will say oh wait a minute

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,360
that's um that's a string class

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,200
and seriously from this we discovered

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,039
really wanted to staticize our strings

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,640
which which kind of ref counted but

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,320
just touching the reference count is not

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,520
your friend if you have to copy a 4k

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,520
page to do it

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,120
so so we effectively staticize these we

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,760
put a tag on all of our strings saying

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,360
yeah

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,960
those are the ones we did at start up

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,960
don't touch them you know don't allocate

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,480
more memory in these these arenas

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,240
uh you know let's let's go do something

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,720
else and so you know speeds up

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,039
referencing removes atomic operations

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,320
saves memory uh you know it's all kind

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,600
of good

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,880
um yeah and so you know you can also end

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,360
up with a ridiculous situation where

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,520
you've

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,039
you've done something to the data but

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,400
you know actually you haven't really won

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,840
you just duplicated the page you

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
restored it to its original state and

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,160
you've got like

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,240
well nearly you know three quarters of a

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,440
meg of just waste

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,440
and then of course you want to you know

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,960
benchmark it and measure it so this is a

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,919
nice you know like before you before you

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,440
start looking at it

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,799
uh you wonder what's going on you know

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,400
why are we why are we using all this

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,480
memory you know we're just rendering

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,679
bits of document how can it be so

00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,120
exciting and then

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,559
you know you start reading the code and

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,840
you discover you know these numbers are

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,000
arbitrary we've never done any

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,720
measurements still in libpix man

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,280
since may 2012 or cairo which has a

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,559
similar

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,760
thing you know all of the software on

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,880
your machine you're running now it's

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,559
going through these

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,080
these kind of comments that you discover

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,880
when you you know start looking under

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,039
the hood

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,280
and so we have some internal patches to

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,720
well better tweak that for our workloads

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,160
make sure that we're not blowing up a

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,640
huge caches but when you consider these

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,120
caches a per process anyway

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,880
on linux yeah it's interesting i'm so

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,120
you know you then get a much better

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,720
much better picture and analyzing that

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,160
you can break that down i mean heap is

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,720
only one way to burn ram but

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,600
it's a popular one um so you know we can

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,880
get this kind of

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,720
base simple test down to five meg real

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,880
guess something like 50 mega dock

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,520
documents something like that that's

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,679
concurrently uh editing

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,840
so you know then we want to scale it so

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,919
we scale it with a

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,840
setups hd proxy is a very simple

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,559
architecture no database

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,760
no message bus no shared data storage so

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,440
these things are entirely independent

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,520
they store their data of course into say

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,120
a next cloud or an own cloud

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,640
and we have users out there like gmx

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,559
that one-on-one have you know millions

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,200
of users with access to this stuff

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,679
are using the code uh at the back end

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,120
which is

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,960
yeah that's kind of cool it scales it

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,880
scales with a network um our

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,640
collaboration protocol is kind of simple

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,520
we bring everything into asynchronous

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,480
single process

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,200
bingo it's all consistent there is one

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,799
model

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,320
uh you know use none of this going at

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,440
the speed of the slowest or anything

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,720
like that it's all

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,799
it's all there and um computer

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,080
scientists gets hyper excited about this

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,880
google wave

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,600
uh composable operations blah blah blah

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,880
blah

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,480
all of it's nonsense in my view um

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,159
it's just just not useful i mean the

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,880
real world use cases most of the time

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,200
the u the

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,720
key function of collaborative editing is

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,679
to make sure that you are editing the

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,000
real document

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,799
and and not a copy of it or problem

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,240
somewhere else

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,760
and so you look at the stats almost

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,480
always it's one person editing one

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,919
document

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,120
but some of the time there are meetings

00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,480
and minutes and those things and

00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,440
occasionally you get multiple users

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,080
editing it

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,200
and yeah i mean i don't know operations

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,520
just don't work you

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,799
the the uh fundamentally you get

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,840
conflicts that aren't computer

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,520
resolvable

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,840
and possibly you need an ai to resolve

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:15,520
them you know even even simple ones

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,960
never mind complicated ones so

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,400
yes bringing all the keystrokes and

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,080
mouse movements into the same process

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,960
same memory space same cpu makes

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,520
everything very

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,640
easy and it works um it's really good

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,159
it's deployed out there i think we have

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,960
something like a half a million

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,240
um paying users out there um which is

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,960
just worth having

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,799
and uh yeah so and this is a picture of

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,919
surf drive which have a particularly

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,679
nice uh installation of 45 000 users

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,840
i typically we find that it uses less

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,559
resource much less resource than the big

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,799
database clusters and object stores and

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,760
hardware to process the web front ends

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,440
for

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,720
your enterprise file sync solution so

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,120
attack it on the side with some spare

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,120
hardware

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,559
yeah and of course if you're on a mobile

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,000
phone you know doing it on

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,919
doing work on the battery downloading a

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,679
javascript solution running it locally

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,280
jitting it downloading the whole

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,000
document and

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,520
interpreting that and rendering it is is

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,360
not necessarily fast it doesn't

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,919
necessarily save battery and it doesn't

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,480
necessarily work particularly better so

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,640
you know we

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,159
we can be quicker and faster to

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,440
calculate big data sets obviously for

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,799
any large document we don't need to

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,799
bring the whole document down so

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,000
so how is it going so that's the basic

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,120
outline um but

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,039
we've been doing lots of things one

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,679
thing is making easier to install

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,360
so i'm having pre-canned demo servers

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,240
online that can grab your data

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,960
um and render it for you and demo uh

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,559
documents

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,000
obviously with big caveats you know

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,000
you'd have to hand your data to our

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,280
well you know our partners test servers

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,559
and to explain that

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,640
but of course that means your your

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,159
server has to be publicly rootable

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,320
so that's the problem so we spent a lot

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,120
of time building a nice one-click

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,799
install

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,559
um that integrates with php i have a

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,919
talk about this at

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,159
fosdem shortly if you're particularly

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,760
interested in this um but it's it's a

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,600
whole chunk of code primarily because

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,360
php has a totally different life cycle

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,919
mechanism and it throws away the whole

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,280
service state after every request

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,200
well and it constructs it on every

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,000
request as well which is insanely

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,640
expensive

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,159
but but kind of cool um but by using

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,799
keeper live websockets we can emulate

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,600
this web

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,120
web socket uh sorry keep live https with

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,520
me web sockets

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,799
and actually we can provide pretty

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,559
wonderful latency

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,159
um and you can have a download app image

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,760
that just runs in the background on your

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,559
arbitrary web server which is kind of

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,840
cool

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,600
and so 640 other new stuff um so a

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,640
notebook bar as we call it sort of a

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,760
more familiar

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,880
ui for people some people like familiar

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,960
uis like that

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,240
obviously if you want a more traditional

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,559
thing i mean so you can look at google

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,400
docs versus office 365

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,919
choose which you like knock yourself out

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:53,840
um it's you know each each to their own

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:56,320
and freeze notebooks uh free throws

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,960
smart art improvements uh pdf search so

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,559
you can

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,960
you can send your pdf to people and have

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,640
collaboration and annotation around that

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,320
um so you know maybe you can't edit the

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,200
pdf but you can

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,760
do all sorts of cool stuff with it um

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,840
what else

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,960
new new things coming here uh chart

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,640
editing

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,400
improved sidebar stuff primarily for the

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,799
phone wrapping it in there

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,520
just better dialogues pivot table

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,919
creation

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,360
and editing we always could render and

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,960
refresh pivot tables but

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,640
bringing these dialogues and actually

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,320
these dialogues are now using um

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,880
a json description on the server side

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,520
and then they can be themed and rendered

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,480
on the client either for mobile or for

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,679
handheld

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,200
many many of the dialogues are still

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,039
pixel rendered on the server but

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,520
increasingly this is the way we're going

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,520
uh to make make things well slicker and

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,400
more themeable and more beautiful

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,080
um calc named ranges managing that

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,799
statistical tools of all

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,600
kinds moving areas smoothing analysis of

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,120
variance

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,679
and lots of other stuff you know faster

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,520
rendering better interactivity

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,279
caching slides in every direction as you

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,240
move around

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:01,440
huge cypress testing work you know tests

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,200
for almost everything

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,799
i can't tell you you know three and a

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,600
half thousand commits worth in

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,960
in one or five slides but there's lots

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,799
of work going on there

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,159
and uh you know getting getting the uh

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,279
the mobile things working better

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,679
particularly the tablet

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,559
uh thing for ios it's just much improved

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,880
now

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,919
started dark mode half a million plus

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,080
installs

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,919
uh chromebooks so we're using android's

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,120
uh chrome os integration which is far

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,200
from perfect but but

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,799
getting getting better and so you can

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,559
then run effectively well it's an

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,679
android app but because we're reusing

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,000
all of the code

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,760
android app also is a pc you know got a

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,600
full pc office productivity suite

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,679
in it underneath it so you can use that

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,600
on your educational setting with your

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,360
moodle or you know and you can run it

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,080
natively so it'll work offline or you

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,080
can connect

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,080
through your browser to your say moodle

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,240
or whatever and collaboratively edit

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,279
in your browser which is kind of cool of

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,720
course there are some people who say i

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:55,440
want to be able to not have an internet

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,440
connection and collaboratively edit

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,200
but they can um well anyway these things

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,760
happen these people get everywhere

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,919
um my style guides to make the ux look

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,120
beautiful and all consistent and then a

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,600
special api to

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,279
well configure the ui how you like and

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,080
to then change all of the colors so that

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,919
they uh

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,360
well you know they they fit better with

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,039
your integration so

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,720
all sorts of little bits that you can

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,440
shove in around the iframe from the

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,840
integration in to make it look prettier

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,960
um so that's that's pretty nice because

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,480
people want to

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,360
you know so well anyway this is this is

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,520
before uh in next cloud in terms of

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,600
what's there and then after you know so

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,400
you can configure the rulers off some

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,120
sidebar um change change the document

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,559
colors

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,159
change some of the highlight colors and

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,360
increasingly you know we're looking at

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,240
communities looking at doing this for

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,720
icons

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,320
and you know the content of various

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,360
things highlights and icons so you just

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,919
get a very

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,480
consistent feel of a native piece of

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,159
your

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,840
integration so

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,200
well this is an interesting problem how

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,679
do you how do you make all of this stuff

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,279
work how do you uh

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,480
how do you encourage people to put money

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,080
in and make things happen here

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,360
and uh yeah well it's a pretty

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,520
interesting question if you look at the

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,960
ideas around calabro online

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,880
you know they're not terribly new uh

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,919
we'd had them when we actually created

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,159
libreoffice back in

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,799
our first paris conference i had a

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,880
hacked up a gt gdk broadway uh based

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,720
prototype so alex alex larson red hat

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,279
created this thing to allow gtk apps to

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,039
be

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:26,799
used over the network a 2011.

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,640
good and it rotted and rotted and rotted

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,440
until finally we got the investment to

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,159
do this

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,480
um and so we managed in 2016 to ship the

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,159
first version of this of any single user

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,399
um and of course it then improved and

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,399
improved but um

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,000
well i i still think economics rocks i

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,640
mean you know communities are cool

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,399
um and i love being part of one um you

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,080
know working volunteers and helping

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,679
mental people and you know having fun

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,880
together is awesome

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,080
and of course actually we try and do

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,600
that inside the company as well

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,799
obviously you know with

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,840
oh with some success um but you know

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,320
ultimately the end of the day that

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,919
investment is needed to get any kind of

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,240
uh real heavy lifting traction um

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,440
and you know it costs millions of euros

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,880
to do it so

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,799
you know if you're gonna put your

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,120
pension into uh software

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,880
um you would like the software to pay

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,120
something back uh when you invest it's

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,360
uh kind of useful if there's a return

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,559
um so that one side of the business

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,840
equation but i guess the on the other

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,799
side of the business equation is that

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,880
whole

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,640
you know do we have a perfectionism you

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,159
know ship it when it's ready you know or

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,320
ship it when it's perfect um

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,760
versus release early and iterate and try

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,080
and get something that will

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,880
get attracted attract people to improve

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,880
it and help

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,240
help and so on and how do you do that

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,720
how can you get a technical release

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,720
schedule

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,000
that works and there's lots of

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,360
interesting things i mean i think the

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
time based

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,760
the time-based release schedules are you

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,240
know really really important

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,279
uh to you know to help with that but but

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,720
at the end of the day you know you're

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,960
gonna you need something

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,919
that provides an economic driver to

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,159
allow you to

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,000
to sell something and and i guess in

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,240
open source the the traditional point of

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,440
proprietization is the trademark

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,240
um you know you can do anything you like

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,760
with the software but the brand you know

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,000
you can't call it red hat enterprise

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,799
linux you can't call it well

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,600
you can't call it even ubuntu um unless

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,039
you you know

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,799
comply with these things and you know

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,320
that that's how we sell right

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,919
that's the that's the piece that's the

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,840
value and so it's really really

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,960
important to them i guess to get those

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,640
things aligned

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,159
and and you know we tried to do that um

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,880
inside libreoffice community well here's

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,640
a picture of

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,799
some of the awesome people there uh you

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,600
know and many of these people are

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,039
my my great good friends and but we

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,000
still disagree sometimes i mean let's

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,919
let's face it

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,440
um when you look at the picture of who's

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,120
putting the investment in that's the

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,640
commits for the last year well maybe

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,000
yeah it's diversified more actually

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,960
interestingly since we moved it out of

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,480
docking foundations

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,480
there's many more commits from

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,480
volunteers which is interesting

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:57,520
um but uh yeah 97 97 collabora

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,200
so we moved decided to move um away from

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,520
the libreoffice table and put this on on

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,120
github and have a collaborate online

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,200
a story really to get that just that

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,159
clear brand uh so that you know when

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,399
you're looking for this

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,679
well you look to calabra and not to a

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,600
free version

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,039
uh from another much more i mean the

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,320
libreoffice brand is very well known

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,480
amazingly we've done a lot of work to

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,720
try and drive it and build it over years

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,919
and it overtook open office after about

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,720
six five six years

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,039
in terms of the google trend curve um

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,240
but

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,720
you know the brand is incredibly

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,600
powerful and you know to try and compete

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,679
with yourself

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,120
called something else in a way that's

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,960
just unconscionable

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,399
um in terms of actually helping to uh

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,200
you know promote investment and we need

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,720
more

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,240
we need more investment to make software

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,640
better that's for sure

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,320
so we decided to move it and unwind kind

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,840
of a long-running conflict about

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,840
how that should be positioned at the

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,279
document foundation

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,640
and because that's clear that allowed us

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,480
to remove a reminder we had a reminder

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,760
and code which i guess is the fedora to

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,919
rel

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,679
that would try and encourage people to

00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,760
to buy support when they

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,440
when they were using a lot of users um

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,799
on the same server

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,200
i mean he'll grow the the pool of

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,440
developers um and

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,399
you know i'm i still love libreoffice

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,360
you know there's lots of

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,720
lots of good things there and the

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,519
document foundation is doing really well

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,440
like i think

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,440
we got something like 1.3 million euros

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,039
in donations we raised last year

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,640
something like up 30 just from the

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,440
desktop product so

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,679
there's luckily not a scarcity at that

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,799
that side of the equation

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,000
and this really tackles the free

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,679
compliments problems so the three

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,880
compliments is i mean if you read joel

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,760
on software

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,039
um everybody wants a free compliment so

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,240
you know one of the great attractions if

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,760
you're a hardware vendor

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,960
is to have a free operating system

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,320
because people don't just buy your

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,120
hardware they need to run an operating

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,559
system on it

00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,240
and if you can get the price down of the

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,159
operating system then you can

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,679
defend your price for the hardware so

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,320
this is the basic free compliment

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,240
problem

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,240
and i think in open source we have these

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,960
these very significant problems

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,919
of people deploying free uh floss out

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,760
there and not

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,360
and not contributing back so i'm fine as

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,559
long as people contribute back

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,760
and you know and they're competent and

00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:59,120
they support it and they do a good job

00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,120
deploying it but

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,799
i think we really need i need to at

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,960
least see this problem but some

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,799
proportion of the people who are saying

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,720
you know you should have an unbelievably

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,600
onerous but apparently freedom loving

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,600
license

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,880
for your software some proportion these

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,120
people are just trying to sell you

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,799
like shortcuts around the license so

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,320
they love to make it more onerous

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,840
and some proportion of people are saying

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,279
ah but it's all free and it should be

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,960
all free wonderfully

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,279
i really just trying to drive the price

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,200
of that to zero so they can sell their

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,320
training installation consultancy

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,360
for more money and so the people wearing

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,320
the hat marked

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,120
good guy uh you know i am the what every

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,320
person

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,760
um is uh yeah not necessarily it's

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,480
interesting to look at the motivations

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,919
of them

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,919
at least you know from a marketing

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,559
perspective it's it's very important to

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,080
try and

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,760
encourage people to contribute either

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,399
whether you know directly as individuals

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,480
or

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,399
you know doing so many people do so much

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,000
contributing it's a shame that those

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,840
some of those companies who have the

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,840
most resource and are saving in some

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,760
cases millions of dollars

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,200
are not encouraged to actually

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,120
contribute and at the document

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,320
foundation we're starting to try and um

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,919
fix this as well so of course i'm still

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,240
the director of the document foundation

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,440
um

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,600
and we're trying to fix this by trying

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,039
to encourage people that you know

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,720
libreoffice is awesome and you should

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,159
use it definitely but really you should

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,760
get an enterprise supported version

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,039
and try you know we've been giving that

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,840
message for years and years and no one

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,440
listens

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,960
uh you know and we don't want to make

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,679
the software worse obviously because

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,840
that would suck

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,600
so how can we how can we market this in

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,480
a way that is more obvious

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,600
for for casual you know well-meaning

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,720
enterprise users who want to do the

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,840
right thing

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,200
so there's a little bit of rebranding

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,080
there libreoffice community that's

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,640
coming

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,600
um and you know we'll see what happens

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,360
there but

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,960
either way there's an issue and that at

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,760
least makes caliber online similar to

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,519
you know

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,000
many of the other enterprise file sync

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,760
and share pieces that we depend on

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,279
you know it's a very clear flow of users

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,919
through the project obvious place of

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,919
support

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,120
clear credit given in the product name

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,279
and you don't need complexity and

00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,120
competing vendors warring inside a

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:02,399
project to try and work out how that

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:04,799
lead flow and marketing relevance

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,559
works you know like do you give equal

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,079
billing to everyone this guy did one

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,480
line of code and this guy's

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,919
done the rest how do you do that how do

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,040
you manage that how do you

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:15,280
you know it's these are difficult

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,480
problems it's not it's not clear to me

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,399
but but all i can say at the end of the

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,280
day is when you look at the uh you know

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,440
the value there

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,879
again there's huge value in the software

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,639
um

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,240
the free and open source companies

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,440
really have very few assets they have

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,280
the cash

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,280
in the bank if they have uh cash in the

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,639
bank or their you know their debts their

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,399
friendly

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,000
creditors um and their brands of course

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,520
uh and perhaps then their relationships

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,440
with their you know customers and

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,720
employees and staff and so on this is

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,000
more than just that

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,679
um but you know that return on

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,399
investment that they put in is really

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,679
important

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,599
and the most obvious route for that of

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,839
course is via you know trademark and

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,879
brand i guess

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,399
so anyway we we moved to uh well github

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,960
which is kind of cool but you know i

00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,040
love that

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,320
you know he's doing some great work and

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,320
you know loads of people

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,079
jumped in and helped out and it's really

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,839
great to see that growing

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,599
if you play with git pods you can you

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,359
know you can get something running

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,200
almost immediately no need to install

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,960
anything runs in the web browser

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,240
virtual machine at the back end ready to

00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,079
hack editor there

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,000
so it's just very easy to get in and do

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,680
an easy hack and well get out again

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,400
although we hope you would stay

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,160
so uh yeah but of course you know like

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,359
98 percent of the code that we have here

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,040
or is it 97

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,720
some very large proportion is

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,200
libreoffice underneath and so you know

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,680
the

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,880
of libreoffice is vital to well it's

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,560
always been vital to collaborate

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,079
productivity but it's also important for

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,079
collaborating online

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,359
and so you know we contribute on both

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,960
sides uh heavily

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,480
so yeah get involved there are great

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,400
ways to uh to

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,839
great pointers there to do that and

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,839
there's lots of easy hacks on

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,359
both sides um there's some language

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,359
choices if you're more of a javascripty

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,920
css designer person then maybe it's

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,119
good in online or just helping on on the

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,640
libreoffice community

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,720
web properties and so on lots lots of

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,320
things to do there and yeah we have

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,839
weekly meetings so we'd love to uh love

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
to hear from you here is a whole load of

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,640
team

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,960
uh collaborators mission is to make open

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,800
source rock i will end the calabre

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,160
uh well it's more complicated than that

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,200
but that's the basic punch line and you

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,480
know we'd love to help

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:18,160
help you uh help us do that

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,079
um what else conclusions yeah so well

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,440
it's easy to deploy so i guess that's

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,680
that's one thing that perhaps i didn't

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,440
label too much but you know alternate

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,960
solutions a real pain

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,920
you know like and we mercifully reuse

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,520
other people's

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,720
hard labor so you wouldn't believe how

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,720
complicated it is just to do

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,640
authentication

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,320
you know there's there's zamel and

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,480
there's all there's all these weird

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,480
weird ways of doing just

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,560
simple authentication you know from your

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,119
kerberos tickets to your ldaps to your

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,599
whatever

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,280
and it's all all really tough stuff and

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,440
similarly object storage you would think

00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,839
it was simple to store objects or simple

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,160
to run clustered databases with metadata

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,200
and

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,280
all this sort of stuff um but it isn't

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,040
um and so in consequence we we try and

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,240
avoid that at all costs we give this

00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,079
problem to other people

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,440
who are experts at it and we love to

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:06,640
partner with them so

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,240
um so you know by the time you've

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,880
deployed your next cloud cluster or your

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,880
own cloud

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,240
you know clustered scalable redundant

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,160
highly available

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,160
solution uh you know it's just trivial

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,560
to uh to drop a calibral line on top of

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,599
that

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,640
um it really is very simple and

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,000
you know and the good thing is you can

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,440
use the same thing for your moodle

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,760
server and your matamos

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,440
and your next cloud for example um the

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,200
same one instance of this cluster thing

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,240
to serve all of those things

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:33,440
simultaneously which is kind of elegant

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,960
it allows you to get control of your

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,000
data and documents don't give them to a

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,520
large

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,040
monopoly uh of whichever flavor um based

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,359
in america instead keep them

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,079
you know on your premise i ideally on

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,320
your network

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,079
on your own cpu in your own ram that you

00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,000
control not something you're row

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,440
hammering sharing with a

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,599
korean north korean whatever um

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,720
who knows who has access to other

00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,000
servers you're running on

00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,760
i mean it's really easy to integrate if

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,119
you have a web app you know you can

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,040
theme it and make it your own

00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,400
you can customize it and we'd love to

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,839
help with that

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,960
um it's relatively uh low load uh on the

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:10,400
server compared with

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,480
you know the things that integrates with

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,640
these these other solutions

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,000
um it's improving very quickly and we've

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,280
created it but with a generous

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,200
generous help with lots and lots of

00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,440
people so check out the credits there

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,320
um we love to have contributions it's

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,000
based on the

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,520
awesome libroffice technology and we're

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,440
very grateful for

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,760
like

00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,720
two minutes

00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,800
[Music]

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,000
yes you finished in time for questions

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,880
thank you michael

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,920
i'm actually interested in um looking at

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:58,320
collaborative for makerspace adelaide

00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:01,440
for our administration office there

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,920
cool and we have a question another

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,680
question

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,079
is any interest in bringing

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,520
base a database tool into the online

00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,800
offering

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,320
good so uh yes so well everybody tells

00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,320
me that you shouldn't use spreadsheets

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,320
for databases

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,000
that's very very true um and and so we

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,000
have a database tool inside

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:26,079
um libreoffice ah

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,359
yeah but it's kind of a java beast uh

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,280
primarily i mean so there's a

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,560
sequel db is the default backend which

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,480
is a kind of naughty naughty

00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,359
java database um we have a firebird back

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,040
end there that's

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,400
at least c plus plus so there's a chance

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,440
you can do some of these you know like

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,280
forking and

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,720
memory sharing and pieces in it

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,400
effectively but

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,079
um you know at the end of the day if you

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,320
look at google or you know one of those

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,560
data entry things you know like the quiz

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,680
survey thing where you you do a web page

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,960
and it

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,640
actually all goes into a spreadsheet the

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,960
back end and don't you know it you know

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,480
that

00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,480
there is a spreadsheet again being used

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,160
as the database incredibly useful i'd

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,800
love to have that kind of functionality

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,880
just to

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,240
collect collect information do quick

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,319
surveys

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,839
um you know get involved uh you know

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,720
help us help us build that

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,599
um but i think the database eps i think

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,040
there are so

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,240
so many good web tools out there to do

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,079
this

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,920
um but i really don't know that we would

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,640
add huge value there but if you have a

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,800
use case

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,880
you know and uh you know i don't know

00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,520
and there's a customer wants that

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,480
obviously we'd look at it but you know i

00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,000
don't know

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,440
yeah i i don't think it's something

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,160
wreaks out does that make sense i'm like

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,480

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,160
