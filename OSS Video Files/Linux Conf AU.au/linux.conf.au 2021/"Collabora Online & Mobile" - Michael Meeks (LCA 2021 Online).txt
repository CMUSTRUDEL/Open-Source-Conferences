Come hear how how Collabora Online has brought LibreOffice
technology to mobile devices and to your web-browser. Hear about:
* adding collaborative editing to a legacy-rich code-base
* Linux security / isolation pieces we use to make that sensible
* how we make that scalable & performant
* the exiting drop-offs of the Web APIs we have to use
* the joys of native JS mapping of UX
* business constraints on engineering: the use of map widgets, for document rendering: you are here → ←, and/or why we’re now Collabora Online.
And of course, get some updates on new user-experience changes, what’s coming next, and how to contribute to our mission of making Open Source rock!

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/
