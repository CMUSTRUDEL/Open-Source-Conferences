well hello friends in australia this is

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,599
corey doctorow and i'm so excited that

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,360
i'm going to get a chance to finally

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,200
come to linuxconf

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,800
uh that is a thing that we've been

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,000
trying to make happen for many years and

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,240
it took a pandemic

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,520
that obviated the need for flying

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,560
halfway around the world to make it

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,080
happen

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,599
um i've been thinking a lot about what

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,640
i'm going to talk to you about

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,599
as a canadian who lives in the u.s

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,079
i feel a lot of affinity for a country

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,680
whose

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,640
economy is grounded in settler

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,239
colonialism and resource extraction

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,280
haunted by uh the hegemonic power of

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,800
multiple colonial masters where

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,559
uh surveillance and increased inequality

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,360
are all shaping the political situation

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,559
and you know as we're at this digital

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,520
crossroads

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,879
through the pandemic and it's aftermath

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,320
where we've gone through this phase

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,719
change where everything

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,559
we did used to involve the internet now

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,799
everything we do requires it

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,920
getting digital policy right is

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,640
important in a way

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,080
that has just leapfrogged all of our

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,799
conceptions about the urgency of the

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,840
task in years gone by

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,479
and i'm going to talk about how

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,680
the free software movement and how

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:26,400
software freedom them

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:30,000
itself is the crux of human liberty

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,439
in a digitally enabled world and how

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,840
what might have started for you as a

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,720
hobby or just a better way to make code

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,320
work

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,920
has become an ethical project

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,079
of enormous urgency and timeliness

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,680
and and i hope to start a conversation

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,360
that you have

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:53,040
about not just the minutiae of licensing

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,560
or the uh workflow

00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,640
of distributed workforces on big

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,000
free software projects but also about

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,799
the way that your work could set us onto

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,039
a path

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:12,080
to a world after the pandemic

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,280
that confronts the great emergencies

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,599
of our planet and our species so

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,720
i'm really looking forward to seeing you

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,800
and

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,720
again i'm very honored to have been

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,440
invited to keynote again

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,040
your organizers are nothing if not

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:33,440
persistent

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,440
