Sustainable open source starts with building sustainable communities. If our workplaces and our communities aren't sustainable then our projects won't be either. Constant chaos and breakneck speeds can only occasionally create sustainable projects, by accident. The next generation of software production will need to lean into relationship building, mission sharing and strategic planning. This talk will explore:

    How projects can get ready for the long haul
    Why resiliency starts with inter-dependency
    How slower structures enable stronger communities

Many of us are doing many of the things that help build sustainable projects already, but what if we could be more intentional? Certain structures and norms can make it hard to implement positive changes even when good ideas come up. Shared leadership and mission-driven organizations offer solid structures for sustainable communities and sustainable software development. Mutual respect and humane working conditions are how we'll create a culture that values both experience and institutional memory while encouraging new people and new ideas. Let's slow down for sustainability!

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,320
uh we're here today with deb nicholson

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,880
so deb nicholson is a free software

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,920
policy expert and a passionate community

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,840
advocate

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,519
she is the general manager at the open

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,160
source initiative which stewards the

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,399
open source

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,480
definition and works to erase raise

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,280
awareness and adoption of open source

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,600
software

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,920
she is also a founding organizer of the

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,320
seattle new linux conference

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,239
an annual event dedicated to surfacing

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,840
new voices and welcoming new people to

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,600
the free software community

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,320
she lives with her husband and her lucky

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,800
black cat in cambridge massachusetts

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,360
so uh deb will be taking questions at

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,680
the end

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,960
if there is time if you have a question

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,440
you'd like to ask deb

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,000
please type it into the tux theater text

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,840
chat

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,080
with the word question in the front and

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,880
all caps so we can find it

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,720
thank you deb take it away all right i

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,640
gotta say i appreciate the

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,640
seagulls in the background as soon as

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,760
you announced the siegel event that i'm

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,000
involved with

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,360
um i don't know how you work that it

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,680
must be magic

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,200
but uh i'm really happy to be here uh

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,360
we'll be here in

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,520
virtual of course and today we're going

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,000
to talk about moving slow and trying not

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,040
to break

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,799
each other so i work at the open source

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,200
initiative this is uh me

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,840
and there's the organization and you can

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,720
uh

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,280
get at me on twitter with those two

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
handles

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,920
right there and uh the reason that i

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,759
decided to give this

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,880
talk is um i guess it became even more

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,720
obvious during the

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,479
pandemic that the current state of

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,520
things is pretty

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,719
speedy um and perhaps like not

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,439
particularly sustainable uh in a lot of

00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,840
ways

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,560
uh and and that's kind of the default

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,159
that's not

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,560
necessarily i'm not calling out any

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,799
specific projects or specific people

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,720
it just seemed to be that our our

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,039
default was like be busy

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,000
um be shipping stuff that might be

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,720
broken or untested or undocumented

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,400
uh and and that's like how we go we're

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,120
like seed of the pants

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,599
and so i started thinking more about

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,680
sustainability

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,280
which is an idea that a lot of people

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,599
have been talking about

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,480
uh in free and open source software over

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,879
the last

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,120
couple years there's like a whole group

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,640
uh dedicated to discussing open source

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,640
sustainability

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,239
but when i listen in on those

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,519
conversations or read notes

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,599
or participate um i feel like the

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,080
participants in those conversations

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,480
are not necessarily using the same

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,040
definition of the word sustainable or

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,800
the

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,879
concept of sustainability so um

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,480
i looked up what sustainability says

00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,159
when you look it up in the dictionary

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,159
and this is the uk dictionary

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,840
and you can say uh the the top

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,680
definition there is the sustainability

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,800
of economic growth

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,800
so it's really focused on um

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,400
you know like making sure that money

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,159
keeps coming in which you know we live

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,560
in a capitalist society people

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,920
got to eat and they have to exchange

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,120
money usually for

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,159
food in order to get it so um you know

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,519
so this is like i

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,480
understand why there's a lot of

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,760
attention to uh continuing to sustain

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,280
economic growth

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,599
uh but it gets a little weird when you

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,680
think of it as like oh that's the only

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,840
thing worth doing is maintaining that

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,120
kind of sustainability

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,840
and then i went and looked up

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,560
sustainable on the merriam-webster

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,840
dictionary and that one has a slightly

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,599
different take on the idea of

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,080
sustainability which is

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,879
uh relating to or being a method of

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,599
harvesting

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,799
or using a resource so that the resource

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,599
is not depleted or permanently damaged

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,080
merriam-webster is probably not thinking

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,560
about open source contributors here

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,680
but i certainly am when i read this uh

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,599
and then you know i

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,519
certainly support thinking about

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,120
sustainability for the planet we live on

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,159
but that's a little outside of the scope

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,720
today

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,519
so i started thinking about like what if

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,079
we were more

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,320
explicit when we spoke about sustainable

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,520
practices and sustainability

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,400
and really focused on

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,240
making projects sustainable not

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,000
necessarily economically

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,600
sustainable although there's probably

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,400
some overlap there

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,040
but uh looking at what's actually scarce

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,479
in free and open source software

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:45,360
and for me i think it's

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,880
people who are excited to work on free

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,280
and open source software they want to

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,919
build

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,600
something uh beautiful they want to

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,880
build something and share it with the

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,560
whole world

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,040
uh and you know the the enthusiasm

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,600
to do that to give something back to the

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,720
world

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,199
is what i think of uh as what is

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,560
actually

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,120
scarce so when i think about

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,080
sustainability in

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,680
in open source uh and maybe you'll start

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,639
to think about it this way too

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,840
because i've now said the word

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,800
sustainability like 18 times

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,479
maybe think about the resource that is

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,320
the most precious which is people who

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,479
are excited to work

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,240
on projects that they want to share with

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,360
the world and make the world a little

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,400
bit better

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,919
so in doing that

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,320
so when you think about like

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,960
sustainability in an environmental way

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,240
like you usually are like whoa slow down

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,400
let's not just like

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,639
fill up the dumpster with a bunch of you

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,360
know plastic disposable one-time use

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,520
stuff

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,759
or let's not just take the whole forest

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,560
without a plan for replenishing

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,039
and those types of things so like in the

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,600
developer sense in a contributor sense

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,960
it's more like how do we not use up

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,319
people's energy

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,120
so that they leave how do we make sure

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,919
that

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,000
the projects and places that people are

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,000
contributing their energies

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,199
are places that they want to do that for

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,280
a long time

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,400
and not just for like two years get

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,240
bought and

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,680
you know make furniture and never do

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,240
software again

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,639
so i thought about slowness and i

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,199
thought you know what snails

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,960
snails are good at slowness why are they

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,919
good at slowness

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,039
it's a good question um it turns out

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,919
that the slime

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,319
is part of why they're good at slowness

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,440
and

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,840
the slime while also pretty like has all

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,759
these

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,440
actual functions and it turns out that a

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,240
lot of those functions are ones that are

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,960
also good

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,520
for open source projects so this is from

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,360
the wikipedia entry on snails

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,440
the foot of the gastropod is covered

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,440
with a thin layer of this mucus

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,440
which is used for a variety of functions

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,840
including adherence

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,840
lubrication repulsing predators and

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,280
recognizing other snails

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,759
plus following a trail to a known

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,280
destination so in our case if not a

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,360
known destination

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,560
at least one that has some known

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,360
variables

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
where we know that it's going to be open

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,000
source

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,280
we know it's going to be a welcoming

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
community that

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,120
people want to participate in and we

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,960
know that we're going to be building

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,639
software that empowers people

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,400
and maybe improves the world a little

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,599
bit so

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,360
the first one adherence for us i think

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,599
the key piece is adherence to our goals

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,400
uh it's one thing to start out as open

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,639
source and then

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,479
whoops stuff happened 10 years later and

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,680
now you're closed source and

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,560
you you know kind of pissed off all your

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,840
contributors

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,520
by a giant license change so adherence

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,599
to goals i think is really really

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,039
important it's part of trust it's part

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,199
of what makes it

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,440
um you know a thing that you want to

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,440
continue to participate in so if

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,919
everyone adheres to the goals

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,039
then uh then you have like a good

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,520
coherence

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,199
about what you're doing and and a lot of

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,520
good investment and buy-in

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,639
like like you know emotional investment

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,039
and buy-in on

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,800
the project and the way that you

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,280
accomplish that is by sharing your

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,639
mission

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,199
and your goals often it's basically like

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,840
the opposite of fight club where you

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,240
basically

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,759
never stop talking about your mission

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,800
and your goals

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,599
so uh the more people who understand

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,479
what you're doing

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,639
the better nobody should encounter your

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,959
project without knowing the answer to

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,880
what's the point of this or why are you

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,000
bothering with this or why is this so

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,959
important

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,919
and so you want to you basically want to

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,080
make sure that you're

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,360
working back to your goals all the time

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,839
and uh

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,720
and reminding people who are there uh

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,880
that you're always

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,800
optimizing for these goals so you sort

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,519
of like set a path

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,200
and describe where you're gonna go and

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,800
that helps you bring in

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,560
more people that want to help you get

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,160
there

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,519
so when you're talking to someone you're

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,800
just meeting and you don't know where

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,680
their interests that you know their

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,519
interests might intersect with yours

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,839
and you don't know what else they know

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,200
but you can at least tell them about

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,279
what your project is and where it's

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,760
going and maybe you know that's not in

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,760
person

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,040
right now so maybe on your website you

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,120
would have on the front page

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,320
like what the point of your project is

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,360
as opposed to

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,720
you know how it works or both you know

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,519
hopefully so um you know that's that's

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,360
how you end up

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,519
attracting folks who want to help you

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,519
with your goal not people who are like

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,640
oh i want to participate in a python

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,600
project but

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,800
i don't want to have it be open source

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,279
those aren't folks that are going to

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,279
help you

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,360
get where you're going those are folks

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,880
that are going to end up kind of being

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,320
sand in the works for you um and so

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,000
it like one of the things that's

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,800
interesting is that if you're talking

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,560
about the goal

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,240
rather than the mechanics all the time

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,839
when you you know are encountering new

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,160
folks and new people

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,360
um you might end up with people who want

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,760
to help you with your goal

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,519
in a way that you haven't thought of so

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,040
for instance this happened with us at

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,040
media goblin

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,079
media government is decentralized media

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,399
hosting

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,160
it takes a whole bunch of different

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,760
media types and allows you to

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,200
interact with them in one place that's

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,480
user focused

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,720
but it also is very dedicated to privacy

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,320
and control over the way that you share

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,680
so there's a lot of granularity on the

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,200
sharing

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,600
um what's neat is that we had thought oh

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,120
this is for hackers and it's for artists

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,880
or it's for artists who are hackers or

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,519
hackers who are artists

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,120
but someone contacted us about using it

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,040
for an elementary school

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,720
which isn't something we had thought of

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,240
this it turned out the folks that

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,839
started the project didn't have kids in

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,959
elementary school so it wasn't a use

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,279
case that we had

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,399
you know been planning for but because

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,160
our goal

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,839
was to build something that was like

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,040
privacy first

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,279
and really granular sharing like

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,120
it meant that it was a perfect pick for

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,160
an elementary school that wants to share

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,720
pictures

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,240
but not with the whole world just with

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,760
the other kids in the class

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,760
and also to be able to um

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,519
answer to parents who have like real

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,920
concerns about privacy for

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,920
lots of different reasons and being able

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,680
to strip out exif data that

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,959
uh talks about the location where the

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,279
pictures were taken

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,680
so this were these were folks who shared

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,920
our goal of wanting to have a tool

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,120
that uh where privacy is first and

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,839
granular sharing

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,240
is central but uh you know they didn't

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,240
know anything about like hackers and

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,160
uh and they didn't get any of our funny

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,279
ascii art jokes but

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,279
um but they ended up like implementing

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,160
it at a small elementary school so

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,920
it was it was kind of neat and so as you

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,839
go through the world you might end up

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,519
finding more and more people that like

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,120
your goal even if you

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,880
hadn't thought of who they might be

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,120
first so

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,720
uh and that's exciting because the more

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,639
people that pitch in

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,880
uh the more you can spread out the work

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,120
the more reach you can have

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,240
uh even if your core project is pretty

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,040
small

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,279
and uh and that's you know uh teamwork

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,959
makes the dream work right

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,519
so we're gonna go back to snails

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,560
lubrication that is the other that is

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,600
the second function

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,120
of uh snail slime and i think for us

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,880
we're probably really talking about

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,360
social lubrication

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,639
um and i i just mean like having if

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,639
people are doing a project

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,200
that they you know that you're working

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,760
hard to build relationships with people

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,800
so that you know i i used to do a talk

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,399
about like

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,480
how do you try and get new contributors

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,200
and someone asked me from the audience

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,440
like

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,399
so when someone leaves your project why

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,800
is that

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,720
and i said well what did they want did

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,639
you ask them and they said no

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,160
and of course they you know i can't

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,040
answer why someone left

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,160
a project um that i'd only just heard of

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,839
but

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,760
if you're if you have people

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,519
participating especially as volunteers

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,560
but also if they're participating as

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,240
direct reports

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,920
you should know why they're there and

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,800
why they're excited to work on what

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,440
they're working on

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,279
because then if you know what they're

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,440
doing starts to deviate from what they

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,040
told you they wanted to be there for

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,440
um then you can kind of step in and be

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,959
like how can we get this realigned

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,959
otherwise they will leave and then you

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,880
will be wondering why they left

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,480
or you know you can ask me and i won't

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,000
know but um

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,600
then i'll have a funny story for another

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,839
talk so

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,880
um so when you're building relationships

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,079
you're going both

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,639
up and down your stack and looking for

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,720
folks that can help you um

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,079
you know do what you're doing by like

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,680
understanding like where does your

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,600
software go after you're done

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,880
where do the pieces that come into your

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,880
project come in

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,320
and you're trying to build relationships

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,800
with you know

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,560
up and down in in both directions and

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,040
with your users too

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,399
so you want to be collaborating early

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,600
and often

00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,880
um it's you know like if you have events

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,959
or forums or online uh meetups and

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,360
things then you invite the people

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,920
that you work with on the project to

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,959
participate or to watch or to uh be part

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,600
of the event

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,040
um and when they have events and things

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,399
and they talk about like what's on their

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,040
road

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,560
and send you um pay attention to like

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,399
the things that they're publishing so

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,560
that you can kind of understand

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,519
you know it means less surprises and

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,959
everyone likes

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,440
less surprises um

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,399
and this means like you sort of get to

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,279
know each other

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,680
which is great um you know you want to

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,519
uh

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,440
you want to have a relationship with the

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,199
people that affect your work

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:44,800
even if they're not like right in your

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:47,279
direct line of sight

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,440
because one day there will be the no

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,800
good very very bad day

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:55,279
and uh if something happens that

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,120
affects not just your project but like

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,920
some of your dependencies or some of the

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,720
places that your

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,519
software goes after you're done with it

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,959
uh

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,120
you're going to want to know who to

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,839
contact immediately and you're going to

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,199
want to have

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:12,320
some trust when you do that and

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,839
so something like heartbleed which

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,519
i'm sure for this audience i don't have

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,800
to go into but it was a bug

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:20,480
a vulnerability in the ssl which had

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,079
several different implementations and

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,440
several different distributions in

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,920
different places

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,160
and you know the community had to talk

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,160
to each other and say like okay

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,160
uh let's tell everyone that there is a

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,279
bug so that they can at least

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,360
try to isolate the effect and then

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,040
we're gonna patch it here and then it's

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,639
gonna have to be like kind of tweaked

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,959
and patched in different ways in

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,079
different places and that

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,199
chain of uh letting everyone know across

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,680
the community the

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,360
relationships that exist between

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,320
different free software communities were

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,880
really key

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,880
for making sure that those patches got

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,639
to all the places and all of the users

00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,600
and all the people that it needed to get

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,160
to

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,560
so this if if you know building

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,720
relationships sounds a little too like

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,040
i don't know fluffy and nice then maybe

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,199
think of it strategically

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,920
um but i will tell you that these

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:17,360
two-way relationships do take time

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,600
um and uh and they do have to be two-way

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,959
like you can't you can't just always be

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,600
asking for favors

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,639
and expect folks to continue to want to

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,560
do that

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,480
uh the other thing is is that a lot of

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,519
folks like you have to include your

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,040
introverts because

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,839
extroverts like myself most of the time

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,759
um well happily like yeah what's up like

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,720
sure we can be friends like

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,320
you know follow me on whatever and uh

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,560
but the introverts sometimes

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,600
are sitting there with a lot of really

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,120
key information

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,399
as well so make sure that you're kind of

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,800
always leaving the door open there too

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,720
all right and you know just i mean i'm

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,240
sure that you're probably already doing

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,920
some of this like you're here at an

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,320
online social event

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,240
uh about free software so you probably

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,800
already are making connections with some

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,880
folks

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,959
but you and this is more to think about

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,400
like the social lubrication of doing it

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,640
a little bit more

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,079
intentionally and inclusively and making

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,319
sure that you're kind of like leaving

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:17,520
all your doors open

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,000
all right so another function of snail

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,919
slime

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,880
is that it helps you recognize other

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:26,640
snails and this is really important

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:30,000
uh because if you are going to be

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:33,039
uh you know building this amazing

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,200
slow like lots of nice connections

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,640
free software project then you're going

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,880
to have to find some like-minded folks

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,720
that are going to help you build this

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,640
and some of the ways that you can do

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,520
this and signal to people that you

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,320
respect their time and you respect them

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,039
uh

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,600
you know not going for broke and not you

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,760
know and

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,600
continuing to like sleep a regular

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,000
amount of hours each night

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,679
is by taking care of these lovely

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,559
like-minded folks when you encounter

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,640
them

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,600
one way to do that is by building

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,039
redundancies

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,960
into your projects and you know so some

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,600
overlap and some redundancies so that

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,679
there are

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,039
always at least two people that can do

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,720
anything important

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,320
so you're never calling somebody up

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,320
during their brother's wedding

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,760
to like reset a server or something

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,080
terrible like that

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,360
um you want to have two people who can

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,360
access any account

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,080
two people who know where any key piece

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,200
of information or documentation is

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,720
um and so you know this means that like

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,600
when life happens and it will um

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,640
that you're you can be like hey no

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,559
problem

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,640
go ahead sarah's got it you know uh and

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,960
this is this is part of how you care for

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,240
people in a slow project that allows

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,640
people to like

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,240
you know go do things like help their

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,240
sister move or

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,520
uh you know help their roommate with

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,679
something or

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,360
take a sick day when they ought to types

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,880
of things like that so like those things

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,240
are gonna happen there's nothing that we

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,360
can do about it

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,799
um and nor should we be really weird if

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,520
we had that power but

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,000
uh you know life happens and if you're

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,799
able to be

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,240
gracious when people are going to be

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,080
unavailable then

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,160
that's going to go a long way towards

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,039
them feeling like oh

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,160
i feel valued and not you know like a

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,320
cog in a wheel here

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,840
another thing is like sometimes people

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,559
leave the project and they don't come

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,200
back

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:33,120
and that's okay um but you want them to

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,880
like go out into the world and sort of

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,400
broadcast like that you were

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,799
great and it was nice so you don't want

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,640
to be weird when people leave

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,679
um it's just not it's not good like

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,960
people are going to do it they're going

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,320
to go to grad school they're going to

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,400
have a baby they're going to have to

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,600
like take on more caretaking duties or

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,520
something like that

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,120
but if you send them out into the world

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,000
like oh that was really nice there was

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,799
like a really good

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,320
exit strategy as well as like a nice

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,400
onboarding strategy and then they

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,039
recommend your project to other folks

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,559
even like maybe 10 years later like when

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,520
they haven't been involved for a long

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,679
time

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,720
this uh happened i used to work at this

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,960
nonprofit

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,640
years ago and we had interns they had to

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,240
come and do an internship for

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,080
school like they didn't have to choose

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,159
us is the key thing here

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,600
but they had to choose something and so

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,880
we had this young woman and she came

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,679
into the office

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,880
and she had a really really great time

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,159
and so for the next

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,880
five trimesters we had somebody that she

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,960
knew

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,039
from her school also doing the

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,840
internship and they're all pretty great

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,159
um so she kept like recommending

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,880
interning with us like way after she

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,919
left

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,240
so you know it's uh the

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,320
the reputation that you send outside of

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,360
your project is really important so sort

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,159
of like this

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,440
uh beacon of gondor you know it keeps

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,440
jumping and jumping and jump

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,600
nice if you're looking for like a like a

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,960
really friendly php community like check

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,400
these folks out

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,039
so um another way that you can take

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,640
good care of your people once they show

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,960
up your other snails

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,480
is to set good long-term goals so people

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,760
know like kind of what is coming down

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,799
the pike

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,840
and um you know and kind of understand

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:22,559
like not just like oh our mission is to

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,200
make a really nice you know education

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,720
portal

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,120
but like they understand what each and

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,120
every of the steps are and what the time

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,559
frame is likely to be

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,799
you know so that everybody is like kind

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:33,600
of on the same page it helps everyone

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,400
feel like they're

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,600
part of the process and then they

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,400
understand

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,880
uh what's going on and that you trust

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,000
them

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,760
with your plan so um the one thing

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,760
that's really you know because like what

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,799
happens is you you have big goals and

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,640
then sometimes

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,559
little goals and then you got to make

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,159
sure that the little goals don't

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,559
um become like myriad like that your big

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,559
goal

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,720
like doesn't descend into like a whole

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:03,360
bunch of like side quests

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,880
um because then you're you're not

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,559
respecting your goal and you're not

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,200
respecting all the people that you

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:11,200
uh communicated your goal to so like

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,440
make sure that you kind of keep that

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,960
tight once you say like here's where

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,039
we're headed

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,880
then actually stay headed there um

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,559
and uh and it can be hard because

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,400
sometimes there are like these shiny

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,559
objects and you really you're like

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,640
what is that i could do that and it

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,039
would only take a weekend like

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,320
um i mean you can do that for yourself

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,480
if you wish but um

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,400
try not to like drag the whole project

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,960
with you on the side quests unless

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,720
they're

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,720
willing and you have a conversation

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,120
about it

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,080
the other thing i would say is don't be

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,320
afraid to do

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,919
less like this is another way of caring

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,280
for people so like

00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:53,280
um if you you know you're like oh our

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,360
goal is to get here

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,760
you know and maybe you're gonna do like

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,960
50 new features by the end of the year

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,720
and it's december

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,640
and you have 20. um don't be afraid to

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,400
go ahead and go back to your community

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,720
and say

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,120
it's going to be 20 that's it or maybe

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,880
we'll finish the 5 or that are 75

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,880
of the way done but we're not going to

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,760
do 50 and like that's

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,320
we obviously that didn't work um and so

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,200
i think it's okay to say like hey

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,520
we have to pull this back or something

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,320
like

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,440
step seven turned out to be like 50 tiny

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,400
steps

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,159
and you have to say like well uh that's

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,080
not going to happen by december but it

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,480
may happen by next july

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,679
and that's okay so don't be afraid to do

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,080
less and

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,559
uh and be explicit about it say you know

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,960
don't just like quietly like

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,200
you know like you have to say like hey

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,039
uh things took longer than we thought

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,240
like we had to deal with a global

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,520
pandemic

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,919
for instance um or you know

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,760
something uh turned out to like have

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,960
like 10 more layers of complexity than

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,679
we were expecting

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,679
and so we're going to do less and this

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,120
is the same with unreasonable deadlines

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,880
so if you had like

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,360
you know we're gonna you know we're

00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,880
gonna like write a million lines of code

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,799
by the end of the year and there's still

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,480
just four of you

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,919
like you're not going to make that

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,480
deadline don't do that

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,360
um because then everyone is just tired

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,559
and it's

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,799
it's it's not good like making everyone

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,720
feel sleepy and sad because they weren't

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,320
able to get the things done that you're

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,440
hoping they would get done

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,039
is not a way to honor people and the

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,760
you know their willingness to contribute

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:39,600
to your open source project

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,400
so our fourth and final lesson from the

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,320
snail

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:46,960
is repulsing predators and uh

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,600
so i spoke about this a little bit at

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,159
the top

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,600
that our our default culture in tech is

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,640
not slow

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,840
it's fast aaron's rough shot over uh

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:02,240
legislation local laws uh

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:05,360
labor uh lots of different things

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,760
people's uh you know the apparent you

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,200
know the

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,120
how the human beings are supposed to

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,159
sleep some certain number of hours per

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,640
day

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,480
um all these kinds of things like our

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,240
default culture and tech

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,080
doesn't really um like to take on board

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,520
um and that means that you end up with

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,799
things where it's like let's just crush

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,640
it over the weekend

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:29,200
or um you know let's let's just uh

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,360
pound it out overnight and not sleep or

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,200
sleep under our desk or never leave the

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,240
office or something like this

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,159
and um and that like

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,080
for a long time that's been portrayed as

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,200
sort of heroic

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,640
um and you know it is

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,320
like if you stay up all night to do

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,120
something that really really needs to

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,440
get done

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,120
okay but like the very the thing you

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,679
should be asking yourself in the morning

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,039
is

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:58,640
how do we not do that ever again

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,120
um and it's difficult like so even if

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,679
you

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,520
if you think about like hey so repulsing

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,840
predators means like

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,559
you might have a project that where your

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,640
culture

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,080
you have decided with your founders and

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,640
your friends and your

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,559
co-contributors that you wanted the pace

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,600
to be slow

00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:21,039
and then someone shows up from another

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,120
part of the tech community and they want

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,760
things to be fast like they like your

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,080
tool but they don't like your culture

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,039
and so you're gonna have to be vigilant

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,480
about repulsing or maybe retraining

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:38,000
predators so and it might sneak in small

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,080
at first like people may think they're

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,159
like helping to like kind of build team

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,919
spirit by suggesting that you stay all

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,039
night to finish something

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:49,679
or that you know let's just let's just

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,400
double our output for the next two weeks

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,520
or something like that and you're gonna

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,880
have to

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,559
like resist this because it sounds cool

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,960
to get more stuff done

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,799
but in the long run you're gonna end up

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,840
with a lot of people that don't like to

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,400
sleep

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,360
and i can tell you right now that that

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:13,520
is not where you want to be

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,799
slower is kinder slower means that you

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,440
have time to say

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,559
oh let me show you how i'm doing it

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,840
since you asked

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:24,159
a question or oh let me

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,600
take a minute to teach you how to do

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,799
this bit yourself

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,200
so that you don't have to wait on me to

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,440
fix

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,039
this part of the database for you to get

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,080
your work done

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:39,520
slower allows you to say things like

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:42,240
oh well uh i totally understand

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,720
if you have to take friday off like

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,399
we'll

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,919
get back to it next week um and then

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,640
slower it just it makes it easier for

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,840
you to be

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,840
nicer and take a minute um and

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,440
for the other end you're not like

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:01,200
constantly expecting

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,600
like the barrage the emergency the

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,360
you know like everything is on fire in

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,159
your inbox all the time

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,120
and that means that people can relax a

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,760
little bit

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,320
um they don't have to be like constant

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,960
alert

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,880
like we're moving so fast like anything

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,159
could break and it could spin off

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,360
in my direction any second and so

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:26,559
um if you don't want people constantly

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,360
on edge and worried when the wrath

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,799
of uh you know whoever expected

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,440
something to get done

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,159
like at 4 am yesterday didn't get done

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,440
you know

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:41,279
you have to be willing to be slower

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:44,799
um so not everyone is ready to too

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:48,080
slow uh and that's okay

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:49,520
but if you really want slow at your

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,120
project

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,080
then you have to be willing to stick to

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,640
your

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,520
principles on that so when you choose

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,640
slow

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,720
um you know you you have time for

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,720
documentation

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,799
um you have time to

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,840
take a minute and do some strategic

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,600
planning

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,760
so that you can look at what your two

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,360
three or four year goals are for your

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,320
project

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,200
um when you choose slow you give people

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,240
time to

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,720
be their best selves like if people or

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,240
you know instead of responding to

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,120
questions like i don't have time to

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,640
answer that

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,120
or like why didn't you just read the

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,159
instructions or there's an faq already

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,960
get out of my face

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,480
like you don't you know you give time

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,080
you give people time to be their best

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,000
selves and they can say like oh yeah

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,039
that is kind of a weird question let me

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,080
take a look

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,559
um and so you really want to do that um

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,559
and

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,399
it it makes people feel a little

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,720
comfortable like they can

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,080
kind of relax a little bit and they they

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,799
know that it's okay to ask

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,559
questions and they can settle in and

00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,000
instead of being kind of like always

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,039
looking over the shoulder for

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,080
a better project that is nicer

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:09,120
and uh more comfortable to be a part of

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,520
uh it also means that you give yourself

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,559
time

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,960
to be your best self especially if

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,679
you're

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,919
a leader within the project the way that

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,360
projects work is they take their culture

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,520
and their cues from the top so if

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,679
leadership says like oh yeah it's okay

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,480
for you guys to like be slow

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,240
and you know not work on the weekend or

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,200
stay up all night or whatever

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,960
but you know um me and the family the

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,720
other founder are gonna do that we're

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,120
going to the two of us are going to stay

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,760
up all night and just fix this so you

00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,480
know

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,960
um it sends a very clear message that

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,640
like

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,240
you know if you want to be part of the

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,520
top you want to be part of leadership

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,720
you want to be part of the like

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:54,480
in group that you stay up all night

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,919
um so really try hard to

00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,799
resist the uh temptation

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,559
of being nice to everyone else except

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,840
for yourself

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:08,960
so um give yourself time to be

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,000
your own best self uh and then you'll

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,399
have time to

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,480
be picky about your clients and partners

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:17,679
and collaborators like whatever

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,559
uh whoever it is that you interact with

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,320
you might be able to specialize on some

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,720
you know really specific

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,279
use case that is really exciting and

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,679
unique and fascinating to you

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,000
uh you know so you might choose to focus

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,799
on a particular academic use case

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,519
or something that is you know just like

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,840
really cool

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,799
instead of just going super speedy and

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,360
trying to provide

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,840
like a you know a barely working product

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,799
for as many people as possible

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,960
um you might have time to do some of the

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,200
community things that you want to do

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,320
like the mentorship programs that make

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,600
the future of tech

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,919
look hopeful and amazing uh

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,279
folks can talk to kids about like tech

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,039
careers and like

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:02,320
you know at code week and things like

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,480
that uh

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,240
you might decide as a company or as a

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,720
project to participate

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,760
in a donation campaign or a food drive

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,039
or something

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,120
because you're like well we're doing

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:16,159
pretty good here in tech maybe we could

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,240
give back to the wider community

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,279
those are the kinds of things that make

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,279
your community

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,840
and your workplace and your project

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,200
special like saying like oh yeah we did

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,399
that together

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,480
um in addition to like shipping some

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,200
code which is also important

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,159
but uh you know having a little bit of

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,440
leeway

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:40,000
um like to be extraordinary

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,279
makes it really special and that means

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,519
that people are going to want to stick

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:46,080
around

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,200
so you have the option to build

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,200
something amazing

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,039
or treat people like human beings that's

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,679
usually what we're told

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,399
is the option in like today's capitalist

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,559
workplace

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,760
situation like we can either be really

00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,799
nice to you

00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,840
uh or we can make all the money

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:06,159
um but i think we could do both right

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,200
um there's no reason that we shouldn't

00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,799
at least try

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,120
right um you know each of us

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,480
is building the communities that we

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,480
participate

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,960
every single day whether it's at work or

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,960
it's in our volunteer work or

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,559
some hybrid because we're doing free and

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,880
open source software and sometimes

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:28,320
that's the case

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,159
but we're in control of how we do that

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,399
we're in control of the kinds of

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,640
behaviors that we want to

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,960
reward and the kinds of behaviors that

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,399
we want to discourage

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:44,240
and we can too slow we can choose to be

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:47,519
kind we can choose sustainability

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,360
uh where you know those folks that we

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,039
talked about the precious resource of

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,440
people that want to build software that

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,200
makes

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,480
the world a better place and share it

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,720
with everyone

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,519
that you know that person is getting

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,480
some sleep

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,919
and is feeling valued and is feeling

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,240
like they may have found

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,519
a place that they can really contribute

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,280
so

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,560
um let's do both that's what i have for

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,679
you today

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:20,480
i do have some picture credits and then

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:22,960
i would be happy to take some questions

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,040
hello thank you so much for that talk

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,079
deb that was absolutely lovely

00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,520
um i i really enjoyed it and i'm sure

00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:35,119
everybody else did too um so we do have

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,879
time for questions we have quite

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,800
a bit of time for questions we have

00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:41,119
about 10 minutes here

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,480
so if you have questions please type

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,800
them into the chat

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,760
in venulis in the tux theater preface

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,879
them with

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,399
question um here is

00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:56,560
our first questions any comments about

00:34:52,399 --> 00:35:00,000
in quotes elon time

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,280
um i actually try really hard

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,880
not to read very much about elon but

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:10,800
my guess is that as a famous kind of

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:14,000
on font terrible i do not probably enjoy

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,200
his thoughts or theories on time

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,839
and how much you should work um

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,839
yeah i and i it's that comes from the

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,520
that used to be steve jobs time or

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,320
whatever before that

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,800
um where you know you just sort of bully

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,520
people

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,119
into working as much as they can that

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,560
type of thing

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,000
yeah i mean it seems like

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,160
you know when you look at a person like

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,240
elon musk you might think it seems like

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,920
his secret sauce is that he yells at

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,480
everyone and gets a lot of work done

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,920
out of them but i think his real secret

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,960
sauce is that he has

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,920
a lot of money and he's a white

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,200
cis man that's really good and confident

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,200
being confident

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,760
and getting more money from investors so

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,800
um is the secret sauce a lot of

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,200
investment or

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,640
is it a lot of yelling my guess would be

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,960
it's probably more investment than

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,119
yelling

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:15,839
that's a that's a very good point deb

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:19,520
um do we have any other questions

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:22,400
just give people a few seconds to

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,400
come up with something

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:27,119
cool yeah and it's ironically i did

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,880
speak a little fast i want to talk about

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,240
slowness

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,800
that's it's always the way here we go

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,040
can you remind us about open hatch and

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,400
where to go now for that wisdom

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,760
ah um thank you so much i'm glad you

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,359
remember open hatch

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,839
uh so um open hatch for folks that it's

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,320
now

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,240
a little while ago but it was a

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,520
non-profit project

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:55,040
that was aimed at helping newcomers to

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,560
free and open source software

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,520
find where to go so we uh we built a

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,720
couple of tools

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,119
on and like rubrics on the wiki as far

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,440
as like how to do your first patch

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,240
and how to like get missions like so

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,200
that you could learn

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,320
git and then also did a whole bunch of

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,359
like day and a half

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,880
workshops with first-timers

00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:20,560
and they were for women and their

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,680
friends so the goal was to kind of

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,079
increase the diversity in uh projects

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,520
uh with and by having workshops that

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,760
were at least half

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,960
women or people who didn't identify as

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,040
men

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,440
um so where can you go for that now

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,280
first timers is like where you can find

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,400
some of the tools and the tips

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,800
on um finding good first patch like bite

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,400
size

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,720
bugs and that kind of thing um

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,760
and then as far as like workshops i know

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,240
that there

00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,240
there have been it kind of rolls around

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,119
a little bit people do like

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,200
um you know day and a half workshops the

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,800
python community is still really really

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,599
good and that was the first place that

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,599
we worked on with open hatch

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,000
and i keep hearing that there are other

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,040
folks looking into

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,079
other places where they might

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,079
start doing open hatch workshops again

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,079
in conjunction with the university our

00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,079
workshops are split somewhere um

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,520
on a university campus and then some

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,160
were just kind of

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,760
um in conjunction with a local user

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,359
group i don't know of anyone who's doing

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,960
them specifically in conjunction with

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,280
their local user groups

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,640
but uh i do know there's interest in

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,320
starting to do them again

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,320
in conjunction with universities

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,960
that's great i'm a big fan of workshops

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,280
we have another question what projects

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,920
or

00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,359
what project or projects come to mind

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,040
that do well at the tactics you're

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,240
describing

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,119
ah so uh i mentioned media government a

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,079
lot which we

00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,680
uh we actually gave over it's it was a

00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,520
good new project it still is a good new

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,000
project and um

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,800
uh and ben sturmfels is the current

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,520
maintainer

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,280
on that project um and he's a lovely

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,320
fellow and so you could still work at

00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,920
uh work on media goblin uh chris webber

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,480
who is the person who

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,119
uh was like sort of the tech lead

00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,440
founder

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,359
at media goblin is now working on

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,680
something called sprightly

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,240
um one media governor is one of the

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,720
things where i described it turned out

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,640
like oh

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,480
we have like a list of 10 things and

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,000
then it was like secretly hidden and

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,280
thing number seven was like

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,599
actually 50 things and so sprightly is

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,480
related to some of those 50 things that

00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,680
we discovered

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,400
in step 7 which was like modular

00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,280
decentralization

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,960
um the spritely project is going to be a

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,760
little different than media goblin in

00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,280
that i think

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,040
it is going to be uh more focused on

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,599
folks being able to build their own

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,880
environment almost from scratch

00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,960
not scratch the program but like uh from

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,800
sort of first principles like what kind

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,320
of environment do you want to create

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,400
and i think it is gonna from the

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,000
beginning include a little bit more of

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,560
an educational

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,200
bent for uh younger computer users

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,599
um as far as other projects that i think

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,000
probably do a good job of slow

00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,640
um i think python like a lot of the

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,119
python

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,319
community is really committed to doing

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,680
good onboarding

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:28,319
and um and you know

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,240
uh treating people well uh you'd

00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,000
probably have to get a little further in

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,520
to find out which pockets are

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,520
like the slowest

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:40,480
that would be fun investigate projects

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,640
and go how slow are you

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,400
yeah yeah i would love it if people just

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,680
started asking that like hey i was

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,520
thinking of um

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,880
you know i did one bug it was cool but

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:54,240
like how slow are you

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,560
that's great uh we have another question

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,280
have you had to send this message up to

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,800
manager slash corporate exec slatter

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,680
with waterfall sales targets um such as

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,200
quarterlys and so on uh we need to sell

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,800
however many per widget

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:13,520
do you have any tips i wish i did

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,319
i've stayed pretty far away from um

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,920
corporate

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:20,000
uh stuff i've been pretty much my entire

00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,280
career has been in non-profit

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,880
and so i haven't done too much of that

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,200
i do think that um probably

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,760
the best place to start like if you're

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,880
getting from however many levels up like

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,160
this

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:39,119
unrealistic list of things is

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,440
to make sure you make friends with your

00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,640
manager like professional friends

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,119
and make sure that when they

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,400
receive the 100 things that the team

00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,760
will do that they

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,000
feel like i'm gonna push back uh

00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,040
we cannot do a hundred things we can do

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,079
70 well

00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,920
or a hundred crummy you can pick

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,079
but don't come back and bother me if

00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,400
like you picked 100 crummy

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,920
um and so i think you really need a

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,960
manager who's kind of an

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,680
advocate like at that first level who

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,359
understands your team's capacity

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:17,280
and um and is a good communicator

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,119
as far as like this is what i can get

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,359
done um

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,119
you know without a bazillion mistakes

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,160
because people are sleeping and going

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,680
home

00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,960
uh you know so you just have to i think

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,640
you have to be really clear it's a

00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,480
little bit uh

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,760
it's kind of a manage up thing and i

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,240
have done that in smaller

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,119
places but uh usually if you put the

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,240
question back

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,640
like um so i'm only able to do

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,640
three of these five things which ones

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,599
what do you want me to prioritize

00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,599
and then make them pick

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,400
that that that's the dream isn't it to

00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,119
be able to get that message going up um

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,720
there's another related question to that

00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,680
um which i guess is a bit of a different

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,520
angle how can one actually transition to

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,400
going slowly if you're currently working

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,000
in a team where you have to work

00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,880
110 of the time is it even possible to

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,400
transition

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,960
from a work environment like that to a

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,319
slower and more healthy one

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,880
yeah that's interesting and i think

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,960
um it can be hard when it's already in

00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,640
place that everyone goes fast

00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:26,319
but um you know you can

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,200
uh i think you can say like uh

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:31,200
hey so last quarter i did a lot of stuff

00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:33,160
um i want you to know that i was

00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,680
really really tired and that's an

00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:38,480
unsustainable pace for me

00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,240
and um you know and i recognize that

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,920
like not everyone has like

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,680
it depends on what the relationship with

00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,560
your workplace is if you feel like you

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,079
could

00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,760
you know in a few months find something

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,760
else fairly easily or not

00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,760
like how hard you want to push back but

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,280
i think it's okay to be honest at least

00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,280
with your direct manager

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,520
and say you know that piece was

00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,160
unsustainable i did it because i thought

00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,880
it was like sort of an emergency crunch

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,200
time

00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:09,760
but i can't do that all the time or i'm

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:12,000
gonna have to find another place to work

00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:13,119
yeah i wish there was a secret word that

00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,880
you could say that was

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:19,760
that a magic spell like

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,440
you know slower fricas or whatever but

00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,599
unfortunately it's all her conversation

00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,440
i think we all want that don't we

00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,920
yes um well we've got about a minute

00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,839
left

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,319
and we don't have any questions right

00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:35,440
now so i think we'll call it there um

00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:37,760
everyone if you've got more questions um

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,880
deb might be able to step over into the

00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,319
tux theater

00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,200
q post talk q a chat channel um for a

00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:45,440
little bit

00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,480
so if you haven't found that in venulis

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,480
