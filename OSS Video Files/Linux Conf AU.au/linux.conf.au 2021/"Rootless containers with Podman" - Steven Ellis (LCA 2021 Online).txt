As more services are becoming containerised the security risks continue to increase. By adopting rootless containers we immediately remove a huge attack surface, in addition to providing the capability for any user to run containers on a host system without requiring admin rights.

This talk will outline the core concepts and benefits of rootless containers, and how Podman provides a simple to use framework that integrates nicely with Systemd. Along the way we'll also touch on some of the other security and performance management capabilities that  SELinux and CGroups bring to containerised deployments.

To outline the benefits, and some of the bumpy bits along the way, Steve will use his initial deployments of Home Assistant and Mosquitto as containerised services for home automation, alongside workloads currently unsuitable for rootless containers.
