and we couldn't have done it without

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,440
them

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,640

came along to that

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,239
as you can imagine trying to work out

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,159
how to shift what is normally a large

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,519
networking event to be entirely virtual

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,360
was great challenge

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,720
we spent quite a bit of time trying to

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,840
work out what we could do to make it

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,040
work

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,720
i know there were a few technical

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,920
difficulties at the start but thank you

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,840

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,319

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,519

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,360
redbubble store where you can get

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,600
desk that will be open from 8 30 a.m

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,840
australian eastern daylight time every

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,720
day in venulis

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,720
we've added a new channel text channel

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,120
for each of our streams today so you'll

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,720

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,759
across to that channel to ask questions

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,080

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,840
if they are in there and have time to do

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,000
so

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,080
remember this is a bit different to

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,280
normal so look after yourself and take

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,240
regular breaks

you don't get to move around between

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,039
rooms as much so

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,039
it's important to take care of yourself

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,800
