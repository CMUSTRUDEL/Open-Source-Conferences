As digital computing continues to become ubiquitous, it has become indispensable
to accurately measure the trust in the systems we interact with, especially
remotely. With the advent of IoT, platform security, and privacy design goals
and solutions continue to be increasingly variegated. One of the reliable and
standard choices to accurately assess trust in a system is to use trusted platform
modules (TPM) to cryptographically prove the system-software-state through a
process called attestation.

After a brief introduction to remote attestation, this talk will elicit
the privacy aspects of remote attestation within the TPM2.0 specification.
We will explore how specific TPM2 commands work in the context of the
remote attestation use case, highlight which data and information is exchanged
during the process and point out some features that augment the security and
privacy of the end-user.

This enables system designers to compare and or customize the existing
attestation frameworks to achieve their specific security and privacy goals and
evaluate them for their real-world use cases.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
