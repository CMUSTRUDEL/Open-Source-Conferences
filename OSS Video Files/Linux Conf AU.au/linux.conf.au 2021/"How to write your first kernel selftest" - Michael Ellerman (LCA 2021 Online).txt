This will be a short introduction to the Linux kernel selftests, what they are, why they are and where they are.

Then we will cover the mechanics of writing a selftest, and why it's not that hard, even if you have no kernel development experience.

By the end of the talk hopefully the viewer will feel capable of writing a simple kernel selftest. I will also offer to assist anyone who wants to try and submit a selftest upstream.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
