During lockdown, staff at the State Library of Western Australia worked on a novel suite of educational resources using the open source platform Omeka which was designed with GLAM organisations in mind. These resources were designed to align with the WA curriculum, to highlight collection materials and to extend the services that the State Library provides to schools in WA.

Putting together sites of this nature can be very time consuming from a research perspective, so in many cases we re-used content from pre-existing websites made by previous staff at the State Library of WA. These websites have a wealth of valuable information, but the design and interface was old and unattractive. Rebuilding them on Omeka gave us a chance to update them and provide better metadata, tighter links to our catalogue, include content from Trove and innovative interactive elements such as a timeline. We will talk about the process of building these sites and how we used information and resources provided by others in the GLAM community. We would like to give a view under the hood and show how Omeka is quite friendly even for less technical users and can be used to enhance the online offerings of GLAM organisations of all sizes.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

kaya nyani wajak noonga buja

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,000
yagani the state library of western

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
australia is on the land

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,680

owners of country throughout western

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,560
australia

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,759
their continuing connection to land and

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,680
culture

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,560
i'd like to pay my respects to elders

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,680

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,200
thank you so

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,640
this is me and trish i'm a librarian

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,159
trish is a teacher and we've worked

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,320
pretty closely together on this project

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,920
and other projects and one

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,600
really good benefit of working for a

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,439
large cultural institution

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,799
is that librarians and teachers can

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,320
collaborate closely

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,520
bring together complementary skill sets

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,879
and work on things like this

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,480
and trish today is in margaret river

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,120
visiting some wineries so she couldn't

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,400
join us unfortunately

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,959
okay when we're working on projects like

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,920
this

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,560
we do look at the strategic directions

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,280
of the state library

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,840
and these are some of the specific

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,560
points

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,239
that we use to think about when we're

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,560
developing things

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,480
specifically looking at collections in

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,920
digital forms as well as the traditional

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,519
forms

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,920
looking at digital services

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,760
and transformation and when we look at

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,239
lifelong literacy we're not just talking

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,760
about

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,280
reading and writing we're also talking

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,040
about digital literacy

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,760
and that's increasingly a focus at the

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,760
state library

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,239
so at the state library we collect a

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,800
variety of historical materials

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,239
people think about books and newspapers

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,720
but we also have a fantastic

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,599
map collection a big collection of

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,159
photographs

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,920
which we which we've been digitizing um

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,800
we've got letters we've got oral

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,959
histories

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,040
we've got ephemera so when you go to

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,959
vote and you get handed all of those how

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,720
to vote cards we actually collect those

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,120
and keep them in our archives so we've

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,040
got a pretty rich collection

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,519
and we can do all kinds of fun things

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,000
with those

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,760
okay so trish is an education officer

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
at the state library we have a number of

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,319
education officers at the state library

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,120
and they deliver a range of services

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,080
that are aimed at

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,519
school students and teachers school

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,640
groups can actually come into the state

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,840
library and have

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,440
guided workshops run for free

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,200
there's self-guided tours there's

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,120
exhibition activities and

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,000
online resources like the ones that i'm

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,840
talking about today

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,599
when we shut down for covert we had

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,640
already started working on some of these

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,360
projects

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,120
but it gave us the time to really focus

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,959
on them a lot more

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,879
which was just fantastic timing from our

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,840
point of view

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,280
so these omega projects can be used

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,599
independently online

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,479
like when students are learning from

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,720
home

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,320
but when they come back into the library

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,240
they can fit seamlessly with the

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,520
excursions and the exhibitions that we

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,120
offer

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,600
so they provide fantastic deep

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,440
engagement

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,960
all right let's talk about the tool

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,520
amica s so

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,479
amica is an uh free open source content

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,600
management

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,960
um program we love that um and

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,440
the really nice thing about it is that

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,360
it was developed

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,840
four glam organizations by glam

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,680
organizations so the development started

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,080
in 2007

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,720
and it was developed by the roy rosenwig

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,639
center for history and new media

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,240
and their aim was to help libraries

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,000
museums archives to

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,840
publish and display collections of

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,479
digital material

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,560
in a rich in-depth form nice thing about

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,400
it is it's underpinned by dublin core

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,240
metadata one drawback to

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,240
original omeka is that every time you

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,919
want to create a new site you have to

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:19,759
install a new instance

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,160
so in 2017 they released omega s

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,000
which is a system where you can do a

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,520
single installation and then you can

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,840
build multiple sites on that

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,080
installation that's the system we use

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,039
that's the system that most larger

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,479
institutions

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,560
use omicros is

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,000
lightweight it's modular it's pretty

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,280
friendly to use

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
um it's responsive so you can use it on

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,720
you know all kinds of devices to a

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,759
degree

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,600
um it's pretty accessible and it's also

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,360
been translated into several languages

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,759
and they've got ongoing translation

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,720
projects

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,520
amica s uses json ld as its native data

00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,520
format

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,199
and it includes a number of different

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,919
vocabularies which i'll talk about a bit

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,919
later

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,520
and you can add your own so that's one

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,039
of the really nice things about it is

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,520
you can update it in a variety of ways

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,160
it includes an api and the ability to

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,360
install

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,000
modules which extend the system you can

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,759
write your own

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
modules the latest version is omega 3

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,199
which

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,400
we installed literally last week so

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,400
it's always being updated

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,120
who else uses it um quite a lot of

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,880
people use it here is

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,000
some of my favorites um

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,759
so glam organizations other local

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,240
organizations use it

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,680
both locally and internationally one

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,080
really interesting thing about this for

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,160
me

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,360
is that there's a real social justice

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,400
theme in a lot of the um

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,360
the amiga sites that are out there my

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,800
personal favorite is this u.s department

00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,639
of agriculture

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,680
offering frost on chickens it's actually

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,680
about contributions that the poet robert

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,080
frost made to poultry farming

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,919
surprisingly which is just kind of

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,639
adorable

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,639
um many organizations

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,440
also have some really useful

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,000
documentation online so

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,520
um shout out to university of tasmania

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,400
and yale university

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,039
they share a lot of their user guides

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,880
online

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,080
and when you're trying to come up with

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,240
your own that's just

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,840
really really helpful as well so these

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,319
are the sorts of things that make

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,360
open source software just a pleasure to

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,039
use

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,800
if you're developing your own guides

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,360
these are there for you to

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:48,479
work from so at the state library

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,440
um the first amica site built

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,160
was a mining and energy archive the

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,560
first site

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,720
that trish and i worked on together was

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,000
the wa migration stories site which is

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,879
which is this one that i'm showing

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,759
now this was designed to extend the

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,840
suitcases

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,400
stories of migration guided workshop

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,039
that the education officers run

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,360
we launched it in february 2020 and

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,840
received a lot of positive feedback from

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,800
teachers and educators in other glam

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,840
organizations

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,080
so that was great um then

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,960
we just started working on something

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,479
else

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,000
and locked down hit and this is where

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,680
the last talk by mike is really

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,759
relevant um you're we're probably not

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,479
the only ones we've got some pretty old

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,599
and ugly

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,279
small sites that hang off our website

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,959
this is one of them west western

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,240
australia and federation

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:45,440
this original site was designed in

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,240
2000 and it you can tell by looking at

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,240
it

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,839
it's very very dated in the way that it

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,880
looks but it does have

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,000
a lot of useful information some of

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,360
which you can't really

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,120
find elsewhere and in fact we found

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,720
some of the wikipedia pages on the topic

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,000
linked back to this site

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,279
which is a bit scary we thought that

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,760
there was a pretty good chance this

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,399
could get taken down

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,080
and archived so we wanted to make use of

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,080
the research that had gone into it

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,399
western australia and federation is a

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,880
year 6 history topic in wa

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,560
so we thought we can take that and put

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,760
it into a new format

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,200
and that is what we did so

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,240
i'm actually going to switch and show

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,040
you

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,800
a demo now of this site itself so we

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,600
migrated

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,240
content onto the amica platform we

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,040
updated

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,760
quite a bit of it and we made some minor

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,399
changes

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,800
to make the text age-appropriate and

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,279
culturally appropriate

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,000
it reuses the original research and the

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,519
original collection items

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,600
but we've included a whole bunch of

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,880
extra metadata and tighter links to the

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,680
catalog

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,360
it's a better fit now for the wa

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,360
curriculum

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,040
which is the beauty of working with

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,519
teachers is that

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,800
they know about all that stuff and we've

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,000
added a bunch of extra stuff and i'll

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,640
show you some of that

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,279
so this is the front page nice thing

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,720
about

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,320
these amica sites is that there's a

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,000
bunch of ways you can navigate you can

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,399
look at the different events

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,480
you can look at the people um we've got

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,440
a timeline that i will show you

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,839
um so it's quite interactive in how you

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,360
can navigate around it

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,760
um and one of the really cool things

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,399
about

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,839
working on these sites was the

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,480
opportunity to work with

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,279
aboriginal members of staff who

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,600
undertook

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,519
cultural review of this site and the

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,000
other sites as well

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,560
the aim is to make them safer and more

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,880
inclusive for aboriginal people

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,959
and reflecting on the cultural biases

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,320
that are

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,519
sort of underpin the collections i

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,560
suppose that's something that we're

00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:00,399
trying to be more mindful of

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,760
one thing that was really fantastic from

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,760
my point of view

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,760
was that one staff member i worked with

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,680
on it posed questions for me

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,120
and made suggestions rather than just

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,800
rewriting the content

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,240
and that gave me a chance to reflect

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,120
more deeply and develop a better

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,680
understanding

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,720
which makes me better in future at doing

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,279
this kind of work

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,240
and and understanding the perspectives

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,240
better

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,160
so that we can look at how some of these

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,519
historical events do cause ongoing pain

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,040
to aboriginal people

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,440
that was really pretty key

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,399
when this went up for review by our

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,240
director

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,600
i was wondering if we were going to hear

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,160
back about this at all

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,440
and to my delight our director actually

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,519
highlighted this work

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,800
and commended it as an example to other

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,240
library staff

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,120
about the sorts of things that we should

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,399
be doing more broadly so that was really

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,160
fantastic okay

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,160
let's have a look at the timeline

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,000
so just take a minute to load so this

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,200
timeline

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,800
um it's quite a fun

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,240
feature um and you can see down the

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,519
bottom it's got the dates and you can

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,560
click through

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,680
and it it just has these pictures that

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,600
it's pulling out

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,079
little bits of information and it's

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,639
linking through to the pages as well

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,800
this uses timeline.js which is another

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,160
open source tool

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,040
and it's actually very very simple to

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,240
use it just uses a google spreadsheet

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,279
for the pictures and information in this

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,959
um and the ability for omeka

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,160
to you have iframe code in the html

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,200
boxes so

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,680
looks really cool really simple to do

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,320
which is really really nice um let's

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,920
have a look at

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,440
one of the pages just to give you a bit

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,639
of an example john forrest

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,839
um so a standard page

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,240
in amica includes photographs

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,720
text for information scroll down we've

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,440
got some questions that students can

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,160
think about keywords and links to other

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,440
pages

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,480
then we've got the items and these are

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,600
essentially digitized collection

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,760
material let's have a look at one of

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,760
them

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,480
so this is an example of a digitized

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,600
photograph

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,079
with attached metadata we've got things

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,200
like

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,240
unique identifiers linked to our catalog

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,800
page a whole bunch of different

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,800
information

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,519
and i'll show you another example this

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,600
one here

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,440
is a digitized newspaper and this was

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,279
actually taken from trove

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,760
and it's got the trove metadata

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,800
including the

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,279
text the corrected text in here as well

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,880
and a link through to trove how we went

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,959
about doing this

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,120
was we made use of the fantastic

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,360
glam workbench so hopefully all of you

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,720
know tim sherritt and his wonderful glam

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,760
workbench tools

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,199
um i use them wherever i can and

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,720
in particular this one used a jupiter

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,279
notebook

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,639
to save true newspaper articles as

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,720
images

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,320
which is much nicer than the native way

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,839
that trove saves them

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,839
gives a much better result now tim

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,680
does also have another jupiter notebook

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,199
that allows for import

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:32,800
of um newspaper articles

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,360
using the omega api we i had to play

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,959
with it but

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,399
couldn't get it working the amica api

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:38,399
does seem to be a little bit um

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,480
tricky challenging to use sometimes a

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,079
bit picky

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,399
and that's something that we can work on

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,360
in future but something else to be aware

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,880
of

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,240
now i'm just going to take you for a bit

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:58,000
of a behind the scenes look

00:14:52,240 --> 00:15:01,680
let's go to one of the pages

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,639
and i'm already signed in so i can just

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,360
click edit

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,360
so you can see behind the scenes amica

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,480
is really modular

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,480
it's just got html blocks it's got

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,600
blocks for items

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,920
if you want to add new blocks they're

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,000
over here to the right um

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,440
and yeah pretty pretty simple to use

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,440
there are some details that are hidden

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,040
in sub menus but you do get to know that

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,399
pretty well

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,320
it's fairly easy to teach people how to

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,639
how to use this um okay

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,639
so i mentioned that on makers you can

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,079
hang multiple sites off so here's an

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,800
example of that these are the sites

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,320
we've got going at the moment

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,839
some of these are live others are in

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,079
production where they've got a little

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,040
closed eye those ones in particular

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,639
they're not viewable yet they're being

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:52,079
worked on

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,600
um and

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,160
they can be owned by different owners

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,480
who are either global admin or site

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,480
admin

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,519
modules

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,240
these are the add-ons that you can

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,360
you can add to your omeka install

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,880
there's all kinds of different things

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,360
that you can add on

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,720
particularly great one is the mapping

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,920
module which we use

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,519
in the wa migration stories

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:23,920
and that allows you to geo-locate items

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,160
and add interactive maps with the items

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,440
on them to omega pages

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,440
um that's pretty nifty

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,920
and the items themselves these are the

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,199
digital objects that

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,440
underpin omega so for the most part

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,639
in our case they're digitized

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,240
photographs

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:47,199
but they can be pdf files they can be

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,160
audio files video files

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,000
all sorts of different things items have

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,560
media attached the media being the

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,680
actual

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,160
files themselves but you can have an

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,480
item with no media

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,680
such as a newspaper title but you can't

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:07,039
have media without an item

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:11,360
items can be saved into sets

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:14,480
um one item can be in numerous sets

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:17,679
we use sets to restrict

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,880
the view within our particular

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,120
sites so if you hit browse inside our

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,480
federation site you'll only see items in

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,160
our federation

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,960
set um because teddy bears for example

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,039
aren't so relevant to federation so but

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,120
they can be shared across different

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,400
sites as well which is quite a nice

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,400
feature some of the time

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,880
vocabularies i mentioned earlier most of

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,559
these

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,559
come um

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,360
into a maker they're already there we

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,480
added schema.org for it for a few things

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,240
that we wanted

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,960
as well um so it it allows you to extend

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,799
it

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,640
to make it more relevant for your usage

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:03,280
i suppose

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,120
same deal with resource templates what

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,440
these are is they're a predefined

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,880
set of properties that you use when you

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,559
create new items

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,160
so when we started off we were using

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,240
base resource

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,200
when we were creating new items but

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,280
after a while

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,120
we looked at it and went you know it

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,520
might be a good idea to make our own and

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,200
i think it was university of tasmania

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,360
what they were doing that prompted that

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,840
so we created our own resource template

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,360
called

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:32,799
slwa trove and i'm gonna just jump

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,799
back here

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,919
and pop back in

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,320
so this shows you the the slwa trove

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:46,960
resource template is pretty cool because

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:50,160
it maps directly to

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,280
our catalog and that means it's just

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,480
easier and more accurate to copy

00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,000
copy things to and forth um

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,720
it's um you're not having to hunt all

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,799
over the place

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,360
it just makes it a little bit easier and

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,960
it controls what we definitely want so

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,960
mandatory things and things that are

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,080
optional um

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,120
it's just a nice way to to make it sort

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,120
of more custom for us

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:23,039
now amica like um a lot of

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,480
open source software has pretty good

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,440
documentation online

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,200
there's a user manual there's a

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,960
developer manual

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,480
and there's also forums online so if

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,080
you're looking for help or you want more

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,360
information about something

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:41,120
there's a fair bit out there and mostly

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,120
kept reasonably up to date as well

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,480
so challenges here you go i had to add

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,160
an xkcd just for my

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:53,200
last minute edition um we have had

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,640
some challenges along the way um

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,320
some of the error messages that a maker

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,240
throws aren't

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,160
as helpful as they could be i think

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,159
that's probably a common

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,600
issue with a lot of technical things um

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,240
especially when it comes to database

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,280
errors sometimes they're just

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,520
it can be a bit hard to figure out

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,600
what's going on we have

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,880
had a bit of trouble with the api we've

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,919
got some things to work

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,760
but it doesn't always

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,520
work as per the documentation and the

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,280
documentation is also a little bit

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,200
sparse about that

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,400
um and there's not as much

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,640
troubleshooting

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,840
help there as as i would have liked

00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,480
personally

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,440
um same with the bulk upload the bulk

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,200
upload

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,280
fails pretty readily which i suppose is

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,400
a good thing in a lot of ways

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,440
but it makes it a bit challenging

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:45,280
to do a lot with it i suppose

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,360
and as with many open source software

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,440
the additional modules some of them are

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,440
fantastic and others you think oh look

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,120
that would do exactly what i want

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,799
but it's not up to date and it hasn't

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,640
been updated for a year or two

00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:02,240
so that can that can be frustrating um

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,840
from the point of view of the library

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,159
other challenges we've had the the

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,440
obvious one is just having staff

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,760
and time to work on the projects um

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,480
that's where covert was great because we

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,520
needed to

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,960
immediately find stuff to do online and

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,240
we were already doing this so that was

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,440
that was pretty easy to just

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,080
continue with it um when we finish

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,760
things

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,600
getting them approved can be a little

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,880
bit slow at times just with everything

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,520
else going on

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,159
and some of the we have really really

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,679
good

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:35,840
rapport with our it people but um

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,360
if we want modules added sometimes that

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,960
that can take a little while too so we

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,000
don't have as much

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,120
um control that's always the way

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,120
as we would like in some cases

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,240
we're going to have to stop you there

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,159
molly um

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,840
there's so much more to talk about here

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,000
and

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,280
yeah it's i mean it's so exciting for a

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,880
number of reasons i think

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,960
all of us could put our hands up about

00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,600
those ugly legacy websites that as you

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,960
say sort of

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,080
have attached themselves um or have sort

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,240
of sit there in the

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,280
in the back um but i think the point you

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,840
raised about

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,840
those um potentially no longer being

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:15,760
culturally safe

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,280
and having to to address that unsafeness

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,640
is really important and i think we'll

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,679
probably have more discussion about that

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,240
in the chat

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,240
um so i'd like to thank you so much um

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,799
again for showing us just how achievable

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,280
this is

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,960
as well um and also for the mandatory

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,159
shout out to tim sherritt

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,400
um it's a go glam feature um

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,440
so molly i'll invite you into our chat

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,600
where people will

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,200
no doubt have so many questions um and

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,840
thank you again

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,840
