In 2020 I started building an interactive map of Australian public library services, rules, and collections. This involved using open data from multiple sources (states, territories, and library associations) provided in multiple formats. My experience sparked some questions both for people using open data and for those publishing and managing it. Who is open data for? How generously do public data stewards manage this data commons? Does there have to be a tension between maintenance and generous provision? And what can open data maintainers do to make it more accessible and useable by ordinary humans? We'll explore these questions as well as a quick rundown of how to make your own interactive maps using public geodata. Check out the map at https://librarymap.hugh.run

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,119
uh we've got

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,520
hugh rundle with us he is a librarian

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,320
and advocate for open culture and free

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,000
software

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,480
we're not making trouble and writing

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,240
crappy code she works at la trobe

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,480
university library

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,640
in 2020 hugh started building an

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,920
interactive map of australia's public

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,079
library services

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,000
rules and collections this involved

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,079
using open data from multiple sources

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,920
provided in multiple formats

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,920
hugh's experiences sparked some

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,399
questions both for people using open

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,480
data

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,160
and for those publishing and managing it

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,039
and he's here today to explore some of

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,199
those with us

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,199
welcome hugh thanks bonnie

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,199
so thanks everyone i'm abusing my

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,000
privileges today by

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,160
starring in my own mini conf um today

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,600
i'm speaking to you from unseated ranger

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,879
wavering country

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,200
where people from many indigenous

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,840
nations now live i pay respect to their

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,080
elders

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,680
past present and emerging and i really

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,720
hope to learn more from them

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,159
in future i'm going to talk to you about

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,600
a little project i've been working on

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,920
it's a map of libraries

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,040
and i believe in calling things what

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,159
they are

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,280
so i called it library map

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,360
it maps data about both library services

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,640
and library buildings across the

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,680
continent of australia

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,680
and some australian external territories

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,000
the libraries layer maps out physical

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,680
library locations and also shows

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,360
an 800 meter radius around the library

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,880
and that's the distance that's generally

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,880
accepted by urban planners it's the

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,439
average most people think of as

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,399
within walking distance uh sort of

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,280
psychologically

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,320
so it's sort of a useful proxy for can i

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,000
you know is this a walkable library

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,759
the rules layer shows fines regimes

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
the green and purple layers you can see

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,720
here

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,720
and they are overlaid with the lending

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,400
period which is the patterns you can see

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,680
so you can see both in combination for

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,680
each library service

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,720
future layers uh will include which

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,080
integrated library management software

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,239
each library service

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,160
uses and that's coming very soon i've

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,319
got most of the data i need for that

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,520
and which languages are held at which

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,599
physical libraries

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,599
and that's coming soon-ish

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,599
the tech stack is a few uh comma

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,239
separated values files

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,879
the open source qgis software

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,080
application

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,760
which is used to create the single geo

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,400
json file from multiple geo data sources

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,200
and i also use it to extract data as csv

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,519
files from

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,760
some other data sources so the tasmanian

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,120
location data was originally in geojson

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,879
but i wanted it in

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,319
csv there's a very small python script i

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,200
wrote to merge data

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:10,159
about library services from a csv file

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,319
into the geo json file

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,360
there's a thing called topo json which

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,200
is a way to

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,800
massively reduce the file size of a geo

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,800
json file

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,480
and therefore make it usable on the web

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,239
so the original geojson file was like

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,120
360 megabytes which you can't load in a

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,599
browser

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,920
um i turned that into typo json then

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,319
it's uh two and a half meg

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,360
i then use the leaflet javascript

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,879
library to layer the data onto a map

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,720
and to do that you need

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,480
a tile service and i'm using mapbox

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,400
which is free and uses a lot of open

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,680
source data from openstreetmap

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,599
so that's how it all works in terms of

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,159
displaying the data but how about

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,519
getting the data in the first place

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,360
that's definitely been the hardest part

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,720
of the project and i'm still missing a

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,640
fair bit

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,319
i started by looking at data for the

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,720
state of victoria because that's where i

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,080
live

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,480
and i worked in victorian public

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,640
libraries for a long time

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,480
so i searched for public libraries at

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,799
the data vic open data portal

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,599
and immediately i struck gold the csv

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,599
file

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,280
with public library longitude and

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,560
latitude coordinates for every library

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,000
in the state

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,600
so i was like this is going to be too

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,199
easy

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,440
but after a while i realized there was

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,759
something wrong with default there were

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,880
a lot of libraries missing libraries i'd

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,240
worked in

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,800
libraries i'd visited many times so

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,320
i took a closer look and i've realized

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,199
the data was at least

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,800
10 years out of date datavik had a

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,400
feedback form so

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,080
i let them know about the out of date

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,240
file and

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,919
i asked them if they could update it and

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,440
suggested that they set up a system for

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,520
keeping it up to date because

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,960
you know um i'm helpful like that

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,639
and i got an email back from someone

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,520
i'll call sam

00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,000
from data vic good afternoon hugh thank

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,000
you for reaching out to us at data.vic

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,520
i will be retiring the record you

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,360
referenced you can access

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,720
library locations data from the record

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,000
below

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,120
i hope this helps so it was good news

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,240
there was already an up-to-date file so

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,520
sam was going to delete

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,479
the old file but what was this features

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,479
of interest record

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:28,639
the url sam helpfully directed me to

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,840
downloads a zip file that unzips into a

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,800
folder

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,560
that has six nested subdirectories to

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,840
end in a collection of obscurely named

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,199
files

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,039
one of which is a shapefile with

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,759
geopoint data

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,320
a small subset there in being data about

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,919
public libraries

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,000
all i wanted was for database to update

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,919
the csv file of library locations and

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,160
instead i got a shapefile

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,160
at the end of six nested subdirectories

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,560
it didn't feel like it was particularly

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,319
helpful

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,759
i worked out how to export the shapefile

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,000
data to csv

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,759
using qgis but i had no idea whether

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,400
that was even possible when i actually

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,280
received sam's email originally

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,720
i'm not a geo data professional i like

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,960
looking at maps but i

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,639
barely understand what a projection is

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,080
and i don't really understand the

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,560
difference between raster and vector

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,560
formats

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,759
now in 2010 tim smen as tim berners-lee

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,759
proposed a five-star rating system for

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,199
linked open data the fast start data

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,639
concept was

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,400
quickly embraced by open data

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,080
enthusiasts including the people who

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,639
created and maintain

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,840
open data portals for australian

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,840
government

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,440
in fact the australian open data portal

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,319
data.gov dot au

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,880
explicitly rates all the data sets it

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,440
has

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,599
using the five star data system

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,199
but every step of the five star rating

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,000
system has trade-offs

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,479
and whilst more stars means the data is

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,599
more

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,440
usable for some users and many machines

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,199
after a certain point it actually

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,639
becomes less usable

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,160
for other people so a key point for data

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,479
maintainers to consider is that you

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,000
don't have to exclusively provide data

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,479
in only one format

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,479
or set removing a data set

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,880
because the same data is available as a

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,639
subset of a file in a totally different

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,080
format

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,160
frankly is a pretty crappy way to

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,479
maintain data openly

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,560
and don't get me wrong i worked in local

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,160
government for 17 years

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,319
i've been a knowledge systems maintainer

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,720
for 20 i understand that data can be a

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,840
pain in the neck to maintain

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,360
but i also think this can be used as an

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,120
excuse for making data less accessible

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,199
it was profoundly frustrating for data

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,759
victoria to provide geodata in csv

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,000
format

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,360
only to completely remove that format

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,720
when they were asked to keep it up to

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,879
date

00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,560
it might be open but is it generous

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,560
how many stars for accessibility and

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,240
user friendliness would you give sam's

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,240
obscure shapefile

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,039
here's an example from data gallery u of

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,960
the formats available for the western

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,400
australian local government boundaries

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,120
you can get this file in

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,039
two different shapefile versions using a

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,000
web mapping service

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,840
or a web feature service or as geojson

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,599
which is actually what i did

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,120
so if you want this data you're not

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,080
restricted to having to download

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,320
only for example one single shapefile

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,800
containing the lga boundaries

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,080
and the town locality boundaries and the

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,680
state electoral boundaries

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,519
and the federal electoral boundaries and

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,240
so on

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,159
it'd be pretty simple for someone in the

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,600
victorian geodata unit to set up a

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,360
system that automatically spits out

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,360
files in multiple formats

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,959
for every subset of their gigantic

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,600
features of interest file

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,720
every time it's updated this is the kind

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,360
of thing that happens in software

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,200
development

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,399
every hour of every day you just

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,000
automate it

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,519
it doesn't require someone to create a

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,399
bespoke file by hand

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,040
every time the data changes this would

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,600
be the generous approach to open data

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,360
and make the data open not just in a

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,399
technical letter of the law sense but

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,160
also

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,360
much more openly approachable to people

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,640
with a variety of skills and experience

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,240
i mean it's nice that data.vic has a big

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,920
features of interest file

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,519
but the only features i was interested

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,040
in were the public libraries that

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,880
previously provided us an out of date

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,839
csv file

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,200
that's pretty annoying so i typed out an

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,080
enormous lie

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,080
and sent it back to sam from data.big

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,440
thanks sam makes sense

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,720
i can see how it'd be tricky to maintain

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,480
separate files for everything

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,080
now fortunately for sam i quickly got

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,760
over my annoyance because i was about to

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,279
confront the kafka-esque world

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,800
of the new south wales spatial data

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,399
service

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,000
it took quite a long time to find the

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,080
new south wales features of interest

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,560
geodataset

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,160
and then a while longer to work out how

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,880
to download it without having to create

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,320
an account

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,440
in a mysterious web application

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,120
the button called full data set seemed

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,040
promising

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,640
but did not in fact download the full

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,800
data set

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,800
but finally i found the magic filter

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,519
building complex type 11 of course

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,480
i guess it's true that naming things

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,839
really is

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,000
one of the hardest problems in computer

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,519
science

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,279
anyway it looks like that means

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,959
libraries excellent

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,760
and so it did but also tv stations

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,760
and radio telescope locations and

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:47,600
libraries in the act

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:50,000
which is not actually in new south wales

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,399
and mysteriously some but not all

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
university libraries

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,680
none of these including any street

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,760
addresses

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,839
truly a treasure trove of generous and

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,839
open data

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,839
thanks new south wales special data team

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,839
now i don't want to take out my full 15

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,279
minutes sarcastically moaning about open

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,120
data providers

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,959
so here are some people who are doing it

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,560
really well the state library of

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,839
queensland provides

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,440
full contact details opening hours

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,079
and even the name of the software system

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,160
for every library service in the state

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,079
the tasmanian government provides a gi

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,560
json file with locations of every

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,760
library

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,399
including whether it's wheelchair

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,399
accessible and library south australia

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,320
provides lists in both pdf and excel

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,959
formats listing every public library in

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,079
the state

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:41,040
including address data and a kml file

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,959
with locations it'd be better if they

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,000
included the geodata in a csv

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,320
file but at least we can access it

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,079
and i'm not just saying that because csv

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,079
is what i wanted

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,279
i wanted the data in csv for much the

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,839
same reason that i think it's a good

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,600
format

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,839
generally let's go back

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,200
to the library map text deck there's a

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,600
lot of steps involved

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,440
and a lot of different technologies to

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,360
follow my workflow

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,680
for making the map you need to know how

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,440
to write html css in javascript

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,360
understand what geojson is and how to

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,120
manipulate it install

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,560
and know how to run scripts with python

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,279
and node.js

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,880
know how to manipulate files with qgis

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,120
have a reasonably powerful computer in

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,639
order to process 200 megabyte geojson

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,680
files

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,760
and learn how leaflet works so part of

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,399
the reason i use the leaflet

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,000
csv plugin is because storing data as

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,760
csv is

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,600
just much more efficient and has smaller

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,240
files in geojson

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,920
but i also made this choice so that

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,360
contributing to the project would be

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,360
more open and accessible

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,880
if you want to help update the data used

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,200
in library map

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,000
you only need to know how to edit fields

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,480
in a relatively

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,240
lightweight comma separated values file

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,360
using any of the many applications

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,360
designed to do that

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,120
so you can use excel libreoffice

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,040
openoffice google sheets

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,519
you can even use a simple text editor if

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,600
you hate yourself that much

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,040
i don't want people to feel excluded

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,639
from being able to contribute to the

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,160
project just because their technical

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,320
knowledge doesn't include

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,079
writing javascript or how to install a

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,720
usable python environment which even i

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:23,760
can barely do now

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,480
i'm still missing quite a bit of data so

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,040
i need

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,480
these contributors if you'd like to help

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,160
with the map you can check out the

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,079
contributing page on the website which

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,320
is on the screen

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,160
all the data is available in github and

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,600
pull requests with updates about library

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,839
service rules are particularly welcome

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,680
i'm planning to write a step-by-step

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,199
guide on editing csvs

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,440
and making a pull request for people who

00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,760
are interested in that helping but

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,639
haven't used git before

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,639
but i haven't done that yet

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,959
so in summary if you maintain open data

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,320
in some capacity i encourage you to

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,560
think about how generous

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,000
your data is what assumptions are you

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,040
making about what people might

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,519
want to use your data for can you

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,040
provide

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,720
your data in more formats are your data

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,680
formats accessible to people with

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,360
varying skills and knowledge

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,360
and are you sure about that

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,240
so please visit librarymap.hue.run to

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,160
check out the map

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,560
if you have any questions or suggestions

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,399
i'll be in the conference chat all day

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,720
you can also find me on mastodon at hugh

00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,839
aussglam.space

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,199
or you can email me at lobbymap at

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,440
hue.run thanks for coming to my go glam

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,560
talk

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,760
hey hugh thanks for that um i think one

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,880
of the really interesting things you

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,880
brought up is that

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,720
that difference between generous and

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,160
open and it's something we've tried to

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,480
bring attention to here with our you

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,320
know

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,680
go glam which is generous and open

00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,880
galleries libraries and archives and

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,360
museums

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,519
that there is that difference and we may

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,079
not necessarily be acknowledging or

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,199
actually

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,839
um doing anything about that in what we

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,440
release

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,240
so i'm going to let you jump into our

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,360
chat stream um so we'll spend about 10

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,920
minutes in there

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,839
everyone can ask you loads of questions

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,320
and he'll try not to be sarcastic
