We all understand the importance of the README.md file in open-source software. But what happens when you go beyond software and begin to document your hardware and your business model too? What could happen if you transformed your documentation from a file, to a product? In this talk, Rory Aronson tells the story of how FarmBot Inc is raising the bar of what it means to have great documentation, and why it is vital to his mission and vision.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source.
