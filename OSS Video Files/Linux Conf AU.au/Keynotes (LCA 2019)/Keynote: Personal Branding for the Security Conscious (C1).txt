00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,039
personal branding and the InfoSec

industry not only to get the job you

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,030

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,489
the community and before I ask you to

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,629
come forward I've just remembered

00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:00,780
something I forgot I think you all want

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:05,000
to see Tim the tool man Taylor

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:08,729
terrible tool of torture today that I

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,430
used to convince computers to do things

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:15,240
when they otherwise would misbehave so

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:22,100
allow me to produce it please don't

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:27,380
freak out skill tour

00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:31,260
[Applause]

00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,670

camera that I have here this is a part

00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:53,000
of my social branding there's a reason

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,000
for it can you see it

00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,070
so one of the really fun things about

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,880
personal branding is you do everything

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:06,270
that you can to promote yourself so that

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:12,480
you can end up doing more keynotes like

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:14,580

keynote but I'm more than happy to chat

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,690

lobby Khan is a thing and thank you to

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,790
LCA I really appreciate being here this

00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,650
is a huge opportunity for me not only to

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,239
be visiting New Zealand and hanging out

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:32,610
with some awesome Kiwis I heard it was

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:34,800
okay if I say that okay yeh but also

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,780
because this is a wonderful chance for

00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,760
me to grow my career I'm still fairly

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,300
new at speaking and this is only the

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,670
third time

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,800
given a keynote speech so it's still

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:47,100
very nerve-wracking and it's scary to

00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:52,890
get on stage in front of so many people

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:54,510
so please be nice and today's agenda is

00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:56,940
going to mostly just be about my

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,220
personal experiences with developing my

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,740
career building your own career from

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,140
scratch whether that's in InfoSec or an

00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,360
open source or what have you building

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,130
your personal branding and making sure

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,890
that you keep your security intact

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:13,470
because that's very hard to do online

00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:15,930
dealing with haters yay women on the

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,890
internet and how I found purpose and

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,480
what I do

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:24,180
so hello Who am I I'm Shannon Morse as

00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,400
Steven introduced me so wonderfully I do

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,680
YouTube videos online they're all about

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,980
information security I also do videos

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,070
about travel and over the 10-year eleven

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,720
year course of my career I've really

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,570
developed a name for myself in

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,250
information security in hacking and it's

00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,590
something that I've really found a

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:46,800
passion for over those ten years and I'm

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:49,410
completely self-taught so let's talk a

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,419
little bit about impostor syndrome it's

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:53,880
something that everyone has to deal with

00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,650
at some time in their life some of us

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,100
deal with it a lot better than others

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,890
but it's still very very hard I have

00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,450
hecka I changed that because I was told

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,300
I probably shouldn't cuss up here but I

00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,610
have hecka impostor syndrome it's very

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,460
very hard and scary for me to do things

00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:14,460
like this but every single time I get an

00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,669
opportunity that I feel like will allow

00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,320
me to grow in my career I try to beat up

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:22,080
that impostor syndrome every time I get

00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,820
by saying yes I will do that and I try

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,270
so hard to make sure that it's something

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,010
that I can be proud of and I also do

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,280
that by finding my own self confidence

00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:34,290
and my self-esteem which is not easy at

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,000
all these are things that you have to

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,550
build throughout your life these are

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,560
things that you can help yourself build

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,450
by surrounding yourself with positive

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,070
people people that really promote what

00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,290
you do and are happy about what you're

00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,000
doing and they give you hugs and they

00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,470
appreciate you and they love you for

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,650
what you're doing in your career and

00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,220
they seek see your happiness and

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,930
surrounding yourself with

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,630
that positivity really helps build

00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:00,210
self-confidence and self-esteem so

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:02,040
taking action practicing surrounding

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,530
yourself with awesome individuals and

00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,220
being consistent with your career you

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:10,290
should never just give up never give up

00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:13,460
because the more that you try the closer

00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:16,170
you can get to building your brand so

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:18,330
how have I accomplished what I have in

00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,040
ten years well these are just a few of

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,240
the accomplishments that I've made in

00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,460
the 10 years and you could just say oh

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:30,650
well she's just promoting yourself well

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:33,240
that's the point of the talk thank you

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:35,670
so some of the things that I'm very

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,710
proud of are the fact that I have 1500

00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:40,440
plus videos on the internet that are

00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,690
completely free and open for everyone to

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,360
watch this is completely free education

00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,669
and they are very educational in fact I

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,800
have professors that use my Linux

00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:52,560
terminal tutorials in their course

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,510
material for college I just finished a

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,790
batch programming series on my channel

00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:58,890
an entire playlist of videos where I

00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,870
teach people how to start programming in

00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:03,180
bash and it's so much fun and it was

00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,620
really exciting I gotta say I loved it

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,760
and now I want to do all sorts of things

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,040
in bash it was great

00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,070
I've also contributed to a bunch of

00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,590
different companies like C net and

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:15,720
NVIDIA and Sony whether you like them or

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,610
not these are companies I've worked with

00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,350
and I'm very proud of that and I've

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,710
given three keynotes including this one

00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,300
two panels to whisp talks which is women

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,850
in security and privacy and three

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,290
university talks so far and those are

00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,260
just the ones that I've been able to

00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:34,200
figure out now and that's only ten years

00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:36,000
into my career I'm also a ham licensed

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:42,540
operator if anybody else is out there

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,940
yes km6 fpp hi so I'm very proud of what

00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,690
I've been able to do so far but how did

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,479
I get there

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,460
so my back story and it's probably very

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,510
similar to many of yours out there is

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:56,790
that I started with nothing really

00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:59,070
developing with Linux I had no clue what

00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,979
it was when I was a kid I didn't even

00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:04,110
know it was a thing until I started with

00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:04,650
hack five so I was not an overnight

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,139
success

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,689
I had no background

00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,300
and hacking or information security or

00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:14,419
making or anything like that now i play

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,949
with Arduinos and thread boards and i

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:20,729
programming and all this weird stuff

00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:22,650
that my mom does not understand so when

00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:25,620
I said yeah I'm gonna start doing videos

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:32,399
on Linux my friends were just like but

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:34,740
that you did theater that's weird so I

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,529
said well yeah but I did Geocities

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:40,579
videos and their websites when I was 14

00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:46,140
that counts for something right yeah

00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:47,880
yeah HTML what so my mom and dad really

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,560
supported me and even though they didn't

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,120
understand what I was doing they were

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,980
totally about it they were like you know

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,550
what we can see that you really like

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,850
this honey

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,290
so you go for it they were really

00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,589
supportive even though they didn't get

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,930
it

00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:02,579
so my background was theater and

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,740
building computers with my dad and stuff

00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:08,070
like that but I too had to start

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,720
somewhere eventually and when I say I

00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,510
started building computers when I was a

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,279
kid it's definitely true so I don't know

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,350
what I was doing on that machine but my

00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,779
dad had computers in my nursery room and

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,060
I grew up around them because he was a

00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,709
builder as well he loved making his own

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,410
machines and when I hit around nine or

00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:27,029
ten my dad decided I think you're ready

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,160
to build your own computer so he taught

00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:31,290
me how and ever since then I think I at

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,510
this point I've probably built 10 or 11

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,980
machines since then I even taught my

00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:39,350
husband how to build a computer a few

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,350
months ago I'm so proud of him and

00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:46,290
that's my days in theater it's a little

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:51,990
embarrassing but that's a I was

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:53,430
Cinderella those good times so let's

00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,850
just skip that that's also a little

00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:58,140
awkward so I went to college for

00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,240
restaurant and hospitality

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,779
administration which you can obviously

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,600
look at and say that's definitely not

00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:09,209
computers whatsoever that has nothing to

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,970
do with the industry at all it doesn't

00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:13,860
but it also taught me a lot about how to

00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,319
build a business and how to build a

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,240
career so when I stepped out of college

00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:20,470
and I kind of discovered for myself I

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,110
don't actually want to run a rest

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,700
or run a hotel or a casino or even

00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,280
conventions for that matter because it

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,870
is so stressful I decided that I wanted

00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,120
to go into something that kind of mixed

00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,510
the two molds of my life together

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,670
building computers in theater both of

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:39,580
which are passions that I've had since I

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,530
was a little kid but neither of which I

00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,510
could figure out how to do on their own

00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:45,640
as a career sure I can own a computer

00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:47,830
shop but I don't think that was for me

00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,840
and sure I could go into theater in like

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:52,390
New York and try to get into Broadway

00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,860
which is very competitive but I also

00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,020
didn't think that was for me

00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,330
while I enjoyed getting on a stage and

00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,010
you know making people excited and

00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,110
loving that kind of job and while I

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:04,180
really enjoyed building computers I

00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,550
wanted to be in front of people I wanted

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,720
to educate I wanted to entertain so

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:12,280
that's why I started doing hak5 hak5

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,530
which is the show I've been doing for 10

00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,770
years now so YouTube was established

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:20,440
back in February of 2005 hak5 happened

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:23,200
in fall of 2005 so we were technically

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,960
early adopters we've been around from

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,640
the very very start I had a meeting at

00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,500
that time which basically changed my

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,420
future and it was very very much

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,600
happenstance and I just happen to have

00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:38,170
mutual friends networking very very

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:40,480
important so I graduated college in 2008

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:43,030
I started this really weird job at a

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,530
baked because back in the day YouTube

00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:48,340
did not make any money you could not you

00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,680
could not pay rent

00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,450
on YouTube not by itself so I had this

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,060
full-time bank job and I did some camera

00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,340
work for hak5 it was really cool and I

00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:01,840
officially started with hack 5 back in

00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:04,060
2008 in August and at the time I was

00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,190
still kind of getting my feet wet just

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,230
sticking my toes in and by the way these

00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:10,410
heels are Sailor Moon heels and they are

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,410
awesome

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,490
I'm so glad they're Sailor Moon fans out

00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,630
there because I am obsessed and by the

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,100
way I have a youtube channel about

00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:22,720
Sailor Moon so it was very very hard to

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,610
get started because I was nervous this

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,670
was something I had never gotten into

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:30,640
Linux what is that what is open source

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,190
all I know is winders you know on it I

00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,300
didn't understand any of it but

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,680
educating myself when I was going

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,930
line and trying to figure out all the

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,110
information was very very hard it was

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:46,480
hard to find information it was so tough

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:50,260
so TLDR RTFM kind of sucks I hated

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,870
whenever I went to forums or when I went

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:56,680
to websites or IRC and people would just

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:58,390
tell me well just RTFM especially if I

00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,370
told them what my name was or if they

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,340
figured out that I was a female it was

00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:05,530
so hard to find information that would

00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,650
help me along in this path that I really

00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:11,680
wanted to deep dive into there was a lot

00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:14,380
of egotism a lot of elitism in the crowd

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,320
and it was tough I felt like there was

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,450
no place for beginners to go if you were

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,410
interested in information security or

00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:26,650
open source so I became that resource I

00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,510
figured out it didn't exist there was no

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,370
place for people to go if they wanted to

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:33,310
learn and if they best learned from

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:35,470
watching videos so I decided I'm gonna

00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,700
become that resource because it was

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:39,340
missing and there's probably other

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,890
people out there just like me who did

00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:45,190
not know where to go to find out about

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:47,860
open source and information security so

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:50,050
I keep this in here because my friend

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,670
illustrated this photo based on a tweet

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,890
that I've just randomly made one day

00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,410
where I said never make fun of the kid

00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:58,080
who asks all the questions I was lunch

00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,980
that kid and people thought I was stupid

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,780
really though they were just too

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,550
embarrassed to ask the same thing so I

00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,800
started with little to no understanding

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:09,490
of InfoSec but I had a willingness to

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:12,130
learn and that is what's so important so

00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,820
what is my job title now that you know

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,920
my history

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,110
I'm an Internet media host and producer

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,150
an influencer a brand ambassador and

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,320
educator all of these different little

00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,970
things that happen when you're a

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,490
youtuber that talks about something

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,890
that's education I've had four to five

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,390
years of work developing my brand not

00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,460
the entire ten years because I did not

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,770
know how important it was ten years ago

00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,560
and the work is not over because the

00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:36,670
industry is always changing there's

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,980
always something different that's

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,850
happening so let's talk about starting

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,500
your career and this can happen for

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,030
whatever career you choose to go into

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,649
because everybody has different passions

00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:50,019
but you can still use this at

00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:52,449
vice for whatever careers you choose so

00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:54,309
you need to ask yourself what does a

00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:56,259
company need if there's a company that

00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:57,730
you really want to work for what does

00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:00,490
that company need and what are they

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,439
hiring for both very important questions

00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:04,499
and how has the industry changed over

00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:07,179
the years you may have noticed

00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:09,550
especially at conventions codes of

00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:12,850
conducts have become much much more

00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:15,550
mainstream even in anime conventions and

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,079
InfoSec security conventions we've seen

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:19,449
more of these codes of conducts and that

00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:21,519
tells us that the industry as a whole is

00:15:19,449 --> 00:15:24,279
getting a lot more diverse and we need

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,259
to be a sceptic of that diversity so

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,540
what are the diversity numbers and how

00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:31,509
can you influence this industry hash tag

00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:34,929
industry comment for whatever industry

00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:36,369
you might be in a positive way so for

00:15:34,929 --> 00:15:38,920
example and this is just for information

00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:40,990
security because that's what I'm in but

00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:43,329
this can be also be looked at for other

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,040
industries as well you may be curious

00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:47,050
about what kind of certifications you

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,059
need to get into that industry ask

00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,519
yourself if there's any certs that you

00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:53,379
are really interested in now in this

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,709
example you'll notice at the very top

00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:59,439
CompTIA security plus there are a lot of

00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:01,809
certification holders there are not a

00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:04,839
lot of openings available for those

00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:07,660
certification holders so maybe hold off

00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:10,089
on the CompTIA security Plus cert and

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:14,079
look at something else like a CIS SP

00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:17,110
which has almost a one-to-one ratio for

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:20,110
holders as well as openings at jobs that

00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,819
are requesting those certifications so

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,800
take this information into account

00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:26,559
whenever you're considering how can you

00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,179
get into that job and you don't

00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,549
necessarily have to get certs I don't

00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:33,339
have any certs and I'm still able to

00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:35,499
grow a career in information security so

00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:37,749
also what do companies need as far as

00:16:35,499 --> 00:16:39,879
what their titles are look at the titles

00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:41,559
that they are interested in and maybe

00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:43,420
consider taking some classes in college

00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:46,839
or looking up this information on

00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,699
YouTube for example promoting myself to

00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:52,749
find what kind of titles you would like

00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:54,790
to have at different companies and ask

00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:55,689
yourself how has that industry changed

00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,329
over the years

00:16:55,689 --> 00:17:00,670
so we noticed that information security

00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:01,120
has changed a lot in the past couple

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,730
years

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:09,010
and it turns out that we're gonna need

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:10,809
to fill a lot of jobs by 2022 a lot so

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,909
they are going to be spending a lot of

00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:15,819
money and they will need openings which

00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:17,529
is why it's so crucial to have people

00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:20,350
out there who are giving them beginner

00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:23,079
information so that information security

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:24,610
isn't scary so that it's inviting so

00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:27,130
that somebody can go to youtube and see

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:28,690
somebody like them and say okay I could

00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,820
definitely enter this career because

00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:34,630
she's doing that as well I think I could

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,610
do it too now I bring this up as well

00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:39,220
because it is diversity it's all about

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:43,450
having all of that inclusion when it

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:45,610
comes to cybersecurity only 11% of the

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:51,370
people employed in cybersecurity at

00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:54,730
least this is from 2017 is 11% those are

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:58,120
women that's it that's terrible we need

00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:01,360
to do so much better so I hope that by

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:04,270
being on YouTube and being so public I

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,909
can introduce some young women and some

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:09,370
people who don't normally see themselves

00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:11,770
when they see a Hollywood hacker movie

00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:13,630
and they will see me on YouTube and

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:15,549
think I can I could do that that's

00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,799
something that I could actually do so

00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:21,130
how can you be an influencer in your

00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:23,710
industry well there's a lot of different

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,750
ways you can but think about what you

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,220
want to get good at and this also goes

00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,990
along with building your career so you

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,090
can think about what do you want to

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,760
learn and get good at what is your focus

00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:36,700
if you want to focus on a very specific

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,399
platform a very specific distro if you

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,799
will or for me if I wanted to focus on

00:18:39,399 --> 00:18:43,570
information security but really really

00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:44,080
dig into lock-picking that's what I

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,580
could do

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,309
I love lack of it picking by the way

00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,049
it's so fun I actually used it at the

00:18:48,309 --> 00:18:52,510
bank one time and they were like just

00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:54,700
they wanted me to break into a safe and

00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,559
they were like well can you do it under

00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,909
your desk so that the cameras don't

00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,169
catch you you're doing it and I was like

00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:01,179
yeah sure I'll just bring in my love

00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:02,950
pics and so I sat him under my desk on

00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:05,230
the floor and I picked a lock so that

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,660
they could open this till it's like

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:10,770
don't forget your keys people

00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,330
understand your best way to learn not

00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,520
everybody is going to subscribe to a

00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:17,160
YouTube channel I know that they're not

00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,170
my target market and that's okay you may

00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,960
learn best by getting certifications and

00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,270
having a deadline fixed that you have to

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,670
hit and then you get that cert and

00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:28,140
everything's good I have a ham license

00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,700
so sometimes it's good for me to learn

00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,230
in that way when I have a deadline it

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,020
puts a little bit of stress on my head

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:35,280
or on my shoulders so I know I have to

00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,620
make sure I get it done by that

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,690
timeframe and that forces me to learn

00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,700
what I need to learn you could also read

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:44,100
books or go to classes watch videos

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,230
whatever it might be it doesn't matter

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,260
just find a way that you love to learn

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:52,350
and stick with it and compile your list

00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,240
of passions but also compile a list of

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,610
influencers or thought leaders or

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,490
speakers or researchers people that

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:01,710
really influence you to do what you want

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:03,570
to do so start following them on social

00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,250
media if they are there if they're not

00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,390
on social media that's fine maybe they

00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,910
have an email address and they'd be

00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:12,060
welcoming to questions go to their talks

00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:14,580
at events like this ask questions in

00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,920
person comment on their videos if they

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,200
do have a YouTube channel or follow them

00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:24,120
on LinkedIn lots of people have LinkedIn

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:26,100
I don't use it that's okay learn from

00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,440
those role models because everybody can

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,390
give you some kind of expertise some

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,850
information and if they are open to that

00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:34,470
then they are worth it

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:38,670
you may end up being a thought leader in

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:40,740
their eyes even though I had no backing

00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:43,800
in information security ten years ago

00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,470
now I talked to people and I work with

00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,470
people some of them are my co-hosts that

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,840
I used to be I thought they were

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,700
celebrities I was just like you're

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,650
amazing can I get your autograph and now

00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,720
I'm working with them side by side it's

00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,580
amazing what you can do if you just take

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,240
the time to treat somebody else like a

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:05,580
human being it's just yeah boggles my

00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,260
mind so I follow influencers and thought

00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,850
leaders in a whole bunch of different

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,340
areas and this is not just information

00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:14,310
security but it's also YouTube and on

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,110
social media strategy in technology in

00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:17,700
general so there's lots of different

00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:20,370
places that of course we have passions

00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,400
in so maybe even though you want to get

00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,100
into an open

00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,990
career you can learn something else from

00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,050
somebody who's a social media strategist

00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,580
so it's really advisable to not just

00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:32,770
follow the people directly in your

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,300
career path but also follow people right

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,809
outside of it that you can also learn

00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:40,690
things from and keep on learning because

00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:43,000
you can never stop learning sponge up as

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,890
much information as you can block out

00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,050
time every single day to do something

00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,150
that is on your list do it every single

00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:51,730
day no matter what make it become a

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,470
habit I believe it takes like 30 to 60

00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,570
days depending on who you are to make

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,370
something into a habit I'm trying to

00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:01,420
learn Morse code right now on my phone

00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:03,160
and it is so hard it is so hard but I'm

00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:09,490
a Hamm licensed operator and my last

00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:12,309
name is Morris so I was like I feel like

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,620
I should I feel like I should probably

00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:16,870
learn Morse code it's kind of it's like

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,790
a family tradition you know make it a

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,440
routine and never stop learning whether

00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,790
that's like learning Morse code on your

00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,820
phone while you're sitting on the toilet

00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:27,580
or if it's doing something else it

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,640
doesn't matter just make it a habit now

00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,980
build your business you're ready build

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,260
that resume build it with conviction in

00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,929
mind now I didn't drop out of college

00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:40,090
but if I did I would make sure to put on

00:22:37,929 --> 00:22:44,740
my resume something like this Missouri

00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:46,690
State 2003 to 2004 hiatus major Network

00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,610
admin minor in philosophy that's an

00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,780
example obviously I might major it in a

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,230
restaurant in hospitality administration

00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,030
but that way you're not necessarily

00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,980
saying hey if lucked out or hey I

00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:59,050
dropped out it looks much more inviting

00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:00,760
and it's much more positive to say oh I

00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,460
put this on a hiatus because it tells

00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,080
them that you didn't continue going to

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,780
college because you had something else

00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:09,220
that you really wanted to get into

00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,650
creative one-pager this is kind of like

00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,900
a mini resume but it's a little bit more

00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,340
trendy and flashy this is the kind of

00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,530
thing that you can easily share online

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,450
and you don't necessarily have to put

00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,970
all of your information on it so it's

00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,740
very useful for getting an introduction

00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,020
into somebody especially if you're

00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,420
networking with them at events like

00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:30,760
conventions networking of course at

00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,530
conventions also a wonderful thing to do

00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,630
and business cards which are still

00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,910
important I

00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:39,750
we all can just like take pictures of of

00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:41,580
our of our bands or with our lanyards or

00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,990
we can just take pictures of a business

00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,090
card or whatever it might be or go to

00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:46,410
LinkedIn and follow them but it's still

00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,120
nice to have a business card because

00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:49,410
they'll take that home and they will

00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,309
remember that you gave it to them

00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:55,710
especially if your picture is on it

00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:57,600
so build your platform now you might

00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:00,059
think that you don't need to have a

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,190
platform but I believe that everybody

00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:03,960
has their own platform everyone has

00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,390
something to say something that's

00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,549
important in life to share with the

00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:10,919
world and that's why I think that you

00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:12,450
should also build your platform maybe

00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,890
you don't want to do YouTube and that's

00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,039
fine that means more people will

00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:18,360
subscribe to my stuff so I'm down but

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,030
you might want to share something else

00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,770
that you learned at your business so I

00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,659
think it's so important to be able to

00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:27,179
build some kind of platform because

00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:29,340
you're becoming this expert you have

00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:31,679
opinions on your topic you've been doing

00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,240
it you've been building your business so

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,809
what do you do you build your platform

00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,580
do speaking gigs write articles if you

00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:40,500
don't want to do speaking gigs you could

00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,200
write articles online you could publish

00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,730
videos like I do you could answer forum

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,240
questions on some of the most popular

00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:50,460
forums or IRC you could offer advice I

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:55,740
mentioned IRC a lot because we still use

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:57,750
it at hak5 it's so cool it's really fun

00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:01,500
I can't help it it's like better than

00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:03,900
discord sometimes don't hate it so using

00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,580
your platform for good if you can afford

00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:08,100
it and this is something that I've been

00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:10,470
trying to do more often nowadays offer

00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,299
complimentary sessions or some kind of

00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:14,280
free classes or something for

00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:17,250
underrepresented groups in your industry

00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,750
this not only will help you get better

00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,090
at your profession but it also

00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:22,470
introduces your name to a lot of the

00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,950
younger generation that will be coming

00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:28,049
in and also don't undersell yourself now

00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:30,840
one time I was going to work with this

00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:32,190
company a very big brand and they came

00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,799
to me and asked me to do a series of

00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:37,890
videos for them and of course I was just

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,870
like oh yeah sure totally like what rate

00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,419
I don't know what to ask for and they

00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,919
kind of low-balled me so I went to one

00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:45,870
of my friends who's been one of my

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,460
mentors for a long time his name is Tom

00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:50,580
Merritt I'm sure he won't mind me

00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,500
shouting him out hi Tom and I said what

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,690
do you think I'm asked for it what do

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,950
you think I'm worth and he was like well

00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,030
take what you think you're worth and

00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:03,720
just double it and see what they say

00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:05,910
they accepted it it was awesome we just

00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,550
we naturally think we're not worth what

00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:10,020
we actually are and when they accept it

00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:13,640
it just blows your mind but then you're

00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:15,960
like wait should I have asked for more I

00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,700
was pretty happy with it I was like all

00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,220
right cool so build your personal brand

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,440
and this is very very important what is

00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,360
a personal brand so this is where you

00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,720
would establish and promote your skills

00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:29,670
and experiences what makes you uniquely

00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,280
you what is different from everybody

00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:35,100
else around you what differentiates you

00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:38,220
from others in your industry what do you

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:41,550
stand for and why should a client trust

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,410
you all very important questions this

00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,990
will end up leading you to interviews

00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,960
job advances or positions I'm

00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,940
self-employed so that doesn't affect me

00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,040
partnerships or sponsorships definitely

00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,170
affects me speaking against you it's

00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,360
very important passive income that's

00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,220
when you do something online you yes

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,440
stick a little Buy It Now thing on there

00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,180
is subscribe now and then people just

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,940
subscribe on their own time that's

00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:07,890
passive income incredible opportunities

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,520
arise when you build your personal brand

00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:14,550
and developing the blocks of your

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:18,300
personal brand lay a brand your building

00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:21,030
blocks this ends up bringing up a few

00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,130
questions like what are your core values

00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,200
your strengths your a math skill sets

00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,540
list all of these out and try to

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,820
understand what your skill sets are what

00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,230

what do you want to achieve in life what

00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,610
will it mean to be successful in the

00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,230
near and the distant future now I hate

00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:44,700
the question what do you want to do in

00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,450
five years because I'm like I want to do

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,650
this I love what I'm doing it's awesome

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,820
anytime somebody asked me that I feel

00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,650
like they're saying well you're not

00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,720
successful so what do you want to do in

00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,700
five years because you're you still need

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,680
to get better I do believe I still need

00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,260
to get better but I'm happy doing what

00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:03,870
I'm doing what obstacles

00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:06,030
have you uncover overcome what are your

00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,700
passions what inspires you to succeed

00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:11,820
how are you different or unique unique

00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,290
and what or who truly makes you happy

00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,870
surround yourself with those positive

00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:19,080
people and write your vision statement

00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:20,910
and live by that vision statement not

00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,070
just write it just like codes of

00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:26,220
conducts make sure that you are actually

00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:29,100
living that vision statement online and

00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,380
offline very important and provides ways

00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,630
to promote your brand what is your

00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,400
agenda make sure that people know your

00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,560
brand through and through now this isn't

00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,240
actually my personal brand but it gives

00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,960
you an idea of some of the words that I

00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,000
live by

00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,830
I'm a purple hair hacker who actively

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,200
promotes and attends cons that stand for

00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,450
diversity i sponsor cons that have codes

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,490
of conducts I speak out about harassment

00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:53,010
and inequality I do if you check my

00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:54,900
Twitter ever I educate the newcomers I

00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,270
welcome all questions I think every

00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:59,100
question is an important one I like pink

00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,540
and purple and glitter and Sailor Moon

00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:04,010
and candy and Starbucks because I'm

00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,010
totes basic and that's okay

00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:11,040
so self-reflect understand your personal

00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:13,320
brand prioritize your skills and your

00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:15,420
characteristics and expectations avoid

00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,510
anyone who holds you back from your

00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,880
personal brand and this will allow you

00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:23,850
to identify how to showcase your own

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,590
self your best self once you understand

00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:27,840
those strengths and those weaknesses and

00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:29,610
you will stand out from your peers and

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,290
from competition although I think that

00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,270
nobody is competition they're actually

00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:35,370
people you can learn from build your

00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:38,250
tribe of followers and people that

00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:40,530
support you online and be human have

00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:42,900
more meaningful interactions with others

00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:44,970
all of this happens when you build that

00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,280
personal brand you establish your

00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:50,910
credibility you demonstrate your values

00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:52,860
your core values you elevate your social

00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:55,260
proof to other people online you

00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,320
solidify your niche my niche is

00:29:55,260 --> 00:30:00,030
newcomers that are into Linux terminal

00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,800
my niche is newcomers that are into

00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,810
information security that's my thing

00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,580
because nobody else was doing it convey

00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:08,220
your message and values and be more

00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,650
confident and guess what you just built

00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,030
your own personal brand congratulations

00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:15,120
now you can do some shameless

00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:18,300
self-promotion so do it

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,030
now this is very important if you don't

00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:24,720
control and manage your brand others

00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:27,600
will do it for you now if you don't

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,430
exist online others will make sure that

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,380
you do especially if they don't agree

00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:36,150
with you so you need to protect yourself

00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:38,280
where do you draw that privacy line this

00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,350
is so important now this of course

00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,700
differs from person to person but one of

00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,740
the best ways that I have figured out

00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,660
where my line is drawn as far as what

00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,030
matters to me as far as security and

00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,480
privacy was quizzing myself and asking

00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:53,580
myself what are those important things

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,530
now for example I am totally fine with

00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,000
being transparent about how much I make

00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:59,820
on patreon which is a crowdfunding

00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,650
platform so people can go there and they

00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:04,710
can see exactly how much I'm bringing in

00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:06,720
- the patreon fees with that said I

00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:08,670
don't really share how much I make from

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,290
sponsorships which I don't get very

00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:14,540
often but since that money is separate I

00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:17,130
decided that any money that comes from

00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:19,380
sponsorships should be used for personal

00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,420
things like paying my rent while any

00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,430
money that comes from patreon will get

00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,990
put directly back into the show so that

00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:27,360
I can purchase a new camera like this

00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:28,710
one that I kind of broke on Monday and I

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,020
had to go to the Sony store and buy a

00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:33,120
new one that was fun

00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:36,140
a little freaked out different country

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,910
oh thank God they had a Sony store

00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:41,580
privacy affiliated sort resources are

00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:43,530
also very very important there's joined

00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,660
elite me.com which is something i

00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:47,820
recently joined it's a wonderful service

00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:49,740
it is rather expensive but they do have

00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,150
coupons during the holidays so if I I

00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,490
could just check it out it's amazing

00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:55,950
they delete you all of off of all of the

00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:58,560
white page websites the ones that get

00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:01,290
all of your information and just list it

00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,670
out people finder's basically so they

00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,830
delete all that information which is

00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,660
wonderful password managers are

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,850
wonderful different passwords on all

00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,590
sites you of course know that but maybe

00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:12,390
somebody doesn't two-factor

00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,910
authentication especially if you're

00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:18,690
using hardware authentication like UB

00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:20,160
keys or you can use an app if you don't

00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,860
have you bikies available to you

00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,450
I definitely don't support SMS

00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:27,630
two-factor authentication I'm sure you

00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:29,070
know why and guest versus home networks

00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,570
especially if you have in

00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:32,940
of things devices that aren't

00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:34,560
necessarily secure putting those on some

00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:36,300
kind of guests Network will help secure

00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:40,530
your home network so you don't run into

00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:44,010
problems now I include this not because

00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:46,230
well I am a huge fan of Marie Kondo huge

00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:48,690
fan but also because she makes some very

00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,640
valid points what sparks joy in your

00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:52,770

accounts clean up your LinkedIn if you

00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,230
have a YouTube channel from when you

00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,480
were young and you used to post like

00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:06,600
really drunken videos don't ask how I

00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,970

00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,950
protect yourself yes I included this

00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,720
picture because I have a Lord of the

00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,720
Rings fan yes I am taking a tour

00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:26,730
so consider smart sharing this would be

00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:29,310
being social while hiding sensitive

00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:31,530
information like barcodes or if your con

00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:34,140
badge has a QR code on it make sure to

00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:35,670
hide that I recently went to CES and it

00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:37,620
turns out the little QR code on the

00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:41,970
badges had your email address and your

00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:44,730
full name yes right flight tickets those

00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:46,590
can be scanned keys those can be 3d

00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,240
printed addresses we all know what

00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:49,860
happens with addresses right people show

00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,460
up at your front door don't ask how I

00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:55,470
know stories story time yes have a plan

00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,300
of action as well if you do run into any

00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,400
of these security issues make sure that

00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,860
you know how to handle it so think about

00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:04,140
all the things that might happen might

00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:07,320
happen in the future and make sure that

00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,610
you have a plan of action and make sure

00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,370
that you're ready to deal with targeted

00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:13,410
harassment because what happens is since

00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:15,270
you created your personal brand you're

00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:18,630
going to have people that are interested

00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:20,640
in taking you down you start to attract

00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:23,370
that attention so what do you do keep

00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,050
notes make screenshots make sure that

00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:27,630
you're keeping track of the people that

00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:29,370
are targeting you with harassment know

00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:31,800
who to contact whether it's a police

00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:34,380
officer who I have had to get involved

00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,169
in previous cases whether it's the FBI

00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:39,210
or your country service there's always

00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:41,470
somebody out there that could help you

00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:44,349
or maybe it's a community-driven

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:46,780
a engagement platform that can help you

00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:48,820
with that harassment if there are trolls

00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,010
that you're dealing with block them

00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,899
banhammer em if they are on your own

00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:54,669
forum that you're running make sure you

00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:57,099
have a way to implement some kind of

00:34:54,669 --> 00:34:59,320
code of conduct online or a policy that

00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:00,880
deals with these kind of people because

00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,550
somebody is always going to be out there

00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,300
that will be angry at you for doing what

00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:06,730
you do

00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,740
you could troll back it's not

00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:12,609
necessarily my favorite thing to do but

00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:14,680
it's possible now you may ask why do I

00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:17,740
do this there's YouTube comments there's

00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:19,420
judgment why do I do it well I would

00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:21,820
rather have a troll waste their energy

00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,700
on me since I've been doing this for 10

00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:26,560
years and I have a pretty thick skin

00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,480
then troll the brand new person that is

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,400
just getting into information security

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,530
and might get pushed away because they

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,020
see one troll that comments something

00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:38,140
about their personal lives and it just

00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:39,550
it they hate it they just don't want to

00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,920
get into the career because they think

00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:45,130
everyone is like that so troll me that's

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:50,680
fine I will totally handle it and so

00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:52,390
will my friends at the FBI they're

00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:55,119
jealous they're jealous because you're

00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:56,770
successful at this point people are

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,910
always going to hate you online they're

00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:02,230
angry if they want to be where you are

00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:04,720
they will tell you that you don't belong

00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:06,220
here I mean we heard this in the keynote

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,650
from yesterday you don't belong here

00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:12,910
that's something that people here in the

00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:14,710
industry but you know what I can say my

00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:17,230
accomplishments bringing it back they

00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:19,000
speak for themselves and this is what

00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:20,589
I've done over ten years and I have done

00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,540
so much more that I couldn't think of

00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:24,430
when I was writing my keynote speech

00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:27,609
these are all the different things that

00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:29,890
you can do in your own industry you can

00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:31,839
have so many accomplishments and nobody

00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:34,089
can take that away from you because you

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,930
are the person that did those you're the

00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:39,099
person that made it happen nobody else

00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:40,900
those accomplishments speak for

00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:42,000
themselves and nobody can take that away

00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,190
from me

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,050
so why don't I quit it's because of

00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:48,970
everyone here in this audience it's

00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:52,060
because of everyone in the over filled

00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:56,070
rooms hi hi guys

00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:58,840
yes I'm waving at you hello there we go

00:36:56,070 --> 00:37:01,810
it's because of you don't do a job that

00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:03,070
you don't like don't do it for fame or

00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,900
for fortune do it because you're

00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:06,520
passionate do it because you love it do

00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,980
it because you want to change someone's

00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:11,140
life that's what I got into this for

00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,670
because I found a niche I loved it and

00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,080
it was something that was missing and I

00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:16,450
knew that I could change somebody's life

00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,400
so when I see a young girl that comes up

00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:20,200
to me at DEFCON and she tells me that

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,090
she's been watching the show since she

00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,830
was five years old and she's nine years

00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:25,900
old now and she wants to get a job in

00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:28,060
information security that's what I'm

00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:31,510
doing this for that's why I got into

00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:33,700
this career and I hope that I'm living I

00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:36,880
or I hope that you live your dream job

00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:38,740
as well just like I am now so I just

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,390
want to say thank you not just for

00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:43,960
having me up here but for giving me a

00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:46,300
chance to hopefully share my love and my

00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,010
joy of what I do with you and I really

00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:50,410
hope that it inspired and motivated you

00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:52,000
as well to do something that you enjoy

00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:55,570
and to hopefully change some lives

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:59,140
