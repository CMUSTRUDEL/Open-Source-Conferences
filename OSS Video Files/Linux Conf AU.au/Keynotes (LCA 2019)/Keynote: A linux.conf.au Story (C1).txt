In which Uncle Rusty tells a nostalgia-drenched tale of the founding of the conference.

linux.conf.au is a conference about the Linux operating system, and all aspects of the thriving ecosystem of Free and Open Source Software that has grown up around it. Run since 1999, in a different Australian or New Zealand city each year, by a team of local volunteers, LCA invites more than 500 people to learn from the people who shape the future of Open Source. For more information on the conference see https://linux.conf.au/

so if you think about it most of us so

00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:10,260
well let's be fair all of us are here

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:13,280
because a long time ago one person had a

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,990
thought and that thought was to have a

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,199
get-together of a whole bunch of people

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,869
who are in to the Nixon free and open

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,109
source software as a result of that

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:28,109
quite an awful lot of people have over

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:31,439
the the two decades have made

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,140
substantial friends who depend upon this

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:38,040
event in order to have their one time

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,350
face to face meet up so if it we're like

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,559
one just great big family really if you

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:48,329
think about it so it would be on the

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:50,879
20th anniversary of this conference then

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:56,309
it would be absolutely appropriate to

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,910
welcome to the stage the reason for this

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,079
conference

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,079
rusty Russell

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,630
my vacation crypto supply and they call

00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,940
me gentrification to wear your black

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,340
modify in princess in what's the best

00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,729
part of your newfound Treasury money and

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,729
you have you

00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:34,150
[Music]

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:34,150
[Applause]

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,260
well I have an announcement to make

00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:47,970
as some of you know for the last 4 years

00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:51,900
or so I've been working full-time on

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:54,700
Bitcoin and as a result I'm fabulously

00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:58,110
sorry rookie mistake

00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,350
yep - forgot to mute the phone just uh

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,350
sorry about that

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:55,220
come on what change

00:02:38,180 --> 00:03:13,670
I liked next time I won't be needing

00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:17,109
this slide then what seems like we

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:21,200
finished a little ahead of schedule in

00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:22,760
unforeseen circumstances my daughter

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:31,069
suggested that I sing a song that she

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:32,269
wrote goes Linux shock dude I don't do

00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:36,290
that because that was sitting at all to

00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:37,459
have you really annoying but I did have

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,720
a few backup slides just in case we

00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:45,829
finished a bit early from the keynote

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:48,319
about the conference history and is the

00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:50,569
last day of the conference so it's time

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,299
from some nostalgia which basically

00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:54,980
means I get to misremember history into

00:03:53,299 --> 00:04:00,290
a coherent narrative that reinforces my

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:03,069
personal biases so get ready if you were

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,449
born when the first Louis Kampf started

00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:09,290
you would be the same age as I was in

00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:12,409
1992 in second year university and like

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:16,250
many others of this era this was the

00:04:12,409 --> 00:04:20,060
time at which I had my first experience

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:25,159
of UNIX a lab full of X terminals

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:27,620
connected to some our servers now some

00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:29,479
us was quickly becoming the dominant

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,460
UNIX really they're sort of low-end

00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:34,639
machines were great for University and

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,050
Sun Microsystems themselves had some

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,099
legendary hackers who work for them it

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,400
would have been a fantastic place to

00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:40,790
work that's the kind of era that we're

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,780
talking

00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:46,940
about now shortly after I discovered the

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:54,470
elegance of Unix I discovered another

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:56,440
operating system Emacs and inside the

00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:02,210
Emacs distribution was a file called

00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:04,340
manifesto now I was I was an engineering

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,200
student I was about as politically naive

00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,000
as they came I probably couldn't have

00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,670
used the word manifesto in a coherent

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,170
sentence at the time but this was a text

00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:17,060
file that described an effort to build a

00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:20,060
free operating system and set of tools

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:24,770
and it envisioned a completely different

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:26,360
path for software than the commercial

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,360
software and the shareware that I've

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:33,580
been exposed to up to this time and you

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:37,280
couldn't just dismiss this as as no

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:40,420
unbelievable made-up fluff because of

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,860
the fact that Emacs itself existed and

00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:47,390
was a pretty impressive software project

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:49,520
in its own right now despite this

00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,870
contact with the canoe manifesto I took

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,360
a pretty normal path you know I left

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:57,880
University 94 I got a job at a small

00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:02,540
firm working with Silicon Graphics rx

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:03,800
sgi's variant of UNIX at the time and

00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,900
there are about two years of like really

00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,450
long days and nights and weekends of

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,910
hacking its what at the end of this so I

00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:14,330
was leading a research project and we

00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,800
were doing it in C++ and SGI's C++

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,260
compiler that proprietary one was quite

00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,770
expensive so we were using G plus plus

00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,180
the new C++ compiler and I had a few

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,700
limitations it was fairly primitive and

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:31,460
so I actually dug back through the logs

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:37,550
and found my first accepted open-source

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:40,430
contribution back in November 1995 there

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,840
you go now of course we all know the

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,380
compiler hackers have like ten times the

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,540
brain matter of normal hackers but

00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,740
coding on GCC and interacting with these

00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,810
people and collaborating with these

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,880
great coders from around the world was

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,600
exhilarating and opened my eyes you see

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,050
as much as I thought

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,430
and as much as I had already learned I

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,590
realized there was another level

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:05,390
there was another level of coders and

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:10,950
another level of code and I plateaued

00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:14,130
where I was so I loved that job but I

00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:18,090
had to leave towards the end of 96 so I

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:21,840
was contracting in Sydney and I spotted

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:24,540
the upcoming news next conference now

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,590
use next was the UNIX conference at the

00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:30,810
time and the 97 conference featured

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:35,510
tutorials by UNIX greats like W Richard

00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,510
Stevens and security expert Marcus Ranum

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:45,140
but this year they were having a special

00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:47,310
track about Linux called news Linux so

00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,840
that nailed it I headed across to

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,600
California I went to my first conference

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,250
and Linux and Ted chaough and Steven

00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,540
Tweedy and Alan Cox all they're all

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:59,460
giving talks and I went to all of them

00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:04,560
and towards the end of the conference I

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:06,480
was standing in a circle among them and

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,460
they were talking about how to make

00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,560
Linux SMP because at the time when it

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:15,060
was basically for uniprocessor machines

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:18,390
and Dave Miller grabs a napkin and a pen

00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:22,590
and he looks around at all guys we all

00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:24,690
know x86 assembler right so starts

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:28,230
writing out these instructions for what

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,910
became the big kernel walk alan cox then

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:34,710
took the napkin off him and optimized it

00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:38,820
but i and i pretty much shut up and just

00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:43,860
try anything dumb but the real highlight

00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:45,720
of this was a talk by two college

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,300
students about porting linux to the

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:52,950
spark the same kind of hardware that i'd

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:55,230
first learn unix on now unfortunately

00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:57,540
this talk was never recorded so I'm

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:02,040
confident in asserting that it was the

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:05,329
greatest technical talk given by anybody

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,769
on any topic anyway

00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:10,829
and it started talking about open

00:09:07,769 --> 00:09:11,970
firmware of the spark machines and hey

00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:13,889
you can poke around and open firmware

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,029
they discovered you know how to drive

00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,860
the devices and figure out where the

00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:19,740
devices were and got Linux kind of

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,769
booting and everything and then Dave

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,259
showed the results of the LM bench

00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:26,579
benchmark and LM bench is an operating

00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:27,990
system micro benchmark it measures

00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:30,509
basically operating system performance

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,759
for various different up different

00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:35,100
operations written interestingly by

00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:39,660
Larry McCoy hits LM bench when he was at

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:42,779
Sun and you know Lenny's didn't do so

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,779
well against Solaris the the UNIX on

00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:48,300
their own hardware so Dave then went and

00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,680
dived into the deep subtle ease of the

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,689
architecture and he talked about the

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,160
paging subsystem he talked about you

00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:58,019
know the virtual memory and the TLB

00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,879
subtleties of the SPARC architecture and

00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:10,139
how all that worked and I understood

00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:10,980
some of those words he used but just

00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:12,810
when you thought you were completely

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,990
drowning that the roller coaster ride

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,389
would come up again and he would show

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,870
you the updated LM bench numbers once

00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:25,079
those modifications we made to Linux and

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:28,589
by the end of the talk Linux had won

00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:36,839
against Solaris on every benchmark of LM

00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:39,449
bench okay now it's this is hard to

00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,880
describe see I was talking to John mad

00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:45,449
dog hall recently and he said to me it's

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:48,779
really hard to describe what computing

00:10:45,449 --> 00:10:52,350
was like in the pre UNIX days to people

00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:54,509
who've only ever experienced UNIX and in

00:10:52,350 --> 00:11:00,660
the same way I kind of struggle to tell

00:10:54,509 --> 00:11:06,569
you what this was like too but I walked

00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:09,660
into that room that that morning and I

00:11:06,569 --> 00:11:11,100
didn't think I lived in a world where a

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,990
bunch of hobbyists and students could

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,339
cobble together an operating system then

00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:18,300
another couple of students could port

00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:22,080
onto the hardware

00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:27,000
hi but UNIX bender and beat them at

00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:31,620
anything let alone everything and yet

00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,720
that is the world we lived in and so by

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,450
the time I got home I realized that I

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:41,520
wanted to work with these people this is

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:43,590
what I wanted to do and I had some minor

00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,290
hacks that I'd done to the kernel

00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:51,540
firewall in code so when my contracting

00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:53,520
contract finished in August I found an

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:55,200
engineering student who needed to do six

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,500
weeks of your work experience to

00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,270
complete his degree and basically I paid

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,820
him to hack with me on a system was more

00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:05,930
expressive and IPFW ATM as ever always

00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:08,670
using at the time and this is the

00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:12,570
earliest I changed a lot of messages I

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,850
could find in the source now I don't

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:18,900
remember it taking this long but history

00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:25,470
shows it was May 98 when my code was

00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:27,570
included and the networking maintainer

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:31,260
who applied my patches was none other

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:34,110
than Dave Miller of sparkle Enix fame

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,330
and in fact Dave liked my code so much

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,130
then instead of taking what I'd done

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,050
which is provide a configuration option

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:42,650
to switch whether you want the old IPFW

00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:45,300
ATM code or the new IP chains shininess

00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:48,090
throw away the old code and slap mine

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:52,580
over the top and I woke up one morning

00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,580
and I was Colonel firewall maintainer

00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:00,860
[Applause]

00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:03,430
so mid-year I went back to USENIX again

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,350
and on the noticeboard

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:09,650
one evening i know - napkin it's a music

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:14,560
thing and written of that somebody was

00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:18,230
trying to hire an IP chains expert okay

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,500
so I went talk to them and I said I

00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:23,779
don't work for you but I have this plan

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,510
for a successor to IP chains can be even

00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:29,240
better the problem is I've got a day job

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:35,120
so it's gonna take me 12 months to

00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:36,920
finish but if you give me money I can do

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,250
it full-time and it'll only take six

00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:46,310
months amazingly that worked

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:47,660
I sent invoices they wired money of

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:55,010
course being software it took 12 months

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:57,470
anyway so so that clearly gave me too

00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:00,220
much time because somehow I got the idea

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,330
that having attended two conferences and

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,100
actually spoken at one but this time had

00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,380
gone to limits Congress in Cologne to

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,990
speak about IP chains

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:10,010
we need a Linux conference in

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:12,380
Australasia well actually I was just

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,820
wasn't thinking that big but yes we

00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,610
needed an Australian Linux conference

00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:18,140
and I asked around and Nathan Bailey and

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:21,350
Terry Dawson stepped up to help among a

00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:24,529
swathe of others and then I had to find

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:26,480
attendees so I did the only thing I

00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:29,300
could think of which is in October and

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,990
November I visited plug in Perth plug in

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:34,900
Canberra love in Melbourne humbug in

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:38,450
Brisbane slug in Sydney and of course

00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:41,089
let me say in my hometown to invite

00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,890
people and to find a local person to

00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:46,459
collect the registration forms and money

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:49,940
for that state and the most common

00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:53,720
question I was asked was why would I go

00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:56,510
to a Linux conference you see most

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,860
people were students or hobbyists or

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,110
perhaps they had a day job where they

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,550
got to do some hacking on free software

00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:05,360
as kind of a side thing that was vaguely

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,440
related but I was still a little bit

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,850
stunned at this point that I was being

00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,050
paid full time to work on free software

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:15,199
and it was really quite unusual

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:17,610
and why would I go to a last conference

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,110
have you ever tried to explain to a

00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:22,230
friend or colleague why they'd want to

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:23,759
come to Lance come for you you can I

00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,869
mean you can point at individual I'll

00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,100
look at the speaker it's talking about

00:15:24,869 --> 00:15:27,629
this isn't this would be cool for your

00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,549
stuff but you end up feeling like you're

00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:33,929
describing all the trees and not the

00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:40,319
forest and you kind of come down to

00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:41,939
something like it's cool but is it three

00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:43,170
hundred and eighty dollars cool or two

00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:44,910
hundred and fifteen dollars if you were

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:48,089
a hobbyist or even ninety dollars if you

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:50,189
were a student and so this this was a

00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:53,480
really hard thing to answer Polly since

00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:55,799
the conference in actually exist yet and

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,759
the other thing is a conference needs

00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:01,350
speakers in effect that meant paying for

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,929
travel for five international speakers a

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:07,290
few domestic ones and all their cheap

00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:08,610
crappy student accommodation now you can

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:18,170
probably guess the very first speaker

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:24,480
that I invited well yes technically I

00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:26,160
just assumed I was coming how rude the

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,759
very first speaker invited was Dave

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,879
Miller and I invite also invited John

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,339
Mayer Dog Hall who at this time in in

00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:38,720
Linux history was a fixture at every

00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:41,069
single in its conference in the world

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,649
but it was also the organizer that used

00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:45,929
Linux track at you snakes which kicked

00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:48,029
this whole thing off and so he was there

00:16:45,929 --> 00:16:49,889
to do the keynote Federico came to speak

00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:58,829
about genome and of course raster came

00:16:49,889 --> 00:17:00,869
to talk about enlightenment now it is

00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:02,610
true that I did get a call one day from

00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:04,100
American Express about some unusual

00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,120
activity on my card

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,529
that I'd managed to rack up fourteen

00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,980
thousand dollars and they just wanted to

00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:12,990
check if I actually had the money and I

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,819
actually had to fax them a copy of my

00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:19,020
bank statements and yes just I did have

00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:23,269
a life savings ready to go and I also

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:25,470
created and ran a slash dot ad

00:17:23,269 --> 00:17:32,509
the first and last time I've ever

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:34,769
created an animated gif so that question

00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,570
why would I want to go to a conference I

00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:41,279
obviously answered somewhat okay because

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:43,139
200 people showed up during three rainy

00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,929
days in the middle of winter in

00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:49,289
Melbourne over a weekend to attend the

00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:51,509
conference of Australian Linux users now

00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:54,659
for me of course the whole thing's kind

00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:55,860
of a blur but we had the inevitable

00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:57,799
crisis as one of the international

00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,179
speakers flight was canceled

00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:02,009
unfortunately palma Kerris of powerpc

00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,169
fame although he didn't really like

00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:08,129
speed and I'm eternally grateful that he

00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:10,309
just slotted straight in we we had no

00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:12,659
network there was no Wi-Fi

00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:15,029
but fortunately each day somebody

00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:16,230
printed out the /plot front page and put

00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:20,370
it up on the notice board for ever to

00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:22,200
get their fix so we had that and the

00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:26,990
last session of the last of the third

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,990
day was empty it was reserved and

00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:31,019
towards the end of the Congress we

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,480
didn't have a straw poll and we chose

00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:34,980
the three best talks and we asked those

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,899
speakers to give to deliver them again

00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,600
one because it was really expensive to

00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:41,039
get them there but also because there

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,779
was no video we weren't recording any of

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,610
this and one thing I hated it their

00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:45,809
conferences I'd been to was you'd be in

00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:47,970
the hallway and someone go or did you go

00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:49,440
to that talk it was awesome it was

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,870
fantastic and this happened and then

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,409
there were fireworks and you were like

00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:57,450
see they're going I hate you

00:18:54,409 --> 00:19:01,529
sounds wonderful so in order to avoid

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:03,179
that we did the best offs and I remember

00:19:01,529 --> 00:19:04,710
ducking out during one session for some

00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,929
administrivia reason that I had to go

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:16,019
and as the door closed behind me to the

00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:18,240
hallway there was silence nobody was

00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:20,190
outside the hole everybody was in the

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,820
sessions and that has never happened

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:25,200
before or since to me now there are

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,490
three stories that I do remember from

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,919
that first conference through the blur

00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,779
the first was the tutorial days see

00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,919
usenix had these printed tutorial books

00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:33,059
and you sit down you have you everyone

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,379
have their tutorial books so you could

00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,060
write notes in and everything else and

00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:37,290
we'd use the same model

00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,210
of course we've told the speakers to get

00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:46,110
the tutorial material to us two weeks

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:48,480
before so two days before the conference

00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:52,830
were there ready to make copies of most

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,710
of the tutorial books and every

00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,000
photocopying facility within 100

00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,200
kilometer radius of the University as

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,690
far as I could tell was completely

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,770
booked up because the new term was

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,220
starting and all the lecturers we're

00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:07,070
printing their their notes but we did

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:11,460
however find for coin-operated

00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:13,860
photocopies so I welcome to other

00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,350
speakers Mikey kneeling and Duncan Grove

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,780
to join me in feeding the photo copiers

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:21,210
and making the 400 copies of books that

00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:23,510
we've required which we then ran back

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:27,800
the copies to the Reggio desk Singh and

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:30,830
someone somehow collated them and

00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:33,150
everyone got the tutorial books in time

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:36,390
now tridge andrew tridgell

00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:38,880
drove drove up from Canberra and he

00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:43,800
brought with him this monster machine

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,360
with three three CD burners now in 1999

00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,480
I'm not sure I'd ever seen a CD burner

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,060
before let alone three and these were

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:55,770
used to stamp out the conference

00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:57,120
proceedings CDs and so you sat down with

00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:58,830
xcd roast and you clicked you know

00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,480
burn and krysta thing in and then you

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:02,340
clicked eject and you took out the thing

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,590
and you replaced it and you did that for

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:06,810
about three minutes and then you started

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,460
looking around for somebody else wave

00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:11,310
someone over and said okay just sit here

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,350
press this button and press down and so

00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:16,500
for two days I don't think I saw anyone

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,300
twice in that seat and I think a corner

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:24,540
of the conference probably did the work

00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:27,300
so but my favorite story of the

00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,650
conference was somebody came up to me I

00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,590
think on the first day and said

00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:33,870
something like I can't believe you don't

00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:40,140
have conference t-shirts to which my

00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:41,770
answer would have been I am so tired

00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:47,350
right now

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:48,850
and they went away but they found

00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,740
someone who was a local who had a car

00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,730
and they drove around and bought up all

00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:56,080
the white t-shirts they could find and

00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,820
came back to the University which as it

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,750
turns out had a screen printing service

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:03,160
and so for the next two days the

00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,679
university was preaching the front

00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,030
webpage of the conference out on white

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,620
t-shirts and they were selling them the

00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,950
person sold them to all the attendees at

00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:16,200
cost and you saw one of those actually

00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,200
if you were here for the history talk

00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,940
now many things have changed about the

00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:24,550
conference over the years the speaker's

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,600
dinner is no longer calling up a

00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,790
restaurant and going kind to have a

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,960
table for like 18 can you do that great

00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:35,320
excellent but it is one of the ways the

00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:37,510
conference rewards the speakers for for

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,760
coming and also gives them a compulsory

00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:43,150
night off before the conference proper

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:45,550
begins and at the end of the conference

00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:48,000
it was andrew tridgell who organized a

00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:51,190
gift to me from the speaker's themselves

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,800
which was something that was totally

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:58,840
unexpected and surprisingly touching for

00:22:53,800 --> 00:23:02,410
me and I still have it it is a pewter

00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:05,940
beer mug engraved with rusty Calhoun 99

00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,940
this organizer

00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:16,530
and this tradition has been continued

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,120
every year the speakers put in a token

00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:20,520
amount of money and we get a pot

00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:27,210
together and we buy a gift the organizer

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:30,780
organizers at the middle so the

00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:32,130
immediate lesson that you learn from

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:39,150
completing a conference like this is

00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:41,610
fairly straightforward but I like to

00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,990
think and as you've seen from the

00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:47,030
examples of things that I remember about

00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:49,230
the conference my carefully crafted

00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,990
incoherent and random approach to

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:55,740
conference organization has left others

00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:57,030
with the sure knowledge that not only do

00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,710
they not need my permission they

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:05,790
probably shouldn't wait for it and as a

00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:08,610
result I've spoken on the main program

00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:11,640
of this conference 19 times 20 of

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:17,060
account this one at all but three of the

00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:21,600
layers configure conferences in 2001 I

00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:24,570
submitted three talks for the paper

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,710
committee to choose from and I was

00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:29,340
rather surprised when I accepted all

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:32,670
three quite a lot of work for that one

00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,930
and about a week after the conference

00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,830
schedule came out some not so much to me

00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:39,630
I said if you looked at the conference

00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:43,520
schedule no way they had scheduled all

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,520
three of my talks at the same time

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:51,360
[Applause]

00:24:48,830 --> 00:25:00,690
causing me to merge these into one

00:24:51,360 --> 00:25:03,660
loosely connected mess of a tall and tie

00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:07,160
it together with some now deeply

00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:09,299
inappropriate jokes between them and

00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,980
fortunately there was no recording of

00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:14,250
this it was the first non-technical

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:17,220
presentation I had ever given to give

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:19,620
you context I was standing outside the

00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:26,000
room before it began just gathering my

00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:30,090
thoughts when I hear this raah stay stay

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:34,559
I'm from inside and it all went downhill

00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:37,950
from there I made it through to the end

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,950
to the questions and somebody asked me

00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,900
the question given how many times you've

00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,070
changed the colonel firewall in code and

00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,410
forced everyone to rewrite all the

00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:50,790
utilities have you ever received any

00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:53,760
death threats and people laughed like

00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:58,679
that and then everyone in front of me

00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,030
just exploded with laughter and I didn't

00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,220
know what was happening you see some wit

00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:04,130
up in the corner had taken their laser

00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:07,140
pointer at that point and shove it

00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:19,770
unbeknownst to me my chest

00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:20,940
I have co-presented this conference

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,500
three times and each time has been

00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:28,679
fantastic and wonderful great

00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:30,360
collaborators and in 2007 at the return

00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,190
to Sydney I even did the virtualization

00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,429
boy band thing we had four of us up on

00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:38,100
stage and looking back I realized now

00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:42,360
this was a subconscious desire going

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,100
back to Sydney to at least provide more

00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:50,910
targets for the assassins or perhaps

00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:55,280
some protection now this conference has

00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:57,510
shaped my career and in fact my life

00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,890
it's through this conference that I met

00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:00,840
andrew tridgell

00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:03,360
who is putting together this group of

00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,670
free software hackers in Canberra which

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,970
is why after the conference I moved to

00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:12,960
Canberra to work there and help form Oz

00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:14,549
labs which was and still is the greatest

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:18,900
concentration of Linux kernel hackers in

00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:21,150
one physical location and this

00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:24,530
conference I know has been this font of

00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:26,790
community for so many others as well and

00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:32,309
there is really a kind of indescribable

00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:35,690
magic here that keeps inspiring us here

00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:38,910
I found a tribe of free software hackers

00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:45,600
who have made me certainly a happier

00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:48,450
person and I think a better one because

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,549
seeing this conference flourish has

00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,440
taught me one undeniable truth all great

00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:55,169
projects come down to a person or small

00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,799
group of people who have two vital

00:27:55,169 --> 00:28:05,010
properties firstly they are smart and

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:09,830
capable enough to complete them and just

00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:09,830
as important they are dumb enough to try

00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,290
and because I love seeing these

00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:17,790
ambitious projects happen I found there

00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,230
are really only two appropriate

00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:22,679
responses when somebody comes up to it

00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:24,120
says I had this thing I want to try and

00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,360
as long as the project isn't actively

00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:31,290
harmful I always respond with one of

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,480
these in the first one makes the person

00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:38,190
dumber I mean makes the project seamless

00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:41,250
done ok and the second one makes them

00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:48,059
smarter more likely to achieve the

00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:50,690
project by collaborating tridge had a

00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:54,059
great phrase once when he was looking at

00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:58,140
what should Linux Australia's mission

00:28:54,059 --> 00:29:02,429
statement be to enable the enthusiasms

00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,960
of its members now I know I can never

00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:06,059
demo late Treacher's genius but this

00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:11,490
this attitude is something that I strive

00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:12,570
for enable people's enthusiasm because

00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:15,110
that is the

00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:19,740
that I have learned from this experience

00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:21,240
collaboration is a superpower it lets

00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:25,820
you do things you could never normally

00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:28,200
do that normal individuals just can't do

00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:34,639
but collaboration isn't always easy

00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:34,639
I learned I think far too late that

00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:44,130
getting along with people is a skill

00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:46,019
sympathy empathy understanding setting

00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:48,629
boundaries setting expectations giving

00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:49,860
feedback receiving feedback knowing

00:29:48,629 --> 00:29:51,480
where something's funny and knowing when

00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,480
you've taken it too far still something

00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:58,919
I'm working on these are definitely

00:29:53,480 --> 00:30:00,750
things that you can work on but it turns

00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,330
out it is an invaluable skill to have

00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:08,190
not just with your colleagues but with

00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:11,250
your friends with your family even you

00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:15,690
should have this skill even if you don't

00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:17,850
always choose to use it so when I wanted

00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:21,200
to both maintain the Linux kernel module

00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:23,399
code and work on my shiny new projects I

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,570
saw the collaborator as I've done with

00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:30,179
many projects in the past now a skilled

00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,500
hacker was actually working on some

00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:35,580
neighboring code and involves some

00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:39,539
pretty subtle and interesting module

00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,919
changes so they actually found a fixed a

00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:44,129
bug in my code which definitely got my

00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:47,299
attention so I asked them if they wanted

00:30:44,129 --> 00:30:51,480
to come become module Co maintainer and

00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:54,269
they said no and I hadn't come across

00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,860
this before but they said I've only been

00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:58,049
working on the kernel less than a year

00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,879
and I think I'm too inexperienced well

00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:02,659
well that's okay I never wanted he was

00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:02,659
cut maintainer anyway

00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,469
wait a minute I've heard of something

00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:11,580
like this

00:31:07,469 --> 00:31:13,019
like in Shannon's keynote yesterday now

00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,580
I confess that I'm not really familiar

00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:19,710
with this because my dunning-kruger see

00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:21,269
on the other end of the scale but so I

00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,619
told them they were an idiot and they

00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:25,739
were wrong

00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:29,719
wait delete that grab draft rusty

00:31:25,739 --> 00:31:29,719
getting along with people is a skill

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:37,379
clearly so I told them I'm not gonna

00:31:35,219 --> 00:31:39,299
question your judgment but I will ask

00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:42,450
you again in six months time and I put

00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:45,719
that in my calendar and the second time

00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:47,969
the answer was yes and we Co maintained

00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:49,619
for almost a year by which I mean I

00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:53,700
applied my usual constructive

00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:55,259
absenteeism approach to allow them to

00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:00,659
flourish on their own without my

00:31:55,259 --> 00:32:04,169
interference and when the handover came

00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:06,899
I had to sign their GPG key but I

00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:10,309
wouldn't have met so we use signal and

00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:13,049
with permission I'm going to quote the

00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:14,279
verification process that I used and I

00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:22,889
asked two questions I'm running into

00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:27,809
quite the first one here now this is

00:32:22,889 --> 00:32:31,529
geek goodness right now both both

00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:35,009
answers were superb you give me an

00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:38,460
answer like that and you're the mortal

00:32:35,009 --> 00:32:40,289
maintainer all right I don't care who

00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,519
you are in fact we've never met and I

00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:48,690
have no idea what they look like but

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:51,269
I've signed their GPG key now it turns

00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:53,279
out that there's another headway into

00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:55,919
collaboration which I had never

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,379
perceived so it turns out there are all

00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:02,639
these signposts around aimed at specific

00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:03,389
people come in welcome this is your

00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:05,789
place too

00:33:03,389 --> 00:33:09,389
these are the signs that I see in this

00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:11,009
realm but there are other signs that I

00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:13,589
haven't seen because they're not aimed

00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:17,570
at me you're different

00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:17,570
are you sure you're in the right place

00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:25,030
and I'm just going to pause because this

00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:28,240
slide is almost identical to slides that

00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:29,850
you've seen in previous keynotes which

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,620
is obviously proof of time-travel

00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:37,210
because I wrote this before before they

00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:39,220
did but it could also be that when

00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:40,480
you've got a keynote you feel you want

00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,430
to tell people something that they don't

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,120
appreciate as much as you have now

00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:48,280
realized because it turns out people are

00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,500
really good at perceiving and

00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:54,790
extrapolating these go away vibes when

00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:56,350
they're aimed at them and really bad and

00:33:54,790 --> 00:34:00,130
even perceiving they exist when they're

00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:01,870
not aimed at them I've experienced this

00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:06,730
in a completely different part of my

00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:08,830
life and it almost defeated me but when

00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:11,950
I don't take active effort to send the

00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:15,640
right signals to counter all that subtle

00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:18,940
but continuous headwind inevitably

00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:21,940
people who don't identify like me they

00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,560
don't even reach my front door they

00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:27,120
don't ping me with questions they don't

00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:30,700
ask for help they don't apply for jobs

00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:33,390
they don't get to collaborate no

00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,390
superpowers

00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:41,319
but these skills are rare and I want to

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,339
experience them as much as I can and

00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:45,700
frankly people who are interested in the

00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:48,289
stuff I'm interested in a weird

00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,549
scratch that let they stick with rare

00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:51,079
people who are interested in the things

00:34:49,549 --> 00:34:57,170
I'm interested are rare

00:34:51,079 --> 00:35:00,789
we're rare so if you have the skills and

00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:14,049
the desire to work on projects I'm in I

00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:14,049
want to work with you in summary

00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:20,280
then it's gone for you awesome and has

00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:25,510
been awesome to me

00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:30,130
collaboration is our superpower getting

00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:33,930
along is a skill that you can work on

00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:36,250
and develop I discovered six months ago

00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:38,290
it was that recently though this wasn't

00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,640
there something that happened you could

00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:42,820
work on this and it's a vital skill

00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,790
turns out it matters and if you have

00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:48,070
skills and interest please please join

00:35:45,790 --> 00:36:05,640

hackers working in Adelaide and we have

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,990
a co-working space and I've got my

00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:12,030
employer to kind of subsidize rent for

00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:14,550
an office space in a pretty funky

00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:18,000
co-working space in the CBD so if you

accidentally have time for questions

00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:32,089
because I speak too fast actually

00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:40,319
