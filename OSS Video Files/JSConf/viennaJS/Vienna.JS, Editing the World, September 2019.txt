	Talk By Julian Krispel-Samsel

Ever wondered how to implement editors in the browser? What about repeatable and reversible changes, rich text, syntax highlighting, mixing text with arbitrary content or god forbid - editing recursive data structures as text? Julian has been obsessing over questions like these for a few years now and is ready to share and discuss his findings. Expect demos, code examples, some talk about design, lots of opinions and maybe even a little fun! To get the most out of this talk familiarity with JavaScript and React are required.
