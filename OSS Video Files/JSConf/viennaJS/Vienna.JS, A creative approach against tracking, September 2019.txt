I'm quite annoyed by all of this

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,330
tracking I'm trying to do some you know

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,639
like sometimes I make some fun things

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,730
for example there was this pillar card

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,130
and as a name I wrote Chuck Norris and

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,570
then I was paying for years as Chuck

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:23,420
Norris and then there was two and I was

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,330
actually thinking about this pillar card

00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:29,310
because it forces here to or there's a

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,050
big incentive on using it because some

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:37,890
of the products are like almost half the

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:40,649
price as without to the cart and and I

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,170
was trying a few fun ideas with the

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,480
Billa cart but then it was replaced by

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:49,620
cue card and so I had to throw away

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,899
everything and I tried it again your

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,480
card tries to get you in there bonus

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:59,250
system and you're collecting data from

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,680
many companies and and trying to yeah to

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:07,950
make money out of that later I'm not

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:10,890
really happy by that and the the you you

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,350
tries with data minimalism to force

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,170
people to not collect that many data but

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,439
it doesn't really work so I thinking

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,740
what else can I do I can't prevent that

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,960
the data is collected so the other idea

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:29,189
was what if the data is invalid or

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,770
useless and this is where I came up with

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,960
the dear what if you have a bonus card

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,360
and they buy a banana in graz

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,460
then they buy diapers in Salzburg and on

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,710
the same day Red Bull in Vienna it's

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,280
probably pretty inaccurate and useless

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:48,180
so my idea was you could actually share

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,939
a card with many people and then the

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,369
data is not really use useful anymore

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,259
and it's hard for them to know which

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,040
data is is correct and which is not

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:02,820
correct so it makes it a bit yeah fun

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,759
and that's the idea of new card I'm not

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,819
sure if I can use the name but I like it

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,920
so instead so instead of having your own

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:14,090
gear card you're actually sharing your

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,090
your card with other people

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:20,040
you get randomly assigned your cards on

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:23,909
a per usage basis that's the idea so

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,620
you're kind of having a card lottery on

00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:28,830
a technical level they have a quite

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,290
interesting barcode for a long time I

00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:37,290
didn't find the right barcode reader

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:41,430
because it's a quite modern format which

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:45,870
is this weird name gs1 databar extended

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:52,470
stacked finally you found it and I'm now

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:55,500
able to offline generate images based on

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,799
the on the number you put in I there's a

00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:04,470
JavaScript rider who can generate this

00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:08,579
barcode and then they're offline so you

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:10,379
have an offline ready website which you

00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,629
can just open up if it has inter

00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:14,670
connection it gets you a new random card

00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:17,370
if it has no internet connection takes

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:20,250
the one which is saved on in the browser

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,440
cache and you just show it up and and

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:26,849
you can scan it and the try that it

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:29,910
works that's the ID here yeah so it's

00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:31,530
it's you can load your own cards it's

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:35,220
offline ready and you'll be able to

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:39,209
submit your own cards it's really hard

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,799
to read this barcode from images so

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:43,530
maybe you have to type in the number I'm

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,470
not sure about that one and it's almost

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:49,919
finished I'm launching it in a few days

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:52,799
and I'll add the link to to the

00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,310
newsletter yeah that's the idea of my

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,710
new card

00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,710
