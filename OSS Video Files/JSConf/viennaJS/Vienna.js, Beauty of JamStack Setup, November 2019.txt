Description: 
	Talk By Samuel Snopko

In this introduction talk I will present you the simplicity and beauty of the projects based on JamStack idea. I will show you how fast and easy you can get from point zero to deployment of your project with setup based on the Storyblok (Headless CMS) and NuxtJS framework. Prepare for quick and wild ride.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,500
so I'm going to speak about the gem

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,690
stack and setup of the gem stack and how

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,940
you can get from zero so basically no

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,769
code to do like deployment like in few

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,040
minutes if you know what are you doing

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,320
it

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,630
it's really fast so this first how many

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,970
of you use the gem stack or do something

00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:20,250
with the gem stack okay a few of you so

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,990
maybe I hope I will learn or you will

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,619
find something also interesting for you

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,660
so my name is Sam a snob Co that's my

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,269
Twitter tag if you want to ask me

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,279
something in the future or anytime I'm

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,120
usually answering on the Twitter that's

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,860
me

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,360
there's like freelance hearing usually

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,399
doing in the night in my spare time I'm

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,129
working as a full time here in Vienna

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,590
I'm here like moved into being a three

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,629
months ago and now I'm just running

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,789
through the various meetups conference

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,350
and stuff and doing like advocate for

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,390
the story block which is the sponsor

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,489
today and also like googe's and noxious

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,710
because I'm big fan of the vue.js and

00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:00,270
Star Wars as you can see from my t-shirt

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,579
also so I don't have a lot of slide and

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,610
first of all I have to tell that gem

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,220
stack is means JavaScript API and markup

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,960
and for that there need to be a ste a P

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,830
I so headless is already a thing I

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,990
started to work in the Drupal 8 as I was

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,509
a developer a few years ago and it was

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,250
not very it was not a lot of fun I mean

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,650
like a lot of people was telling me that

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,409
it's really cool and great and I was

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,380
like hey I think we can do better so I

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:30,329
was looking for long long long time for

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,990
something useful and something how we

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:35,490
can create a web easily very fast not

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,950
blocking not spending time of

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:41,100
hard-coding the backend and doing really

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,470
the stuff that customer take like like

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,420
to love to see which is the front end I

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,180
don't mean that fronting is more

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,909
important than the back end but the most

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,409
use cases and the useful stuff is

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,840
happening in the front end and if you

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,670
are speaking with a customer he's asking

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,060
like why is this look like this and then

00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,950
we are spending so much time setting up

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,409
some backup stuffs we could do better

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,299
and we can optimize it so that's why I

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,530
think as I find the headless approach

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:12,270
very useful and what is the headless is

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,630
basically you have asked you can have

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,820
something

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:19,920
like its own service on your server or

00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:21,870
you have a like service cloud and there

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,940
are many solutions already out there and

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:25,950
a few of the solutions I just speak here

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,130
the logos it's a story blog content

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,990
fullmetal if a CMS ghost or through API

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,150
and you can find even more of them like

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,100
on the headless CMS the dork where it's

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,020
like listing and you can filter all the

00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,630
possible solution out there and I'm sure

00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,060
you can find something also for you so

00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,530
this is like how we are going to do to

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,260
data API

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,700
so the first I'm using to I will be

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,590
using a story blog because I'm big fan

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,440
of the store blog and I think it's a

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,170
great tool to use and it's real like

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,540
enhance your work and creating a

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,300
creation of the website or applications

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,190
doesn't matter so the second thing is

00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,800
like front-end you can do it as you

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,670
liked to do so that what does mean is

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,280
like if you if I worked in the old stuff

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:11,790
headless sorry CMS as I don't like to

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,980
call it

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:15,630
CMS's because there was like a whole

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,570
environment they were like saying you

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,610
okay if you are going to right now use

00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,800
the CMS you have to use a piston plating

00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,450
language you will do this this way you

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,370
will do this this way and there was like

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,590
not really a freedom that you couldn't

00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,680
choose even like the basic framers for

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,720
your front end and nowadays you can do

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,240
the front as you like so you choose your

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,730
back-end service which was will be one

00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,710
of the DS and then you will choose one

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,540
of your front-end services our

00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,490
frameworks you would like to cold and

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,590
you prefer if it's a react then you

00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,300
would go for the next J's maybe if it's

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,820
something more static then you can go

00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,430
for group greet some great to be Hugo or

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,380
if you are like the view on the view

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,720
side of the JavaScript framework then

00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,580
you would go for the neck J's and that

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,160
will be also this sample I will be

00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,830
showing you the whole sample in the next

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:10,140
J's so this is basically my stick and

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:12,750
now that was almost digital almost last

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,530
slide we are going to cold and we are

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,890
going to heck

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,109
summer cold and basically from a0 we try

00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,150
to deploy in the next 15 minutes because

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:23,790
I think I should have like something 20

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,710
minutes long talk we try to get to the

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:26,410
point that we deploy something and it

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:31,480
will be

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:34,600
publicly use them or like you could

00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,140
visit it also from our phones so no no

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,320
thanks

00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:41,350
let's jump to the cold so why do we have

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,320
to go do I prepare few notes from my

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:46,000
talk and I'm a markdown file and first

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,360
of all we are going to create the next

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,200
application so we just installed next

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,230
very fast and we just used a yarn create

00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,060
next app which is basically a node

00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,800
package which helps you create the next

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,500
application and it will create the

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,940
application in my current folder so it's

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,710
the if the Internet is working and

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,380
everything works then this will be a

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:12,160
very nice life coding at first project

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:13,600
name we just used the folder name yeah

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,720
this description probably it's

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,810
outstanding project it's I'm the outer I

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,050
prefer yarn package but if you want you

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:26,980
can use an NPM so the UI framework

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,450
already the view just have a big lot of

00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,310
possibilities to choose a frame view a

00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,680
framework and there's already they are

00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:33,970
connected to your next I prefer and

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,220
trying to last times

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:41,440
tell me CSS so let's choose the table in

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:44,110
CSS we are not going to use any server

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,500
framework and I would like to have a XE

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:49,630
us and dot F because I had to do some

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,880
somehow routing and also I have to put

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,610
somewhere all the viral environment

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,940
variables as will be the token for my

00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:00,130
application so okay then there's also

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,830
depresses for excellent pretty lame

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,750
stage files and styling which I will

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,210
skip this time because tomorrow as I was

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,590
preparing for this talk I found out that

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:13,390
if you oh you don't see how long is that

00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:15,340
yeah the second so if you if you choose

00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:17,800
the styling then basically it will block

00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,050
the compiling over your project it took

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,710
me just one hour to yesterday to find

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,150
out this so for now and we really don't

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,060
have a lot of time we will jump this

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:31,090
over so we done into any test framework

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:34,000
which I don't recommend in the future

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,650
use something and then there is like two

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,900
possibilities at first it's a

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,270
server-side rendering so basically it is

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,550
a universal application which you

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:45,190
deploy somewhere on the services like

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,740
now sage our nettle if I it's a pre

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,560
render your website so it's soo or

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,570
Google friendly so all the bots can find

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,420
the application it's not a single page

00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,730
application there is really some there

00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,220
are some files and some HTML pages

00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,510
behind if you visit the link or if you

00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,670
prefer you can go for single page

00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:05,980
application if you creating application

00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:09,070
and good news in the future probably

00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:11,500
next year and with the next three should

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:14,260
come also full static build or

00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:18,250
generation of the code so we are going

00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:20,110
to for universal application and now as

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,540
I am using a BS code as you can see it

00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,900
here I'm going to also take the

00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:28,210
recommended J's config so now we are

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,610
installing all the packages on the left

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,050
side and you surely don't you will not

00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:36,040
see which is green and which is not

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,960
green so what is but what was added but

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,680
basically okay the 9:00 p.m. is running

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,020
next this will be our front end now we

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,970
have to setup our back end so that will

00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,250
be story block so let's create a project

00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:51,670
in story block so I just go to the app

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:54,400
store a block calm and what's happening

00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:58,630
here it's if the Internet is fast enough

00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,550
we will see the admin ok great this is

00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,230
the admin I'm already logged in this man

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,510
these are my projects I don't make a lot

00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:07,030
of photos please and I am just going to

00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:10,090
create a new space where my data for my

00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,220
new website will be living so as this is

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,410
a very fast and quick introduction talk

00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,210
I just going to duplicate a space and

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:21,010
then explain what is happening there so

00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:23,350
let's create a V energy space and I

00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:25,630
already prayed prepare something called

00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:29,020
beauty of the gems tag I duplicate this

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:30,520
space and I get basically space of my

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,920
project of the website or something

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,620
future that you will we will deploy and

00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:37,960
where we will start will all the data be

00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,780
stored so now have a project where it's

00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,910
a home this is the first website so

00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,190
basically our index just called home for

00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:48,550
the customers or the client who will be

00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,800
using this visual editor to edit data if

00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:53,649
I click on it then you can see that

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,629
basically there's a page liquid is

00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:58,089
so there's no template in joint behind

00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:59,649
so we don't see any front-end on the

00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:02,259
right side you can see that I already

00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:04,660
created somebody and play an added one

00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:07,899
component called placeholder so what are

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,029
what is this on the right side you can

00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:12,069
see that here in the component where you

00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:15,189
are creating the basically on atomic

00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:17,439
base or as you choose components which

00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:19,209
can be then reduced in the in your on

00:09:17,439 --> 00:09:20,829
your website you can combine them

00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:23,889
together and then create website as a

00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:27,699
normal CMS's should do not all of them

00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:29,980
do so at first I defined the page home

00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:32,949
where I said there is a body and this

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:35,439
body is basically a list of the

00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:37,899
component and I allowed to edit only the

00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:41,110
placeholder component inside I don't

00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:41,980
require any of the components inside and

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,529
that's it

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,829
then the placeholder in our case is just

00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:52,089
a component which hold a name so this is

00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:54,399
like input field or variable named type

00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:57,220
of the text and the name of and the name

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,679
of the name and in boolean which is if

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:04,149
it's done or not and this is a by

00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:06,550
default false ok so we have now at the

00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:08,679
back end we could create like we could

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,170
edit the home page and we could add a

00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:13,629
new placeholder and we can say that this

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:19,240
one is done so let's say this is like a

00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:21,699
slider component this is just quick demo

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,189
so I will not be creating a real

00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:27,129
component but as you could see we didn't

00:10:24,189 --> 00:10:32,860
see anything so let's go back to the to

00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:35,170
our to our editor the front-end is

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,699
already built and it's installed as you

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:39,339
can see we can start it with the yarn

00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:40,899
def so let's start on Def and on the

00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:46,149
localhost we should see the introduction

00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:49,059
screen off of our front end in the next

00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,499
so it's bundling together and now we see

00:10:49,059 --> 00:10:52,929
the introduction screen from the NAG

00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:56,199
days we can go to documentation or the

00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:58,600
github ok very nice it's working we have

00:10:56,199 --> 00:11:00,249
no errors so what's the next step we

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,839
need to connect the front end with our

00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:03,819
back end because there is no connection

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,220
at this moment so let's add the

00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:07,000
connection this the NPM package called

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:11,860
the yarns

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:16,600
or a story blog next which will also

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:20,350
install and we will it will take a short

00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,570
while it's done and now we have the

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,240
possibility to connect it how to connect

00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,820
it it's like I need to load a story blog

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,590
token from a dot FL because I don't want

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,330
to push it into my github repository or

00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:34,870
what I want to keep it of course

00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:36,670
private so at friend I need to load it

00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,440
also in the neck JS config

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:43,300
like just config is the file that was

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:45,730
created already by the next install so

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,550
now I'm loading the dot and file

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:52,870
basically config which I already have

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:56,080
because I checked that dot M on the

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,600
under by creating so there is but no

00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:01,350
story blog Tolkien so I need to create a

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,770
story block token here let's create this

00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:08,800
story block Tolkien in my dot and file

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:13,810
so okay I need to get a stir block token

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:16,270
and that I'm going to get from my space

00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:21,160
in the story block of course so copy

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:24,460
paste save now I just need to also set

00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:26,770
up the story block nooks connection

00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:30,250
because there is also this is a module

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:34,390
of the next Jess so let's quickly put it

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:36,610
into modules and this is down here where

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:40,080
it's already as you can see there is

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:46,210
already access and dot F sorry for some

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:48,580
super quick coding I don't see now you

00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,530
see so what do they did I just added the

00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:54,640
story block nukes access token and the

00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:59,020
cache providers the memory so now if I

00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:01,540
start mine from the end it should start

00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:03,220
with the introduction screen and there

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:09,430
should be no errors but there is a

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:12,610
connection behind so we are still on ok

00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:15,430
no errors cool very nice and there is

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,850
also a hold result of course ok what

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:19,010
next

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:22,670
so let's back to my notes

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:25,940
so now we already did and we just need

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:29,389
to load our data

00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:32,690
I created also like the cache version

00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:34,610
this is basically that we just do some

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:36,649
caching and we just want to know if what

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,420
the version of the cache we already get

00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:42,290
from the store blog so I just quickly

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:45,050
copy some sheets from the middleware so

00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:47,389
this is my store where it's like

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:51,230
basically I will set in the buicks which

00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:53,630
is a store similarly as an indirect I

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,630
will store this version of the cache I

00:13:53,630 --> 00:14:01,610
just put it into the store and sorry

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:02,600
give me a second copy paste I do not

00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,820
have to do anything

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,370
next already know that in the store are

00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,410
all this Buick stores file so it will be

00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,600
automatically loaded but still I didn't

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,490
use it and I don't feel it so for that

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,440
and just hit had to have something like

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:17,720
called the middleware which is basically

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,040
running before the load of the page or

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:24,019
on the page load and will like this the

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,300
correct a cake action which is in this

00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:28,910
case load cache version so I just K

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:32,720
create like copy the cache version

00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:36,139
loader into my middleware and then I

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:39,339
need to go to the next config and also

00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:43,910
enable the middleware in router

00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:46,399
so next config and I just added here

00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:49,130
after the modules and this will make

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,959
that as I'm routing to the website the

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,870
middleware know that I should call the

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,310
cache version loader and the version

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,639
cage version will be loaded into my

00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:02,420
application in this case in the website

00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:06,230
so this was maybe a little bit

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,940
complicated but it's really nothing you

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,970
will do it once at the beginning and the

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:13,040
on your setup and then it's done so we

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,630
still don't see anything because we

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,550
didn't create any component in our

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:19,670
front-end and we can't didn't create any

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,180
pages so what not what do we need to do

00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,810
now

00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:26,690
it's the load data so in the cheat I

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:29,300
have the file folder which is called

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:31,430
component and here I have a store block

00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,830
page which

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:36,380
is the abstract page which take care of

00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:38,570
that at how I'm going to a synchronous

00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,089
load the data for that I just need to

00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:42,500
get a mode on what version I am going to

00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,480
mall so it's the published version or

00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,460
the draft version there I need to get

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,950
also the cache version this was what I

00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:52,130
exactly done in the few seconds ago and

00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:54,350
then also I need to I need to calculate

00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:56,480
or like build the pad from where I'm

00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:59,959
getting the data so if I'm going to

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,480
wherever my page slash home I want to

00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,700
get also the data from the home in the

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,190
story block so this is what is happening

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:11,720
here and then on the mounted here I just

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:13,700
also create the story broad bridge which

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,459
is basically a connection for the story

00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:19,190
block that that visual editor you saw in

00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:21,649
the story block will be clickable and we

00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,240
can then edit our data live in the story

00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:27,649
blog and see the live preview of all

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:30,320
data edited and there so let's add the

00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:34,850
story blog page into my component in the

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,100
next so I just added here the next as

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,830
you can see here is a page folder which

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,870
is my also Rueter basically and there is

00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,060
the introduction page i already we

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:46,790
already saw like three to two three

00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:53,540
times so now i just override the code

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:57,050
there and by the index from my cheats

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:59,779
and this is doing a nothing else as city

00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:01,670
set up the Edit table so this is make

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:03,830
that it will be clickable you will see

00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:06,050
in a moment and then i'm just getting

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,880
through the body the content of the body

00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,520
in the story block and loading the

00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,679
correct component and as here you can

00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,010
see there is like a story blog page so

00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:20,179
this abstract page and I am extended it

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:22,959
so let's copy this put it into our

00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:26,030
project so I now just save it and

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,000
probably we should get errors and the

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:32,120
first error is that we are loading here

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,910
sorry a placeholder component which I

00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,059
didn't we didn't have any project so at

00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:41,750
first we need also this one which is a

00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:44,230
placeholder project we just expecting a

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,820
done is done variable and if it's

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:48,220
then it will be green and if it's not

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,529
done it will be red and then also like

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:53,139
render a blog name so that what kind of

00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:54,909
the component or something on their

00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:58,330
websites missing this is really like a

00:17:54,909 --> 00:18:00,669
simple component for us now so I just

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:03,070
copy this placeholder and I add it to

00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:04,659
the component also the structure and the

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,659
real project it will look a little bit

00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:10,149
more complicated as this so we have a

00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:12,399
placeholder and I would still have a run

00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:15,279
problem and this is missing the helpers

00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:17,080
and the helpers in my case are those

00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,179
functions which are basically building

00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,490
the path finding out what language is

00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:25,169
open in the moment on what kind of mode

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:29,919
of the data we want so this is also

00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:32,740
plugins in the cheat and here you can

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:36,370
see this is like the gate pad get mode

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:40,000
and load data function so I just copied

00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:44,490
this sorry I copied the file and just

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,320
add it to the plugins so okay and now

00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:50,649
it's compiled there is no problem so

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,720
let's jump to the hole drilled and we

00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:54,789
see the two placeholders so we hit play

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,250
student and slide component and this is

00:18:54,789 --> 00:19:00,159
already connected to the story block and

00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:02,649
load it data from the story block so

00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:04,809
what's next is like if I just jump to

00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:05,620
the content to disturb log and I go to

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:07,899
the home page

00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,840
I still see don't see the light prayer

00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:12,700
so why is this it's very easy that we

00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,059
are expecting something different so I

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,529
copied localhost address because we are

00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:21,070
now working on localhost

00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:22,570
and go to settings file and then here in

00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:25,840
the default location I just that

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:29,019
location and just for the future I

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:33,549
already or also create a previewer for

00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:37,049
for the local and save it and now if I

00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:39,909
go to content and open it then we should

00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:41,769
see also the local house so we see a two

00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:43,419
placeholders and this should be also

00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:46,120
clickable so we right-click on the first

00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:48,519
one I can edit it here and the life you

00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,399
see as it's changing the colors and also

00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:57,330
like we I can say that this will be a

00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:59,039
hero our home and it's not done so I am

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,739
I have it read in the future I know that

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,080
okay I still need to work on this one so

00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:06,779
let's save it make it kind of publish

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,429
and this is the home page

00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:12,899
Oh still five minutes cool thank you and

00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:14,700
this is okay this is only one page how

00:20:12,899 --> 00:20:17,039
to get create like more complicated

00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,619
routing or something like that so if I

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,509
now create a new page which I already

00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:24,239
prepare here in components a general

00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:27,450
page which also have a body is is just

00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:29,340
copy of the home page in this case but

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,749
normally it will be complicated you can

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,940
say that here could be used only

00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:38,730
different components so if I copy it and

00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:42,269
create sorry if I create a new page here

00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:47,009
called new page and I say it's a page

00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:50,009
general I create it then I should get an

00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:53,399
error and I'd add placeholder you I can

00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:55,049
see anything here I don't want to my

00:20:53,399 --> 00:20:57,330
head static as I did the index because

00:20:55,049 --> 00:21:00,029
the index was already are always looking

00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:03,929
for the home but now let's do it like

00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:07,139
dynamically so for the dynamic I just go

00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:09,989
to the page folder into cheat I have the

00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:13,019
pages and I have this underscore view

00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:16,080
file here and the underscore view file

00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:18,960
basically match all the paths you can

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:23,039
imagine so in this case if I copy this

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:26,549
and add it to the pages then I am now

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,769
hitting all the paths on if I make X

00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:31,109
epsilon slash etc etcetera etcetera

00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:34,889
doesn't matter if I would write it here

00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:45,509
in the pages create a folder like test

00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:47,639
folder test slash test /u sorry dot then

00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:49,980
in this then of course this file would

00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,929
not hit the test slash something because

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,779
it the test the test folder is now the

00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:56,399
router predefined part for that and he

00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:59,639
would know that he should go to this

00:21:56,399 --> 00:22:01,799
folder this is not the point of this

00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:04,049
talk is more complicated a little bit

00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:06,929
and here we just have the page general

00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:10,859
so how to load the page and I also have

00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:11,220
the page general basically template or

00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:13,170
view

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,450
file which is loading the placeholder

00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:17,640
also as you can see I'm now loading the

00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:21,770
player in two places you could load it

00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:24,990
globally and you don't see thank you

00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:27,660
so in that case I just copy the page

00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:31,320
general because we need to load it also

00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:36,150
so add it to the component and you don't

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:38,330
see come on we just compiled without a

00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:43,440
problem we have a page general which is

00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:45,900
also like kpop is here is in the basket

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,050
case but you just note that the kpop

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,510
case etc not important and now the new

00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:53,850
page will work and now if I go and

00:22:51,510 --> 00:23:00,420
create a new page which is type of page

00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:04,500
general so any page and I say page

00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:06,720
generic and I do create then I create a

00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,060
placeholder then it's hid then is

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:14,130
already like getting those touched

00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:16,080
template cool so that was very fast I

00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:19,260
still have a few minutes and what I

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,270
wanted to show you is the last thing is

00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:24,390
to deploy it because I promise to deploy

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:26,610
it in the 20 minute so how to deploy it

00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:29,490
if you already heard about now sage or

00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:30,840
nettle if I and which I probably guess

00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:32,190
yes if you worked with James Tech then

00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:35,300
you know that it's super fast and super

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:38,820
easy and what we need to do basically is

00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:42,990
just create a two files so in the cheats

00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:45,030
I have a now ignore so very easily

00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:47,430
there's like ignoring the next node

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:50,730
modules lock etc nothing complicated

00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:51,210
and now just a settings file JSON file

00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,460
sorry

00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:56,130
so here I just saying the name of the

00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:59,400
file so let's call it Vienna JS website

00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:01,470
and down here I just need to set also

00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,540
the token because the token for the

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,270
story block is in this case is don't is

00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:09,030
in the dot and file which is not pushed

00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:12,020
into service in my case now is edge so I

00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:15,840
just say here okay let's be a Vienna and

00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:21,270
there should be a second one so let's be

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:22,950
a Vienna okay cool now I can check if

00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:25,830
Who I am

00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:27,570
because if I write now is now Who I am I

00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,580
will get that it's the contest I'm a

00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:32,789
snob God and the now as edges look

00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,859
globally installed on my computer so

00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:38,009
first of all as you can see here I am

00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:41,340
expecting some story block token so how

00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:46,049
to use the ster block token and this is

00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:50,399
a quick tip I just need to add there a

00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:53,249
secret so I just copy the secret I say

00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:56,100
you will be Vienna and here I just need

00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:59,159
to write my token which I have in dot

00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:04,679
and file so I just need need this drink

00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:07,109
I added here now I hit enter now I'm

00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:09,720
creating a secret on now sage under my

00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:14,609
name so you will have to do it now if I

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:17,249
can check it now secret list and you can

00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:21,090
see all my secrets from the now sage

00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:24,059
okay so clear the terminal there is no

00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,529
you don't see the tokens but you could

00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:29,159
see there was a list and there was also

00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:29,940
that one thing so what now we almost

00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,889
done

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,109
we just need one more trick and that's

00:25:31,889 --> 00:25:35,999
basically that we need to defend also

00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:38,159
angel for for an average because you

00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:41,700
would get a very funny error so I just

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:44,970
hit to package.json and I say that okay

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:49,139
I want to use a now a note about 10

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:51,239
about him and one more word about the

00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:55,590
now and then start the deployment

00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:58,259
because it will take a while so that

00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,789
started and now I just forget to tell

00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:02,970
you one more very important things that

00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:05,369
in a the novice a now Jason setting file

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,559
basically I set up the NACA J's now

00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:09,840
builder and then there is like way to

00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:11,639
set up if you want to go for production

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,249
if you do is that you want to do a

00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:17,210
static build or something else so now

00:26:14,249 --> 00:26:20,100
it's everything is running I can also

00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:22,739
show you one more thing and now in this

00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,779
case we are deploying as a universal

00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:26,879
application so this will be basically

00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:29,090
the same mold as this is the development

00:26:26,879 --> 00:26:32,730
mode and the users will be able to click

00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:34,919
through the in the story blog use this

00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:36,920
link as a preview to play with it if we

00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,440
would go for the life

00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:42,630
life deployment then we would use an axe

00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,930
generate which will build basically a

00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:47,790
static all the website and we can like

00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:49,500
host it on the nightly fire or even

00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:52,050
rehang and holds it on our own server

00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:55,470
where we copy paste the code so cool

00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:59,190
look like we are green and we now on

00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:01,260
this link we should see the website so

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,720
if we have a lag and everything was done

00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:07,740
then there is the website so this is

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:12,030
cool so and still we for the our

00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:14,550
customers or like the editors of the of

00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:16,350
the of the of the system basically they

00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,660
don't want to probably have a whole new

00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:20,910
localhost to test the data so create the

00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:25,890
preview are also for them so have a

00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:28,620
preview and now I just save that now a

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:31,470
sage link there and let's make it also

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,750
default because we are the developers we

00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:37,320
can click to the localhost and now if I

00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:41,160
call to go to content and to home then I

00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,690
should see that the link here it's now

00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,610
getting from the now Sh

00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:46,950
so I can deploy there some status which

00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:49,140
is like safe they can play around they

00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:51,900
can click and change the components and

00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:55,200
say like ok this is another component I

00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,440
can save or I can like copy-paste this

00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,810
stuff I can create more complicated

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:05,330
components and deploy it all the time

00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:05,330
and basically that was it

00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,499
