	Talk by Oleksandr Sabov

Animations in enterprise product UIs are very often considered an optional thing that can be added at the last moment â€“ if at all. Developers often work under various time and business constraints, and may not have the chance to put effort into adding animations to the user interfaces. In this talk, I will discuss how to turn animations into a powerful tool that improves product usability, elevates the user experience, and overall make your products more engaging and accessible. We will go through a few examples, best practices, and I will show you how teams at IBM create meaningful animations using JavaScript.
