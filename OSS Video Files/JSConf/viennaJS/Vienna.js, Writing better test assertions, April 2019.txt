Description: 
	Talk by Thomas Mayrhofer:

TDD is part of my day to day workflow. Quite often my tests cause some maintenance overhead as additional requirements make previous tests break, even though functionality was only added and existing behaviour didn't change. Doing some research made me realise that the way the test assertions were written caused this overhead. In this talk I'll present a way test assertions can be written without the need to fix them on requirement changes.
