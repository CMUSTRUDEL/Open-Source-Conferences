	Talk By Rainer Hahnekamp:

As JavaScript developers we don't have to care how our application "gets" memory and releases it. We are in the luxurious position that the engine does that automatically and shields us from all challenges that can occur. For a professional developer, this is not an excuse to ignore this important topic. In my talk, I will cover the very basics of memory management. We will start with the theory in general, watch JavaScript's memory management in action and learn about patterns that can cause the feared memory leaks. We will finish with an overview of the most important component: Garbage Collectors.
