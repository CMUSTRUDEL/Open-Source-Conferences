	Talk by Robert Kaiser

"VR Maps" is a small demo as a side project by Robert. It puts OpenStreetMap data into WebVR using Mozilla's A-Frame toolkit. The talk will describe and show the code on how that can be done and how to allow navigation through the scene both in the normal browser and with a VR headset on, as well as what additional steps can be done to improve on the existing demo and code. I'm also happy to answer questions on A-Frame, Mozilla's WebVR/AR/XR work as well as OpenStreetMap.
