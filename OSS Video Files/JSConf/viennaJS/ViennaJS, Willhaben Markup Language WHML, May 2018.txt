	Talk by Adri√°n Bolonio

We usually associate changes in the UI with frontend developers, but that's not always true. At willhaben we have developed a new markup language that helped us to decouple the UI from the frontend team, empowering the API devs to have the knowledge as well for the UI, as well as the project managers. In my talk I will show you the code of an app developed with the open source tool kit from SUI (Schibted User Interface) and the new WHML (willhaben markup language), so you can see how we build our user interfaces dynamically from an API.
