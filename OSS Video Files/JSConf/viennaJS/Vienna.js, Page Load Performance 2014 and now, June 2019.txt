	Talk by Roland Schütz: 

I did a technology update on a website, which was developed and super optimized 2014. It was super interesting to see what works similar and what really changed. The result is a high performant modern website, which follows page speed best practises.  Especially for image loading is super interesting. The average mobile website page weight is ~50% images. So we talk about responsive images, lazy loading, progressive loading and other techniques that will improve the usability of your site or app.  After the talk you will definietly know more about how to optimize websites and images (way deeper than just responsive images).
