Basically I am not somebody who prefers to reinvent the wheel. There are already a ton of solutions out there on handling data binding and and validation within forms in ReactJS. But as soon as the new Context API arrived I wanted to experiment with it and see how easy it can be to build connected forms more easily. Also my intention was to decouple things (mainly validation), which resulted in a middleware pattern that can replace validation and add more interesting features.
