Playlist: viennaJS
Description: 
	Talk By Priscila Oliveira and Juan Picado:

Verdaccio is an npm package which allows you to create a local npm registry, without any configuration. Itâ€™s a batteries included project, coming with its own database. It does so by acting as a local caching/proxy server.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,150
things we want to come into over

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,280
presentation today we want to talk about

00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:10,500
probably having working for a long time

00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,400
- ooh today's just a brief introduction

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,369
about the project the plan is the

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,420
following we won't we are going to talk

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:24,480
about no GS packages managers and the

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:28,380
relationship with the registries also we

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,390
are going to plant a question actually

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,210
the NPM registry is covering all our

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:37,020
requirements and we are going to finish

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,390
talking about birth - my name is Juan I

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,010
work out front an engineer in moth box

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,629
here in Vienna I have been working in

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,730
for - over the last three years almost

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:51,480
and I work in rare dice creep no GS by

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:56,039
accident and I am a huge traveler so

00:00:51,480 --> 00:01:04,229
that's something I like a lot so we

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:06,900
still is gonna continue the talk thank

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,909
you for coming first of all I'd like to

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,880
say that today is our first time is

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,840
peeking at some atop at the top so we

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,189
might have make some mistake you but I

00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,480
thank you for your understanding and

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:24,609
your patient my name is Priscilla

00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,609
[Applause]

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,970
so my name is Priscilla during yeah

00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,340
during the day I work at the every

00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:38,560
sports and during the night I work for

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:40,570
production when I'm not coding a life to

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,850
travel and spend some night sometimes

00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,220
with the nature and I'm also on that

00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:49,539
fixed series addictive who isn't

00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:52,210
nowadays before they start talking about

00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:54,909
for that show I'd like to talk about NPM

00:01:52,210 --> 00:02:07,390
registry does anyone knows what our

00:01:54,909 --> 00:02:09,759
histories okay so thank you so ine p.m.

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:13,660
registry is a public collection of

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:15,040
packages of an open source open source

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,610
code for node.js

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,610
it's used by back-end and front-end

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,610
developers

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:33,810
fine and how we can sell the libraries

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,710
that are in the heavy stream I'm sure

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:44,040
most of you have already heard about our

00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:47,240
use NPM yeah I'll show 10 mm is the most

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,340
use at package' to install to install

00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,500
also 10:00 p.m. is the most uses manager

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,650
to install packages there are a number

00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:00,180
of alternatives as yarn created by

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:03,530
Facebook and p-n-p-n p.m. a very nice

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:07,680
open source library created by Johan

00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:09,990
Sultan Kohan so it doesn't matter which

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,540
library you you use it to install your

00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:16,200
packages there they will do the same

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:21,000
thing send request to any p.m. here

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:24,060
stream okay but when you install one

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,660
package II you expected to get only one

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,640
package right the truth is when we sell

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,340
one package you get much more than you

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,290
expected you can try it out you can

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,650
create a project in style for example

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:40,320
web pack and after check the node

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:45,720
modules folder there will be a lot of

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:49,800
packages so if you come from a Java

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:52,530
background here you can see how the Java

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:59,100
Script package manager' any p.m. is

00:03:52,530 --> 00:04:02,580
getting much ahead is getting ahead it

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,480
has more than 90 100k modules and it's

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,650
growing every day people are publishing

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,470
downloading and then be very happy

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:17,760
because I'm a front-end developer I mean

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:20,040
a JavaScript developer curry house has

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,730
shared some nice information from NPM

00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,790
which says that in 97% of your code it's

00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:32,300
not the of the code of your application

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:35,870
it's not your code only 3% is yours so

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,870
what are you doing

00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:43,689
so we completely depend on the NPM

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,060
registry and you should really take it

00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:52,840
seriously should you keep it in mind

00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:55,719
because it might fail and it already

00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:00,520
the it already failed I have here some

00:04:55,719 --> 00:05:04,810
examples last year for example 2018 a

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,520
guy employee of NPM by the way in Pima

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,300
was an open source and but now it's a

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,610
company called

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:15,280
NPM Inc so a guy here by mistake erases

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:17,319
he removed some packages from the

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,740
history and after that people could not

00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:25,210
build their applications anymore so it

00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:28,870
might happens again who knows that's

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:34,599
another another possible scenario any PM

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:38,500
has as a true authentication two-factor

00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:40,330
authentication it has a two factor

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,229
authentication sorry but it's not

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:46,509
enabled by default so when you type in

00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:48,759
pay me polish it's just matter of

00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:51,849
seconds and your library will be

00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:56,469
published and you know once on internet

00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:59,710
always on internet you can try to send

00:05:56,469 --> 00:06:02,560
one email to the NEPA support and they

00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:04,810
will try to help you out and disable

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,259
your package but you know NEPA has a lot

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:13,139
of mirrors and people can download it

00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:13,139
faster so it will be ever forever there

00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:21,879
other scenarios offline feature it was

00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:25,870
introduced introduced it in the NEPA m5

00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:29,979
but that's not so good as we expected I

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:32,979
am going to talk about it it latency and

00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,870
connectivity issues might affect you so

00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:38,610
you need a good internet Forester for

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:41,139
you use NPM install your package

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,649
security and prices out of your control

00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:46,810
if you really care about the security of

00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:48,849
your packages you cannot rely on

00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:50,050
third-party companies to do the security

00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:52,810
for you

00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:57,550
and even if you trust on them this kind

00:06:52,810 --> 00:07:02,289
of who knows what's going to be the

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:06,879
price tomorrow now I'd like to tell you

00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:10,300
a story this is Javier he's working at

00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:13,180
train during his travel difference or it

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,280
will be Austrian the cow there doesn't

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:21,009
let him die to lie to us

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,900
I like house by the way so as a

00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:25,750
contributor he is working a web pack

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:29,199
project and now after plant a project he

00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:31,599
needs to install the packages but he has

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,590
problem the Internet of the trains not

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:38,979
that good

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:41,800
well maybe not much crystal do you have

00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:46,560
an idea of how many dependencies have

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:52,900
here we'll get by Alan way back the

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:59,080
clinic project no ok here we we did some

00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:03,460
research and here is the result so by

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,770
styling web pack for he got 1690

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:12,039
dependencies and inner dependencies and

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:20,560
that's the lot 1080 hundreds to request

00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:26,620
from and came to the head III so back

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:29,139
today of my feature independent able to

00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,659
use it all of them make sense to me

00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:35,250
something inform if we found a package

00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:38,580
for you of course and the cache is local

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:41,310
there are there is no way to share

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:49,500
speaking clients unless you use a proxy

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:52,230
registry young provides the Omani mirror

00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,079
which forces you to check in all powers

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:59,970
each of the four which creates a lot of

00:08:55,079 --> 00:09:02,640
unnecessary twice plus you are unable to

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,100
use some semi commands like any

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:09,570
publishing p.m. info and a bunch of

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:13,200
other CLI commands insulating work areas

00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:16,680
so maybe working at some company where

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,380
they they have a very history history

00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,630
chief policy so all the time you want to

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,940
solve some packages some software

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,279
wherever you need to go to the dev ops

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:32,310
and ask them permission so that's really

00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:39,300
annoying isn't it okay now I'd like you

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:43,470
to take a look at this map if you live

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:49,520
in the blue area you can consider

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:54,870
yourself lucky me yeah we are in Austin

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:58,350
so me and most of the virtual

00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:05,220
contributors have lived in the or still

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:07,800
live in the now it's say that from I

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:11,149
from our own experience day to the

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:15,420
Internet there is not so good as here so

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:18,300
I'm from Brazil from a tropical country

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:21,630
and we you know tropical countries they

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,820
have a lot of tropical raining and when

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:27,209
they start to rain they're sometimes

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,459
internet adjust was was just gone and I

00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:33,410
needed to a to the provider to to fix

00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:33,410
the internet so that's not good

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:44,380
for those who live in China is even

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:47,410
roast because the far wall checks

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:51,130
everything before it goes into China's

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:53,680
Network and many time it also corrupts

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:59,200
the packages by the way for that is

00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:03,400
super popular in China roaming unlimited

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:06,370
data plans network outage I have an

00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:11,230
example who are my colleague he traveled

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:23,200
to to to Russia last year and he paid 60

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:25,720
euros to send one email so so as I said

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,570
before you cannot rely on third party

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:34,600
companies to do the security for you you

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:37,360
cannot believe them 100% if if you are

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,670
worried about to delegate your secrets

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,280
to the search party companies it's a

00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:46,050
sincere concern many companies are not

00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:48,730
allow it for internal policies either

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:53,380
certifications and they need to self

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:55,600
host an internal history but this you is

00:11:53,380 --> 00:12:03,070
to be able to face from the public

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:07,560
registry paid hedges trees are expensive

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:12,390
and we have to sort of module see you

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:15,970
self self hosted some companies provide

00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:18,670
provide self hosted history but license

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:22,290
are quite expensive and not affordable

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:25,180
for small startups we have a

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:28,300
software-as-a-service is the most

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,660
popular module NPM is the most popular

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:33,850
example by the way but

00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:36,880
software-as-a-service it modules comes

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:41,470
with some G's advantages you cannot use

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:48,790
it for commercial purpose purpose and up

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:49,660
and we have a Russian so here is a case

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,290
of study

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:55,870
if I run a business were distributed

00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:58,080
NEPA packages is essential you might

00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:03,940
look into the experience of J's

00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:07,300
it's it's our client so so shitty J's

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,940
open-source project has shared that

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:14,620
experience and the result for them is of

00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:17,020
sixes NPM affords that every user has to

00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:20,490
have paid account if you are wiling to

00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:25,870
distribute through their SAS plataform

00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:28,450
but using a droplet for just $5 per

00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,480
month you can have a history in

00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:35,680
production and save money so that was

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,870
really smart guy now it will leave the

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,410
stage with one he will talk about very

00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,410
large about

00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,950
[Music]

00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:53,290
thanks miss Tila

00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:59,160
so I'll take away if you travel to

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:59,160
Russia switch off their warming so

00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:05,890
having a registry is essential for new

00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:08,620
projects to scale but privileged sources

00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,959
can get expensive for small groups with

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:14,320
startups where - is here to provide you

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,580
an affordable an easy solution to tackle

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,180
all the problems like we see let us

00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:21,160
exposed so what's worth - sure but

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,990
that's just a lie with proxy and private

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,180
registry with an entirely optional

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,459
configuration that allows you to host

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,649
private node.js packages and is

00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:34,930
compatible with all claim package

00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:37,149
managers such NPM yon or PM PM eastern

00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,830
where - is really simple you only need

00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:41,440
to install the package globally and

00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,970
you're set if you're a wide developer

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,190
you want you're willing to try the

00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:48,490
latest features I would recommend to you

00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:52,500
the tag the next stack remember but that

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:55,150
show only works with no GS 6 a minimum

00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,459
also we have found official docker image

00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:00,700
it's pretty straightforward to install

00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:03,850
just ladies more than 3 millions 200

00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,010
poles by now our Eugene bird a show in

00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:07,540
the projects and companies and is the

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,700
most popular way to use birth -

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:14,910
annuities if you want to know more about

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:18,100
docker examples with local examples

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:22,390
examples I would recommend to look into

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:24,640
in our register repository with with our

00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:27,160
examples it's really complete a lot of

00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,160
things right there so where does use a

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,850
CLI you only need to grab the - in the

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,020
terminal at you are running this the

00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:37,480
various tree it's super fast

00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,400
takes like three seconds really simple

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,399
but also we allows you to use a

00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:45,750
different different port or use a

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,640
different location for the config file

00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,940
so what's it worth - in a nutshell then

00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:56,040
that use a live with probably registry

00:15:50,940 --> 00:16:00,639
it has a proxy it cached packages

00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:03,939
the configuration is optional it has

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,249
plugins a lot of them we have a new web

00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:08,019
user interface is integrated in the in

00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:10,509
the project already and the most

00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:12,279
important thing is MPD lessons so if you

00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:13,899
want to use it your company or you want

00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:17,730
to contribute this license is very

00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:20,620
affordable a separate registration

00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,660
provides all the benefits that the NPM

00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,360
registry with a couple of difference of

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,399
benefits I would say first of all you

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,970
keep the full control of the of the

00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:33,550
registry also you can host packages you

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,970
can host private packages even if you're

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:40,420
not a scope for instance web pack you

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:43,990
want to hose your own private package of

00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:46,439
web pack you can over ripe public

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:49,689
packages even if they named collide you

00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:53,259
can force publish things you cannot week

00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:55,959
with the NPM public registry so you can

00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:58,689
control the access of the of the

00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:02,079
packages of access the packages also the

00:16:58,689 --> 00:17:03,759
publish and this is a question I get all

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,520
the time but actually it does not

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,530
publish in the in the end in the public

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:14,520
registry for you everything always is

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:17,260
the local lets see the visualization

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,620
because my pleasure is a proxy how it

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,870
works

00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:24,520
here I'm using p.m. p.m. I'm installing

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:26,890
a package stupid - so the client does a

00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,059
request to the to the registry the

00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:33,390
registry computes the right remote fetch

00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:36,340
information cache the content and

00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:39,070
response the client to have you notice

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,850
something in this flow the clients tools

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:44,230
only works with one rated at a time

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,970
perhaps is not that entirely true

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,559
because you can hook all the registries

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,080
with the associate and a scope feature

00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:52,600
like in this example but these scans

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:59,020
with a huge disadvantage it only works

00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:01,210
with scopes also I believe is really

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,720
hard to maintain as it's insecure as you

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,700
can see is view checking this this is

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,250
the MP mlc file we checking this in

00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:12,250
hip-hop you can really easily leak

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:15,250
and puzzle to the public and this is not

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:17,200
good idea also you cannot use regular

00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:25,539
expression to match packages that that's

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:27,010
you does uplinks public this is the

00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,780
feature that we're - you can hook

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,970
multiple registries take a look this

00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,010
model this this represent a really

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,740
complex model which you need to talk

00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,270
different registries for instance you

00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,860
have a private one into your company

00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,539
already and you want to use birth - you

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,580
also do quantity you need to use the

00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:44,520
public one but that show has the

00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,049
Adventist to root any package name

00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,390
independently whether the scope whether

00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:52,539
it is covered or not to a specific

00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:55,390
registry when package can be fetched for

00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:58,299
multiple registries as a fallback if one

00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,679
fails you can get a second one so for

00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:03,190
that your hand is that distribution very

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:05,440
fair to me for you but not all the

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,220
registries are public may be protected

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:12,010
so birthday she also provides a way to

00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:14,500
set easily HTTP headers for notification

00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,900
as much Heather you need you can grab

00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,419
the token for a note for an environment

00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:23,140
variable or you can define the token

00:19:19,419 --> 00:19:25,539
drag in a config file but this is a

00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,750
cache cache consists in a bunch of

00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:31,299
dependencies organize it by name under

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:34,659
dependency it consists in a metadata

00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:37,330
file and a bunch of turbines which is

00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:40,480
each been a reversion of the other of

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:42,039
the package the cache will cover you

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,500
when the connection with the main

00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:47,320
registry fails and it fails like just

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,820
priscilla proof of there is no

00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:53,110
connection at all because you can just

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:55,570
birth - in real offline mode the storage

00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:57,280
invade I choose file based system but

00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,230
you can use something different if you

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,480
want to scale for instance you can use

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:04,000
the Amazon s3 bucket if you want to

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,770
remember - in the cloud this planet will

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,900
allow you to a scalar that you multiple

00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:12,190
processes delegated the person's the

00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:13,900
persistence into the cloud because cash

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:15,789
is important especially for continuous

00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,730
integration tools because you will avoid

00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:21,610
you will avoid failures do external

00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,930
issues like NPM is down today or

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,990
tomorrow you know

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:29,020
oh the package is not there for some

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,550
reason it doesn't move you will save a

00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,770
lot of bandwidth and reduce external

00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:35,290
traffic this is really handy if you're

00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:38,590
running your SIA in the cloud because

00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:40,600
every megabyte cost money I will totally

00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:43,210
recommend use the data between your

00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,700
build server and your external registry

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:49,540
it will never fails for externalist

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,310
issues you can use splash widow - we

00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,330
have three kinds of plugins the first

00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,640
one is self-certification

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:57,520
for instance bit love is the most

00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,340
popular one LD a dip or a lit up I don't

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,590
know how to say in English and storage

00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,300
for instance you can use the plugin of

00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:08,620
Amazon like I said before of the Google

00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:11,230
cloud also we have middle work because /

00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:13,330
- use Express node.js application you

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,700
can add your endpoints or you can

00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:18,070
intercept peak words if you want for

00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,080
instance we build the NPM out the twine

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:27,070
which provide NPM out the support

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:29,470
through the - to the main registry also

00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,180
we have from the website a list of all

00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,430
the plugins are available not all of em

00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,340
but I would recommend checking github

00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:37,840
because there are a lot of them there

00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:39,880
but you can search your plan if you want

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,780
to build one because it is really simple

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:46,440
we provide types and flow anti-skid to

00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:49,390
make this process smooth as possible and

00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:52,780
also we have a lot of documentation the

00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,640
website is really simple to create we

00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:56,950
have a web user interface because you

00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,700
can search and your search private

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:03,340
packages and browse on them also you can

00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,620
check all the metadata which the package

00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,290
provides regulations out for last

00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:12,280
version that assisted dependencies and

00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:14,470
so on if you use the mono repo I will

00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,930
totally recommend testing your packages

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:20,530
before publish them I cannot go too much

00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:22,450
into details it's a really big big topic

00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:26,530
but a let me - let me tell you on a

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:29,050
story here we have ionic co-founder

00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:31,690
which he was trying to play the build

00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:34,240
scripts in order to don't make mistake

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,640
he switch-hitter net of the wifey

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,080
smart guy but he maybe his manner

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,390
because there is a better way to about

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,530
mistakes using birth data as a marking

00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:47,710
registry exactly like red create red up

00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:50,559
is doing they used birth - ooh - to run

00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:52,390
end-to-end testing every time someone

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,520
does a pull request and suing the

00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:58,059
release process will speed move and

00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:00,340
nobody introduce anything that makes it

00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:04,480
fails when that released will not really

00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:07,299
release take place also there are a lot

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:11,010
of other projects you might look into

00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:13,870
like storybook PMPM module a neutrino

00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:15,730
eclipse its area and even capture he has

00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:19,630
the word experimented using birth data

00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:21,220
using the same approach they all of them

00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:26,260
they use different patterns because

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:28,929
different built other features we can

00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,820
highlight here is no we have an old API

00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:34,090
Ducal bit you can build something on top

00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:37,900
the / - you like Amazon Labs is doing

00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:39,400
with the cloud development kit I you can

00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:41,650
look also on the pride how they do it

00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,690
also we have on the vacation if you want

00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:45,460
to bother your colleagues and with luck

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:49,960
every time someone publishes a package

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:54,610
also you can do it so let's recap / - is

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:56,370
really affordable and easy to use you

00:23:54,610 --> 00:24:01,120
owns the control of the private packages

00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:03,520
only do you can cash cash in the

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,549
packages will keep you safe will never

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,080
get you will never miss a package also

00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:09,840
encourage you to test your packages

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:15,990
because they need to be tested up one

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:22,840
and it has a full offline support

00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:25,720
donations so yes / - you like the darts

00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:29,740
near the lashes up a surprise nobody's

00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:32,470
working 24/7 on this project but we are

00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:40,059
running activities like this one we have

00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:41,320
stickers by the way much of that and we

00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:43,960
believe the open store might be

00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:50,610
sustainable if you allow me to give to

00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:50,610
quote I forgot his name he's my hero

00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:56,739
yes so if you want to don't only predict

00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:58,719
I totally recommend it because it's 97

00:24:56,739 --> 00:25:00,909
