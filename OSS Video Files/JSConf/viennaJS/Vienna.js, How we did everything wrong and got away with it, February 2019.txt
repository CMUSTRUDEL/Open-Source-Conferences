Description: 
	Talk by Marko Jurisic:

This talk describes converting of an enterprise application from a legacy jQuery solution to Angular. The talk will deal with design decisions, upgrade strategies, problems that we encountered and our solutions to them. I will also talk openly about the errors that we made and what would we do differently after three years of experience with using Angular for an enterprise application. We all share similar problems and by sharing and discussing we can avoid some mistakes and produce better products for our clients.
