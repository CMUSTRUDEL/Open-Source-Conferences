	Talk by By David Leitner

Over the years we brought the field of front-end development to an elusive new level and Single-Page-Applications (SPAs) became the de facto standard for crafting modern, reactive, and customer-friendly applications. 

When it comes to the selection of SPA frameworks we have a wide range of options. Full fletched enterprise-ready frameworks like Angular, something in the middle like React or Vue, or tiny newcomers like Svelte. But maybe also the options of just using pure Web Components. Most of these options have their merit, and the maturity to have limited risk by using them in production. 

Although all those frameworks seem to follow very different concepts and approaches, more and more ideas seem to swap over from one to the other. And there is a strong tendency that this trend will even increase in the future. After we have uncovered the current status-quo of commonalities and differentiators we will focus on the driving factors that will make SPA frameworks evolve even more in the same direction in the future.
