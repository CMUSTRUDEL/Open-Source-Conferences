Wonder what's it's like to grow one of the fastest growing open source projects before graduating from high school? 

Since it's release, 30secondsofcode.org was nominated as the 6th fastest growing open source project by GitHub in 2018, gathered over 50,000 stars, made it to Hacktoberfest trending lists, and started series of education projects used by thousands of developers daily. Growing an organisation of this size isn't easy, especially when a newbie is running it. 

Stefan will share some of his most inspiring and challenging moments of running the organisation—and share tips for maintainers and teams starting their own open source projects.
