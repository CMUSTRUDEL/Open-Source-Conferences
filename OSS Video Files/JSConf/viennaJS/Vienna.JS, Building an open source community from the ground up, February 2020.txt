Description: 
	Talk by Stefan Feješ

Wonder what's it's like to grow one of the fastest growing open source projects before graduating from high school? 

Since it's release, 30secondsofcode.org was nominated as the 6th fastest growing open source project by GitHub in 2018, gathered over 50,000 stars, made it to Hacktoberfest trending lists, and started series of education projects used by thousands of developers daily. Growing an organisation of this size isn't easy, especially when a newbie is running it. 

Stefan will share some of his most inspiring and challenging moments of running the organisation—and share tips for maintainers and teams starting their own open source projects.

my name is Stefan and one of the things

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,819
that I remember when I was a kid is

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,799
whenever somebody asks you to introduce

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,080
yourself you would actually say that

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,370
your your name and then your age so if

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,040
you're like five years old you would

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,490
usually say I'm five and a half years

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,890
old

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,240
so I just followed the trend and say

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,949
that I'm a twenty and a half year old

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,220
front-end engineer from Novi Sad Serbia

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,289
I do JavaScript like most of you do and

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,050
the reason why you see this karate

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,720
outfit is dead because I often joke that

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,669
I have a black belt in JavaScript I also

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,250
do a lot of open-source and actually

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,620
starting this year I started co

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,960
organizing the open source Awards on two

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,879
conferences one of them being the J's

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,070
nation that Miro talked about five

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,629
minutes ago and the other one being the

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,910
react summit that is happening this

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,739
April the aim of the program is to

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,690
nominate the best open-source projects

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,030
that are introduced in the last year and

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,309
give them some words and some money in

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,670
order to be even better in the years to

00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:58,859
come

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,690
and starting this summer I'll be joining

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,789
github in San Francisco as a software

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,220
engineer so that is kind of new and

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,130
below that you can find my website where

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,200
I share some tips and tricks and my

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,540
journey of being in a tech scene at such

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,310
a young age so today's talk is not going

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,170
to be about JavaScript I'll be talking

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,759
about open stars and actually building

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,220
an open-source community from the ground

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,700
up so those are some projects that I

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,340
have done in the last two years as you

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,470
can see the first one is called 30

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,860
seconds of code it is my most popular

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,170
project it has over 50,000 stars I think

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,840
right now it has like 55 or something

00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,240
so I'll base this talk about around this

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,979
project and share some tips and tricks

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,229
that work for us in order to grow the

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,549
project to this size so the project that

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,340
I'm going to be talking about today is

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,250
called 30 seconds of code and when

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,540
people on meetups like this one asked me

00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,189
Stefan what is the project about I

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,259
usually tell them it's a curated

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,149
collection useful JavaScript snippets

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,880
that you can understand in 30 seconds or

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,909
less and after that you know most people

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,610
are kind of okay but I cannot imagine in

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,990
your head like what the project is about

00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,310
so the way we see a problem in our

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,310
community is that when a lot of people

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,959
are solving the problems they solve it

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,760
in a similar fashion so they encounter a

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,890
problem then they

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,750
googled error message or the problem

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,760
they need to solve without even thinking

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,349
about it and then the first thing that

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,939
pops up in their browsers is actually

00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:25,909
linked from Stack Overflow or some third

00:02:22,939 --> 00:02:27,110
party website and then they're just like

00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:30,829
copy and paste from Stack Overflow

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,780
hoping it's gonna work and usually it

00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:34,400
doesn't work so somebody invented this

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,519
keyboard for like copy pasting from

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,829
Stack Overflow and it kind of works I

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,930
guess so after you know trying stuff

00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:44,060
until it works and you at the end you

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:46,340
make things work and you're like you

00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,269
solve the job you actually done a pretty

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:50,930
bad thing

00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:53,989
so for beginners websites like Stack

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:57,769
Overflow don't provide with just a

00:02:53,989 --> 00:03:00,019
second they they're not like code

00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:03,049
consistent you know when you copy a code

00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:05,000
from few sources your code base is not

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:08,060
going to look good and most importantly

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,859
the code is not documented properly so

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,569
when you copy something you expect it to

00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:15,620
work and it works you have no idea how

00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:17,900
that is working and it is quite a bad

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,660
experience for other developers when

00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:22,609
they join the code base later on so we

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,949
created this little resource called 30

00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:28,430
seconds of code which is basically our

00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:30,109
collection of more than 400 JavaScript

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:32,959
related problems that are sold in a

00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:34,459
functions like this one so for example I

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,069
know if you can see but right here we

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,290
have a debounce function which is inside

00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:41,810
one card and each card represents one

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,370
problem so the first paragraph is

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,410
actually explaining what the function is

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,169
doing and the second paragraph is

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,389
explaining how the code works and in

00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:52,129
this like it's blue box button the

00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:53,989
projector is a black fund you can

00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:56,959
actually see a nicely formatted code

00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:59,180
which is optimized to work perfectly on

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,340
your project and you can actually copy

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,290
and paste that code and the difference

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,329
between us and other resources is

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,060
actually you can read how certain things

00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:09,979
work so I think that is really cool and

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,010
if that is not enough for you we also

00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:15,470
provide this little example page which

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:18,380
is right below it and we actually show

00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,359
the developers on how they can use the

00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,849
mention function and what is going to be

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:26,659
the author of it so when I say we like

00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:27,050
we manage to make nearly 400 of those

00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:30,530
new

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:33,470
and this was asked the 200 contributors

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,870
together we made 5,000 commits merged

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,960
more than 800 requests and successfully

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,629
opened and sold nearly 200 issues and

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,069
this number might be very big for me it

00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:44,960
might be very small for you if you're

00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:46,220
working in a big company but for github

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,199
we managed to be the sixth

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,020
fastest-growing open source repository

00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,210
of 2018 I don't necessarily know the

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,889
metrics that are used in ranking but we

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,409
were actually the six based on like the

00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:00,050
number of stars and early contributors

00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:03,289
and just the overall traffic in the

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,180
early days and most importantly this

00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:07,610
project is an idea that started a series

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,659
of other educational projects so today

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,380
I'll be talking about like the

00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:14,990
JavaScript project but overall people

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,270
started repositories for the CSS Java

00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,750
C++ C sharp dart and a bunch of other

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,460
languages so I think this is a really

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,169
really cool by the community so the

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,900
question naturally is how it all started

00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:28,129
you know after this introduction and my

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,750
age a lot of people assume that I

00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:31,520
started coding when I was like five

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,800
years old or that my parents come from

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,409
the engineering background but none of

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,729
that is true you know if I ask you like

00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:40,340
what was your dream job and you were a

00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:42,500
kid you know most of the people wanted

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,319
to be like lawyers doctors policemen

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,940
firefighters astronauts you know my

00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,430
sister nowadays she's kind of like want

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,069
to be a YouTube star whatever and when I

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:55,370
was a kid I wanted to be a garbageman so

00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:57,919
this was my kind of spaceship and if you

00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:00,259
ask me now what I wanted to do so I kind

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,240
of thought that it was nice like cruise

00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:04,009
around the city enjoy the view and also

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,250
do something good for the community

00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:10,819
so I guess nowadays I'm not a garbageman

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:13,039
so I chose I guess write that but I was

00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:15,740
into being a garbageman for a long time

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:18,740
and I just liked the fact that I could

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,150
do something for the community and that

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,180
the community is going to appreciate it

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,219
so couple of years forward I'm actually

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,639
doing open source which is not kind of

00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:29,630
the same thing but you get a point and

00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,490
after they had to know my first day

00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,139
since therefore not a great so I wanted

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,149
to be a garbageman first and then I was

00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:37,849
like kinda into Lego bricks so I wanted

00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:39,529
to be a Lego brick designer and back in

00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:40,520
Serbia my parents didn't know like which

00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:42,770
school I should go to

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,810
to become one so when the time came to

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:46,580
to choose the high school I kind of

00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,259
picked randomly and there was one

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,660
experimental class that was teaching

00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:53,509
computer science for the very first year

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,669
so I got there and back then I had no

00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:57,410
idea what computer science is what our

00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:00,199
programmers and developers doing in

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,789
their life so I kind of had to cheat in

00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,500
high school in order to be good at it so

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:05,660
the thing that I'm going to show you now

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,430
is obviously not recommended it's very

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,800
stupid way of cheating in high school

00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:13,099
but the thing is we we were developing

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:15,650
in language called C sharp and it's fun

00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,270
enough but I couldn't see sharp both

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,009
ways like I couldn't write it and I also

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,039
couldn't see sharp because I I wasn't

00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:23,900
wearing glasses into it in high school

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,729
so naturally I had to sit in the first

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,830
row in order to see what teacher was

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:29,569
presenting and I was sitting in the

00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,180
first row and next to me there was a guy

00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:34,580
whose dad was working as a computer

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,319
science professor at local university so

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,819
naturally that guy was like very good at

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,169
algorithms data structures and

00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:41,000
everything that we had in the first year

00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:42,500
of high school so whenever he wrote a

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,690
piece of code that looked like this I

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,639
would just like copy and paste his code

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,280
and do like a global find and replace

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,889
ting and it worked for our first few

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,710
tests and I was like very proud of it I

00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:56,599
never like copied everything so I don't

00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,870
get the same grade as he does instead I

00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:02,090
copy like 90% of his code and it usually

00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:07,430
worked until the mid semester came and

00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:09,889
we had one task with a race so basically

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:11,419
we had like swept two elements in array

00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,889
and in order to do so he had to

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:15,680
introduce like the third variable which

00:08:12,889 --> 00:08:17,389
was called temporary and because his

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,210
English was not so good he didn't short

00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:22,909
hand it to the TMP name instead he was

00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,409
something like TRT and I again copy

00:08:22,909 --> 00:08:26,090
pasted the whole code changed all the

00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:28,430
variable names but forgot to change the

00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:30,949
GRT line because I didn't know that was

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,529
meant to be a variable name and this is

00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:35,089
where the teacher actually caught me so

00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:37,690
did not ever try this and you can

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:42,260
actually see how stupid I am still but

00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:45,589
it worked so after that I was kind of a

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,360
bit sad because I was not doing so well

00:08:45,589 --> 00:08:48,980
in school and I kind of wanted to have a

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,190
good career so I started pursuing

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,870
internships and one of the things that

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:56,270
everybody looked for was a nice

00:08:53,870 --> 00:09:00,080
and everybody recommended having github

00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:02,420
as as a link on your resume so I started

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,100
building my github account and I went in

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,260
reddit and saw this project which was

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,040
called 30 seconds of code so basically

00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:12,380
one guy shared his project initial

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,500
version and I saw it I immediately

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,060
jumped to to work on it as you can see

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,830
my first commit was adding a reverse

00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,020
string function to that repository

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,640
culture his second sub code the

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,029
everything like felt really really

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,279
awesome I really liked it and you know

00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:29,630
thanks to this guy that was the day when

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,510
I actually said you know I want to

00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,339
contribute to open source and I want to

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,920
be part of this project so just little

00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:38,420
backstory on how the project started so

00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,100
this isn't jealous who is a developer

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,770
from Greece and he was actually

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,990
finishing his master thesis and he also

00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:47,600
wanted to like get a job and the way he

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,480
prepared for it is that he used websites

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,220
like hack rank and lead code and one

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,900
thing that he noticed is that a lot of

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,180
the problems share the same like kind of

00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,550
structure and they reused the same from

00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,690
functions so instead of like searching

00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,390
for those functions in Stack Overflow

00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:05,300
all the time he kind of started writing

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:08,600
them to a text file on his computer and

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,279
later on he shared it on reddit and the

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,930
takeaway from here is to let every idea

00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,540
no matter how crazy show its true

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,670
potential I mean the project started as

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,800
a one text file containing about 20

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,959
functions to being one of the best

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,270
learning resources and github which most

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,580
stars and most traffic to this date so

00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:27,380
some tips on fighting the idea you can

00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,820
for example open source existing

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,070
personal projects if you recently

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,690
graduate from University start from

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,670
there modify them a bit and release

00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,709
something into open source if you're

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,200
also a company you can open source a

00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:41,750
part of the product that you're building

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,520
it's not smart to open source everything

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,130
because you're getting fired in the same

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,810
day but if you just open source a part

00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,370
of it you know you're gonna attract a

00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,260
lot of developers you're gonna be seen

00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,450
as a good and open source friendly

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:55,610
company and also your hiring process is

00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:57,200
gonna be much more easier because you

00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:58,790
can just like hire the people who are

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,520
already contributing to your open source

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:04,790
project and of course you can start

00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,920
something new so for us the next few

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,730
weeks were chaos so that reddit boss

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,949
post

00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,559
got us like funny stars or something and

00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:14,869
there was me Angelus and Fiore

00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:19,040
contributors and for some reason one

00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:22,129
night the project went from 22 2008 is

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,549
you can actually not see the gif because

00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:27,259
it's lit but overall there were like

00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:29,600
hundreds of pull requests to review a

00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:31,879
bunch of issue there was so many people

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,709
that wanted to contribute but we as the

00:11:31,879 --> 00:11:34,999
maintainer didn't know what is the

00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:38,869
feature of the project not look like

00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:40,399
because nothing was planned and you know

00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:42,709
naturally this was overwhelming for

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,809
Justin jealous so he invited us to be a

00:11:42,709 --> 00:11:46,910
small team of developers working on this

00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:48,439
learning resource and take away from

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,799
here is that open source is a team

00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:50,809
effort

00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,850
you kind of need people to support you

00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:54,439
if you if you want to do big so for

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,839
example these days I'm like finishing

00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:58,519
two years of university in a single

00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,399
semester moving to San Francisco in

00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,470
summer and hosting a bunch of events in

00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,480
Amsterdam so I kind of need people to

00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,299
help me to build this thing and this is

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:11,089
the reason why you need people to just

00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:12,559
support you on your journey so tips on

00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:15,350
finding a team it's okay to start alone

00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,749
Angelus did so and it worked fine for us

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,549
you can form a team later on you can

00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:21,559
also talk to friends and colleagues or

00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:23,660
people from this meetup because the next

00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:25,639
big react idea might be happening in

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,559
this room and if you like somebody

00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:29,329
else's idea just feel free to join them

00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:31,220
because you know if you put effort

00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:34,160
together it will lead to some great

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,739
things and naturally I gave this talk at

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,359
github universe in November last year so

00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:40,669
I kind of made this repository called

00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:42,529
github universe talk where I invited all

00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:44,589
the contributors from the early days to

00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:47,149
share their opinions on the

00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:49,759
organizations and things that helped us

00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:51,169
grow in the early days so from now to

00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,259
the end of the talk most of the stuff

00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:55,999
that you're gonna see is based on the

00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:59,539
community opinion and it's not like my

00:12:55,999 --> 00:13:01,309
own talk and you know takeaway here is

00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:04,089
having great people around you is

00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:08,359
essential this is our dimension this so

00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:10,279
jokingly during early days I said when

00:13:08,359 --> 00:13:12,410
we reach like 50,000 could have stars

00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,809
I'm gonna buy a plane ticket and fly to

00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:16,879
Greece to meet the original trailer of

00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:18,470
the project and we both knew that it

00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,749
would kind of never happened because you

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,170
know back then we had like 2,000 stars

00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:23,570
and

00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,459
50 was like an amazing number but

00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:29,660
eventually when I was in San Francisco

00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:31,850
we passed 50,000 mark and I got myself a

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,639
ticket to Greece I met Angelus and

00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:36,980
rented a huge Airbnb where we had like

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,320
12 our hackathon and during the

00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:42,380
hackathon we wanted to improve the

00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,690
online presence of our organization so

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:48,110
we built Twitter but basically the bot

00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,399
is sharing JavaScript functions in every

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,769
eight hours which are like well

00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,800
explained and in the last month it

00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:56,899
helped us gain about 650 something

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,459
followers so if you're wondering how we

00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:01,880
built one we basically use the github

00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:03,740
actions and the github actions fired one

00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,959
script every eight hours and that script

00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,540
basically launched the puppeteer found a

00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:10,459
random page on our website

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,170
took the picture off it added a

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:15,290
background image from unsplash and then

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,120
published it via no Jess Twitter API so

00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,519
this was like kind of added after the

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,459
conference and one of the things that

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,110
our team member named atomic said he

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:26,300
said like the team was very helpful and

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,220
encouraging which made atmosphere of the

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:30,589
repo very welcoming and I felt to be

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:33,260
great to part and I felt great to be

00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:35,269
part of it so there was one part of the

00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,860
sentence that I really liked and it is

00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:38,240
this one you know I think this is what

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,070
open-source should be like you know

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,519
everybody should feel great to be part

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:44,269
of it and there is no secret to this

00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,279
basically you need to build an amazing

00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:49,490
developer experience around the project

00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:51,470
and as I said it's not a secret and I'm

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:54,230
gonna share with you all the stuff that

00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:56,149
helped us so this is our kind of

00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,579
developer experience checklist I'm gonna

00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:00,470
be covering each one of those steps so

00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:03,350
starting with code quality I think

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,180
having a really high quality codebase is

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,010
really important because the reason why

00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,199
people get to open-source is actually to

00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,640
learn something new and if the code base

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,170
is not really good they're not gonna

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,360
enjoy their time and they'll just find

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,089
another project to contribute to so a

00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,199
few tips that you can use in order to

00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:19,880
boost the quality of your code base

00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:22,519
especially in the open source world is

00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,860
to stick to a coding style guide and be

00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,060
consistent so you don't have to invent

00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,980
something on your own there are a bunch

00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:31,040
of like coding style guides that you can

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:33,520
just start accepting and using for one

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,990
of them being the Airbnb style guide

00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,390
and you should also like organize

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,250
everything and remove clutter this was

00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:40,720
especially necessary for us because in

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,580
the early days we had a bunch of code

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,710
that was not used and everybody was

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,750
confused like what is the code doing so

00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:49,120
just try to minimize everything and make

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,710
it as easy as possible for somebody who

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,860
is new to the code base to understand it

00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:55,630
and last but not least you can use stuff

00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,730
like colanders and formatter some good

00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:59,260
hooks so for those of you who are new to

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,850
the industry it hooks are basically

00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,280
hooks that are attached to certain git

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,840
commands so when you run git commit you

00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,600
can actually attach a hook to be run

00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:09,790
before or after the commit so maybe you

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,190
can use git linters in the pre commit

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,620
hooks and those curl interns can tell

00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:17,350
you actually whether the code is nicely

00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,360
formatted for you or not and whether it

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,570
follows the coding standard and you can

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,190
also use for matters on hooks that are

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,350
triggered after you're committed and

00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,360
those four matters can actually replace

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,240
tabs and spaces depending on what your

00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,770
project is using so I'm not an expert in

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,510
this topic so I'm quickly gonna like

00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,700
skip over it and the next one is

00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,680
probably the one that is the most boring

00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,930
for everybody so I'm not gonna like

00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,850
stick to the traditional advice I'll be

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:44,440
talking a bit on the one unique side

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,080
that I found really interesting while I

00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,050
was developing this presentation so the

00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:52,390
guide to a quality documentation relies

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,400
in writing actually good commits and

00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,260
there is one approach that I found

00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,510
really useful so this is how we actually

00:16:56,260 --> 00:17:00,610
write code I mean we spend like eight

00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,890
hours writing code and then 30 seconds

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,330
in writing the the commit message and

00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:06,459
the commit message usually ends up

00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:09,400
looking something like this and this is

00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,780
a good idea to do because you know half

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,640
an hour later somebody's gonna review

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,709
your pull request and they have they'll

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,870
have no idea what was commit supposed to

00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:19,180
do so there is this structure that I

00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,530
found really really interesting it's

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,540
called telling stories through your

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:24,700
commits and basically the idea is that

00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,560
you should form your commits like the

00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,840
following so if the commit is like very

00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,340
atomic and very small one it should be

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,170
put in one line and that line is

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,660
recommended to be like less than 50

00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:38,590
characters because 50 characters can fit

00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:40,240
on most you eyes meant for git

00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:43,600
versioning so for example it can fit

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,370
inside the github UI and if the

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,809
Committee is a bit longer and

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,059
a few more files you should definitely

00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:50,590
include some longer description of what

00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:53,200
a change does you know if the title

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:55,150
isn't enough also you should explain you

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,830
know why the changing is being made so

00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,630
one thing that I hate is when I have a

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,000
file with like 50 lines and then there

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,290
comes a guy who adds 100 more lines and

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,450
I have no idea why he done it

00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,520
it's probably like a new feature but I I

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,010
kind of want to know why he done so so

00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,530
the good thing is to actually explain

00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,990
why we're making this change and perhaps

00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:15,940
at a discussion of context or

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,980
alternatives that were considered so

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,929
just imagine that you spent like so much

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,030
time developing something and you put so

00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:24,850
much like research into it you made a

00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:27,790
change the guy next that is developing

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:30,490
your project project next is not gonna

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:32,559
know all this like discussion and what

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,410
was the project project about so you

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,630
should kind of tell him what was the

00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:39,510
context and things that you considered

00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,920
before in writing the end solution and

00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:44,230
doing so you can actually like search

00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,200
the whole base via this command you know

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,210
you can find some errors or some unique

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,730
keywords that are very specific for your

00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,650
project and you can actually have the

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:55,179
whole codebase be documented and one

00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,100
nice thing is that if you're using the

00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:59,740
device code there is an awesome

00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:04,090
extension called get lens so get lines

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:07,870
will basically visualize each commit

00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:09,640
yeah you can actually not see it here

00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,500
but when you hover over a certain line

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,850
and have your cursor there it is going

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,730
to show you the commit message that is

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,590
associated with that specific line so

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,660
you know having this you can navigate a

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,980
code base and whenever you're feeling

00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,809
like you don't know what is happening

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,490
you can just open that commit message

00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:28,110
and see what what the change is about

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:30,400
and you can actually move much faster so

00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,260
this is not something that I invented as

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,210
I said is what post really explains

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,610
everything in details so if you like it

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,320
I will share it afterwards or you can

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,179
take a picture right now it's basically

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,100
like a 15 minute talk about this

00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,559
methodology and I found it really really

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,320
useful so next on our list is

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,550
simplifying the onboarding experience

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,410
you know for a lot of people the first

00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:53,230
point they see our project is actually

00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,880
the readme file so the idea here is to

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,130
make your readme file as appealing as

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,659
possible because this is the first thing

00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:00,399
that somebody sees and it has

00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:03,509
be perfect if you want people to start

00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:05,259
contributing to a project so few tips to

00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:06,879
network fine for us

00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:09,190
are actually having like a name and a

00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:11,619
catchy description you should try to

00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,679
explain your product or your library or

00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:17,619
whatever in one sentence so you can kind

00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:18,789
of fit into the UI and people can

00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:21,009
actually understand what is happening

00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:21,429
without having to spend so much time on

00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:23,259
it

00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:26,200
you should also have like fancy graphics

00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:28,090
and those readme badges the readme

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,759
badges signify trust between me and you

00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:32,859
even though we maybe say that all the

00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:34,779
tests are passing some might not but it

00:20:32,859 --> 00:20:38,049
says the project is in a good shape and

00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:41,320
you should have also liked the as a set

00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:44,109
of fancy graphics we basically took for

00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,519
our logo we took a free icon just added

00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:47,409
the J s on top of it and it already

00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,389
looked much better than most of the

00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:51,580
projects you should also include a Quick

00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:52,960
Start Guide so if the description was

00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,029
enough for somebody to convince them

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,799
that they want to use your project you

00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:59,919
should include a QuickStart guide to

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,299
help them run the project so maybe it

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,059
should introduce like some how to

00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:05,799
install the library how to use it and

00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:07,629
some small piece of code that can

00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:10,570
actually show them the small demo of

00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:12,519
what your project is doing next if they

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,619
really like the start guide you should

00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:16,720
link to Doc's and you should write Doc's

00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:19,359
even though you have perfect commit

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,489
messages after that you should also

00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,729
include a contributing guidelines so the

00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:26,919
person you know likes your project they

00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:28,269
use the QuickStart guide they used the

00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,769
docs they kind of want to start

00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:31,179
contributing you should have a place for

00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:33,369
them that is going to explain everything

00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:35,470
and I'm gonna talk about this in a

00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:37,989
second and last but not least you should

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,999
have a code of conduct and a license for

00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:42,460
a long time we neglected this but then

00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:44,739
few months before the you have universe

00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,950
took place there was a guy from India

00:21:44,739 --> 00:21:51,519
who took all of our snippets and made

00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:53,739
like 20 medium posts he made em premium

00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,289
and because medium has much better SEO

00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:58,599
he actually started to rank in front of

00:21:56,289 --> 00:22:00,369
us and to earn a lot of money because

00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:03,220
the posts are getting we're getting a

00:22:00,369 --> 00:22:06,609
lot of traffic so definitely be sure to

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:08,349
to check the license and the code of

00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:09,700
conduct that you're using so back to

00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:11,559
contributing guidelines you know you

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,590
should write them for people who want to

00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:15,789
work on your project so things it's I

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,529
found really useful in contributing

00:22:15,789 --> 00:22:19,749
guidelines our answers to the following

00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:21,730
three questions so you should definitely

00:22:19,749 --> 00:22:23,769
answer know what the projects need help

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,480
with if I'm somebody who is contributing

00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:27,549
to your project I definitely want to

00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,519
know you know but our areas that I can

00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:32,409
contribute to and next then I ask you

00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:33,940
know how do I start contributing like

00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:36,580
what commands do I run in order to set

00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:38,919
up the development server or how do I

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,809
like get up and running and last but not

00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:43,779
least when I'm stuck I kind of want to

00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:45,879
know who should I ask for help so you

00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:48,519
should maybe like I mean personally I

00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:51,220
offer like one-to-one mentorships and

00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:53,799
even like place my email there for

00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,999
people who who want to ask me if they're

00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:56,919
struggling with contributing to the

00:22:54,999 --> 00:23:00,879
project so maybe this is something that

00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:03,009
you you want to consider and you know

00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:05,559
you should name that file contributing

00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:08,559
that m.d because tools like github are

00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:10,869
automatically gonna showcase it on the

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,480
website in a few places so for example

00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:15,399
when somebody is opening a pull request

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,830
they're gonna be prompted with this like

00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:19,539
small pop-up which is you know saying

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:21,429
like be sure to review the contributing

00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:24,789
guidelines in code of conduct and you

00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:26,710
know when people do that it's gonna be

00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:28,059
much more or less stressful for you

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,350
because people are gonna follow the

00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:31,299
guidelines and they're not gonna make

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,899
stupid mistakes that you have to fix by

00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:37,840
yourself in the in the code review while

00:23:34,899 --> 00:23:39,580
merging the pull request and one thing

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,789
that I really love to do is explaining

00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,350
everything to a five-year-old so the

00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:46,330
thing that I've done in our project is

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,940
basically draw this little diagram which

00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,070
shows how you should contribute to our

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,070
project you'd include several steps that

00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,299
you should follow and after that is done

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,220
you will kind of have a perfect pull

00:23:55,299 --> 00:24:00,429
request and following this approach you

00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:03,970
know we saw a lot more green merge pull

00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:05,799
request buttons then then other projects

00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,779
because people actually follow them and

00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:10,029
the code that they wrote and submitted

00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:12,460
was much better than before we had I was

00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:15,389
contributing guidelines and you know

00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:18,070
that was enough to to make the

00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:19,809
onboarding experience better and next in

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,940
our list we have welcoming first-time

00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:23,169
contributors so first-time contributors

00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,480
are basically people who are

00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:28,179
experiencing the open source for

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,640
first time and usually you know they

00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:32,530
come true github because you can have

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,940
these like a perfect place for this they

00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,770
kind of say they have like forty

00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,210
millions users which I'm not sure if

00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:39,700
it's true based on the numbers of

00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,140
developers we have but I think it's the

00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,890
right place to start building your

00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,799
community

00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:48,040
so most people found find about github

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:50,169
like as I did by searching for a job and

00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,540
you know it said that I should have like

00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:54,250
portfolio on it a lot of people find

00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,120
about github true events like

00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,429
Oktoberfest

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,380
so Hector burst is like even happening

00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:01,630
every October which promotes open source

00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,549
and I know a lot of people who got into

00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:04,780
open source because they they got a free

00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:08,080
shirt from Oktoberfest

00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,520
so your job there is kind of to not make

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,559
them say this sentence you know I had a

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,419
lot of people who commit like four pull

00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:15,040
requests and end up one shirt and they

00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:18,340
were like if I make additional four do I

00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:21,340
get two free shirts so your job is to to

00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:23,380
make the open-source experience Pleasant

00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,030
for them so they actually want to stick

00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,240
after the heck Tober fest and other

00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:29,350
events like this one so you know

00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,299
contributing to open source is tough on

00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,460
itself like first of all you need to

00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:35,410
find motivation to this so which on its

00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,720
own is pretty pretty hard thing to do

00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:40,299
afterwards you need to figure out ways

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,280
in which you can contribute and a good

00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:44,559
thing to do is to mark some basic issues

00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,679
as good first issue so people who are

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:50,950
new to the open-source can actually open

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,140
them and start from there and good first

00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,820
issues are also like showcase and

00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:57,790
several websites that are promoting open

00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:00,580
source so it is definitely a good route

00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:02,559
for your open source projects next you

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:04,929
have like for the repository which is a

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,400
very strange for a lot of like

00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:08,559
first-time contributors you know when I

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,270
start an open source like I didn't know

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:12,460
what the term fork means so I just like

00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:14,650
for the repository then I had to make

00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,410
changes which is very tough on its own

00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:19,410
when you're inexperienced developer and

00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:21,790
then I had to open a pull request and

00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:23,500
then there is like this code that it

00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:25,059
takes just a bit of negativity to remove

00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,730
the whole motivation and the whole thing

00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:29,830
that we talked in the previous slide so

00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:32,919
the comment section area is where you

00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:35,169
should shine you should basically you

00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:35,890
know congressional starting to

00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:38,119
contribute

00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:39,829
you should also leave some

00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,629
good feedback on the coda already broach

00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:44,539
and not focus just in the bad things

00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:46,609
don't function well so the idea here is

00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:49,399
to be actually very nice to everybody a

00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:51,049
few days before the conference I had one

00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:53,179
girl from India she wanted to start

00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:55,639
contributing to our project and she was

00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:56,569
very interested in accessibility so she

00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:58,549
kind of wanted to introduce

00:26:56,569 --> 00:27:01,429
accessibility section to our projects

00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:03,199
and you know I guided her through one

00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:05,689
full request and she was very happy

00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:07,129
afterwards we merged it and in the

00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:08,959
following weeks to come she basically

00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:11,329
kept adding more and more content to our

00:27:08,959 --> 00:27:12,769
website and she really enjoyed a whole

00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:15,919
experience of being an open source

00:27:12,769 --> 00:27:17,599
contributor so when communicating on a

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,369
project you know don't just use

00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:21,619
complicated language for people who

00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:23,749
didn't grow up speaking English a lot of

00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:26,809
us don't use English as a main language

00:27:23,749 --> 00:27:28,879
and it is very hard even for me when I

00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:31,849
go to a pull request and you know people

00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:33,589
kept using some like very very strange

00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:35,269
and complicated words that make them

00:27:33,589 --> 00:27:36,499
look more professional so you know just

00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:38,839
stick to basic English if you can

00:27:36,499 --> 00:27:41,649
explain something and it's gonna be a

00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:44,839
much better experience for for everybody

00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:46,669
so the idea here is to treat everybody

00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:49,279
like guests you know make them feel like

00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:52,489
they're home everybody should have a

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,709
good time in open source and now we have

00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:56,779
like completed developer experience

00:27:54,709 --> 00:27:58,819
checklist and just by following these

00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:00,949
steps we managed to be the first learn

00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:03,619
to code repository featured by github on

00:28:00,949 --> 00:28:05,989
their website for over two years now

00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:08,059
we also managed to release this project

00:28:05,989 --> 00:28:12,289
called 30 seconds of code which is like

00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:14,329
a nice collection of CSS snippets that

00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:16,309
you can use to make like pencil odors

00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:18,769
some animations in a bunch of CSS

00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:20,329
related stuff we also released this

00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:24,979
project called 30 seconds of interviews

00:28:20,329 --> 00:28:27,259
which was basically meant to make people

00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:30,769
prepare for the interview we have over

00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:32,959
150 questions with like nice answers so

00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:34,939
you can actually learn how to prepare

00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:36,559
for the interview this is not and

00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:38,899
resources but it should be enough to

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:41,239
guide you to to actually get your next

00:28:38,899 --> 00:28:43,369
job and there is also one funny story

00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:46,099
one guy released this website called 30

00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:47,559
seconds of knowledge it's basically it's

00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:50,539
not a website it's Chrome and Firefox

00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,149
extension which is going to display a

00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:53,519
random

00:28:51,149 --> 00:28:55,169
whenever you open a new tab so when he

00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:56,879
released it we were pretty upset because

00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:58,649
I saw it in product hunt it was the

00:28:56,879 --> 00:29:00,479
training project of the day he was

00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:02,460
receiving like a lot of donations and

00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:04,830
there was a lot of traffic and he didn't

00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,769
even mention that he used like our our

00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:09,809
code base as a resources for for this

00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:11,639
and then I kind of researched who that

00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:14,549
guy is and it turned out the guy lives

00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:18,269
like 50 kilometers near me so I was kind

00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:20,629
of okay with that and we we actually we

00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:23,369
actually were some time had this project

00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:25,529
in our own organization and he decided

00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:27,509
to step out and continue developing it

00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:29,429
on his own but overall it's a pretty

00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:32,179
nice resource if you want to kind of

00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:35,219
learn something new on every new tab and

00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:37,559
you know you saw like our success in the

00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:40,259
numbers we achieved and the idea is not

00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:42,899
to be anxious about numbers you know the

00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:45,059
numbers of stars issues commits

00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:46,080
contributors don't really matter you

00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,669
know because there is always going to be

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,279
like one subway station that is better

00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:53,519
programmer than you are so you know it

00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:55,080
just doesn't make sense to chase the the

00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,289
green squares and everything I mean when

00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,839
I was starting out I kind of like did

00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:02,879
every change in code I committed so if

00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:05,129
it's as if it was just like a one-line

00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:07,999
change I would commit that and I was

00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:11,309
just chasing the more the green squares

00:30:07,999 --> 00:30:13,080
so there was one quote from Jason that I

00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,969
really like he said you know this is a

00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,619
periodic reminder open-source maintainer

00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:19,109
so doing their best to keep up with

00:30:16,619 --> 00:30:21,719
firehose of questions bugs in perfect

00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:23,460
docs and so many other tasks that it's

00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:24,629
easy to take for granted so please thank

00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,200
them and be kind to open source

00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:27,239
maintainers

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,919
usually they only hear the bad feedback

00:30:27,239 --> 00:30:32,039
and the last sentence is really

00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,659
important here so you know haters are

00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:35,489
always louder and especially in open

00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:37,409
source world everything to me feels like

00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:38,729
this you know people just want to fight

00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:41,159
in the comments section if something is

00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:43,169
not working so a while ago I told you

00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:45,239
about this website called 30 seconds of

00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:48,269
interviews somebody posted that on

00:30:45,239 --> 00:30:50,549
reddit and one of the feedback comments

00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:51,899
was this it was basically like a senior

00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:53,779
front-end engineer from New York City

00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:56,729
who said he was interviewing 50

00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:58,889
front-end developers for his company and

00:30:56,729 --> 00:31:01,079
he was betting that nobody could know

00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:03,299
answers to those questions and the

00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:05,020
answer to that was coming out of

00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:07,570
bootcamp in New York City we could

00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:11,080
answer that so you know the point here

00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:13,120
is just to forget about that and to feel

00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,880
great about being an open source and

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,490
kind of sticking to this sentence that I

00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,950
started to talk with I'm not so good at

00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:23,110
finishing talks and I wasn't even good

00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,580
at finishing essays in primary school so

00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,380
I found like a perfect gift that is

00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,080
gonna explain what you should not be

00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:32,020
doing so this is a contributor and he's

00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,340
basically on a little playground the

00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:37,030
playground is supposed to be your

00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:38,860
project open-source project and you're

00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:41,170
gonna see what he's doing so basically

00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,240
he starts like playing on it considering

00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:46,030
to contribute and then just like exits

00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,610
the playground so this is definitely not

00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:51,190
what you want to do and yeah that would

00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:54,160
be it for for today I hope you liked it

00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:56,290
you can see my contact to the very top

00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,840
if you have any questions or if you're

00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:01,180
gonna ask questions now and I also want

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,080
to introduce the next person who is

00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,760
going to talk which is going to be

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,600
Adrian about testing web accessibility

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:11,020

00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,020
