Description: 
	Talk By Jakob Reiter:

Smart Assistants (most common Alexa and Google Home) are more and more pushing into our living rooms. In this talk I will present the two major platform capabilities, compare their up and downs from a developer perspective and show some nodejs code on what developers can do with them.

I have the pleasure to give you an

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,980
introduction to voice assistance I

00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:10,019
looked over the website of the energy s

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,030
and I was like why has never like anyone

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,099
done about that topic it's it's really

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,160
cool it's really fun and it's really

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,600
easy to do and I'm not seeing like a lot

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,119
of projects out there so I thought like

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,170
maybe little motivation goes a long way

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,410
right who of you has a voice assistant

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:31,080
at home like Anna lecturer Google home

00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:33,540
right right okay how you like it like no

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,760
yeah good there's a good yeah good

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,200
rock on yeah it's always good yeah

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:43,020
nicely so I thought hey why not do both

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,690
because don't want to be biased so

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,940
whenever you have a like this icon on

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,500
the slide that's very specific to Alexa

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,050
and if you have like this icon on this

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,719
light that's very specific to Google

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:58,649
right to Google home I try to like keep

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,820
it as like consistent for both of them

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:06,659
but sometimes obviously they diverge

00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:10,860
cool who the am i I'm allowed to

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,100
say so my name is Jacob I'm one of the

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,810
founding partners at the venturi I

00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,939
worked there as the chief lead for

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,530
backend and data engineering so I care

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:24,240
about the backend I care about data I

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,100
care about stuff moving and I'm also an

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,850
evangelist for a chat and voice box

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,000
there so I love stuff that talks

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,210
I'm also an easy and and easy Anna it's

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,680
easier I am an easel committee member on

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,229
the joint Technical Committee on

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,540
artificial intelligent which is cool

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:45,390
because lots of stuff happening in that

00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:50,060
field and we're trying to standardize it

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:53,850
on the international level cool

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,369
that's my company whatever do cool we do

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,380
we do cool stuff we invest in startups

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,060
we work with the corporates so it's

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,780
super fun you see a lot of different

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:07,350
tack so yeah so driving a little bit

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,640
into Alexa right so not a lot of people

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,910
know that there's about a hundred

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,370
million Alexis being sold and in in

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,370
households out there

00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:19,970
and the prediction for 2022 is as

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:21,920
actually 200 million Alexis out there so

00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,799
you have like a really massive amount of

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,170
devices that is sold in households ready

00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:29,180
to be used and then you look in the

00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:33,019
Alexa skill score store and it's

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,810
basically empty right so it's you have

00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:38,209
this device people are using it but no

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,769
one is there right and all the marketers

00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:41,360
in my company always tell me like if you

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:43,459
have something like this go on to it

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,010
because you get all the attention if

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,480
you're the first one in that market so

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,489
what's very specific about a lexer is

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,560
they used to be voice only they try to

00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:53,420
really go for like voice commands and

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,220
voice assistance but they're now

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,660
starting to open up with screens and

00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,359
buttons and stuff like this mostly

00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,370
through the pressure of Google I think

00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:03,920
but that's that's impressive but now

00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,129
wait for Google so the Googler system is

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,549
now on 500 million dedicated Google

00:03:07,129 --> 00:03:12,980
assistant devices right and then over 1

00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:14,870
billion Google assistants that obviously

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:16,970
also includes the one on the smartphone

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,590
right because Google right

00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:21,109
I've never the less the 500 million

00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:24,169
dedicated devices with Google assistant

00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:25,940
is really impressive I think and what's

00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:28,790
but what I think is really interesting

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,349
with Google it it it like really bridges

00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,329
the whole band it like it's voice it

00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:35,720
texts it touch write the Google system

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,190
is very broad in its term of going into

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,799
different modes that you can communicate

00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,690
with so it's quite challenging to to

00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:46,190
also program a good experience on it but

00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:48,019
it's huh so how does it work try to keep

00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:50,180
it super high level on the architecture

00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,549
you speak to the device and the device

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,079
speaks to you and you listen right this

00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:57,379
is this is kind of like this loop here

00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:00,500
right and the way you plug into the into

00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:03,019
the platform is that you have kind of a

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,599
switch get to that later and then you

00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,760
have like your action or your skill that

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,000
runs on the platform right it's kind of

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,919
like you are app or your attention span

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,250
taking over the communication with the

00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,769
user and then it's super primitive you

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,210
have a web hook that goes to your

00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:26,180
preferred nodejs server obviously and

00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,960
then you send a response right what

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,550
sometime

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,360
really interesting is that that

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:35,180
communication here happens synchronous

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,430
so that might sound like something fun

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,400
because like I get a request and then I

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,740
just output the return Jason and that's

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,860
it the communication but it's sometimes

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,210
really a problem because Amazon or

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,979
Google they're not they don't want to

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:53,120
wait so they give you like ten seconds

00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:55,430
to answer with the response right so the

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,830
timeout is actually pretty tough and ten

00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,720
seconds may not sound that long if you

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,880
have like a small app but if your

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,919
example integrate into like an insurance

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,380
company and you go way deep into their

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,380
core system your starting just like

00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:11,000
pileup on response times and suddenly

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,169
you're like a 10 seconds response time

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,099
because you're dealing with a system

00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:17,720
from wherever right and then you're

00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:19,070
starting to like come close to that

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,389
response time which is sometimes a

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:26,360
problem so fast is really cool here but

00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,009
yeah the basic is that with the web hook

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,919
you kind of get all the information you

00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:32,659
need to process your request essentially

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:34,490
and then in the response you give

00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:36,860
basically the answer that is done

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:39,620
funneled through the system to the user

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,940
and you hear it right and what's really

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,630
interesting with those kind of systems

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:49,070
is you have no visual output right you

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:52,699
don't have anything no buttons no select

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:55,099
boxes nor checkboxes nothing so hearing

00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:57,949
and the art of hearing really becomes

00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:59,900
important which is fun cuz suddenly your

00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:01,940
voice becomes your brand when we think

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,699
of like making websites everything but

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:08,180
our brand represents is visual right

00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:10,969
it's its colors its styles its formation

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,039
of the platform but none of that happens

00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:15,469
or none of that exists normally in a

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,490
voice only communication so the way you

00:06:15,469 --> 00:06:21,889
speak the words you use the tempo right

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,560
the acoustics stuff like this becomes

00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:26,479
your brand the way you speak right

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,360
there's a really good explanation like

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,979
if you call an airline company and the

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,440
person on the other phone says like

00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:36,199
howdy what do you want to go today right

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,960
that's a very different brand than hello

00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,400
how may I help you right you have an

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,220
immediate different person in your

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,900
head and that's the brand right that is

00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,370
on a voice only communication your brand

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,310
so it's very interesting to also think

00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,740
about what kind of character do you have

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,630
because we always have a character right

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,970
when humans communicate even with

00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,860
something like a Lex or a Google home we

00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,259
tend to imagine a character in our hat

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,720
so we have to consciously design that

00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:04,430
which is fun because it very much

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,770
reminds a lot of people on the beginning

00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,960
of the web we say like oh wait maybe we

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:10,370
have to like put forums into consistent

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,680
way and like maybe we should think about

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:14,960
the flow of the application so we're in

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,449
that very early stage now with the voice

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,750
communication but anyway super fun to

00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:23,060
think about it so how do we get to this

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,830
branching thing like between you and the

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,990
other one so this is called an

00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,389
invocation word so you give it an

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,669
invocation word and with Google that is

00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:35,599
global globally unique and with Alexa

00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:37,580
that is device device specific unique so

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,009
for example here you can say hey Google

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:43,009
asked meet up but about the next V

00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:46,370
energize meter right and here you have

00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:48,680
an explicit mention of ask meet up so

00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,990
this would be your invocation name but

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,820
you can also have on Google the implicit

00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,680
which is really nice because you can say

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,599
hey Google when is the next Vienna chest

00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,909
meet up so you're not dedicatedly

00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:00,979
mentioned the invocation word but Google

00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:02,510
kind of gets from the context and the VN

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:05,020
are chess that you want to reach the

00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:08,449
meet up skill right and then tries to

00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,250
redirect you to your own to your own

00:08:08,449 --> 00:08:11,990
skill which is nice because a lot of

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:14,389
people tried this without the dedicated

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:17,659
and then they like find you there's an

00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:20,120
implicit way of a being found on those

00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:21,650
platforms Alexa has this currently in

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,979
beta so it will also roll out in the

00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,979
near future

00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:29,750
so a little bit of words because

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,680
obviously in the visual one we always

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:35,630
know what that means but for the for the

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,300
voice one it's maybe interesting to also

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:39,909
get the words that we use there so when

00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,469
we call it what we call an utterance

00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:44,360
which is basically what someone says

00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:46,610
right it's the it's the input that you

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,440
get for example the user says when is

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,570
the next V energy s meetup in March

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,180
that's an utterance in the sense that

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,230
it's an input that you get what you can

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,020
classify out of

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:59,810
in the first step is an intent what is

00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:02,420
the intent behind that utterance that

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,730
the user says right the utter and the

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,830
intent behind this is he wants to have

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:10,280
the meet up time right this is kind of

00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,990
like the broken down business case or

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,000
the broken down case that your

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:16,850
application needs to process later on

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,220
right and then obviously you can get a

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,320
lot of out of this utterance right you

00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,630
know for example that it's looking for

00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,270
the V energy s meet up that's not just

00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,550
any word in the sentence but to you that

00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:31,370
word has a very specific meaning it

00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:33,590
means the specific event that they want

00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,840
to hear maybe they're looking next time

00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:38,510
for the Vienna PHP meter right or the

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,610
Vienna gardening Meetup right so this

00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,500
word has a very specific meaning for you

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,230
we call this an entity or a part of

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,090
speech and then there's second very

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,970
interesting part of speech in there

00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:51,800
which is in March right you probably

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,200
don't see but in March which is the

00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,790
month that that we actually get because

00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,950
it makes a difference if we're looking

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:00,830
for the Vienna HS meetup in January the

00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:04,040
one in March right so this is like an

00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:06,350
entity that we have to detect so how are

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,860
we going to do this yeah so obviously

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:12,560
this goes into the training and this we

00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,270
need to tell the platform that those are

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,760
words that we kind of care of because

00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,080
they make a difference for the sentence

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,430
so how does the training work I hope

00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,420
everyone can see so this is the

00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:25,190
interface you get from Amazon Alexa and

00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:28,040
what you have here is you enter in

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:31,040
simple utterances so you train the

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,550
system by entering what a user might say

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:37,190
right and you give him like ten twenty a

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,440
hundred a thousand different examples

00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,990
for that single intent so you're always

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,540
training on an intent basis so the

00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,980
intent here is meet up time and I gave

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:50,530
him a couple of trainings they're like

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:53,600
what time is beep in beep so month

00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:56,960
meetup and month what's happening in

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,730
beep month yeah so you tell him where

00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,470
you have your entities in there and it

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,240
kind of learns how the structure of the

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,880
sentence worked but merely entering

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,940
those so it would detect that's what

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,860
happening what's happening in January

00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,320
what's happening in March what's

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,760
happening with April then automatically

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,660
comes because it knows that the

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,860
structure of the sentence should be that

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,900
and you can even train it without an

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,490
entity when is the next Meetup

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,620
right you don't have all the information

00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:26,240
so you might prompt the user afterwards

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,490
like yay which meetup you're looking for

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,170
which month you're looking for you have

00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,420
to then later guide him through a step

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:34,580
before the dialogue but ideally the user

00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:37,220
provides everything for example in this

00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:39,040
sentence so that's how you train and

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,540
intent you give them sample except uh

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,790
Terentius and it kind of learns from

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,470
those sample utterances and that's also

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,420
the learning later in the system is that

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,460
you carefully log if there's an

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,470
utterance you didn't know and you can't

00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,660
classify and you put it back into the

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,490
training it's like a this is this you

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,080
did wrong this is data that's that is

00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:02,000
that this is that intense and vice-versa

00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,740
this is how it looks in in Google

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,110
they're using a platform called dialog

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,750
flow which was a startup they acquired a

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,820
couple of years back and you also see it

00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,980
here this is like the utterances here

00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,780
and here you have the entities already

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,640
marked when is the energy s in March

00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,470
right they actually like you can

00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,110
actually write it down write it out and

00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:23,750
you see that what you also see here is

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:26,030
that is from the entity meet up and

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:28,130
that's update period so it automatically

00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:30,560
detects date periods which is super nice

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:33,200
because then all the date periods work

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,510
right it's kind of like comes out of the

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:40,250
box with Google which is really nice so

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,570
why not yes in the backend I think for

00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:44,480
everyone in the room that's quite

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,310
obvious because no GS is cool and it's

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,110
very easy with four lines of code to

00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:50,120
like write a simple server that allows

00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:52,850
you to take that web hook and

00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,570
immediately then responds with the Jason

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,980
you would need right so we found that

00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,930
nodejs is actually pretty awesome in

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,390
that regard because it's fast it's very

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,880
light wave and you can great you can't

00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:08,300
generate those request response pattern

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,790
quite easily and quite stable and also

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:13,010
like a lots of serverless because speed

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,570
is is of the essence if you talk to a

00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,370
lexer if you talk to go home you don't

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,440
want to wait a couple of seconds

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:21,020
interview you got the response you want

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,560
to have them more fluent conversation so

00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:24,529
speed

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,300
is really important here so start

00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:29,660
thinking about server less if you don't

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:32,000
have a cold start so how does it look

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,370
with Alexa right so you get like a

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,940
massive JSON out of it right I try to

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,920
reduce it so it fits on one slide and it

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:43,220
only holds the information necessary but

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,320
that's a huge a huge jason you get stuff

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,330
about the session that's currently going

00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,779
on about the context that the

00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:52,940
conversation is what user where's the

00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:55,010
user's location what's the device ID

00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,620
stuff like this and then you get that

00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:59,660
request with an intent request this is

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,910
when you get an intent that was invoke

00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,500
ated in the platform you get the local

00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:06,230
so you know like oh this is from an

00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,640
english speaker and then you see here

00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,040
you get the meetup time

00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,380
the intent that you classified and then

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,140
you get like this slots which is the

00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:17,720
entities as Google as Alexa calls them

00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,279
and then you have like meetup and here

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,650
you have the beginner chairs meetup and

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,000
here you have the March and that's what

00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,260
you then basically run against your

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,600
database right you do some formatting

00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,300
you do some Corrections you look how it

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,790
works and then you google hey meetup API

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,920
give me four V energy s everything you

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,740
have in March you filter that back and

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,040
put it back into the Google into Amazon

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:42,620
Alexa here right how does it work

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,510
the response you give it a version super

00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,250
easy session attributes you can forget

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:50,300
and then you have a response output

00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:52,820
speech type plain text right and then

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,220
you have the actual text that Alexa

00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:59,060
should say through its text-to-speech

00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:01,010
mechanism super easy and you'll mostly

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,130
get good results there is a second type

00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:06,080
which is really interesting it's SS ml

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:09,080
speech synthesis markup language in

00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,760
there it's basically text with markup

00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,339
language where you can actually like

00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,440
control the pronunciation exactly so if

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:17,209
you have for example a horrible world

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,160
with a horrible word which is the

00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:21,650
venturi which is really hard to

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,980
pronounce even for a human rather than a

00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:28,190
Texas speech synthesis mechanism you can

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,920
give up the exact sounding words and the

00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:32,750
sounding Louds and then it would make

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,850
its best to actually make it that sound

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,529
which is really nice especially if

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,230
dealing with brands or very specific

00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:43,310
words that don't come come out good to

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:46,819
the normal text to speech synthesis with

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:50,420
Google it's also very easy you get this

00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:52,819
query request again here it's really

00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,610
nice you get the plain utterance that

00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:58,310
the user says which is super nice

00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,990
because if you don't trust Google to do

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,990
a good job which sometimes you should

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:05,149
then you can run it on through your own

00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,009
natural language processing or your own

00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:08,839
natural language understanding or even

00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:11,980
through your own tensorflow

00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,720
and like see if google did a good job

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,190
and then you get the parameters and then

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,839
you basically as you can see here you

00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:21,920
get your entities here

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:25,279
same thing with Amazon Alexa and you

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:29,060
basically also get the core intent here

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,800
as you see meet up time and then here

00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:33,500
you even get an intent detection

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,959
confidence so it's very nice from Google

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,670
to tell you like how confident the

00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,889
machine is that they have made the right

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:42,800
choice for you so for example you can

00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:44,540
say oh I only trust 80% and if I get

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,149
something that is less than 80% like

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,610
I'll cut it and like go through a

00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:53,660
fallback procedure or any other dealing

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:55,819
mechanism right again this is the

00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,380
essential fields this it's a very long

00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:59,649
JSON with a lot of data that you

00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,689
normally get but that's the core field

00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:04,880
so and then you respond the response is

00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:07,400
very sleek you give it a fulfillment

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,589
text which is basically again the text

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,120
that you want to speak and then you give

00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,760
it a source so it can attribute it to

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,010
your server and then some context and

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,679
flow output that I don't want to go into

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:21,559
because it's a little complicated and

00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:24,230
that was easy right that that's all

00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:26,240
there is right you you get an intent you

00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,069
take it you classified you do your inner

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,370
workings with it and you respond to it

00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:32,990
and basically the rest is the magic that

00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,299
happens in the box right it's the rest

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,850
that the Amazon Alexa or the Google home

00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:40,429
cares about so basically you're writing

00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:42,950
the pure back end and let the front end

00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:47,030
and everything handle a lot with Alexa

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:48,740
and Google so that's easy especially if

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,500
you're doing like a small application

00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,990
that for example you automate something

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,120
in your home or you write a notification

00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,620
service you can ask that Google hey are

00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,750
there any new notifications and stuff

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,520
like this but I want to give you a

00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,170
little bit of sneak peek because that's

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,730
obviously not the way we do it in the

00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,250
company and I thought it would be nice

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,440
to see how our system like looks in

00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,740
production if you're all it out to a

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,420
multinational cooperation how a system

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,070
on a bigger scale looks like because I

00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:20,210
think then you're starting to see a

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:22,970
pattern so we have we have something

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:25,010
that we would like to call the bot base

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:28,040
because it's a nice name and it kind of

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:30,679
like shows how it works and what we

00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,570
built is we built not just a lecture in

00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,340
Google home but we built like a lot of

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,250
channels and we put them through a

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,630
harmonization layer and saying like we

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,340
don't want to care too much about the

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,900
specifics of the platform but we want to

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,270
have something abstract to work with

00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,130
that a developer who's not familiar with

00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,929
each individual platform can still work

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,510
with the platform on an abstract level

00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:52,880
right so taking the specifics out of out

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,710
of the interface and then after the

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,540
harmonization layer we run it through

00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,030
the actual custom business logic that we

00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,220
have right it might be like handing in

00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:03,559
an insurance claim or it might be like

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,280
triggering something or putting a sales

00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:09,520
offer or even an FAQ or something very

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,050
simple we run it through it and

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,070
sometimes we use one of the platform's

00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:17,690
above sometimes we use our own methods

00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,880
it's actually super flexible sometimes

00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,070
our work was already done for example in

00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,780
the Amazon or Google home they already

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,970
come with the intent we don't have to

00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:28,520
run through the tented and detection

00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:31,190
again and then we Google on the end some

00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,420
enterprise data or some databases where

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,620
we have some knowledge about the user

00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:38,360
right so actually you want to dive not

00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,340
too much into the specifics but you want

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,960
to abstract it very quickly so a lot of

00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,790
developers can get onto the source code

00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:48,920
I don't have to read through a lot of

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:50,570
materials of documentation so yeah that

00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:54,310
was all I hope it was a short

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:57,740
introduction and happy to get questions

00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,740
