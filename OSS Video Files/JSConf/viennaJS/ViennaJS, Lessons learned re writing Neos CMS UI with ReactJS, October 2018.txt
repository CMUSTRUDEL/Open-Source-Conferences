Description: 
	Talk by Dmitri Pisarev

Image your task would be to build one of the biggest open source ReactJS applications. Dmitri has exactly that experience as a Neos CMS core member. Neos CMS is a modern open source content management system. The administration area is very complex because it offers full inline editing of content. So the React application has to play nicely with arbitrary code from site developers. Based on ReactJS, Redux, Redux-Saga, and Immutable.js the Neos UI project has almost 100.000 lines of code over 5.027 commits.  Dmitri brings us along the rather exciting journey rewriting the User Interface from Ember into ReactJS. The team solved a number of long-standing technical challenges and learned a few lessons along the way. Join the talk to hear the story, both from a technical and a project management perspective.
