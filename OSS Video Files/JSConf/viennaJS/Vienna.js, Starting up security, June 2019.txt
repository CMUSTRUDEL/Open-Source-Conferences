	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,870
so first disclaimer I'm working for

00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:10,410
security monitoring service provider

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,269
called the fence city so I might be a

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,990
little bit biased and on one of the

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:18,270
slides second disclaimer I'm software

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,000
developer and no security expert I'm the

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:25,490
one in our team that's actually coming

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,689
from an computer programming background

00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,580
the other ones in my team are

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:35,040
penetration testers and security experts

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:37,980
so I'm not failing you to the topic but

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,520
at least in my team I'm I'm not official

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,250
expert about security but as I'm working

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,890
in this team for now more than one year

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,430
I thought it might be interesting to

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,760
share some patterns that I saw when when

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,760
working with customers what different

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,530
levels of security you can achieve and

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,270
how you can improve your security

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:05,309
step-by-step when doing software

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:08,780
development first off I thought I'd give

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:14,540
you some interesting numbers numbers

00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:17,790
there is one 76% of breaches are

00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,580
financially motivated meaning usually

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,470
people say well we're too small startup

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,080
we don't have a lot of data that's

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,780
interesting to hackers might not be

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,090
interesting for them to to attack us at

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,659
all so security is not important

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:38,610
financially motivated means they'll try

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:44,280
to install crypto software in your front

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:49,610
end in your back end put up many cloud

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:55,920
machines and computing power to just run

00:01:49,610 --> 00:02:00,689
coin mining stuff usually or in

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:05,520
comparison to yeah griefer or just fun

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:06,840
it's just a lot less big motivation in

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,980
heck

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:14,890
another interesting statistics is

00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,930
comparing how much time does it does it

00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:21,570
take for attackers to get into your

00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:24,880
system and how much time does it take

00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:27,460
attack organization to find out about

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:31,420
this heck so there's this huge gap of

00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:36,820
attackers just needing 9 nearly 90% of

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:41,050
all hacks being being done will take

00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:44,230
only minutes meaning these are the 90%

00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:49,390
of hacks are really obvious things that

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:52,810
could be patched very easily but yeah

00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:56,260
it's not done so it's very easy for the

00:02:52,810 --> 00:03:00,459
hackers to get into a system with very

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:04,810
obvious flaws in your systems and on the

00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:07,290
other hand due to missing lock systems

00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:10,269
and reviewing your your whole

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:13,810
architecture and systems usually the

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:18,300
organization will need several months to

00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:23,560
find out about the sec so we have this

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:29,830
68% of hex being only discovered after

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:31,930
month another interesting thing to to

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:38,350
get a little bit of perspective of

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:40,750
security 93% of breaches are caused by

00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:42,850
fishing and pretexting so fishing and

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:48,160
pretexting is really a big thing where

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:52,900
most attacks are successful the neck

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:55,360
next biggest part is lack of security

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,450
patching having old servers having

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,110
whatever having not patching your your

00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:05,080
application framework not patching your

00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:07,630
front end libraries and the next big

00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,840
pillar is change management which

00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:13,600
matches also the trend of going more and

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,780
more to the cloud change management

00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,459
meaning you deploy new stuff changed

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:23,440
something in your

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:26,440
cloud cloud provider and opening holes

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,660
into your systems by doing that and not

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,660
having a proper process where another

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:36,520
one another developer will review your

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:41,950
changes on the other hand where is the

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:44,470
vast majority of money spent I guess I

00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:47,230
took these numbers from from the

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:49,560
presentation down here did a link so if

00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:52,780
you're interested in seeing the whole a

00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,110
slide tech slide tech and getting even

00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,330
more information you can go there but my

00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:02,260
suspicion is that those security spans

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:04,230
are mostly by big companies meaning they

00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,840
pay a lot of pay a lot for

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:11,950
authentication and authorization systems

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,430
they also pay a lot of money for malware

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:18,300
detection and metal detection in the

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:21,820
network and also endpoint security

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,250
meaning antivirus software and what's

00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:29,530
interesting in just mapping those two

00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:32,560
areas is that you can say authentication

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:36,490
and authorization will nicely match the

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,010
fishing and pretexting problem but on

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,700
the other hand those big issues are not

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:51,340
really addressed by there the other big

00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:54,669
spending pillows yeah so I'm coming I'll

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,640
give you just a short overview of what

00:05:54,669 --> 00:06:02,230
types of attacks to expect on the one

00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:04,870
hand we have automated attacks somebody

00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:07,900
creating a script and trying to get in

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,380
as many machines or finding as many

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:15,220
machines with a certain vulnerability

00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:17,770
meaning usually these people are not

00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,050
targeting one specific company they are

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,600
just the found one security hole in

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,220
software and now they're trying to find

00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:27,669
a target where they can apply their

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:30,430
their vulnerability on on the other hand

00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:32,230
there is this highly customized attacks

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,540
where they really have you

00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,900
company is the target usually these

00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:40,030
texts are these attacks are against

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,520
bigger corporations where they want to

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:46,570
want to get where there's higher stakes

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:49,030
if you get into into the systems the

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:51,490
highly customized one usually take also

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:57,880
longer and and you have to focus on on

00:06:51,490 --> 00:07:00,820
really one company which targets to

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,260
attack us address so on the one side if

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,660
you're a software development company

00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:08,290
you will have your product that you are

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,810
most concerned of usually your product

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:14,110
is the custom software that you're

00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:16,110
developing on a day to day business and

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,240
on the other hand there is this

00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:22,450
infrastructure component that usually

00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,180
every company in the world nowadays says

00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:27,580
meaning your email services your file

00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:31,540
shares things you buy from other

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:33,760
companies and vendors but those things

00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:39,460
are also very critical to your daily

00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:43,030
business so those are the two components

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:46,060
that you have to care about and both

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:50,050
components have different things that

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:52,780
you have to care for so what what's the

00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:57,120
first step in improving your security as

00:07:52,780 --> 00:08:00,250
a developer I'd say as individual be

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:06,490
individual be interested in security

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:09,400
topics in general so try to follow news

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,230
posts when when new vulnerabilities pop

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,560
up especially with your framework or

00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:17,520
your technology we through the problems

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:23,680
they have and the problems to address

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:27,850
and you do it the same way as you would

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:31,630
do with highly critical bugs get get

00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:33,550
interested in those things usually if

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:37,419
you're using some kind of framework or

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:39,400
that's the general recommendation look

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:42,430
at the frameworks in your technology

00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:44,800
technology space and learn about the

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,140
security features they provide for

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,510
example

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:53,310
I'm a Django developer so there is one

00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,890
specific sub-site and they are the

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,800
commutation detailing all the features

00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:01,230
they provide in terms of security I

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,140
listed all so for example Express GS

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:09,540
they also have a best practice site for

00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:11,490
security with them get get a feeling for

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,970
what they provide and what you might

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:19,770
miss in your framework or in your code

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:23,400
which you should work on also if you're

00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:25,640
using a framework try to subscribe to

00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,940
those mailing lists that will announce

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:32,400
vulnerabilities as soon as they pop up

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:35,240
yeah again there's one for Django but

00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:41,340
I'm sure there is also others for

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:43,770
JavaScript related stuff NPM has one sub

00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:47,190
site detailing all the advisories do you

00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,750
have an RSS feed I guess or I've seen

00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,740
that you can also filter for the

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,450
packages that you usually use and just

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:58,280
subscribe on those specific advisories

00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:03,030
and there's also this nice tool snook io

00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:05,120
they also have a very big database and

00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,410
up-to-date database of new Buller

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:15,000
vulnerabilities in the JavaScript

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:19,500
environment so again so this first level

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,370
is getting your small team more focused

00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:29,280
on security and one good thing to start

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:32,010
with is having code reviews try to find

00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,220
or if you don't have any senior

00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,930
engineers already in the team tried to

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,080
get senior engineers since they will

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:44,820
improve the whole code reviewing a lot

00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:49,940
and usually they or if you are senior

00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:52,980
engineer try to put the finger on

00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:56,490
critical parts of the code of juniors

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:59,660
and talk through them talk through that

00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,660
the issues you can find

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:07,390
try to develop best practices in your

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:11,260
team write them down make them clear to

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:13,000
everyone yeah that that's the most

00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:20,050
important thing that you can do as a

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:23,410
team then two more technical things

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:25,810
hands-on things that you service I said

00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:31,870
it's one six percent of all

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:35,800
vulnerabilities are based on unpatched

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:39,640
servers so that's a real threat to use

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:44,020
systems it's not you should do that on a

00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:46,330
very regular basis on the other hand one

00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:49,420
pattern that we saw with our customers

00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:53,080
the ones that have a very high level on

00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:56,740
with security they usually also have the

00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:59,710
sense for using platform providers just

00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:03,780
to name a few like Google App Engine

00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,780
hero core there are thousands others

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:11,190
focus on the things that you're best

00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:14,140
with and the whole patching and and

00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:18,220
keeping a systems up-to-date leave them

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:20,080
to your platform providers and also

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,350
studied the Eric security related

00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:27,670
documentation usually Google App Engine

00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:30,670
and abs they all have security related

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:34,950
features read through the documentation

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,950
and find out what makes sense for you

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,270
another important thing if you're

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:45,820
developing your own product isolate your

00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:48,400
assets if you have a wordpress blog for

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:51,100
example since it's a typical case and

00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,980
you have your product custom code don't

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,800
put them together on one server find

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,500
some in the best way you'd find some

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,900
special WordPress hosting company and

00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,310
just put the WordPress stuff there and

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:07,900
have your product stuff on another

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:10,060
server yeah centralized logging is also

00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:13,210
something that's very important to find

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,880
out about problems you might

00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:19,210
come across or if you're it under attack

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,400
that this you need to have a system to

00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,740
go to where you can find out if there is

00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,830
somebody attacking you and so there's

00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,510
central logging there's also some

00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:33,270
service software's the service company

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:37,300
doing great products and this yeah

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:39,370
also multi-factor authentication is an

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,040
important thing to improve your security

00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:44,650
so these are the steps that you can do

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:50,020
totally in-house without doing anything

00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:54,730
special have a security policy have some

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:58,930
dedicated email address where possible

00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:00,730
attackers can contact you and be sure

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:04,300
that this email address is also

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:09,700
forwarded to one that somebody will read

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:11,980
it on time for example there is right

00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:15,790
now if I'm not sure it has been in the

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:19,090
media right now the viennese library has

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,550
been hacked some days ago and there was

00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:27,070
exactly the thing that the heck

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:29,490
published 700,000 date data records just

00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:32,080
because he couldn't reach anyone and

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:36,160
nobody followed up on his issues and

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:39,010
fine on his werner ability about a

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,640
broken web application so there are

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:44,440
several layers how you can improve that

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:48,640
one very simple thing is this having

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:53,230
this security txt on your server it's

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:56,950
nothing special so just put in a mail

00:14:53,230 --> 00:15:00,310
address and you might also want to have

00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:02,470
an key so that if somebody finds a

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:06,870
vulnerability and wants to contact you

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,870
first one secured way he can do this

00:15:12,709 --> 00:15:18,439
the next step will be having some

00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:21,339
specific security page the Django

00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:25,279
project for example has this they also

00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:28,490
detailed the whole process on how what

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,369
they expect if you find something how

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:33,379
the process will will go up for the for

00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:35,869
the whole community if there is a new

00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:42,019
vulnerability so that's another good

00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:45,249
thing and the last well another level

00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:47,869
would be having a security policy

00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:52,160
published on hecka one Haeckel one is

00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:58,009
also a big platform back bounty platform

00:15:52,160 --> 00:16:00,050
where other hackers can can browse

00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:03,279
through companies that are willing to

00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:08,259
give money if you find a vulnerability

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,259
yeah Dropbox is doing that for example

00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:15,230
also I put in one link where you can

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:19,309
find nice templates for creating

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:27,279
security pages and security texts like

00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:30,679
the one you like the Django page yeah so

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:37,629
publish security policies would be the

00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:40,100
next level what to do next regularly run

00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:44,290
vulnerability scanners against your

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:48,199
infrastructure this usually will not

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:50,709
improve your product security as you've

00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:52,550
done custom code development and

00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:55,790
vulnerability scanners are the right

00:16:52,550 --> 00:17:00,049
tool for checking your infrastructure so

00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:04,039
finding very obvious problems that that

00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:07,459
90% would be so previously usually you

00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:10,189
can find them also with nice and good

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:12,350
vulnerability scanners they are very

00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:16,069
easy to start with usually you just in

00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:20,209
type in to your domain and they'll start

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:22,250
checking your infrastructure look for a

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,740
solution that provides a lot of good

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,890
documentation if there is an issue that

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,310
defined in your interest

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:32,760
Raksha that's also something that will

00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:35,370
help your team increase security

00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,140
awareness if you find a nice

00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:39,510
documentation that you vulnerability

00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:45,480
scanner that will help a lot as a

00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:46,590
starting point yeah just tonight to name

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,310
a few

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:53,160
of course there is a fancy D and there

00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:56,220
are another two big companies necess

00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,790
cloud they are from Israel and market

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:04,530
leader and Qualis is also not a big one

00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:06,450
so there's usually something but yeah do

00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:10,430
you research in the internet you'll find

00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:13,020
probably something that fits your needs

00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:16,050
penetration test is usually the thing

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,900
that companies that try to start with

00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:20,610
security they first go to penetration

00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,280
test so they don't care about security

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,710
policy or improving the whole mindset in

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,280
your in your development team but they

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:32,460
want immediately a penetration test so I

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:36,480
put this penetration test slide on

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,730
purpose way back yeah

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:44,880
penetration test makes a lot of sense

00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:49,040
for your product they can do very D

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,360
contract your your code specifically and

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:55,500
give you a lot of insights where you

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,720
have problems but the big or the issue

00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:02,190
with penetration tests is only one time

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:06,140
track of course it costs a lot of money

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:10,890
just say it's a huge upfront investment

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:16,500
and it's of course of just limited scope

00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:19,620
to - yeah test your product but on the

00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:23,070
other hand limited scope is a nice tip

00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:26,790
also penetration tests make a lot of

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:30,030
sense if you on purpose limit the scope

00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:32,730
to some specific area where the the

00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:36,290
penetration testers have time to really

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:39,900
look into and dig into that issue

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:43,170
another tip that I would say

00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:46,290
makes sense is if you do penetration

00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:48,870
testing already or yeah if you do

00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:51,150
penetration testing already switch

00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:57,650
partners from time to time as usually

00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:57,650
the report of penetration tests is

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:03,120
depends on the the team that does it and

00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:06,480
if you change teams you will get

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:09,090
different tests different ideas

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:14,309
different viewpoints so that makes a lot

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:17,730
of sense to I already mentioned take a

00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:22,080
one with the Dropbox policy page echo

00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:25,470
one is a back bounty program so usually

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:29,340
it's kind compared somehow to

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:31,950
penetration tests since some some

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,800
individual will check your software and

00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,780
you define which parts of software which

00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:42,809
parts of the infrastructure you want to

00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:44,460
have checked as if you are on that level

00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:47,880
and want to try out the pack bounty

00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:52,140
program program there is the great tip

00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,870
of as a first step to do publish your

00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:58,320
security policy privately and invite

00:20:54,870 --> 00:21:01,860
some VIP researchers to start slowly

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,410
with the whole program and not be

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:07,800
flooded by new requests since usually

00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:11,250
those research researchers will expect

00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:13,920
you to respond very quickly and if you

00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:17,280
are starting just with public you will

00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:22,590
get a lot of trivial issues firsthand

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:28,110
and you will just drown in contact

00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:31,460
emails here's a nice case study from

00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:36,240
WordPress WordPress is also a page on

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:38,460
hecka one they have done or the the guy

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,920
from Brad press who is responsible for

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:44,100
the security Aaron Campell published the

00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:47,540
blog post and he said in within six

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:53,409
months they spent fourteen thousand

00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:56,919
dollars for on 22 different haircuts

00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:59,860
on average the report on average for

00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:04,090
every report they paid 350 dollars and

00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:07,149
the interesting part is also only 60% of

00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:11,080
the reports you got in were valid

00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:14,049
reports so there is this huge workload

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:19,870
you you'll have to expect from from this

00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:24,190
kind of platform yeah

00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:27,580
as a last slide I wanted to also mention

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:31,659
some in-house scanners I would only

00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:34,299
recommend them for wheel or if you're a

00:22:31,659 --> 00:22:35,919
bigger corporation or if you work in a

00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:40,779
bigger corporation and you have the

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:44,769
money that that might make sense yeah

00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:47,499
one very are two very popular ones also

00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:49,809
in our penetration testing team they use

00:22:47,499 --> 00:22:51,759
an SS in pursuit so just for

00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:54,129
completeness sake if you are interested

00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:58,950
those are very nice tools to start with

00:22:54,129 --> 00:22:58,950
if you want to try something locally

00:22:59,399 --> 00:23:07,740
cool so that's the official end of my

00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:10,690
general talk I also try to collect some

00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:15,159
travel script specific ideas from from

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:18,730
the rest of my team where we thought the

00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:20,950
the biggest issues are within the the

00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:24,999
JavaScript community in terms of

00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:27,970
security in the JavaScript world there

00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:34,259
is this tendency to have a lot of module

00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:38,289
imports for very small software packages

00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:40,649
so in general be conservative about the

00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:47,289
things that you import from third-party

00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:50,309
developers as a general hint and if you

00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:52,960
import software from third-party

00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:57,970
developers be sure to pin the version on

00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:01,960
a specific specific version review the

00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:04,480
code and use something like snick snick

00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,960
the tool that i mentioned previously we

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,120
have this vulnerability

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,679
database for free but they also provide

00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:14,809
a tool where you can trust check your

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,450
third-party lab requirements against

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:19,549
known vulnerabilities and you will be

00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:23,649
alerted if there pops up and you

00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:23,649
vulnerability which might be very handy

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:30,649
yeah if you link to some external CDN be

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:34,220
sure to use the integrity attribute

00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:37,309
meaning there is if you for example use

00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:41,149
a trick query version hosted on some

00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:42,830
other CDN there is this attribute

00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:45,649
integrity where you can provide a hash

00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,179
and if this hash does not match with the

00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:51,070
contents of the file that gets

00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:51,070
downloaded the browser simply will not

00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:57,830
rent or will not process the javascript

00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:01,700
file meaning if somebody if the CDN

00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:05,659
losses of somebody is able to push into

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:08,080
new JavaScript files into the CDN using

00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:11,630
this at the attribute you will be safe

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,460
so that nobody can create phishing pages

00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,980
or what I want you're on your

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:20,179
infrastructure

00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:22,870
patchy JavaScript libraries one nice

00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:26,240
tool is this chrome lighthouse

00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:30,049
application it's a general tool that

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,899
will also check your pages performance

00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:37,990
but it will also highlight if you if you

00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:37,990
use libraries that are out of date

00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:48,140
yeah so the last three things that we

00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:56,480
came up with were understand the same

00:25:48,140 --> 00:26:00,020
origin policy meaning the data will not

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:03,549
be downloaded from another domain if

00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:06,049
your data like HTML files or JSON files

00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:08,120
the browser will not download from

00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:09,770
another domain but if you have Travis

00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,210
script files you can download them from

00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:17,059
other domains too that means you don't

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:19,740
ever put any secrets in your Travis

00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:22,520
script files and to be more general

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:26,780
also don't travel script files usually

00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:30,020
should be just static files and no

00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:33,120
dynamic rendering in your travel script

00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:38,190
content security policy is also nice new

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:41,130
feature most newer browsers yeah

00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:46,620
having have baked in by now so learn

00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:53,190
about that you can just restrict more on

00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:55,710
what the site is allowed to do and the

00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:59,550
last point is if you're working with

00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:02,340
some back-end developer is I'm more from

00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:06,510
the backhand side usually there is this

00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:08,250
huge or if you have a front-end team in

00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:11,100
the back-end team usually the front-end

00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:15,809
team develops a lot of nice new features

00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:18,090
and demands a lot of queries from the

00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:22,140
backend and the easiest way will be just

00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:28,230
open up everything and let the front-end

00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:31,320
people create ya create cool new

00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:33,990
functionality but this also of course

00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,880
opens a lot of security issues so be

00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,860
sure to talk to your back-end team if

00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,410
you have one dedicated Pakatan team

00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:43,080
about the functionality you don't need

00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:48,780
anymore so they can just strip down the

00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:53,160
deprecated once again ok yeah for

00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:58,050
completeness there is those two articles

00:27:53,160 --> 00:28:01,620
and and yeah tips

00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:04,170
another links about security what you

00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:06,270
can work on where you can get more ideas

00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:10,150
what to improve and the link to the

00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:14,099
video yeah that's it thanks

00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:14,099
