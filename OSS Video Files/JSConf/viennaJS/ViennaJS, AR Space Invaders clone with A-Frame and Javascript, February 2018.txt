hi everybody my name is Vlad my talk is

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,550
gonna be in many ways very opposite to

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,490
what you've just heard so none of the

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,290
mine facts stuff this is gonna be very

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,780
easy maybe taking you a little bit back

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,970
in time

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:22,880
basically my talk is about how easy it

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:27,180
is to use a frame which is a web VR

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,580
framework and you know get started very

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,420
quickly with with the web RIA what we

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,399
are I've started this project with with

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,660
a friend Marco Bogdanovich he's

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,190
unfortunately not here he's the true

00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:49,309
mastermind behind this it was his idea

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:53,160
and he he has the most experience right

00:00:49,309 --> 00:00:55,980
about me I'm on a day 59 of the first

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,820
round of 100 days of code so if I say

00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,890
anything stupid

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,730
maybe somebody can explain to me why

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:06,990
everybody's laughing afterwards Marco

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,820
has quite a bit more experience I'm just

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,270
gonna get right into it so the project

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,840
was started doing a hackathon the

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,860
coderdojo hackathon which had as a as a

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,159
target

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,500
you know kids they organize courses for

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,220
children and they try to get kids

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,200
between 8 and 17 I believe to to start

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,100
coding to learn how to code through

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,799
different projects they use also some

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,840
hardware I forgot I think it's a micro

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,750
bit that they use yeah I know and that's

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,479
also coded through JavaScript and

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,759
basically for this hackathon we were all

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,079
supposed to come up with anything that

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:51,450
would help the kids you know get

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:57,090
interested in coding learn coding and so

00:01:51,450 --> 00:02:01,530
on and so forth we we basically used a

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:06,329
frame which I'm gonna show actually who

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:08,369
is familiar with a frame all right so

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,270
this this this will be interesting for

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,270
some of you

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:21,330
a frame is a framework which builds on

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:25,739
top of 3j s and it allows web we are to

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:31,650
be implemented with the help of HTML

00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:33,599
tags basically let's see so this is a

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:38,430
very simple this is more or less the

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:42,030
hello world of a frame a frame and it

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,310
would look if if you look at the

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:50,340
components you have some some very

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:52,440
simple geometric items and a plane and a

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,380
sky and it would

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,590
it has great also some great

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,870
documentation and if you look at what we

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,900
the code that we've just looked at kind

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:07,670
of looks like this somebody can look

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:12,599
around can move around in the scene and

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:15,599
from a very basic example like this one

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:20,280
can go further into something that looks

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:23,190
a little bit like this like this of

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,440
course if you have a Google cardboard or

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,750
any other type of device that helps you

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,160
connect your cell phone well to your

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:37,049
head if you will you can activate the VR

00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:44,970
capability through this and yeah alright

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:46,109
so we we use this in order to develop a

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,799
very small game

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:51,870
I'm thinking maybe everybody can just

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,900
whip up their whip out their cell phone

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,739
and type this website in and have a look

00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,209
at it directly

00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:05,099
I think that's easiest that's the

00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:09,150
easiest thing to do you're gonna find

00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:10,230
yourself in space well not a nun in

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:16,730
space you're going to find yourself in

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:16,730
this room actually with

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:25,630
right with some okay here we go yeah I'm

00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:30,130
hearing already some successful logins

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:32,889
and if you move your your cat your phone

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:35,620
around you should be able to pan the

00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:40,539
camera and see some agents at some point

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:44,770
some alien looking objects and if you

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:47,530
point the cursor you're going to be able

00:04:44,770 --> 00:05:11,970
to shoot them as well they come from

00:04:47,530 --> 00:05:21,610
every direction right yes of course it's

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:23,590
early alpha right so I'm just gonna I'm

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,900
just gonna talk a little bit about how

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:31,900
this scene is created so you've already

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:34,479
seen that the the the everything is

00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:38,139
based on HTML and every entity in this

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,300
scene is is an HTML tag the background

00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:48,720
for example the sky that you see here is

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:48,720
is a simple a certain kind of picture

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:54,780
I'm gonna go yeah so the code would look

00:05:51,849 --> 00:06:00,070
a little bit like this a frame requires

00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:03,010
loading at the beginning and everything

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,810
else has to go into an a scene tag then

00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:07,300
you have your assets in this case we

00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:09,880
have the enemy models you have a camera

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,400
you have a cursor all the entities which

00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:16,330
can take any shape or form you have

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,880
sounds and basically that that these

00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:21,639
would be the resources now if you look

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,409
at how we manipulate everything else is

00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:28,210
basically JavaScript manipulating these

00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:29,289
these HTML tags around the only part

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,719
that I had a

00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:35,800
major role in it was was this file which

00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:41,919
which generates the the enemies if you

00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:45,909
look at this you see calls to HTML tags

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:54,180
and afterwards a type attribute setting

00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:54,180
oh yes sorry actually I'm just gonna

00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:08,050
write and once the entities are are

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,509
available on screen one can add

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:14,529
animation to them all sorts of

00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:20,020
properties rotation animation and so on

00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:23,979
and so forth the the problems that we

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:27,879
ran in one once we started getting past

00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:29,919
the very basic elements were for one the

00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:31,930
model we wanted to use something a

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,240
little bit more advanced than what a

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:37,569
frame was offering us in terms of object

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,370
so a frame has of course cubes spheres

00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:41,469
and so on and so forth

00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:44,499
we wanted to use something that looks a

00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:47,620
little bit more advanced and so we found

00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:49,269
a model online and very quickly we

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,399
discovered that trying to shoot them

00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:55,659
doesn't work the way it works with a

00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:58,029
frame provided object because I think

00:07:55,659 --> 00:08:00,009
the model probably the a frame doesn't

00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:02,439
have an understanding of that of that

00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,869
model that we imported we found it has

00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:09,039
one Achilles heel where it did register

00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:11,139
the mouse over but that was unplayable

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:16,800
so Marco came up with a very interesting

00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:20,199
solution in my creative solution he he

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:27,479
added no it's actually here he added an

00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:27,479
invisible a frame object to the to the

00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:32,979
enemy to the enemies so which which he

00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,139
created which basically the opacity the

00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:37,329
heat turned down the opacity but they're

00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:41,000
always there and so they can respond to

00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:44,600
the to the mouse over of the

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,610
of the cursor that would be one problem

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,569
that we so we we kind of hacked around

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:53,149
then another problem that we found was

00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:55,069
the fact that we wanted to have some

00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:57,620
kind of a function which decreases the

00:08:55,069 --> 00:09:01,339
player's life if the object get too

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:04,310
close if the enemies get too close we

00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:07,339
however discovered that a frame creates

00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:09,709
the the scene like a big bank so

00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:12,949
everything that would eventually be in

00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:17,029
the scene starts it you know coordinates

00:09:12,949 --> 00:09:18,589
0 0 0 because the player is at 0 0 0 the

00:09:17,029 --> 00:09:20,509
game would start with the player getting

00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:24,589
damaged immediately

00:09:20,509 --> 00:09:30,019
so again Marco came up with a hack where

00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:32,990
he said check so during this explosion

00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:35,149
when when the object got past a certain

00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,129
point they would activate the check and

00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:39,889
Wednesday the game actually started and

00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:43,670
they started getting closer going past

00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:47,000
that check would enable the the the

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:50,480
enemies to to hurt the player and that

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,930
looks a little bit like this a frame has

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,610
a this model of component which which

00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:59,269
which are a type of function which can

00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:02,569
be added to the entities and they can

00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:08,569
modify the behavior of the entities and

00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:12,529
so on and so forth then let's see one

00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:13,970
last problem one one one thing that we

00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,589
wanted to do which is what you've just

00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:18,199
experienced was the camera input we

00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:22,759
wanted to fake an augmented reality

00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:25,430
experience and just simply instead of

00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:27,649
instead of the background which you see

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,439
here and it's which is you know it's

00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:35,930
it's fixed we wanted to have the camera

00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:41,300
feed as the background and so so we

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:49,339
managed to make a call for that and it

00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:52,220
looks a little bit like this this is 99

00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:54,350
percent Marcos work so I'm just going to

00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,060
show it and and avoid a

00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,250
planing trying to explain it because I

00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:05,920
don't understand most of it as you can

00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:09,860
actually see here right

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,980
so that would be there will be it for

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,630
for the things that we ran into as you

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,070
probably know when when you start a

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,290
project and you don't have some kind of

00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:21,380
deadline and an exact thing that you

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,330
have to achieve you start to think oh

00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,730
how great would it be if we could add

00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:27,500
this and this and that so we would like

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,450
to implement some levels yes some

00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,550
difficulty levels and and also like a

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:34,910
form of storyline where the aliens start

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:43,340
in space then they they end up in in

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:46,730
basically a a city they okay master

00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:51,110
password alright yeah this I guess I can

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:52,850
do it like this to show that it's very

00:11:51,110 --> 00:12:00,080
easy to for example to change the

00:11:52,850 --> 00:12:01,820
background let's see if there worked yes

00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,550
so basically we're from space we've

00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:08,390
ended up in in on earth because they've

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,950
advanced and now they're attacking here

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,990
