Description: 
	Talk By Francesco Strazzullo:

I think that right now as JavaScript developers we are in one of the most lively communities out there. We have a lot of power with React, Angular, Vue and so on. So how should we choose the right framework for our new shining project? And what does it mean to choose a framework “in a right way”?

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,250
welcome to this talk called framework

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,899
compass chart why the fancy name the

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,210
fancy name is because primal compass

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:12,570
chart is a tool that we use in our

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,330
company to help team to choose other

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,949
tools okay so it's kind of a meta tool

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:24,019
okay and this tool will not have any

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:26,550
kind of code so it's quite hard to me to

00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:28,949
explain these things because usually I

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,349
use code to explain things that code you

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,540
know it's easy you will read the code

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,260
you should understand it without my

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,530
words so it's quite hard for me but it's

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,320
a talk without code I think it's a quite

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:48,300
important topic for the JavaScript

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,969
community why is that do you ever ask

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,670
this question do you feel the jasc of

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,250
fatigue you know JavaScript fatigue is

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,879
is when you know you start learning

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,100
angular and then they say no react it's

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,989
a good thing stats that you start

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,750
student react and they save you is in

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,729
you think okay you start using webpack

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,030
and they say parcel is the new thing and

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:15,210
so on okay that's the expression called

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,970
JavaScript fatigue it's it's born from a

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,360
post from which two years ago I think or

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,939
something like that but I don't think

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:29,610
that it's a really a problem I see that

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:33,750
more like sorry more like a Faton

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:37,259
opportunity and really really enjoy to

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,430
do study new things to understand why a

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,060
framework at six

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,049
why redux has been invented why react

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,119
has been invented

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:46,979
behind every framework there is some

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,420
kind of decisions and I want to

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:54,649
understand what are the real meaning of

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:58,590
that tool but we are in any opportunity

00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:58,979
there is a challenge it's always like

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,170
that

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,750
if you see an opportunity because you

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,670
see as a challenge and what is the

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,879
challenge in this case it should choose

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,780
the right framework okay I should choose

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,349
web park parcel why you should use react

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:20,180
angular and so on

00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:21,950
but it's this Doria challenge you have

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,840
to choose the right framework to solve a

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,459
problem I don't think that this is the

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,829
real challenge because there is no real

00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:29,389
solution to this problem I don't think

00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:31,489
that your project will fail if you

00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:35,090
choose angular of if you choose react

00:02:31,489 --> 00:02:38,680
okay it's not the point the point is to

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:41,540
choose a good framework in a right way

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,389
the point is not just in the solution

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,370
but in the process to that solution what

00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:52,069
I'm saying is that to choose a framework

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:53,989
is a decision making problem okay so

00:02:52,069 --> 00:02:56,269
we're not talking about actual code but

00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:57,760
we are talking about the decision that

00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:01,459
we make

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,959
before starting : because usually our

00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:08,719
first commit is npm install react but we

00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:12,230
I that comment there is a lot of finger

00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:16,579
behind your team talk about it usually

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:18,409
or at last at least I hope the last code

00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:20,030
the last consultancy that I have when I

00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:23,209
asked to the team

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,829
why issues react because they have a lot

00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,840
of performance problem because they

00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:30,189
didn't know react at all

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:33,819
so I asked why you choose it because you

00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:38,060
it's obvious that you don't know it and

00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:42,349
they said but our boss tell us to use

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:47,030
react and I said ok fine it's your boss

00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:49,340
and developer no ok ok we have a problem

00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,659
then yes it's but it's not the code

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:53,959
probability and another kind of problem

00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:57,829
so go on but ok but you understand that

00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,870
is a decision problem write down so the

00:03:57,829 --> 00:04:02,650
point is what kind of problem is to

00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:06,469
choose a framework ok

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:10,219
before answering this question let's try

00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:12,979
to understand how can we how can I say

00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:16,070
categorize problems the first category

00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:19,579
is the simple cystic problems there is

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:22,430
only one answer who is the President of

00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:25,990
the United States there is only one

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,690
answer and it's quite easy to answer ok

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,900
then we have the

00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:34,350
deterministic problem we have one answer

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:37,770
possible but unit you need analysis of a

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:42,270
formula to answer it and as example is

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:44,310
the area of the circle it's easy but you

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,990
need to know the formula without

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:49,650
analysis or without the formula you

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:54,120
can't answer this problem okay let's go

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:56,820
over random problems different answer

00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,000
are possible but the option can all be

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:03,720
identified for example which of the

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,730
candidates will win directions okay you

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,780
understand how we are getting harder and

00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:12,120
under problems now right now we know

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,100
which are the candidates so we know the

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:19,770
possible solutions but who will win the

00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:22,950
elections no no one probably put a coin

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,870
on Trump and the wins so understand it's

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,390
quite enough problem to understand at

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,990
last the most difficult problem in

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:33,390
determinate different answer but they

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,970
are too complicated to list so we don't

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:38,610
even know all the possible answer for

00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:42,050
example how will internet affect our

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:44,790
retail sales over the next five years

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,100
there are probably a million of

00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:49,950
solutions of this problem and we can't

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,430
even understand how much solution

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,950
how many solution we have on the table

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:59,670
and there is a quite an interesting

00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,440
thing if you put simple cystic

00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,890
deterministic around the Mediterranean

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,490
in the terminate in a row you see that

00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:10,980
the role of data it's important for

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,750
simplistic and deterministic and the

00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,420
goal of judgment is not important in

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:18,570
this case why because you don't need

00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:21,450
judgment to say what is the area of the

00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:24,000
circle in order need any kind of you

00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,800
know I think that the Ragged of circle

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,050
is this or I think that the area the

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,200
second is one no it's a formula so there

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:34,440
is no judgment in a formula but when you

00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:38,160
go to Rondo on the terminate the two

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:41,629
factor will invert so when you have a

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,389
random problem and and you have

00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:48,479
this situation so you have a mix of

00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:49,740
judgment and data in the importance this

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,780
is quite interesting because if you

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,810
think at the election you is just not

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:58,409
about data it's also about about how we

00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:00,360
interpret the data and when you go to in

00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:02,550
determinate process the things

00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,409
completely flip because you don't have

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:09,030
enough data to understand all the

00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:11,189
possible solution fortunately it's not

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,280
an indeterminate problem to choose a

00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:16,620
framework it's a random problem so at

00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,349
least we have all the possible solutions

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,349
on a table okay in the java skill

00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:27,300
community we have a lot of options but

00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:29,969
we can list them all okay okay so we

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:35,009
know that that choose a framework is a

00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:39,539
mix of data and judgment but the point

00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:41,520
is what the data do we need if you need

00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:46,319
to choose a framework what data we will

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:51,419
keep in consideration I we about

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:55,979
it a lot in our team and usually we you

00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:59,339
know we concentrate on what the software

00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:01,650
has to do okay we usually use user

00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:03,690
stories so we think ok the user should I

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:07,199
want as a user I want to log in as a

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:10,020
user want to do that and so on but the

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,990
point is there is something more

00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:15,180
important in my opinion to understand

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,389
how to choose a framework and there are

00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:21,120
the non-functional requirements what is

00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:23,610
non-functional requirement if the

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,830
functional requirement is something that

00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:32,190
describes what a software should do as a

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:35,519
user I want to login its what a software

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:38,760
has to do non-functional requirement is

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,310
something it's this is just a non

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,019
comprehensive list

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:46,160
do you have response in apps you have

00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:50,610
some your sustainability testability

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:54,089
transparency usability these things that

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,030
in the in England are also called elite

00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:58,090
ease

00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:00,670
you know to not say non-functional

00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:04,540
requirement all the time these things

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:06,780
describe how a software should work you

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,280
understand that is a very very hidden

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:12,280
specification sometimes because if I say

00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:15,970
to you I use as a user I want to login

00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:21,190
and let us say as a user I want to login

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:23,170
in less than 50 milliseconds in a sense

00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:27,460
that is a completely different approach

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:30,430
to the problem the point is that usually

00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:35,500
when you talk with a client you never

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:37,570
use any of these words because the

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,910
client doesn't know about performance

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:44,320
doesn't know about usability most of the

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:46,750
time so if it comes the tool the

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,480
framework compass chart the femoral

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:53,410
compass chart is a tool to add that

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,780
helps you to visualize the most

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:59,490
important non-functional requirement of

00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:02,800
your project how it works

00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:05,530
take your team I mean the tech team and

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,920
also the stakeholder also uux design of

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:11,890
a UI designer the clients the QA

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:15,250
everyone in the your team put everyone

00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:17,410
in a room and try to decide the five

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:20,770
most important non-functional

00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,750
requirement from that list okay that

00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:27,340
list is not comprehensive but you can

00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:29,830
find a list of Wikipedia or in some book

00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:31,420
you can find a very very complete list

00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:35,700
of non-functional requirement right

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:40,950
there are at least I think 100 okay so

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:43,840
try to make your team to choose five

00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,750
important non-functional requirement I

00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,720
put them on the chart this is this is

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:52,690
real data that I have done with a client

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,080
some of the room so that we decided that

00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:59,920
testability evolvability performances

00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,470
community and velocity and the five most

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,150
important thing that we need to keep in

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,420
consideration when deciding the next

00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,300
framework for their project by the way

00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:13,370
they choose

00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:15,590
okay so okay now you have to fill the

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:19,160
chart this is a very very funny part

00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:20,600
usually because the tech team and the

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,120
you know the project manager they have

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,390
completely different approach to fill

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,180
the chart okay what I usually do is

00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:33,050
something like planning poker okay I

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:38,000
everyone just states a number one to

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:40,880
five and and then I let people talk the

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,610
most the most high point and the lower

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,610
point okay until they all agree on a

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:49,190
number this thing could last an hour I

00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:52,430
would say that okay it's not an easy and

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:54,500
easy thing to facilitate but it's very

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:59,780
very important at last we have something

00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:02,210
like that you know there is no rule when

00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:05,150
you fill the chart there is not you know

00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:08,540
you don't have a maximum amount of

00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:11,870
points okay but you know if you put five

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,850
on every corner you are asking for the

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:15,710
perfect framework and the perfect

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:18,500
framework does not take six so what I

00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:22,340
suggest when I ALP team do that is if

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:25,280
you put a to 401 five probably you

00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,890
should put a one or a two because if you

00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:31,490
want evolvability you should sacrifice

00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:33,470
something else all you are looking for a

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,780
perfect solution that doesn't does not

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:39,410
take six so this tool is quite not

00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:42,320
useful so you have this situation and

00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:44,890
and what you have to do with that this

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,340
is the why this is called compass chart

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:51,350
because your attack team you should

00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:55,160
leave this chart as a compost when

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:57,860
choosing the framework what I mean is we

00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:01,400
don't have for example take the example

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,260
if someone says I will prefer react

00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:06,020
because it's more performant than

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,450
angular I don't even I don't even know

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:11,360
if it's true or not but the point is

00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:14,240
when ice when I hear this thing I say

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,700
it's not important let's talk about

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,820
evolvability

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:21,320
is angular better they react when we

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,630
talk about about mobility of the

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,250
software

00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:28,160
because because we said that is a quite

00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:31,940
important point who has the better

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:36,440
community angry react of course they are

00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:39,620
not exactly you know truth their opinion

00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:44,320
but you are guiding the opinion on the

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,320
important things about your project okay

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:52,430
can you can I answer later okay okay the

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:55,340
talk is finished this is kind of

00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:57,620
references you have two books about

00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:02,600
decision-making you have a post on

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:04,580
medium about these you know this tool

00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,270
the type wrote some time ago and we also

00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:10,490
have a very very nice video of a girl

00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:12,080
called Guillen from Belgium let's talk

00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:15,290
about the decision making it software

00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,450
this is very very interesting before I

00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:21,170
quit where I one less thing that I want

00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:23,060
to give you it's a news this is a first

00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:26,750
the first time that I talked about this

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,580
thing outside of Italy and it's the

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,410
framework last movement that is a

00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,960
movement of people the tie we are

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:36,320
creating right now with my colleagues

00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:39,910
and also other people around Europe and

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,800
it's a group of people interested in

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,430
working with our frameworks how it takes

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,170
to create a completely framed class

00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:50,720
rendering engine today for example and

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,340
also in how to decide the right

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,990
framework for the right project even

00:14:52,340 --> 00:15:03,350
it's a it's a movement that talk about

00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:05,900
framework without the you know the truth

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,970
that is you should always use a

00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:12,470
framework we keep a new framework option

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:15,020
in mind every time I am Francesco

00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:17,480
Scavullo come from Italy I work for

00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,600
extra logic a remote company in Italy

00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,780
about and we are a very very vertical

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,270
front-end development agency you can

00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,220
find all this is on my contacts you can

00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:31,550
