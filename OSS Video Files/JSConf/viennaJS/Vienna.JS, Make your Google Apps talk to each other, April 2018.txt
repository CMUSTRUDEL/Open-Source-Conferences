Title: Vienna.JS, Make your Google Apps talk to each other, April 2018
Publication date: 2018-04-26
Playlist: viennaJS
Description: 
	By Diana Vysoka:
I am sure that you use Google Sheets to organize your data and that you are familiar with the built-in functions, too. Just imagine a huge sheet with hundreds of columns and rows. Now try to edit them, analyze and send particular information via Gmail, find addresses in Google Maps and create hundreds of events in Google Calendar, all based on the information from the sheet. Does not sound that easy anymore, does it? When it comes to advanced tasks, the built-in functions might not be sufficient and too much of manual activity might be needed. Not an ideal scenario for us, developers. Thanks god, there is another and more powerful way to process and edit the data using JavaScript. Let me show you how to solve all of these problems using this beautiful language in your Google Apps! This session contains a lot of good information in slides as well as live coding.

hello everyone I'm very excited to be

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:05,879
here today because this is my very first

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,440
talk so please don't throw this Russia

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,740
left on me if you don't like the talk

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,450
but anyways I hope you will I'm here

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,230
today to talk about how to make the

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:19,770
google apps talk to each other I studied

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,539
computer science at the toe and I'm also

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,369
a Google developer group organizer in

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,070
this instance Lakia and that's how I

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,230
basically got to make this talk because

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,890
I had to face some problems I'm going to

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,450
talk about them later and I also work at

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,380
we're developers and I support the

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:40,500
program team so what's the story behind

00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:43,050
as a GDG organizer in eastern slovakia I

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,750
run some meetups and also we organize

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:49,649
conferences and while I was doing that

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,910
I'm the only women in the team so who

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:53,640
would else do a communication with

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,649
partners and speakers it was me and I

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,840
had to ride like a million of email

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,390
sending reminders scheduling the talks

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,399
asking for configuration then again

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,229
sending reminders and waiting for

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,600
confirmation and there was something

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,880
that just dream has driven me crazy and

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,860
that was me I looked exactly like that I

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,500
hated to do this and I was questioning

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,020
myself okay well we are GDG we are a

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,759
nonprofit organization we can't really

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,850
afford to have some speakers management

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,409
tool and I told my colleagues hey guys I

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,299
really can't work like that we I have

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,740
million other tasks to do which are more

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,380
important than this and this is just

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,110
like very very time-consuming and my

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,110
colleague was like what if I told you

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,479
you can do it yourself how can I develop

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,790
a speaker management tool in one week we

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,119
need it urgently and he looks me like

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,490
that

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,250
well you never heard of Google Apps

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,899
scripts so Google Apps Script is a

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,990
technology I would like to talk about

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:52,320
today and these Google Apps app scripts

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,119
are based on a JavaScript concrete with

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,530
JavaScript 6 and they have some features

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,090
of JavaScript 7 and JavaScript 8 as well

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,890
so first I would like to ask you how

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,189
many of you are using g-suit apps or

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:07,649
google apps racer ends up everyone

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:12,540
very cool how many of you have heard of

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:15,090
Google Apps scripts yes ok

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,709
if you feel like everything and things

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:20,819
talking about something which is not

00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:25,140
true just step in or you know feel free

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:28,799
to do to step in okay so first I would

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,690
like to invite you to follow this link

00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:33,360
or scan this code in order to make this

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,310
session more interactive because I would

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,659
like to make a roleplay with you that

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,790
you're gonna be the speakers applying

00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:42,150
for my conference and I'm the organizer

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,010
who checks the top proposals and decide

00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:49,650
what talk is going to be accepted and

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:51,510
which not so this is very short just you

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,760
don't have to think of like a real title

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,459
of the talks of course just put themself

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,980
but there's some random string or just

00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,900
like talk your health before or you know

00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,389
just just so you you really get the

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:07,709
feeling about this technology and also

00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:09,540
please in email address I would like to

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:11,459
ask you to feel everything in lowercase

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,739
because otherwise it's not gonna work I

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,870
found out like half an hour before they

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:19,470
started because I was always putting

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,540
inside like the rights and also the last

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,459
field is your mother tongue please fill

00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,709
this in because there is gonna be very

00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:29,730
cool feature regarding the this this

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:31,799
this language I'll give you a couple of

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:36,720
seconds a couple of minutes to to fill

00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:38,280
this in okay so I will start now so from

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,799
this Google Form we are getting all the

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,799
information to this Google sheet and

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,970
this is going to be our database and we

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,829
are going to execute the Correll

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:54,840
operations over it so first of all I

00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:55,919
would like to go through the agenda so I

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,340
will show you how to set up the

00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:02,099
environment I will show you how to code

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,230
your own menus your customized menus and

00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,540
also I will show you how to set the

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,190
triggers which are executed which are

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,810
then like calling the the functions you

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,879
have there I'll also show you how to

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,010
send the emails from Google spreadsheet

00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,229
how to connect it with for the document

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,989
how to translate the content then I will

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:20,760
show you a little bit of advanced HTML

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:24,900
service and in the end we will send the

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,310
calendar invitation for your talk so the

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,870
first thing I would like to show you

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,460
so how do you think this Google

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:37,340
spreadsheet is going to be stored in

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:40,010
JavaScript no not in this case this in

00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:44,669
into the array to that diamond jewellery

00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:46,050
so how do you set your environment we

00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:50,400
have two choices you go to

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:52,889
script.google.com where you have other

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:58,169
projects you create a new script in my

00:04:52,889 --> 00:05:00,480
case it's already this one or you go to

00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:06,630
tools here you have the script editor

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:09,660
and in this case this script editor will

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:12,240
have a special relationship to your to

00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,150
your to your spreadsheet and in this

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,160
case you have to think of two of one

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,500
thing and that's when you want to create

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,720
a special menu here you see that's my

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:26,160
menu I created this this manual show the

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,560
cotan this must be the bounce a version

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,960
of the script so it has to be created

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,910
from the toe and script editor or not as

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,770
a standalone so that's the only thing

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:40,800
here then the other thing is that there

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,630
are these triggers there are four types

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,080
of triggers it's on open on edit

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:49,050
do get and do post this function for

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,450
example is called whenever the script

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,430
whenever the spreadsheet is opened so

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,169
basically I open the spreadsheet and in

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,560
a little case there should be this

00:05:55,169 --> 00:06:02,669
manage speakers automatically in this

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,460
open app open I'm creating a new menu

00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:07,800
which is called manage speakers at item

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:12,270
which is reject and it calls this

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:16,350
function reject speakers about this here

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:18,360
I will talk a little bit later or I can

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,520
talk about it now so basically there is

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,740
a nice work around when you want to call

00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,760
some functions from the from the

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:30,210
spreadsheet from its menu which is

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,750
basically written in the in the bound

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:39,110
script editor in the bound script and

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:44,310
that you basically saved

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:45,840
the standalone script as a wait I'll

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,760
show you like you go to project

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,700
properties and here you have the project

00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,970
key you'll send save this project key

00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:57,480
and set it as a library of your bound

00:06:53,970 --> 00:07:00,720
script which is here you only add the

00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,090
the key here and that's hidden you're

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,770
allowed to call the functions like this

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:12,960
from some other script so finally I got

00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:14,700
my talks Wow quite a lot amazing and now

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,440
I would like to let you know that I got

00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:19,800
your talks I really appreciate your time

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:24,150
you put into the filling this form and I

00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,900
will send you an email to do so so I saw

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,810
the function

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,810
I say confirm proposal received

00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:51,000
who got an email raise your hand up it

00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:59,400
works so great now we see here that the

00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:01,740
flag is set to us in our function we

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,620
have yes so here is the function country

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,940
proposal I'm building the string the

00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,280
message I would like to send you

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:13,770
I just iterate through with the first

00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:16,590
light for life through the dock through

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:20,700
the dock I take every row and here I

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:23,040
save my cell where I have the

00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,350
information if the if the email is

00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:30,330
already sent so this confirmation is

00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:32,040
sent cell is this variable here and in

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,760
case this confirmation is sent already

00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:37,740
then just continue do not send email

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,320
again so I'm getting the recipient

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:44,400
recipient first name message greeting

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:47,070
and here I just added like the Google

00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:51,540
developer group team and now comes the

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:55,110
most important part I use mail app which

00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:57,120
enables me to send the email and forget

00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,780
I only need recipient this is the

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,060
subject and is the message so that easy

00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,280
it is and at the end when everything is

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,750
fine I will just set the flag to yes so

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,140
I don't bother people with the same

00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:12,240
email like 50 times and the super thing

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,660
here is which I forgot about to say is

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,900
the triggers you can have two types of

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,700
triggers so this one was in my other in

00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,680
my bound script so on open so

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:27,870
immediately when this sheet is opened

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:30,000
you will also call this on open function

00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:35,060
and the second way how to set the

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,430
triggers is to go to edit other triggers

00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:41,250
add new triggers and come for proposal

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,980
received for example so you you choose

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:47,760
here which function would you like to

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:50,220
trigger with this this thing you can say

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,600
okay this should be time driven and you

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,000
can also choose like how

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,480
often should this function be cold so I

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,610
say I would like to have it every minute

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,860
now because I think that probably my

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,519
some thoughts might come so I'll just

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,410
save it I'm not gonna send it again I

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,389
think do you want me to send it to see

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:12,209
how it works probably I'll just do it

00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:14,069
some of you and then one minute you will

00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:17,250
get the email again so I don't spend

00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:20,130
spam all of you so this was the first

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:23,220
use case sending confirmation email now

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,949
I have the Google spreadsheet and I have

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,680
the top descriptions here and in usual

00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:31,470
case you get the top descriptions long

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,860
around 600 words so it's not very usable

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:38,040
to read it here and to decide about

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:40,949
talks here so what can we do does anyone

00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,630
have an idea how can we take this

00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:44,880
information and put it to some Google

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:46,019
document and also we don't want to have

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,399
the first name and last name of the

00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:51,480
speaker because we want to be really

00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:54,839
objective when we choose the talks there

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,399
is now a nice way how to do this and I

00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,310
will first show you how it works so I

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:04,319
have the empty evaluation doc here which

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:08,329
is in my drive now I will call the

00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:12,540
function feel evaluation doc I run it

00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:16,529
running running running and here we go

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:19,589
we have it all filled we have around 21

00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:21,420
speakers here and now we can read

00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:28,579
through it and decide who is the best

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:35,600
one so let me decide let's say that I

00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:40,470
will first reject everyone okay I

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,660
rejected you and now I will say sorry

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,000
guys like there is a very high

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,470
competition we couldn't take all of you

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,230
we couldn't accept all of you

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,230
so reject

00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:09,899
did anyone get an email because I got

00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,899
okay

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,970
okay so now I have a problem let's fix

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,920
it so translation between the given

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:30,160
language is not currently supported okay

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:38,740
that means that some of you didn't

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:41,970
fulfil the criteria great now it should

00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,970
work so let's try again

00:12:52,550 --> 00:13:02,040
I'm not sure but it's not language guys

00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:18,079
it's okay I'll have to think of another

00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:19,709
way how to make people feel this okay

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,690
let's try again

00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:28,139
you know like first or question to go

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:30,380
everything well you know like I'll just

00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,380
keep it

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,850
sorry

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,220
you received yeah all these people

00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:41,699
before you received but here then there

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:44,100
is apparently some problem and email

00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:51,089
can't be sent and this English I think

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:53,990
that the email is kind of not it's your

00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:57,720
email hmm okay

00:13:53,990 --> 00:14:11,390
and did you did the rest of you get the

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:11,390
email is sorry I'll just make it German

00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:21,819
well okay for now it doesn't work it's

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:25,839
interesting because it's always worked

00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:39,040
so far so what is written in the email

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:40,269
you got the rejection yes it's exactly

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,430
this what I need yeah

00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:48,040
and then there is a special line can you

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:51,879
please read it aloud and is it in

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,560
English okay because you did anyone else

00:14:51,879 --> 00:15:01,689
has the mother tongue something else

00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:07,060
except for English yeah exactly

00:15:01,689 --> 00:15:11,079
so what happens I rejected the speaker I

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:13,779
again went through the world doc I got

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:16,990
my problem but the most important thing

00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:19,779
here is this single single line here I

00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:22,689
use the language app which enables me to

00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:24,970
translate something to from from English

00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:26,680
or my source language to the target

00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,079
language with language which is your

00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,420
mother tongue which is set in the Google

00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:33,339
Doc isn't powerful when you want to

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,050
reject a speaker he will be very upset

00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:37,269
and at least you can like you know make

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:41,019
him feel better with some very

00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:44,589
personalized message and again then you

00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:47,380
will just set this decision is yes so

00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:51,939
you don't bother again well now I would

00:15:47,380 --> 00:16:00,149
like to accept all of you let's try it

00:15:51,939 --> 00:16:00,149
out this is gonna be No

00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:11,580
and yeah let's try it

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:14,450
accept speakers let's check the flag

00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,450
okay

00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:37,850
okay so some of you again didn't get the

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:43,490
email interesting yeah I think that the

00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:49,550
problem here is because I just got an

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:55,670
email that this email here is not so

00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:58,090
let's try it like this probably that's

00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,090
the problem

00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:15,630
okay so who got the email okay can you

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:19,410
please read what's inside okay so there

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:22,890
is like dear someone you're accepted and

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:26,730

count for sure and how did I do that is

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,580
it doesn't differ very much from the

00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:25,010
previous emails there is only one line

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:27,480
which says generate URL i parse here the

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:29,429

link and this gallery direct you to my

00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:07,920
web app here is how it looks like so

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,809
here is the do get trigger I was talking

00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,580
about in the beginning so as soon as you

00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:14,160
click on this link this doget function

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,550
will be executed I'm getting all the

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,090
parameters I'm getting the

00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:22,690
and the number of the speaker here I

00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:26,410
will need this cash for later on so I

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:29,680
will just keep it for now and here I

00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,900
just check if name is if expected name

00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:35,110
so from this from this parameter is not

00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,850
the name as the name in the sheet then

00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:41,020
just throw some problem could not load

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:45,430
the data sorry in case in my sheet this

00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:46,780
memorandum is already signed then say

00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,490
thank you very much the memorandum is

00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,710
already signed so the ones who got the

00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:55,320
email you can click on it again and you

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,320
will get this page so I just see here

00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:07,690
sign a memorandum refresh thank you the

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:09,670
memorandum is already signed ok so the

00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,740
next step is what happens if the

00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,590
memorandum is not signed yet I'll just

00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:19,300
create a new object speaker push it to

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:21,130
my array and then templating team

00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:25,240
fighting is very cool Fink which enables

00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:28,410
you to have your your HTML file for

00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:33,280
example demo confirm attendance

00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:35,800
connected to your web app with HTML

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,350
service service where you use the method

00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:41,800
create template from file and then just

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:44,470
set an object to your template and then

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:48,000
it is important to say that this to get

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:51,910
method it must return and HTML output

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,460
this is what I have here is not an HTML

00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:58,680
output but with this method evaluate he

00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:04,810
is going to return the HTML output and

00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:07,990
what happens in my in my HTML file is

00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:13,020
that I have basic HTML page but here on

00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:17,710
click I'm calling this clients servers

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:21,300
this function which calls them the own

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:26,020
open signed which is the the server

00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:28,350
function here and is executed exactly

00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:32,100
here so this function

00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:36,270
is responsible for updating the value in

00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:38,700
my spreadsheet and I said when you click

00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,830
on this link you are giving the

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,710
parameter but this parameter is needed

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:46,559
in order to update the spreadsheet so

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:51,330
therefore I have my cache here where I

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:53,429
just saved the number from here and then

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:56,490
I'll just just get it from from cache

00:21:53,429 --> 00:21:58,169
and can use it again so after all of

00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:01,320
these things are done

00:21:58,169 --> 00:22:05,580
I can finally send the calendar

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:10,080
invitation to my speakers which I do in

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:14,940
the following send invite to accepted

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:23,520
speakers just click and you guys should

00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:27,840
now get the calendar invitation for for

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:29,580
the talk so let's see yes because there

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:33,840
is a constraint that everything must be

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:36,020
yes we're and I want to call the

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,020
function

00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:50,029
so I can show you what I get here so I

00:22:46,459 --> 00:22:50,959
got this email staged a seven everything

00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:53,690
you need to know when you're developing

00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:56,659
Java Web Apps Tomcat ables SF spring

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:59,989
security and is exactly on the timeslot

00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:05,149
I chose so this is how it should look

00:22:59,989 --> 00:23:07,129
like and how do you do this is this

00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:09,559
special calendar up here where you get a

00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:11,509
default calendar and you just create an

00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:16,039
