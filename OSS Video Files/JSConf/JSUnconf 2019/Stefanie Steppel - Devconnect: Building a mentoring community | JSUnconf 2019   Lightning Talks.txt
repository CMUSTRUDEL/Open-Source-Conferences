hi my name is chef Ian I'm a software

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:14,580
developer and machine learning engineer

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,320
in the making and today I'd like to talk

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,670
to you about a passion project of mine

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,109
that has been sitting in the corner

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,539
around for two years and I'm really

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,760
excited because it's my baby and it's

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,099
called F connect and the idea behind it

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,470
is to create a mentoring community where

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:31,529
people can meet for hands-on mentoring

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,690
and coding on projects together but

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,100
before I dive deeper into this I quickly

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,960
want to answer a question and some of

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,280
you might have an s why mentoring and to

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,899
answer this question I first have to

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,780
quickly tell you about how I became a

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,760
software developer so my mom is actually

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,649
a software developer but she never

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,680
talked about her job at home so

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,949
naturally I never knew how what it was

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,020
like to make your living as a coder and

00:00:54,949 --> 00:00:59,940
so when I finished high school I went on

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,760
a backpacking trip to Southeast Asia for

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,619
six months where I met my partner and he

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,619
was actually the one after having long

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,210
talks with me who suggested that this

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,700
might be something that I could enjoy

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,479
and I thought you know why not try it

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,970
and what he did there for me was to

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:20,189
change my perspective on what I could do

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,409
with my life and I think that this is

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,390
actually the essence of mentoring for me

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,070
and you might think okay well but isn't

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,049
mentoring about like helping somebody

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,970
out or teaching something learning

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,130
something and I think yeah you're right

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,840
but in the end if we learn something new

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,280
the changes that happen inside our

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,380
brains the connections between our

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,030
neurons they make us automatically

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,270
change our perspective about the world

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,840
sometimes we don't even realize it and I

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,939
think also that learning to code you

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,549
have so many resources nowadays to do it

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,399
you have online tutorials and videos and

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,380
so many great people teaching you but

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,270
having a community that supports you and

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,689
mentors that support you is really

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,130
important on your journey and that's why

00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:04,619
we want to create a mentoring community

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,750
that is supportive and diverse where

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,069
people can work on projects that they

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:13,860
care about that they're passionate about

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:14,130
and to foster learning and for this we

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,560
have to

00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,030
find different roles we have mentors and

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,980
mentees who will make up the project

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,260
teams and there will be three to five

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,960
people in each team and the mentors

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,060
should be ideally someone who has

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,460
experience in the industry has worked in

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,290
IT for some while and can share their

00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:33,630
knowledge about the technology and the

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,150
mentees can really be anyone who's

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,920
interested in like changing their view

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,920
about the technology or learning to code

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,170
at all or learning some new framework

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,820
for instance and then each team will

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,680
also have a team coach because I think

00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,960
it's important to have someone to help

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,670
you set up and to help you keep the ball

00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,670
rolling and stay motivated along the way

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:56,550
and also to give us feedback and by us I

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,260
mean the organizers and of course we're

00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,930
like tweeting and updating our social

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,460
media presence but our real

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:05,010
responsibility is to organize meetups

00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:08,100
and regular coding sessions where the

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:10,920
teams can meet to code on their project

00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,420
and so you might ask what's missing from

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,810
this and why am I telling you this

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,180
and I think it's you because to create a

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,700
community we need more people right so

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,350
I'd like you to get involved whether

00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,810
it's just as a follower in social media

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,510
or whether you want to become a mentor

00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:31,490
mentee or even team coach or organizer

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:35,430
and obviously we also need sponsors to

00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:37,950
host our meetups and so please please

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,710
join us and because I think in a time

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:44,880
where populism and polarizations on the

00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:47,730
rise it's important that we yeah we

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,520
teach each other and we create the world

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,560
we want to live in and grow our

00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:59,280
community of passionate developers

00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:00,990
together thank you I was so looking

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,389
forward to ring a bell

00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,389
