hello everybody that's me I'm Katrina

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,880
and IT consultant at nightlights

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,039
consulting and I will do a super short

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,500
presentation on the topic of one point

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,619
five degree lifestyle and how to reduce

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,119
your carbon footprint so yesterday I

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,800
didn't expect to be standing on this

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,869
stage but I heard the motor of this

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,670
conference which is reduce reuse recycle

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,160
and they thought that this talk will fit

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,489
pretty well in this conference so five

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,730
minutes while this stay crisp this is

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:42,000
the possible scenarios of global warming

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,550
based on our behaviors the red line on

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,770
the graph is displaying what will happen

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,260
if we don't change our lifestyles which

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,270
corresponds to four degree change in the

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,379
global temperature and the light blue

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,710
line is what might be if we adjust so

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,840
what does four degrees of change mean

00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:03,030
pretty pretty horrible scenario with

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,280
destructive weather with the mass

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,200
migration mass extinction I think you

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,150
have already heard all of this quite

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,430
often but I think that this message

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,630
still didn't reach it so well to the

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,070
minds of the people that I'm standing

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:18,810
here so I when I see all the videos

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,570
about it on Facebook and I see the

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,350
statistics I've asked myself what can I

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:29,460
do and first I found a very nice

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,409
calculator for the co2 emissions on the

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,600
personal level on the individual level I

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,659
have entered the information about my

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,340
lifestyle there and I got the number 12

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:44,100
so 12 tons of co2 is my yearly emission

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:49,110
which is a bit above the average German

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:52,140
emission and the six tonnes of my

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,049
emission is traveling so last year have

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,329
flown six times round trips and that

00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:01,670
correspond to six tonnes so pretty crazy

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:04,500
half of my emissions is my flight sir so

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:08,459
what is the goal it's actually one ton

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,400
one point one ton of co2 has to be

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,060
individual emissions by 2050 we have to

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,099
remove

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,840
eleven tons of our missions in this

00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:19,349
short time and we should better act

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,569
quick so these are the areas of your

00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:24,510
life where you can act which is

00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:26,640
nutrition housing mobility consumer

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,580
goods leisure and services in all of

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,069
these areas you can really optimize your

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,340
life optimize your emissions and I will

00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:38,340
name just three points which are the

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,099
most effective and that everybody can do

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,260
and I just want to focus on those so

00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:45,600
first estimate your carbon footprint it

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,489
was actually a lot of fun to enter all

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,319
the information about my lifestyle and

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:51,330
to that calculator and see the results

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,160
especially if you think that you already

00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,170
doing something towards it you can

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,610
actually yeah you can put it a number

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,450
since we like doing it right as

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,549
developers second it lets beef and dairy

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,470
or go vegetarian it's really awesome

00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,989
that we have on the vegetarian diet here

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,150
at net light we have the same policy we

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,370
have a veggie first policy so you don't

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,940
need to opt out of meat you have to opt

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,799
in for meat if you want it means

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:21,690
vegetables and fruits are great they

00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:24,269
have the least co2 production when they

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,209
have produced choose train summer

00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:29,280
flights that goes also for time like

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,650
this it's Easter time so four days

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,590
everybody can travel somewhere everybody

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,870
choose to to fly and we have I have seen

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,500
it on my example how much co2 my flights

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:43,079
produce so trains are great get rid of

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,859
your car if we have if you have one that

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:49,560
has a drastic change and additionally

00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:51,540
you can climate compensate choose the

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,170
web sites there are really so many of

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:58,350
them you can reuse and repair reduce

00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:00,600
recycle and moreover keep talking about

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,370
it that's why I'm sitting here and I

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,630
think it's a great topic and we can all

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,670
learn from each other thank you

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,980
[Applause]

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:13,010
