all right hello again my name is Hannes

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,440
and I briefly want to talk about the two

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,830
most commonly phrases when I work in

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,619
professional environments these phrases

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,539
are I'm proposing to stuff and the other

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,869
phrases in order to achieve something

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,449
and I deeply believe that these two

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,940
phrases save time and you we all know

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:37,469
time is money so they in the end may

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,450
also save money so in order to save time

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,660
I'm proposing to you all that you do the

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,809
same using this two phrases more so

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,899
let's talk about proposals we all know

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,940
the situation so two people want to meet

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,550
one person say hey we should talk about

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,620
something yeah when do you have time I

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,399
don't know maybe next week what about

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,890
you yeah baby so this can go longer and

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,260
longer on the other hand if the first

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,140
person just starts with a proposal

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,150
saying hey we should can you do you have

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,760
time today at eleven o'clock maybe

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,950
that's all it needs and the second

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,130
person just says that's fine

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:19,470
and even if a date that's proposed by

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:23,340
the first person it's not free on the

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:26,729
other person menko can give a proposal

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,610
back and basically saves time and this

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,060
is not only applicable to finding time

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,610
slots

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:37,110
it's basically applicable for all kinds

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:39,360
of solutions yeah and technical

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,369
discussions on per requests you can just

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,250
say hey I don't like the change that you

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:46,409
made here but you can also say I would

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:52,740
propose that you do it in another way

00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:54,869
and that usually saves time yeah on the

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,549
other hand when you just say how should

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,579
we solve the problem that leads to a

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,640
discussion if you say I'm proposing to

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,009
solve this problem in a specific way

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,079
that may lead to a discussion and this

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,989
discussion will most probably be more

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:15,500
focused more directed in a way that

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:17,940
solves the problem yeah my opinion

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,030
taking a more proposal driven approach

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,890
on solutions could be able to make some

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:28,980
meetings absolutely obvious obviously

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:31,800
need not all meetings but some if you

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,300
don't have an opinion I'd say just

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,780
propose the first thing that comes to

00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,629
mind that will most likely also spark

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:43,230
the good fruitful discussion the other

00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:47,670
thing is intention intention is why I

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:51,720
build it that way or why will we build

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:54,239
this feature and specific way and in my

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,400
opinion if I know the intent and the

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,500
intention of something that's that

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,209
enables me to unfold my full potential

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:06,209
and that's because I don't know don't

00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:13,230
only know what I want to build but also

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:16,920
what for so that makes me enables me to

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,540
understand solutions better mmm if you

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,030
find Hecky locating code somewhere you

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,980
base if you don't know what's the person

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,670
writing that code close to a deadline or

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:28,200
was the code work around for a Bock or

00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:31,500
have the person maybe just no idea what

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,480
what he or she was doing one thing that

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,620
I want to introduce robbery briefly is

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:40,920
what I called golden commits

00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:43,590
who of you knows the Golden Circle and

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,480
okay it's basically an approach where

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,879
you start with a Y if you build a

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,830
company and that's not one-on-one

00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,230
applicable to what I want to present you

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,099
but the why the how and the watch our

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:59,189
stuff that I've really like in commits

00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:02,610
so if you do a commit you have the what

00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:04,620
and also the where in the in the commit

00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:09,120
header or you basically say hey I did

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,489
this thing then we have the how which is

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,650
basically this stuff that you've changed

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,510
don't care about what's in the commit is

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,060
just the code that you changed it's what

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:21,030
you did and then this the thing that

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,880
most often

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,740
it's been forgotten is why and we have a

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,520
whole body in the commit that we can use

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,610
to basically say I did it in this way

00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:36,660
because I wanted to achieve something so

00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,700
that's it these two phrases I like a lot

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,970
like it a lot when people I work with

00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:42,510
using them and that's it thank you so

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,000
much

00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,610
[Applause]
