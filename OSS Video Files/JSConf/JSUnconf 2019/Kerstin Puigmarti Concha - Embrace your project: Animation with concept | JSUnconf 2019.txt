hello and welcome to my very first talk

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,880
yeah it's named embrace a project

00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:28,680
animation with concepts and yeah that's

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:31,650
me never see my face this big and maybe

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,320
I should stick to the microphone so I'm

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,950
care scene developer at some kuhmo here

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,600
in Hamburg and my twitter name is busier

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:46,950
Dave because I love Bezier curves and

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:50,550
yeah I'm a former character animator

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,640
I've been working as a freelancer for

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:56,039
about seven years and it's I'm sorry

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,640
body in character animation and other

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:03,870
things and now since ten years I'm a

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,900
front-end developer yeah so let's get

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,979
started and I hope you can see me is

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:14,760
pretty high here yeah I have a question

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:20,119
for all of you did you ever have one of

00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:27,659
the following web experiences loss of

00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:35,159
orientation increasing frustration or

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:39,020
maybe loss of trust I think you had so

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,020
how did it come to those feelings

00:01:44,030 --> 00:02:03,990
think about it maybe your cognitive load

00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:06,020
became too high could be so cognitive

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:16,290
load was it what is that

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:18,870
I've got a seat at well thank you I've

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,870
got a quote the total amount of mental

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:26,420
effort that is required to complete a

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:26,420
task involving processing of information

00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:33,330
so animation can fill the gap between

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,530
viewing and understanding

00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:40,980
that's what's happening if you have

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:47,459
overload there's a gap and you have to

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:49,530
fix it oh yeah I'm first hark so look at

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,709
this this animation on the left-hand

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:59,370
side you can see someone going from home

00:02:52,709 --> 00:03:03,170
to contact hmm well pretty snappy where

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:06,180
are you on the side what about this here

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:10,650
wow I know where I am that's pretty cool

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,459
and look animation so maybe it's simple

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,720
as that huh

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:20,010
what do you want closing the gap how do

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:25,060
we do that we take animation so what do

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:29,629
we want to animate yes

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:35,599
so let's animate everything yeah let's

00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:39,290
take some time let's animate tiles

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:42,290
let's any make some burger menus let's

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:46,400
animate some accordions looks like fun

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,680
okay let's do that so be brave and go

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,409
for it

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:57,650
I've got an example over here I didn't

00:03:51,409 --> 00:04:01,310
do that that's my pretty cruel yeah so

00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:06,530
where am I here well let's see I want to

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:08,739
go Oh what oh no no no no that was just

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,440
want to skip that okay I go there Oh

00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:14,959
finally whoa so let's get some

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,780
information about that side oh oh now

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:23,840
where am I

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:27,320
where when am i I can reach to them

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,530
that's fine okay thanks whoa so where

00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:39,110
was that start page I don't know I'm

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:45,740
lost I'm frustrated so how do I get back

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:51,610
to my I'm pretty lost okay here I am I

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:57,610
have sir okay just relax so wait what

00:04:51,610 --> 00:05:01,280
what what just happened here hmm

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:04,479
overacting elements everywhere we've

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,479
been animating everything beyond so I

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:14,810
got a suggestion for you what about

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:21,530
animating with concept so but what you

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:27,550
need to know first is natural movements

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:31,850
give comfort they don't pop in okay and

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:39,710
they have weights

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:41,830
I had to do that so and there are 12

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:45,800
principles of animation

00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:47,500
let me show them to you it's by Sarah

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:55,070
villains coma

00:05:47,500 --> 00:06:03,890
Wow there are so many like easing I can

00:05:55,070 --> 00:06:08,120
show you some easing it's like it's like

00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:10,430
eating in and out what I just did was a

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,380
transform and transformation as was

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:18,640
going from the left side to the neck to

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:22,160
the right side from my side and yeah and

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:25,010
you need a minimum two poses and one

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,900
tween between is all the movement

00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:31,310
between two poses

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:37,040
it's a tween so like this here or if I

00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:42,830
do this unless opposes this but how did

00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:51,440
I get there maybe like this or maybe

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:56,510
like that so I will represent to you the

00:06:51,440 --> 00:07:02,510
animation superpowers they make context

00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:05,090
clear they display hierarchies you can

00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:09,790
see okay which element is the hero of

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:18,350
the day who's the sidekick and they make

00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:19,310
the usage in in to it for me yeah I did

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,340
it okay

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:26,990
intuitive I say that every day from now

00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:30,290
on so and they can make artificial

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:34,890
shortening of waiting time pretty good

00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:43,830
for da jman maybe and yeah

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:43,830
and movement animation should be natural

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:53,280
predictable and comprehensive to our

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:57,130
users for a better user experience and

00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,270
what else can you do you could maybe

00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,270
create a mindmap

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:07,600
guess what you already have a lot of

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:11,620
them every one of you has several mind

00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:13,240
maps so let's make an experiment and you

00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,790
can close your eyes you can keep them

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:22,420
open as you like you can listen to my

00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:25,590
soft voice think about your home think

00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:30,640
about your favorite mug

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:43,470
where do you store it and how do you get

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:46,450
access to it so users need a mind map to

00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:51,670
about your project and now I have to

00:08:46,450 --> 00:09:11,410
drink something I really have it's not

00:08:51,670 --> 00:09:16,110
joke and breathe okay so with a mind map

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:18,550
you have orientation for example and

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:22,480
next slide I have an example for you

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:24,400
from a project of mine I would like to

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,060
show it to you in the browser but

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:32,230
unfortunately it's not going live this

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:37,170
week maybe a Monday and so here we go

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:41,080
I had this from from the designer and

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:45,150
she said okay what you see above there

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,959
oh wait

00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,089
spoiling

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,819
and what you see above there should be

00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:55,470
the first state and what you see below

00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:59,949
is the last date and I was like oh okay

00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:05,019
when I press here this and this

00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:08,649
disappears and what you have here these

00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:14,019
two they go there okay

00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:17,199
and this one goes to the X down there I

00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:20,889
don't have an arrow I forgot that one so

00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:25,389
oh no I'm just looking at my forward ok

00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:28,059
I'd do it again I didn't it's not the

00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:31,959
same as you see this I'm sorry for that

00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:35,709
so okay this is the button I will press

00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:40,920
here and this and this disappears okay

00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:46,470
and goes down there now you get it okay

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:50,740
better you X now so and almost like okay

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:53,860
how do we get there they look they don't

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:57,759
look the same and so different so

00:10:53,860 --> 00:11:04,569
different so let me tell you about my

00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:12,129
story and the story it starts the secret

00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:17,339
I have to share now with all of you yeah

00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:17,339
I use pencils and paper

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:27,470
yeah great effect like if you got

00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:30,950
shocked I had these cute animals so so

00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:35,740
that's what I do I draw that's where I

00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:39,260
come from drawing 2d and f10 3d and here

00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:41,030
you can see my thoughts I had I was

00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,820
drawing the first state and the last

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:49,490
date and I was thinking okay how do I

00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:53,360
get from A to C hmm okay what do i what

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:58,760
do I have to think about and I can show

00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:01,850
you the result it's like this and I'd

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:06,680
like to explain to you what I thought

00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:09,440
why is the navigation up there going to

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:14,330
the right and not disappearing by by

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,950
opacity or something and yeah it's I

00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:22,540
would love to go there but the mic is

00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:26,210
here so it's that burger and magnifying

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:29,120
button which amplify that if you click

00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:34,480
on it you see all the menu down there

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:40,190
and the menu is hidden in those

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:43,190
navigation items too you see it expands

00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,110
if you click on it is it expands below

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,090
I'm sorry I don't have that in a picture

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:52,070
you have to imagine just like your house

00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:55,760
and your cup and yeah for me logically

00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:59,540
they have to move to the right into the

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:04,760
button because it's in there and then

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:06,800
it's it it expands down and yeah that's

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,990
why I could talk a little bit more about

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,880
that but now I'm too nervous about it so

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:14,450
I hope you got it

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:19,070
did you yeah thank you

00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:21,020
so I breathe again and we go so what did

00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:26,300
i do - good get there I did some

00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:28,190
prototyping and this is how this is how

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:31,670
it looks at the beginning it wasn't

00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,750
about being fancy or stylish or just

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,450
looking like

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:40,030
the designer said no I just wanted to

00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:44,300
have a feeling is it right to make a

00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:47,360
morphing the way I did it like this or

00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:51,590
did it feel wrong and how does it feel

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:55,970
the timing when my navigation points are

00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:59,200
moving what is right and when I finished

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:04,310
with that I couldn't resist anymore and

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:08,180
I took the project and I analyzed

00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:11,810
everything every single component yes

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:14,530
and I thought okay which component needs

00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:17,060
animation which doesn't and which

00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,310
component needs what kind of animation

00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,190
so which component needs some

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:24,590
transitions or a hover effect or a

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:31,670
movement from A to Z or who's the hero

00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:33,530
here so I had some principles I found in

00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:37,820
the internet by a surveillance camera

00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:39,350
again and he says it's about micro

00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,300
animation not the whole thing

00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:45,230
it's micro just only a component

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:47,480
animating they have to be restrained and

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,970
narrator if they have to tell us sorry

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,510
that they have to be a reason why there

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:55,760
is animation and if you do so just do a

00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:59,060
single movement don't do it all

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:03,320
everything together make pauses

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:09,920
sometimes and animation won't save you

00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:12,590
if if you get a design where the gap is

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,370
too big between the first state and the

00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:19,520
last state maybe just don't maybe just

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:23,120
talk to them we have something else

00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,040
please and if you have some little

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,000
details they can be opportunities to

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,160
raise up the user experience and just

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,710
like I said I got really

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:40,690
interdisciplinary and I was talking to

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:43,240
designers concept oh yeah I see

00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,970
who's on which side I'm on both sides

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:53,110
and maybe I just show you the little

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:56,170
piggies again okay so where happened

00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:59,649
okay I talked to everybody and and was

00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:02,860
like okay we're for example back end hey

00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:06,339
when do the information come when does

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:11,800
the data come do we have to make an

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:14,920
artificial time thing so nobody realizes

00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:17,860
that we are wasting time here or maybe

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,779
I've been asking they design it okay

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,019
this component it really doesn't fit

00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:25,569
with animation and I'm a front-end

00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:28,060
developer I developed it by myself but I

00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:29,920
if I wouldn't do that I would go to the

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:34,019
front and a developer and say hey come

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,810
on how do we how do we the animator and

00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:39,810
talking to everybody and I was asking

00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:43,449
the real questions who's the hero here

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:47,199
not in my company but on paper in my

00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:50,170
project on that side which element has

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,269
to be the hero who's the sidekick yeah

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:55,660
and that's what another example just

00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:59,610
going through all the elements I had and

00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:02,199
exciting how they have to behave and how

00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:08,520
does that fit in the whole project

00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:14,610
that's that's what a concept is about so

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,610
project benefits of animation concepts

00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:24,549
yeah they give more structure because

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:27,730
every animation has a meaning they you

00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:31,470
have a kind of usability testing by just

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:34,150
looking other hidden to bless others to

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:36,880
elements that look the same and note

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:44,490
that don't look the same but they do the

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:44,490
same thing they behave they behave

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:51,150
like twins but they are not if you look

00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,929
at them

00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:57,870
okay so just kick one of them but you

00:17:54,929 --> 00:18:01,020
have to talk to everyone else before you

00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:03,690
do that and everything gets more organic

00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:08,429
you have a more organic feeling it feels

00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:12,660
more naturally and it's a user-centered

00:18:08,429 --> 00:18:15,440
way of development and you have more

00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:19,200
interdisciplinary exchange that's great

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:24,980
so here are some developer pitfalls as

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,980
well because what great power you know

00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:33,240
performance performance performance

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:35,730
performance think about performance so

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,549
here's the critical rendering path I

00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:41,610
know I don't know if you heard of that

00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:44,669
but if you animate you can't an image

00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:48,120
all the properties because some are

00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:53,909
rendered before they like here I have

00:18:48,120 --> 00:19:01,049
that no didn't want to spoil it

00:18:53,909 --> 00:19:07,049
I have to go there okay now that's app

00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:11,039
animate I'm just for Meetup and here you

00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:13,400
can see that's where we want to go we

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:18,980
want to animate things where the

00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:26,520
properties here and the compositor

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:29,880
composite here not here not there not

00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,640
there but you can check this out on code

00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,840
pan yet there you have several

00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:39,929
informations it's about performance

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:42,419
animation and so and if you wonder which

00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:44,429
properties are these to animate here

00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:51,780
there are I get another example for you

00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:52,040
oh man it's falling again okay here we

00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,630
go

00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,550
so you can go there and just see okay

00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:59,650
it's trying

00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:00,790
translate X it's translates that scaling

00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:06,020
[Music]

00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:07,760
opacity rotation and translated Epsilon

00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:14,290
and I got a little keyframe animation

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:18,820
for you here again there you go and

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:25,250
reset okay that's my presentation again

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:30,290
here we go so I've been spoiling this if

00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:33,080
you have basic animation like one two or

00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:36,880
maximum three elements you have to

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:43,340
coordinate with with each other just use

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:47,420
CSS if you go for more if you have to do

00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:51,220
a complex animation like four five six I

00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:57,250
don't know how many elements then I

00:20:51,220 --> 00:21:00,050
would recommend you to use gzip they

00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:04,870
whatever you animate with your keyframe

00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:10,430
animations every change you have to do

00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:14,150
in CSS might take you hours and on gzip

00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:20,690
it takes you a few seconds so we can

00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:23,330
talk about that later and yeah and you

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:28,460
also have some developer support what I

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:32,390
did when I started to take my project

00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:36,260
and just go through every senior element

00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:38,900
I was wondering okay um how do we get

00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:43,040
from here to there so I took Adobe XD

00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:45,200
and make some made some prototyping and

00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,410
it's great if you want to know okay

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:54,140
where do I come when I click here and

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:59,240
where do I go next and yeah easy to

00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:02,510
learn I think and then I started coding

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:07,590
on code pan my animations but I realized

00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:09,570
that after why you go so deep into that

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:13,340
it becomes a big and you lose all that

00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:18,390
time mm-hmm so how can I develop some

00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:23,070
micro animations a bit faster then I had

00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:26,760
principal and principal is program which

00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:32,520
on which you can upload your sketch

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:35,730
files and then make some cool animations

00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:38,820
they have timings and so on and yeah

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:41,570
there are some pitfalls if you're

00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:46,020
interested we can talk about that later

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:53,669
how to handle principal and then I would

00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:57,510
say go for it take your project look at

00:22:53,669 --> 00:23:00,750
all your elements which should have

00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:03,419
animations which not how does it feel to

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:08,940
be on your project hmm maybe it's all

00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:14,000
snappy could be and then I'd say embrace

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,000
your project thank you
