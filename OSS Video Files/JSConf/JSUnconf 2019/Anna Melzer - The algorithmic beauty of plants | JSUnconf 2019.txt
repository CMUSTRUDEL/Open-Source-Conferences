okay thank you all for coming my name is

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,009
Anna I'm a freelance JavaScript

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,430
developer from Berlin but my background

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,010
is actually in computational linguistics

00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:22,199
computational linguistics is the science

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,240
of looking at natural language so the

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,369
stuff that we humans speak in a

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,349
mathematical way trying to find patterns

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:34,290
and rules to do awesome stuff with it

00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:37,050
and this is what inspired this talk yeah

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,840
I want to talk about something called

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,899
the algorithmic beauty of plants so when

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,629
people talk about mathematical aspects

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,390
of plants and the beauty of nature you

00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:51,660
usually see those kind of images show up

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,120
circular shapes with easily recognizable

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,340
repeating patterns sometimes you even

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,390
see if you not see spiral drawn on top

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,890
of it to indicate the goal of national

00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,199
somewhere in the plant whether this is

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,960
true or not but this is what people

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,010
usually talk about however in this talk

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,530
I would like to give you another

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,770
approach to seeing the mathematical and

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,720
algorithmic a beauty of plants and this

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,110
approach actually starts with the human

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,479
language so a common thing between

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,479
people of all cultures in the world is

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,200
that they use language to communicate

00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:29,130
while those languages vary wildly widely

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,180
there seems to be a common feature

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:35,549
connecting them so humans speak to each

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,150
other using languages they have

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,470
different structures different words but

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,950
there are some similarities and this is

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:46,439
what linguistics is about so to give you

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:49,740
an introduction to how we linguist look

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,229
at language I say let's have a look at a

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,729
couple of English sentences and see if

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:58,100
we can find out what makes them

00:01:53,729 --> 00:02:00,509
sentences so look at this sentence it's

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,159
called marika reviewed peters pull

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,909
request that sounds like a wonderful

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,429
english sentence to us however if we

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,709
rearrange the word pull request marika

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,520
peters reviewed doesn't sound like an

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,780
english language so if you

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,240
have another native language than

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,120
English or German maybe a non-european

00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,670
language this word structure might make

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,000
sense to you but for English and German

00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,830
speakers it usually doesn't

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,540
so another sentence that isn't really a

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,760
sentence is something like jessica talks

00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,860
about there's something missing in the

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,050
english language so our brain gives us

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:38,960
this kind of error message when we

00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:41,840
listen to that and you laugh with error

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,820
message but actually we can observe

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,500
something like this

00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,780
so when linguist try to figure out what

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,210
makes the sentence grammatical for

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,660
speakers they have a couple of

00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,850
techniques techniques to check that one

00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:59,840
technique uses eye tracking so when we

00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:01,700
read a sentence like this the test

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,890
subjects eyes go back to the front of

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,980
the sentence furiously looking for that

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:11,030
missing information you even can put on

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,620
an EKG to measure the brain waves and

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,740
you see that there's a spike in it when

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,800
a sentence is ungrammatical so this is

00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:20,750
really interesting

00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,330
the first sentence had a word order that

00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:26,810
we perceived as non grammatical this

00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:28,880
sentence seems to be missing a word but

00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,650
then there are sentences where our brain

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,440
doesn't throw an error message in a

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,750
grammatical way for example this

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,770
sentence colorless green ideas sleep

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,810
furiously it is a perfectly valid

00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,230
English sentence but it doesn't make any

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,720
sense

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:49,220
so we laugh about that but we don't get

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,020
that error message thrown so there seem

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,520
to be some rules that we can break and

00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:57,830
still maintain an English sentence and

00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:59,930
some that we can't and we want to figure

00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,810
out what is it that makes a sentence a

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:06,709
valid English sentence in that case the

00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:09,680
fun thing is its grammar some of you had

00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:11,630
grammar studies in in school and they

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,620
were taught some basics about their

00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:17,570
native language some didn't in

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,580
linguistics a grammars just a set of

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,440
structural rules that tell us how a

00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,720
sentence a phrase so sometimes in the

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:27,020
word may be composed so it has nothing

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,479
to do with so called press

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,729
prescriptive grammar where we say what

00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,560
rules make a nice sentence and if you

00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,180
say that you're teachable if you say the

00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,300
other one your teacher will say it's

00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,069
wrong but really just figuring out what

00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,810
throws the error messages in our brain

00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:43,810
and what doesn't um

00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:50,479
grammar has always been a part of

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,770
learning a language so even 100 years

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,569
ago when people were studying different

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,060
languages they looked at the grammar

00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:58,240
they looked at the word order to figure

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,830
out what is a good sentence and what not

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,690
looking at grammar and languages from a

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:06,740
mathematical angle actually started

00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:08,150
happening in the 50s so for our approach

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,919
right now we just agree that the grammar

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,169
is a set of rules how words may be put

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,229
together

00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:19,159
not nice sentences not educated

00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:20,690
sentences but just valid sentences when

00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:23,030
I started started in the 50s that

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,360
actually started mainly with this person

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:28,550
it's called Noam Chomsky he used to be

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,060
very important theoretical ingres

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:34,370
nowadays he switched to politics and

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,800
philosophy but he laid the groundwork

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:41,630
for all mathematical approaches to

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,949
languages it went this far that we

00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,729
actually call this kind of grammar

00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:50,870
Chomsky grandma or Chomsky systems and

00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:53,800
in a very short summary he says so the

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,969
grandma is a type of rewriting system

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,830
that contains rules that tell us how

00:05:55,969 --> 00:06:01,969
words may be put together to form a

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:04,340
sentence so what is a rewrite system it

00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:07,539
might sound complicated but it's

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:11,080
actually just search and replace symbols

00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:14,930
now we for example have rules like this

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,930
it's an s and Aaron in a in a B and that

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,550
just means every occurrence of the

00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,539
symbol on the left hand side is the

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:25,039
error so the S is replaced with a and B

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:28,669
not the other way around

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,199
yes it's written here yeah you may be

00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:32,599
using already those kind of rewrite

00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:35,960
systems if you use Auto format as like

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,279
prettier that replace every double quote

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,460
with single quotes or the other way

00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,530
around this is just a rewrite rule

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:47,300
more complex rule would be the second

00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:50,360
one so only if the symbol a appears to

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,370
the left of B replace it with C or even

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,169
the third one if a and B appear together

00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:59,360
replace them with C and this is just

00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:02,000
this is how a rewrite rule works it's

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,840
simple replace one thing with another

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,599
according to some logic and with us we

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,750
already can build as a grandma for human

00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:13,340
language so this is a simple sentence it

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,099
works nobody gets an error message

00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:19,880
thrown jessica talks and we have two

00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:20,570
types of words in this sentence one is

00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,270
called a noun

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:25,639
jessica is a noun it's the word that

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:29,449
identifies a person an animal a place a

00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:33,020
thing or an idea um the other thing is

00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:35,180
talks and this is a verb and the verb is

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,159
one of the main parts of any sentence or

00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,639
any language you have you will always

00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:46,009
find verbs in languages they're like

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:48,400
functions i Jessica talks talking is

00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:51,020
kind of a function of the object Jessica

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,220
and they really tied the information

00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:57,080
together that we're having hmm like a

00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,449
real real sentence or a question cannot

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,580
work without a work they of course some

00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:04,969
exceptions but in general the verb is

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,520
the important thing this is how

00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:10,009
important these action parts of speech

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,289
are the verb signals an action and a

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:14,650
chorus or state of being whether mental

00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:19,009
physical and mechanical

00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:21,320
somehow there's an activity expressed so

00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:23,630
a simple rule for English sentence would

00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,900
be a sentence is a noun followed by a

00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:29,120
verb so we would have a rewrite rule

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,770
like this so have signed a symbol for a

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,829
sentence I could replace them with noun

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,630
and verb and this allows us some simple

00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:41,620
sentences like Jessica talks or

00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:44,000
Florencia tenses but we reached the

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:48,350
borders of our grammar pretty fast with

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,740
just the dog barks or Florencia dances

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,240
with a broomstick and in linguistics we

00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,650
call that grammar not expressive enough

00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:00,200
so we need to add more

00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:01,610
to form a complete grammar so when we

00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,050
have a sentence like Jessica talks about

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:09,550
machine learning we again see more nouns

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:13,040
we see the verb that we had before and

00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:17,840
we have a new word about which we call a

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,640
preposition this is the word word form

00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,980
that links nouns pronouns and phrases

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,460
together in a sentence so to create a

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,950
new meaning so we remember this rule and

00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,470
now sending us a noun and a verb we say

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:33,880
okay that's not enough so now we can

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:37,190
come up with something more expressive

00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:40,580
now the word phrases come into that

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,980
corner phrases are just groups of words

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:47,420
that form a specific unit in a sentence

00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:49,430
so noun phrase it's not just now like

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:52,910
Jessica can also be noun in an article

00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:54,470
like the dog and the verb phrase is not

00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,480
just the verb but all the information

00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:03,500
that belongs to it so talks about

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:06,680
machine learning there are some elements

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:10,670
to form a grammars that we use so called

00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,800
non-terminal systems symbols like noun

00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:15,340
verb and prepositional word forms

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,870
terminal systems that are symbols that

00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:23,870
are actual words in a set of rules when

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:27,050
we have a couple of rules we can use

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:29,990
them one after the other so we start

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:32,060
with the s we expanded to noun phrase

00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:34,250
and verb phrase we expanded to noun and

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,660
verb phrase and so on you see that

00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,540
there's a kind of tree structure

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,130
emerging from it and non-terminal

00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,320
systems just appear in the inner notes

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:45,410
and the terminal symbols and we'll learn

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:52,360
that at one point other leaves of the

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:54,740
tree and this is a simple grammar

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,330
applying the productions you can see on

00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,670
the right hand side how that works and

00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,980
with that very simple grammar we can

00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:03,350
actually already form quite a lot of

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,510
sentences so the children talk about

00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,390
jessica is developed sentence in just

00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:14,330
our four to six row grammar

00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:17,240
children sing with joy children sing etc

00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:21,200
and now the cool thing of grammars comes

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,700
into play we have we can generate

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,320
sentences with it

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,020
and if we write our grammar in a

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,640
specific way we can have an infinite

00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:32,450
amount of sentences with just a finite

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,040
set of rules which is pretty cool so if

00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:41,210
we just add something that we call

00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:43,130
adjectives so the children sing the big

00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:44,720
children sing the big funny children

00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:47,000
sing the big funny lovely children

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,070
seeing you can see that we can create an

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,630
infinite amount of sentences just by

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,410
adding the rule that we allow adjectives

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:57,410
now and this is cool because we somehow

00:11:54,410 --> 00:12:02,020
seem to be able to harness an Internet

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:05,360
group of sentences was just a few rules

00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:07,610
this was a very quick run-through how

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,060
formal grammars for natural languages

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,590
work so they get the idea and the

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,260
knowledge that you need for the nice

00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:17,660
things with a plant just a heads up if

00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,060
we ever are interested in that you will

00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:21,980
see that these small grammars are just

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,280
not expressive enough these were

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,810
so-called regular grammars but there is

00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,210
something called context-free grammars

00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:33,050
or context-sensitive grammars allow for

00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:36,560
more complex sentences that might escape

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:39,020
the simple rule set so now to this to

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,020
the plants there's another lovely person

00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:45,740
called OST Linda Mya it's actually a

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:48,550
theoretical biologist and there's a nice

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,560
origin story how all this works together

00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:55,850
he was teaching at a university and he

00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:58,610
was working on describing the growth of

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,980
algae actually so the plants in the

00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:03,890
water and it was thinking a lot about

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,510
that and he was passing a room where

00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,550
they were teaching theoretical computer

00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:10,130
science and talking about the language

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:12,700
of grandma's so what kind of set of

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:16,640
sentences is a specific grandma

00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:20,210
producing and in theoretical computer

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,980
science it's denoted with L G and he

00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,250
just heard oh they're talking about L GL

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,840
dude

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,940
seems to be something that's my interest

00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,850
because I'm looking at those plans and

00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:32,900
he went into the class not knowing that

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:35,390
he was mistaken but from that class he

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:37,700
was watching learning about grammars and

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:41,480
rules it was actually able to develop a

00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:46,130
theory based on that to describe plant

00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:48,680
growth so these systems that he

00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:51,500
developed are so-called L systems or

00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,870
Lindenmayer systems and they describe

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,630
the behavior of plant cells to model the

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,520
growth process of plant development it

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,950
started with the algae but later it was

00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,930
more complex organisms and when you look

00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,940
at those plants you see that there's

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:08,170
some kind of structure to it some kind

00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:14,510
of rule it's not just based in the wild

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:16,310
and its tree and having a grimmer gives

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:19,340
us actually the possibility to describe

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:24,050
something like this this is a simple

00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:25,790
plant it grows and when we watch the

00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:28,460
different stages of the plant growth we

00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:30,710
actually see that there's some sort of

00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:33,440
system for it there's also some sorts of

00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:36,050
repeating elements so we have a size one

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,410
leaf somewhere we have a stem we have a

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:41,380
size two leaf or a size three leaf so

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:45,140
from the first of the second plan

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:47,780
besides one leaf has been replaced by

00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:49,100
two sides one leaves the second one the

00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,260
two sides of one leaves have been

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:56,390
replaced by a stem and the two sides one

00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:57,620
leaves so we can actually already see

00:14:56,390 --> 00:15:02,720
that there's some kind of rewriting

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:08,000
could be going on when we talk about

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:10,160
linear systems we have two main elements

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,750
of our grammar so first we had those

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,880
terminal symbols and non-terminal

00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:16,040
symbols and then let my assistants we

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,160
just have an axiom it's kind of the seed

00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:22,040
of the plant so the starting word

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:28,430
so to speak and replacement rules that

00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:30,770
describe how our plants grow and and the

00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:32,840
linguistics grammar we applied one rule

00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:36,300
after the other and then from our

00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:39,480
systems the rules are actually applied

00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,580
altogether so on our first step we have

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,700
our seed our s and we have a rule that

00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:48,860
says replace the S with L and s okay we

00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:52,950
do that and then we have an L that says

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:55,110
replace it with SS R and we have an S

00:15:52,950 --> 00:16:02,550
again so now the rule for the s and the

00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:04,140
L will apply as well every stage of rule

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:06,060
application is actually a different

00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,980
plant and as developed plant so first we

00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,390
have the seat then we have one leaf and

00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,860
we have a couple of leaves and then in

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:18,540
the end we have a tree and you see if

00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:20,760
you write the rules the right way the

00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:25,290
words the trees can be pretty big pretty

00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:27,330
soon so to summarize it's a rewrite

00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,970
system we have the seat in the beginning

00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:33,900
all rules applied at once and every step

00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:36,090
is a relative word or plant and the

00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:39,510
final result we can actually translate

00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:43,140
into a visual here's the comparison to

00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:45,810
the Chomsky gamez we have a root with a

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,360
non-terminal we apply our rules and in

00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,280
the end we have a valid sentence we

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,200
don't really need to translate it into

00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,180
something visual unless we want to print

00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,820
it on the screen our brain is

00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,580
translating it to actual phonemes and

00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,370
words in our mouth but with the

00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,840
Lindenmayer systems we can actually

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:06,600
translate it into anything we want and

00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,010
an easy way to start with this is

00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,890
something called turtle graphics

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:13,260
I love turtle graphics as an explanation

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:16,580
because just imagine there's a turtle

00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,020
and in its mouth is a pen and the turtle

00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:22,110
walks over a sheet of paper according to

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:25,020
some rules so we have if we have a word

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:27,570
like this guess what mean draw straight

00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:31,830
line L what mean turn left our word mean

00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:33,810
turn right so we start here supposed to

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,850
draw a straight line then there's a turn

00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:38,790
left another straight line

00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:42,210
turn right another turn right a straight

00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:46,070
line turn left straight line this is

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:48,860
turtle graphics and we can use them to

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:52,610
visualize our

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:54,830
plant words so we start with the seed

00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:56,600
have the set of rules and then we

00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:00,260
translate the symbols with the meaning

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:02,240
into something else I kind of put two

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:06,010
stalks together so I apologize for the

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,870
repeating slides but this is again

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:12,620
symbols with the meaning translated into

00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:16,070
turtle graphics so now we have a couple

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:19,429
of iterations where we use our rule sets

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:21,830
to create new stages so the first thing

00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:24,679
the axiom is just a straight line it's a

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:27,950
valid word if we have our rule applied

00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,600
one it's a very big rule we can see the

00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,570
little triangle that we just had with a

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,320
turtle but even the second iteration

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:38,480
already shows us sorry I guess like a

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,299
fractal structure so all parts all

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,910
straight lines are replaced with that

00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:47,450
little triangle and grow and grow and

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:50,030
grow turtle graphics is one thing wake

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:52,460
translated to the other thing it's

00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,929
basically whatever you want so the

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,900
biggest picture I think is surrender

00:18:53,929 --> 00:19:00,110
tonight in a frame which is a 3d library

00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:02,960
that you can use in VR settings the

00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:07,880
upper right is just plain canvas and the

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:10,580
lower right is three JIS they actually

00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,970
use the same grammar some with different

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,919
starting seeds but this is about it so

00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,580
you can do quite interesting stuff with

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,470
it so for a more complex example which I

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:25,070
don't expect you to fully understand by

00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:28,070
the code we only just have two rules but

00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:30,770
one rule is pretty long the X is just a

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:36,320
placeholder to be used in other rules so

00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:38,240
you can see that our plans our words

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:44,980
will be getting bigger and bigger and

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:46,940
bigger with every step and we can yeah

00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:50,090
actually see what's happening with that

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:53,840
kind of rule so now it's praying time

00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:56,120
because I have to change my settings so

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,900
this is one of the trees rendered in

00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:02,000
three.js as I said but here is a simple

00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,790
small tree that uses the grandma that I

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,060
just showed you

00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:13,340
it's rendered on on canvas so our rules

00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:17,270
are actually just translated into canvas

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:19,760
operations so the rotation the saving or

00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:24,050
restoring what's just actually drawing a

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,880
path to somewhere here we have three

00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:28,730
iterations right now and let's see what

00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:31,700
happens if we apply the rule just one

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:33,530
more time so once the read this is

00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:38,990
actually five iterations now you can see

00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:41,810
that the word is enormous just by

00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,370
applying those two rules five times and

00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:52,120
we can actually see a tree that has been

00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:56,600
growing here c6 crushes the browser

00:20:52,120 --> 00:21:01,460
no but it's getting too big for the tool

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:03,590
tool to see you see and this is so

00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,780
there's no really complex operations

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,910
involved that you need to describe how

00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,040
to render this tree is just set of two

00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:12,830
rules and some translation into

00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,410
something to visualize it and I find

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,870
that is pretty cool this library is

00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:20,510
actually not developed by me but by a

00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:24,590
person called Tom prover who was I think

00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:26,360
was part of his master thesis he's not

00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:29,090
here today but he's from Berlin so check

00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:36,590
him out if you're interested

00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:39,560
so going back to my displays so although

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:42,050
this was a very complex thing for some

00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,750
of you to understand probably it's even

00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,280
not enough not expressive enough just as

00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,410
simple grammars were not expressive

00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,160
enough for our natural language we need

00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:55,970
to keep be more expressive for more

00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:59,090
complex systems so for example there's

00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:01,760
some kind of randomness involved

00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:03,890
sometimes like depending on whether

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,650
there's a bird sitting on a tree when

00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,710
it's trying to gross or not a tree can

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:11,170
be growing in another direction

00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,220
depending where the Sun is coming from

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:15,440
parts of the tree actually need

00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,950
different rules than other parts of the

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,840
tree so we have something called

00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,850
so hashtag l-systems parametric

00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,800
l-systems etc is very fun to play around

00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:23,430
with that if you're interested and

00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,620
that's it

00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:27,510
thank you for your attention if you want

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:29,370
to look at anything from that these are

00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:32,040
the search and in terms that might be

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:33,540
interesting for you and let me know if

00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,690
you want to talk about it I like talking

00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,420
about languages

00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:40,279
[Applause]
