Title: CSSconf EU 2018 | Claudina Sarahe: Design Systems as Facilitators
Publication date: 2018-06-02
Playlist: CSSconf EU 2018
Description: 
	We build design systems to help our teams communicate to accomplish a shared goal—often, in the case of web development, improving a product. Design systems provide shared reusable patterns aimed to reduce code bloat and establish harmony across applications. However, the most significant benefit to building a design systems is that they create resiliency and dynamic conversations across our teams. A good design system is the first step to establishing autopoiesis—a cybernetic feedback loop—within our design and development teams and organization, which is a requisite for maintaining a viable system. By the end of this talk, I hope we will see how the act of building and maintaining a design system not only aids our teams but takes us one step closer to reimagined futures.
