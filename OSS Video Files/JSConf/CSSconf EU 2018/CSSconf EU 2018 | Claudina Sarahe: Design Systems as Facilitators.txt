Title: CSSconf EU 2018 | Claudina Sarahe: Design Systems as Facilitators
Publication date: 2018-06-02
Playlist: CSSconf EU 2018
Description: 
	We build design systems to help our teams communicate to accomplish a shared goal—often, in the case of web development, improving a product. Design systems provide shared reusable patterns aimed to reduce code bloat and establish harmony across applications. However, the most significant benefit to building a design systems is that they create resiliency and dynamic conversations across our teams. A good design system is the first step to establishing autopoiesis—a cybernetic feedback loop—within our design and development teams and organization, which is a requisite for maintaining a viable system. By the end of this talk, I hope we will see how the act of building and maintaining a design system not only aids our teams but takes us one step closer to reimagined futures.

CSSconf EU will be back on May 31st 2019: https://2019.cssconf.eu/

Thank you so much.

00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:12,790
It's fantastic to be here, and I also just really want to thank Trent and Whitney, and

00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,750
all the organisers who helped me out this morning so that I can be here on this stage,

00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:23,100
and it's an excitement to get to close out CSSconf, because the last time I was here

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,140
on the stage, I was giving a talk which was really a call to action.

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,500
In some ways, I see this talk as perhaps a part 2 of that, or, if you haven't seen it,

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,150
answering some of the questions that I proposed at the end.

00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,750
I'm going to talk about design systems but not in the normal sense we're used to hearing

00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:50,050
about design systems, I want to talk about it through the lens of facilitation.

00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,640
This is marrying two things that I love: one, design systems, and the second thing I've

00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,170
come to fall in love with in the last couple of years is this topic of facilitation.

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:06,680
What I hope to do for you today is introduce facilitation and to show you how it is actually

00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,470
an incredible and really powerful tool, and how our design systems really, although we

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,710
build them to establish consistency across our products, are actually acting as facilitators

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,300
within our organisations.

00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:27,580
And how this is super instrumental in , and I see is it one of the first key steps in

00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:34,320
helping to transform our educational structures, and helping us build resilient teams as well

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,520
as products.

00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:46,630
This is a neat facilitation tool.

00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:52,610
You can enter the code CSS EU, and you can leave questions and upvote other people's

00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,610
questions.

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,100
If I have enough time at the end, I will take a look at them.

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,230
If we don't get a look to them, this is a great starting point to find me afterwards.

00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,300
Discuss and debate, tell me what you liked and didn't like.

00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:09,080
That's what we are hear for at this conference, and that's one of the greatest reasons I believe

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,390
to gather.

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:18,860
As I started working on this talk, I came across this talk.

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:27,870
This is how I had to start this because this is getting at the core of my trajectory in

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,790
my life and how I got to come to this point of interest.

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,660
This is really true for me: the older I get, or the longer I've been working in tech, the

00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,360
more every problem seems to be a matter of getting humans to work together effectively,

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,550
and it is actually not about the tech itself.

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:51,010
So I started out at the beginning coding, heads down, member of a team, and through

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,280
my almost 12 years, I got to the point where I was building teams, and thinking about the

00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,120
other people on my team.

00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,800
And to the only thinking about the people on my team, but thinking about how we interacted

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,270
with other parts of the organisation.

00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:09,489
And this really drove home to me, because this is exactly what I would encounter.

00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:15,150
It didn't matter how great my codebase was, at the end of the day, if the members of the

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,319
team, if we couldn't communicate effectively, then the process wasn't great and our products

00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,000
weren't great at the end.

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,120
So this issue is actually what drove me to start to focus on organisations and structures,

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,129
and I know this is a conference about CSS, but, we work together as people, and we work

00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:39,819
under organisations, and really, when I think about organisations, I view them as a place

00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:44,020
which just interactions with human beings.

00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:50,319
This became the question that I've been driven by for the last year and a half: how do we

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,690
design our organisational structures for participation?

00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,810
To actually allow for participation to happen?

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,500
And beyond that, how do we ensure that we have a balance of the bottom up with the top

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,500
down?

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,549
And we don't end up with too much of the other?

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:11,720
And in comes to how we are going to work in our organisations.

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,920
Because, if we don't, our products aren't going to be as great.

00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:23,460
And so, while I'm still writing CSS I assure you - and JavaScript - I'm also doing a lot

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,590
of other things.

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:30,430
I'm learning a lot about ethnography and research, and, to answer this question, I want to share

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,810
a story with you, and this is a story that, for me, really married my call twin-tracks

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,229
to action on my last talk which was really let's think about the human layer of what

00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:42,229
we are doing, right?

00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:48,710
Let's day about the collaboration and what our tools are enabling.

00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:56,389
So finning out about what happened in Taiwan and the history of Taiwan became this really

00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:57,509
big revelation for me.

00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:02,350
If you don't mind, I'm going to tell you a little bit about Taiwan.

00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:08,800
In 2014, there was an occupation in Taiwan, called the Sun Flower Movement.

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
The.

00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,909
The government of tie would be tried to pass a loafed-door deal with China.

00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:21,210
There was a great media org called watch-out starting to live broadcast the events of the

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,470
proceeding.

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,810
When they found out, this news got on the internet, and, in less than five minutes,

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,789
students and citizens of Taiwan, decided to occupy their parliament.

00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:38,419
This is like the US occupying the White House in Europe, occupying just the biggest seat

00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:41,839
of government that you could find.

00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:48,189
And they barricaded it and sets themselves up there, and they were there for over a month.

00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:52,740
It wasn't mayhem, it wasn't as if they weren't accomplishing anything.

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,120
They actually were leading a non-violent occupation, and one of the most most interesting things

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,900
is they showed the government how they wanted the government to respond.

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,949
They set up live streaming infrastructure, they held debates and discussions in the streets,

00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:23,129
and this is powered by their civic [sound distort ed].

00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:24,649
And it did lead to change.

00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:30,930
The government was so embarrassed by what happened, that they invited one of the members

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:36,180
from the civic community to enter government.

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:43,059
[Sound distorted].

00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:49,560
This is to me the ultimate marriage of the bottom-up power with the topdown, or the bottom-up

00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,699
with the top-down power.

00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,669
They are using this legislation to do things, for example, to regulate what to do about

00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:00,740
Uber, instead of London trying to shut it down, they took it into suggestion.

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:07,580
They used it to figure out what to do about air B and N - Airbnb and regulate most net

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,419
laws.

00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:14,499
I went digging and thought there must be some amazing piece of technological piece of software

00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,929
behind this, and there wasn't.

00:07:16,929 --> 00:07:24,969
There was a simple facilitation method, called the focus conversation method - objective,

00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:29,590
reflective, interpretative, and decisional.

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:35,270
I've named this to something simple: it starts with finding facts.

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,430
We need to be clear about what those facts are.

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,360
Along with the facts, it is okay, we need to sort out the feelings.

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,900
What do people feel about in stuff?

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:53,610
Then, I think this is a wonderful framework to consider what you're design systems are

00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:00,639
doing and how to go about building them in a way that doesn't lead to issues of rejection,

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,009
even though I will show you how that is a part of it.

00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:07,629
So if we think about our design systems and we start gathering our facts, the first thing

00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:09,909
we want to do is find out what currently exists?

00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,889
Who are the stakeholders?

00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:14,879
What is out there in our organisations that we can build off of?

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,669
Then need to find the feelings.

00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,099
This is a really important one.

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,709
And one where you're probably going to get a lot of emotions, but if you working on the

00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:29,289
design system are approaching this as an idea of I am facilitating, I'm listening, then

00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:31,270
you can kind of step back.

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,620
We shush asking people how we think this should work.

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,419
This is a time to ask people their feelings about naming or how we should organise stuff.

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,649
Let's get the feelings out.

00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:45,240
How do people feel about our existing design system if we had one, or existing attempt

00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,269
to make one.

00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:47,269
What worked?

00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:48,269
What, did not?

00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:51,960
Once we get to this, we can generate ideas.

00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,029
What is this tooling going to be?

00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:56,040
How is it going to work?

00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,360
How will the team begin to interact with it?

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,920
Then we can document our decisions, and we should document our decisions, and they should

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,259
point back to the whole process so people can see why we made the choices that we made.

00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:13,510
And we should be transparent.

00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:19,000
So at the end of the day, facilitation is doing is really making an action or process

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
easier.

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,750
Our design systems do this, right?

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,140
They make coding easier.

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,209
You don't have to repeat the same code.

00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:32,180
Ideally, if they are well documented, they help you find answers, the questions that

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:36,680
you may have, so you don't have to implement it.

00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:43,190
And so, a facilitator is the person that is in charge of sort of designing this process,

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:49,310
and they think a lot about what things can they do all along the way to make the action

00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:55,759
or the whole journey much easier?

00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:06,509
We're trying to make design easier, coherent, less opaque.

00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:12,160
Our design practices that we are really using are designed to help make our processes a

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:20,190
lot easier, and to help us arrive at this point of shared understanding.

00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:24,670
Stephanie Hughes has a great video called Architecting Interaction.

00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:29,449
She's an architect but takes things from a systems point of view, and she says facilitating

00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:34,060
is about creating contexts that are incomplete, right?

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,139
They're not quite finished.

00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,370
Think about our design systems.

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,500
They are never quite finished.

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,630
That's okay.

00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:45,370
Also, they're impermanent, which means they're going to change.

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,189
That's also okay.

00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,170
Lastly, they're imperfect.

00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:56,269
And I don't know about you, but every design system that I've built is pretty imperfect,

00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:57,850
although while it gets the job done.

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:04,120
The way I like to think about this is each stage of our design system is facilitating

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:10,629
a context and it's creating an environment, and this is the environment where we can get

00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,230
things done as people, right?

00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,680
That environment is helping us achieve a sense of shared understanding for that moment so

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,600
that we can move forward and make another decision.

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,730
This is a cyclical thing that we work through on our design system.

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,980
Where we start is not where we will end up.

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:37,029
Constantly, we are thinking about creating these environments that allow for conversation,

00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,910
and allow for us to get to a point of shared understanding to take the next step forward.

00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,680
So, really, what we are doing is designing the context for interactions.

00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,620
I think about our design system this one level up and we think about help in the place of

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,230
our organisations, they're designing those interactions, the interactions that we have

00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:02,399
between people in different departments, right?

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,209
This is another great talk by Jess Clark, and I highly recommend it: evolving your design

00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:10,321
system, people, product, and process.

00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:15,079
She talks about the different stages that the linked linked design system - Linked In

00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:17,139
design system went through.

00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:25,910
She divides her process, communication, collaboration, co-ordination, and contribution, to her represent

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,170
that happens at each stage of a design process as it matures.

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,999
I would like to say if our design systems are actually facilitators, then these are

00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:42,291
the things that we need to be designing for and accounting for at every stage of the process

00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:48,360
from our design system, even though it may change.

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,589
Communication in the early days of a design system might be informal and loose and tapping

00:12:53,589 --> 00:13:00,170
someone on the shoulder, and the collaboration as well might not be super defined, and your

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:05,420
contribution to allow other people to contribute to your design system might look more like

00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,360
send me an email when you want something.

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,449
But as this evolves, you begin to think about ways that you can be more communicative with

00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:22,069
other people in the organisation, that you can increase collaboration, that you can mitigate

00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:25,760
and design for better co-ordination, and that you can have better contribution.

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,459
Maybe your dream state is getting this to a pull request.

00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:37,730
But I want to urge us to think about how we are designing our systems to account for these

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:44,630
processes at all levels, and not view it as an evolution that happens as we get better

00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:48,579
and better, we have more better ways of contribution.

00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:54,610
It's more as our contacts and needs change, we evolve our process.

00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:01,389
Really, our design systems are facilitating multi-stakeholder discussions and needs.

00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:06,519
And this becomes really, really challenging in our current organisations because most

00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:12,389
of our organisational structures aren't set up to make this easy.

00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:18,629
Which is why I suddenly realised how important a design system is, and what it really means

00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:23,459
when an organisation says, "We're undertaking a design system."

00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:28,559
I would like to start the section by thinking about this quote.

00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,309
There's this misconception of the independent existence, right?

00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:34,399
There is no such mode of existence.

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,931
Every entity is to be understood in terms of the way it's interwoven with the rest of

00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:40,180
the universe.

00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:44,410
When I think about this in the context of our organisations, I'm thinking about this

00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:51,300
issue where we often have these org charts, in command-and-control pattern, even though

00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,899
the universe doesn't work that way.

00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:56,990
The universe is like this more collaborative, decentralised network.

00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:02,930
Furthermore, what is challenging is our design systems are about the collaborative network,

00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:09,959
and we are trying to get to that while we are existing in this extremely centralised

00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:10,959
model.

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:17,939
So perhaps, to me, one of the most powerful things that our design systems do when introduced

00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:22,800
into an organisation, is they become one of the first manifestations of a team that is

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,959
trying to work across all of these silos.

00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:29,839
Face it, that is really hard.

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,540
Because our structures aren't set up for that.

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,519
So you're doing an amazing job to keep pushing this through.

00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:41,759
These are two articles that came out a couple of years ago, one is by Nathan Curtis, and

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,910
another is a response by Gina, and Nathan is looking at various models how to scale

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,160
a design system.

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,189
He talks about three.

00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:55,930
He says there is this solitary Over Lord model, that there is one person that makes the design

00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:02,190
system, he's super excited and focused on his team's needs - I was that person for a

00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,190
while.

00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:04,920
It's easy to be that to learn person if you punish this forward.

00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,880
There's a centralised pattern which is a single central design them that produces and supports

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,309
the system and everyone else is using it; and there is a concept of a federal pattern

00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:22,199
where multiple members of the team decide on the system together.

00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:30,850
While it's always best to aim for a cross-functional team where we are really pulling the people

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,449
that we need from different departments to make our design testimonies, I think if we

00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:42,540
take this idea of a design system as a facilitator, it is also okay happens to be if you're that

00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,399
solitary person working on your design system.

00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:55,420
What that means is that you need to design all of your processes to be incredibly open,

00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:01,529
and to go out into the organisation and to find out what the people actually need, so

00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:07,059
you're going to be not only the developer of the design system but a UX reserver team

00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:13,069
of one, which is really hard, but that is a way to get started, and I believe by doing

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:18,439
that, you won't end up with a design system that fees like an over-Lord because the process

00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:26,070
by which you designed it was more of a facilitatory process.

00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:32,870
Because our organisational systems aren't set up for design systems and a lot of battle

00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:38,190
of the design system is to get that buy-in so you can make your cross-functional team,

00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,900
resistance and chaos are always going to be a part of the process.

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,559
We just must embrace it now.

00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,360
All right?

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:55,080
If we can embrace this, we can also get out of it, and see how we can help facilitate

00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,140
the processes to make this more manageable.

00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,299
So here are two, I'm going to share two design models.

00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:11,500
This is the Double Diamond design model which states as you start with a problem, you will

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,510
have divergent thinking, and then eventually going to define it and converge.

00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:21,690
Then of you you're going to have an answer, and, again was as you generate ideas, you

00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:27,370
get divergent thinking, and, as you start to test them, you're going to converge.

00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:32,480
I view this as something to accept, right?

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,020
This might feel really chaotic to people that why do we have so much divergent thinking

00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,020
again?

00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,630
Can't we just all agree?

00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,410
It's okay.

00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,410
It's totally part of the process.

00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:52,060
I think that, if we can make this clear too as facilitators, as people here to guide members

00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:59,010
of our orgs through this, it helps them understand that there will be a solution at the end.

00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:07,279
The other model I recently came into and wanted to share because it really helped me just

00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:13,149
become Zen with chaos and resistance in organisations is this change model.

00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:19,070
This comes from family therapy.

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:24,700
In our organisations, we've got this status quo, and we have to introduce we've got to

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,880
change.

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,970
This foreign element comes into play.

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:33,450
In this case, our foreign element is the design system, and the design system team.

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:38,279
As soon as any foreign element is introduced into the existing system, it's a period of

00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,890
chaos.

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,419
It's absolute chaos.

00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:47,179
People become emotional, they have their own feelings, they don't want to use it, they

00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:53,970
say it was better the way it was before, you're constantly fighting, until suddenly this thing

00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:59,230
starts to take root, and you can see this transformation into an idea, and eventually,

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,530
we get, it becomes part of our practice, and we integrate it, and then we end up at a new

00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,530
level.

00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:12,660
We're at this new level until the next northern element enters, and we begin this again.

00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:21,220
So, ask we are building design systems, if we can really think about ways to facilitate

00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:28,950
that way through chaos, and this is part of why taking on these facilitation models by

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,799
talking to people and not being in our solitary teams, by finding out how they're feeling

00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:41,820
about stuff, really helps us make our way through the change model.

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:50,470
So, really, what we should be focusing on is the outcomes in our design systems, and

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,510
not the outputs.

00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,559
Because the outcomes are actually what drive impact.

00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:00,870
And the outputs and the design system I like to think about as the components, right?

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:04,279
And so you might want to have a design system that has tons of outputs.

00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:09,840
You've covered all the possible component patterns, you did it, everything is in the

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,590
system, hurrah.

00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,760
But that's not going to be great.

00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,840
Because, in taking that approach, in order to do that, you might find yourself trampling

00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,409
over people.

00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:29,120
So, if we focus more on what we are hoping these things will do in our organisation,

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:37,240
such as facilitate conversation, be that spark of interaction, I think that we can design,

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,370
it will help us design these better systems.

00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:49,250
And is to, it is really about building as much as we need when we need it.

00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,201
What I want to say here is please don't be embarrassed about your design systems if your

00:21:54,201 --> 00:22:00,820
design system is a PDF, or if your design system is a sketch file, or if your design

00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,340
system has red line marks on it.

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:10,130
Please don't be embarrassed if your design system isn't in a fancy repo and has all these

00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,960
amazing components that you can import.

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,730
You were build what you needed for that moment in time, right?

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,550
You were trying to focus on that outcome.

00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:27,090
Starting with a PDF might get you to a point where you designed a context where at least

00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,020
you can have discussions, and that's the what matters.

00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:37,269
In the next stage, you can think about evolving it to meet the needs of your team.

00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:44,299
So really, again, I cannot stress, focus on those outcomes, really assess your teams,

00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,980
and determine what it is that you need.

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:52,710
A lot times within I really think that it is about communication and talking, and breaking

00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,590
down those silos and the human-to-human interactions.

00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:04,730
Really, when we think about designing sustainably and designing sustainable systems, it is about

00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:09,360
facilitating a process which is what we are doing with our design systems.

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,059
We're empowering that system to deal with change.

00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:20,519
This is what makes it proactive and more resilient, and able to anticipate the futures of what

00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:24,710
will come.

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:31,710
In another model, it's called the viable system model, he talks about this concept of autopoeisis,

00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:38,029
which is the idea that a system has everything inside of it to better itself and to get better

00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:43,290
- in our body, this is the mitochondria.

00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:52,230
If our design systems are facilitators, I like to think we designed this context, and

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:58,779
we have a collection of processes that we can constantly use, and employ to help our

00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:00,230
design systems grow.

00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:08,320
So, for me, it goes back to that focus conversation method and remembering to listen, and also

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,230
remembering that we are doing is looking to create these incomplete, these impermanent,

00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,760
and these imperfect structures because that is setting up the first environment and the

00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,419
first context for our discussions.

00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:27,679
And so lastly, I want to leave you with a quote from one of my favourite heroes, this

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:34,730
is Audrey Tang, currently the digital minister in Taiwan and rub the V Taiwan process.

00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:41,450
She says: deliberation, listening to each other deeply, thinking and living and making

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,870
something we can all live with is magical.

00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:52,309
This is really the beauty behind our design systems and what we are getting at.

00:24:52,309 --> 00:25:00,049
We are deliberating, exchanging ideas, and trying to arrive at a final product - that

00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:01,460
design system.

00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:08,279
But let's not get so focused in the design system, and let's rather that process in and

00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:14,800
of itself is actually to me one of the most magical parts about creating these.

00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Thank you so much.

00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:15,801
