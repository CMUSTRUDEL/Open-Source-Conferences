what I love about CFS in 2018 I can't do

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,790
everything

00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,960
[Music]

00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,910
[Music]

00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:34,480
good morning and welcome to 2008

00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,430
[Music]

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:46,700
[Applause]

00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:46,700
[Music]

00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,710
[Music]

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:04,420
[Music]

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,700
my favorite part of CSS comp is always

00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,460
the meeting new people and hearing the

00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,840
conversation it gives developers and

00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,120
engineers and designers a chance to

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,380
connect with each other in a way that

00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,020
they don't get to in their normal

00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,390
day-to-day work inspire each other and

00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,550
talk about the work that they do with

00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:24,870
people outside of their own companies or

00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:28,270
organizations and so it can open

00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:30,280
developers minds to context and

00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,260
situations that they don't encounter in

00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,000
their daily work I think community

00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,800
events are really important because I

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,470
came from a really small town in the

00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,060
southeastern United States and I didn't

00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,040
really find a sense of belonging there

00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,990
and it just it blows my mind that I came

00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,940
to Berlin and found this amazing

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,200
community so far away it's nice to be in

00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,240
a place where everyone can come together

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,150
and celebrate CSS and all its quirks

00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,890
together see what's coming up and see

00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,920
what we can do to make it even better

00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,960
for everyone in 2015 I was one of the

00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,600
scholarship holder I had a lot of

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,690
opportunities to be a speaker and also

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,780
landed up in a job in Berlin this

00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:10,530
scholarship is a is a great means to

00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,040
help diverse candidates explore

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:17,290
opportunities new opportunities

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,290
[Music]

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:26,220
[Music]

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:28,650
this has confessed run by a volunteer

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,480
team the curation like all the little

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,849
details that we see here the design is

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,989
all done by volunteers that have known

00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:36,269
each other for years

00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,280
and all of us still remember the very

00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:40,620
first year where we just all had this

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,750
desire to set up an event to talk about

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:57,329
CSS because there was no place for it

00:02:42,750 --> 00:03:00,450
before my talk was about how we can

00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:02,489
build safe teams and a better culture

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,440
and environment East Asian photography

00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:06,870
and how it can inspire more than web

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,359
layouts building a dev tools extensions

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:11,849
API that people could use to create

00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:13,620
their own tools for web designers on top

00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:16,639
of dev tools I thought was about Design

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,109
Systems as facilitators and applying

00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:21,030
facilitation lens to products that we

00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:25,109
use I would say my talk was about

00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,419
empathy and the fact that you really

00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:29,590
need multiple layers when you're talking

00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:39,120
about empathy

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:40,530

welcome so many wonderful people from

00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,220

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,350
