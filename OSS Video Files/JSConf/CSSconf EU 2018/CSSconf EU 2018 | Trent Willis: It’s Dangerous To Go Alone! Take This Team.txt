Description: 
	What makes a team successful? Innovative? Great?

As software developers, many of us spend a fair amount of time working alone behind our computers, but when we come together as a team we can build truly great products for people. So how do we build effective teams?

In this talk at CSSconf EU 2018, Trent Willis explores the concept of “safe” teams and how they enable us to build and design software faster and with more innovation than other teams. We’ll see how these concepts apply not just to our day jobs but also to the larger Open Source and CSS communities to which we belong.

CSSconf EU will be back on May 31st 2019: https://2019.cssconf.eu/
