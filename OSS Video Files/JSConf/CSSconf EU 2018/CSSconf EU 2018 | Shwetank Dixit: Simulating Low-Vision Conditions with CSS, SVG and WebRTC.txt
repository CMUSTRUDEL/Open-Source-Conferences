Description: 
	Augmenting Empathy: Simulating Low-Vision Conditions with CSS, SVG and WebRTC

“Low-vision” is a concept which is hard to grasp for most people in an exact manner. Its an umbrella term for a number of conditions - each affecting eyesight in a different way. What if we could make tools to make people see what people with low-vision actually see?

This talk is a story of how I talked to persons with low vision and their family members, and tried to make tools to help people understand how people with various low-vision conditions see the world. Through the power of CSS, SVG and WebRTC, we’ll take a look at how to simulate low-vision conditions and what it taught me about empathy.

CSSconf EU will be back on May 31st 2019: https://2019.cssconf.eu/

Hi, everyone.

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,460
I hope you had a great lunch.

00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,059
So, let's get started.

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:21,380
This talk is about augment ing empathy, and what I mean by that is basically that you

00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:27,470
already have empathy, but there can be some things or tools that you use actually to augment

00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,890
that a little bit more, to understand some situation s and to make things clear, and

00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:39,480
we will be using CSS, SVG, and WebRTC to do this.

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:47,030
My name is she she.

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:56,280
Basically, I do a lot of R&D to try to look at new technologies.

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:06,840
Previously, I used to work at Opera.

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:13,910
It's a company based in Mumbai, and it does a lot of accessibility consulting, auditing,

00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,910
and stuff like that.

00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,730
It is also an enterprise with a social mission, and part of that mission is providing opportunities

00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,840
to people with disabilities, and so much so that about 70 per cent of our staff are people

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,810
with disabilities.

00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:38,490
One of the person in the staff is Ahmed who was born with with low vision.

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,870
Back in 2005, he met with an accident, and he lost sight in his right eye.

00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,360
So, but that didn't stop him.

00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:51,710
He still had an interest in tech, and he ended up become a trainer and goes to a lot of different

00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:57,850
conferences, trainings and workshops to teach people how to make their site successful.

00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,760
When I got to know him, and we got talking, there were - I quickly realised there were

00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:09,530
a lot of things which people who have low vision were confused about, particularly with

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,759
his condition.

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,980
A lot of times, people couldn't understand the way in which his vision worked or didn't

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,069
work.

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:23,370
We also had people who were low vision, and I talked with them as well.

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:30,590
I talked to their colleagues, friends and families, and caretakers as well.

00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:37,530
One trend kept coming again and again which, a lot of times, it was difficult for for people

00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:45,599
with low vision really to articulate what their condition was, how they basically saw

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,480
the work, and sometimes, people who didn't have low vision couldn't understand what was

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,480
happening.

00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,010
So I did a little bit more research.

00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,520
I actually consulted an ophthalmologist as well to get the medical perspective from someone

00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,760
who has dealt with hundreds of thousands of cases.

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,480
One thing was very, very clear: low vision is a very generic term.

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,880
If you say, "Someone has low vision," with a lot of times people assume it is a form

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,320
of myopia.

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,810
That can be the case.

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,220
That's not always the case.

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,200
Sometimes, you have glaucoma, macular degeneration - all these things are there.

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,100
If you ask the random person on the street what is macular degeneration, they might not

00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,349
know.

00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:40,780
One thing became clear, that one of the things I could do is not help people with low vision

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,110
but actually help everyone else understand what low vision is.

00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,110
That's where the simulators come in.

00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,870
I said, can we make something to simulate what the vision is like?

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:58,569
And, if it is possible, can we use the web to do this, and also gravy on top, if we can

00:03:58,569 --> 00:04:05,590
use JavaScript less and SVG have CSS more, that would be more awesome.

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:13,740
The first condition I chose was colour blindness, and this is even more poignant here in Europe

00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:20,139
because eight per cent of men and 0.5 of women of northern European ancestry have some form

00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:27,169
of red-green colour blindness, and the more you talk to people who have red-green colour

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:32,129
blindness, the more you will see in the physical world, not just in the online world but the

00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:37,120
physical world, there's still a lot of stuff in which you need to determine whether something

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,749
is red or green, right?

00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:44,599
The most obvious example is traffic lights, but that's not just the case.

00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:51,819
If you have the MacBook charger, if you charge it, and you want to look from afar whether

00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:57,629
it is still charging, the only way to distinguish it is whether it is red or green in colour.

00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:59,659
That's it.

00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:05,650
So I made a tool which you can actually simulate the different conditions.

00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:12,590
This is using WebRTC and applying SVG on top.

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,129
The reason why it is actually pretty useful is because a lot of times, people get it wrong.

00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:27,930
I asked a lot of people with normal 2020 vision, what would it be like to live with colour

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,539
blindness and see something red in colour, what would they see?

00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:38,680
A lot of times, people become confused and don't know and assume it will be a desaturated

00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,300
version of that image.

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,300
That's not the case.

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:48,999
Over here, we can see that, in one condition, you will have this bench as brown in colour.

00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:51,460
On the other hand, you will have something light greenish in colour.

00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:56,349
The real colour is actually red.

00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:57,599
How do we actually do this?

00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:08,219
I use something called SVG colour matrix, which is a set of matrix values that you provide.

00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:10,440
It basically works like this.

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,050
You have an image.

00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,580
Each and every image will have an RGBA value.

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,839
You have a matrix with a set of values over here, and all you do is matrix-multiply the

00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:26,159
values together to form a new colour for that particular pixel.

00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:31,469
You can define an SVG colour filter over here.

00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:42,210
Then the colour matrix, and values, you can write out all the values come are a-separated.

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:50,800
In the CSS, it is as simple as saying filter URL, hashtag, whatever.

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,949
That's all very, very nice to know, right?

00:06:53,949 --> 00:07:00,760
But it's one thing to have an academic or mathematical perspective of how SVG colour

00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,270
matrix works, and the other is to have an intuitive understanding.

00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:11,020
The only thing that I've seen which grants you that is experimentation, unfortunately.

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,240
You can't get it how it works, just by learning a few things.

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,479
You need to experiment.

00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:26,379
Fortunately, if you Google, the SVG playground, where you can mix and match different values

00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:31,530
and see what the output would be, and that gives a better perspective and a more intuitive

00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,530
understanding.

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:38,889
I will be sharing the slides later on as well with links to some really, really nice articles

00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:46,949
opinion let's take this opportunity to know about the matrix and put it in our pocket.

00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:50,379
We will revisit this later on.

00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:56,991
Now that we have a tool which can address different colour blindness conditions, one

00:07:56,991 --> 00:08:02,389
of the things that I also - when talking with people with red-green colour blindness - I

00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:08,960
say how do you distinguish between red and green and nothing else?

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,219
It's a bit difficult to do so.

00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:15,930
I made something which, for lack of a better name, I called the red-green sheet.

00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:22,229
On the left, you have one example of the test which is generally a set of tests which is

00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:24,680
used for people to diagnose colour blindness.

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,159
If you don't have colour blindness, you will see 74.

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,450
If you do have it, you will see something like 21.

00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:43,330
Over here, let me just go back, you can see I've made something where you're basically

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,010
isolating things into two categories.

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,280
If something is red, it goes into the left category.

00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,800
If something is green, it goes into the other category.

00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:00,720
This is all done in real time, and it's done using CSS and SVG.

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,430
The only JavaScript part is getting the camera output.

00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,840
So this is how we do it.

00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,590
The first thing that we do is apply an SVG filter, and the second thing we do is apply

00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,730
a mixed blend mode of hue.

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,800
Simple, but it hides a lot of complexity behind it.

00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:24,610
Let's revisit this, see and go into a deeper dive into what this means, and how this effect

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,210
is actually done.

00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,070
To do that, let's go really, really back.

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:38,810
How many people watched Looney Toons when they were a child?

00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:40,680
Everyone.

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,430
All these cartoons use something called cell animation - "cell" standing for celluloid

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:55,430
- and the reason why is these were transferring sheets, and, generally speaking, in any kind

00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:01,760
of animation, you had a bunch of characters moving around, but you also had some background

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,610
which was static.

00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,920
What you could do is basically have a sheet where you just paint the background once and

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,500
be done with it, and all the other stuff you can do with the character animations and put

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,140
one layer on top.

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,860
A lot of these animations were done like this where the character animations were done by

00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:27,150
one team, and the background animation or painting was done by some other team in parallel,

00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:32,020
and then the final result was putting those layers on top of each other.

00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:37,060
This was basically an early form of what we call compositing.

00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:43,740
Compositing and blending, the spec is based off this, but come positing and blending has

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,860
been around for a long time, even as part of SVG.

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,750
So what exactly is composting.

00:10:49,750 --> 00:11:02,720
It is it's how to deal with - ... what exactly is - it is named after Thomas

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:11,070
Duff who in 1984, they published a seminal paper on how to deal with overlapping objects

00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,660
- this exact thing called compositing.

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,940
At that time, they were in the early 1980s working together on a small company called

00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:26,390
Lucas Film which was doing a lot of pioneering work when it came to digital graphics.

00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:33,040
They basically said in that paper that, if you have two layers, one on top of the other,

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,420
so the top layer is called a source layer, the bottom layer is called a destination,

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,420
right?

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,740
So, in that overlapped portion, you can do pretty much four things: first, none.

00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,870
You don't show anything over there.

00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,600
Second is the source in which you show the top layer.

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,320
Third is the destination in which you show the bottom layer, and the fourth, and more

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,410
interest interesting one, is show a combination of both the top and bottom layer, right?

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,690
And this is where opacity and alpha channels come in.

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,950
Coming back to our example, what we need to do in the first half to recreate the effect

00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:13,370
that we saw in the colour sheet is to somehow make it black and white but own the red colour

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:14,370
showing.

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:20,820
So, in this case, what we do is, if you can see the red-green and blue channels are all

00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,500
zero, right?

00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:30,110
In effect, what this matrix is doing is basically taking this image and making everything transparent

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:34,370
except for the colours which have a little bit of an R value.

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:44,070
Then we come posit it on the original image to get some of the red stuff.

00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:52,360
Value equals zero so it is totally desaturated.

00:12:52,360 --> 00:13:00,440
Then we composite them on top to get the black and white image with just the red showing.

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,360
All of this using SVG, nothing else.

00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,210
Now, the first part is complete.

00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,880
The second thing we want to do is to understand blending and how that works.

00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,890
So blending is basically how to deal with the overlapped portion in terms of colours,

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,250
and the mixing of the colours.

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,820
So, for example, we have this particular layer.

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,290
And then you have a layer on top of it over here.

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,540
So, there's a portion which is overlapping, right?

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,930
How do we deal with the colours over here?

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:37,750
That is the essence of blending.

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:43,350
In a more practical example, let's see this image.

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:50,870
We can have a few layers, we can mix and match them through whatever we want to achieve this

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,470
particular final layer.

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:56,290
This is essentially what blending is, mixing and matching different layers, to achieve

00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,630
a final effect.

00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,910
Let's come back to an example.

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:04,780
Over and over here, we have a container div which is red in colour.

00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,620
Inside this, we have the video, which is running.

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,850
Right now, we haven't applied any effects, so it's just the normal colours.

00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:18,650
The moment we apply the SVG filter we talked about, everything is grey scale apart from

00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,660
the red stuff.

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,840
Then we will apply a blank board.

00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,650
We're applying a hue.

00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,360
This works in the cell space.

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,860
It will take the hue from the top layer and combine it with the saturation and luminosity

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,750
of the bottom layer, so, in this case, all the black and white stuff will be basically

00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:48,240
a grey area, whereas the rest will be bright red, so ultimately you get this.

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,160
So it's just two lines, but it hides a lot of complexity, and it's very, very important

00:14:52,160 --> 00:15:00,420
to know the concept of layers and how it plays into blending and compositing, and with JavaScript,

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,440
if you have a proper understanding of it.

00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,230
One more thing that I worked on was macular degeneration.

00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:20,190
Sometimes, it's called age-related macular degeneration.

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,720
If you have a visual, you can see what it actually means.

00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,510
It's sometimes also pretty tragic or heart-breaking, because a lot of time, it affects people who

00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:35,190
are older, and, by the time they have grandchildren, and sometimes, they have a hard time seeing

00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:41,250
the faces of their grandchildren, and that's - and that's something which if someone else

00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,590
comes in, that's something else which people don't get, the human aspect of how it makes

00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,060
people feel.

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:57,430
So anyways, like I was saying, if I have to recreate this effect using SVG, or just CSS,

00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:58,590
how do I do this?

00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,351
Fortunately, in this case, I don't want to use SVG.

00:16:01,351 --> 00:16:07,950
I can use a radial gradient with a blend mode.

00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:16,290
If you have a container detective which is a radial gradient which is black to transparent,

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,580
and you combine it with the video output, then you ply a mixed - apply a mixed blend

00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,050
and multiply, and you get this kind of effect.

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:31,300
In most cases in web designs, you won't really use this, but if you take the opposite of

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:38,400
it in which you have transparent to black radial element and combine it with an image,

00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,730
then apply the multiplier, then you can get nice effects on images without using Photoshop,

00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:47,390
which is really, really great.

00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:53,960
One thing that I wanted is for you to put it on top of your headsets.

00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:00,420
Nowadays, our headsets are getting cheap, and some of these allow these to use the background

00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,000
to see on the other side.

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,819
Not all of them, but some allow you to do that.

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:08,110
If you do, then you can actually do this.

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:15,409
You can have stereoscopic mode where you have two video elements and you can go full screen

00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:21,120
and use it as part of a VR to get a more immersive experience.

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,240
If you want to do this, right, there are a few things that you want to do.

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:33,249
First, you want to make sure that it displays just one video on portrait mode and two videos

00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:34,249
on landscape mode.

00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:40,789
You have to detect whether something is in portrait mode and hide the video.

00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,860
So it - there is a lot of stuff going on over here.

00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,350
I also want to make sure that everything is full screen so that you don't see the browser

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,720
and address bar, and once you're in that full-screen mode, you don't want to switch between portrait

00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,350
and landscape every time you're moving your head, so you want to lock the orientation

00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,700
as well.

00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
This is how we do it.

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,340
You can have a full-screen API, the moment something goes in full screen, we can use

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,140
the orientation lock API so that it doesn't switch between portrait and landscape all

00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,950
the time.

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,890
One more thing that I do is I use a CSS exclusively for full screen as well, so, in this case,

00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:24,769
I can use along with prefixes, the full screen pseudo element.

00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:28,309
This will just be applied on full screen.

00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:32,659
One more thing that I do is of course have custom CSS for the orientation.

00:18:32,659 --> 00:18:37,549
If something is in portrait mode, it needs a certain set of standards apply than in landscape

00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,549
mode.

00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:44,299
Here you have the media library for orientation mode as well.

00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:52,590
One thing people are not talking about but shed is the fact that in PWAs, of you a lot

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,490
of display modes.

00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:01,389
So you can load a PWA as a normal browser tab, but once you install that PWA you can

00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:04,270
open it up as a standalone app.

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:11,789
In that case, you don't have the browser address bar which means you have increased screen

00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:16,690
real estate that you need to account for and do something with.

00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:23,720
Hero, use the display mode standalone and see what the display mode is, and, depending

00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,350
upon that, you can have custom CSS.

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:34,580
One of the things that I've used, and one last thing, that I leave you with is that

00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,720
none of this actually matters.

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,929
It doesn't matter if you don't actually talk with people and interact with people with

00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,320
real disabilities.

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,870
That's really, really important.

00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:50,350
I like this tweet, which was, retweet if you're tabled and an inspiration.

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:56,119
If the person then stick around to get to know you as a person.

00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:01,059
It got 630 retweets by the time I screen shotted this.

00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:03,090
That's a big thing.

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,289
When you're talking about empathy, you really need to kind of generate empathy somehow,

00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:13,059
and the only way you can do it is actually to be someone's friend, or be listening to

00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:18,031
a person, not academically reading things here and there, right?

00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:20,539
That's one of the things about disability simulators.

00:20:20,539 --> 00:20:25,029
A lot of people think that, just because I have interacted with a simulator, suddenly

00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:28,750
I know everything about people with that particular disability.

00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,850
That's not true.

00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:33,179
Human interaction is always always required.

00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:37,960
A lot of times, people were able-bodied, they put on a simulator, they struggle, and they

00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,789
put it back down, and then they think everyone with that disability is just struggling 24/7.

00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,919
That's also wrong.

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,559
This is a tweet who says not every person with a disability feels they are.

00:20:51,559 --> 00:21:03,639
The insinuation that disability is equal to suffering ... so, when it comes to empathy,

00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:09,740
one layer is yes, you need to think about what other people are finding challenging,

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,110
what problems people are facing, but the other side is actually to get to know what they

00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:20,179
want to do, what their potential is, what they aim for, what are their goals in life,

00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,889
and then what are you going to do about it, right?

00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:29,980
These tools that I try to make, I always forms the idea that, okay, now, actually do a task

00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:35,350
five times, because, by the fifth time, they're not struggling so much.

00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:40,159
Then they realise that, okay, people who have these conditions have developed coping mechanisms,

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:46,029
and actually, kind of gotten used to it, and now they're taking dysfunction just like everyone

00:21:46,029 --> 00:21:47,659
else.

00:21:47,659 --> 00:21:55,190
So, being empathic it's recognising a few things.

00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,869
It's multilayered.

00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:01,549
You need to recognise the challenges that people face, right?

00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:04,480
And it could be something as simple as just believing someone when they say they have

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,519
a problem, right?

00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:11,610
It doesn't even apply to people with disabilities but every kind of marginalised group.

00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:14,460
Listen and believe them when they say they have a problem.

00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,919
The second thing is recognising the strength and potential that people have, right?

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,139
So, if a person really wants to do something, have faith in them.

00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:30,710
I can give you a story of a person who went - who was diagnosed with low vision.

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:37,190
A lot of well-meaning well-wishers said take up pottery or handicrafts or something like

00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,190
that.

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,139
It was coming from a good place but it wasn't the right advice.

00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:46,899
That person wanted to go in tech and do stuff with computers.

00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:52,100
Fortunately, she joined our company and is now one of the top people over there.

00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:58,659
The main thing to recognise is that what other people are supposed to be doing, what people

00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:02,830
are capable of doing under supporting that.

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:09,840
And ultimately, the way in which you display your empathy has to be a combination of all

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,840
these things, just like blend modes, like you have different layers, and you kind of

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,860
like mix and match between different colours, the same thing has to be happening with your

00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,470
approach to empathy as well.

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:27,580
So, recognise the challenges they face; recognise they are capable, they have potential; and

00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,269
then ultimately your action as well, because empathy without action is useless.

00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:34,039
That's the thought that I will leave you with.

00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,039
Thank you so much!

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:35,539
