Description: 
	Accessible by Law! Generating Colors with JS and CSS Custom Properties

In Norway, all websites are required by law to be accessible. That has inspired us rather than constrained us when building our video consultation service. How could we make it easy for users to pick their own brand color, and still make sure they had sufficient contrast? Combining CSS Custom Properties with a sprinkle of JavaScript we were able to create a color palette and components that also meet the WCAG criteria (and learned a lot on the way).

CSSconf EU will be back on May 31st 2019: https://2019.cssconf.eu/

hello my name is the Ginga and I'm

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,830
either and I want to tell you today oh

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,570
but first I want to tell you about the

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,369
law that we have in Norway actually and

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:23,070
inaccessible websites are illegal in

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:30,119
Norway this is a law that has been in

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:33,960
effect this is a lot of in effect since

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:37,020
July 2014 it had unanimous support in

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,730
our Parliament it was backed by NGOs and

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,290
also the industry in Norway so the hold

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,610
industry and everyone is really

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,629
basically agreed this is a good idea

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,640
let's do it

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,160
and then what's interesting also is

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,260
often laws like these are just applied

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,260
to the public sector but Norway it also

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:55,379
applies to the private sector so if

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,809
you're a bank if you're airline you also

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,780
have to follow the law and how its

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,329
defined is that anything that is can be

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,250
considered a main channel to offer

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,680
services or information to the general

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:12,479
public has to be accessible that's

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,460
pretty broad and thing also so when we'd

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,400
say accessibility in this context is

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,759
based on the world the web content

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,860
accessibility guidelines - oh and not

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,299
all of the double-a criteria but most of

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,659
them so all the ones that are in green

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,340
are under the law we have like a bunch

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,600
of links and resources so that were a

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,829
link that we share afterwards and then

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,020
you can get all of the details if you

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,000
want to know and there's the thing is

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,220
there's a bunch of countries that also

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,470
have these laws but in Norway they can

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,290
also have consequences so there's a

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,780
state agency called Die fight they make

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,119
random controls and check the websites

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,880
according to the criteria and published

00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,159
a report online as this this is the

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,549
things that this company has to fix and

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,219
his old public and online and I think

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,009
it's a year or two years ago v CAG was

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,890
actually making headlines in Norway

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,320
these are headlines from two of Norway's

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,179
largest newspapers on the headline SAS

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,950
as a Norwegian airline and the headline

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,599
says SAS fails SS as risking fines

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,860
interesting thing is like it was in all

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,140
of the newspapers it was making

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,970
headlines on the story was not only that

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,440
it made them look well you know

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,630
following the law but it also made them

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,430
look incompetent you don't understand

00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,140
technology because was such a broad

00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,340
support from the industry and also from

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,940
the Parliament it just made them look

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,810
stupid

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,910
so accessibility is something it's not

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,980
really something just a question about

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,970
morals anymore in Norway because

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,170
something you should I think it's

00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,380
something you should do anyway but it's

00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:48,360
also you're risking bad press finds

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:50,610
stuff like that so back to us this is

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,660
our company and this time this is our

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,220
entire company will fit into a selfie

00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,720
and we're based out of Norway that's

00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,519
what we have to care about this law this

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,959
is a Norwegian fjords for you if in case

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,739
you were doubting where we were from

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,720
Norway and so as its mentioned what

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:07,890
we're trying to do is I just to give you

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,470
a little bit of context what we're

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:14,280
trying to do is to make a super easy

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:16,440
video calling so the thing is and is

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,870
that it's in the browser so you can just

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,970
like send someone a link and they can

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,340
open it on any device and then you're in

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,459
the call oh I have to be careful with a

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,720
clicker here yeah in the call so the

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,780
thing is and there's a couple of people

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,790
that do this but why colours comes into

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,920
this is that the people that use our

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,170
service our businesses or professionals

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,410
so could for instance be your physician

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,870
there's offering video appointments

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:44,970
maybe you have a cold like I have today

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,989
actually and maybe you want to talk you

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,540
a therapist even though you're

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:49,709
travelling or maybe sometimes you would

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,180
want to learn something from a

00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,980
professional and the person was best

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,750
suited to teach you this it's on the

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,100
other side of the world like if I want

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,090
to learn Japanese it's probably better

00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:02,790
to get a teacher that's in Japan and the

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,959
thing also these people they have the

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,549
brands you know they already have

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,590
businesses so if they're going to offer

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:10,920
the services they would like to brown

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:13,350
their video calls so just to give you a

00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,440
little bit more like an image of who our

00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,829
client could be this is Siri she's

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,109
amazing Siri funk-rock she's a midwife

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:24,479
she's been running giving advice to

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:26,990
people about pregnancy and newborns for

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,630
like on the instant almost 20 years now

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:32,000
this is a Google it's called everything

00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,470
from mom doctor I know this is a Google

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,300
Translate so this is what she does she

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,580
knows she's the mid-foot she knows

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,310
everything about giving advice as a

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:44,180
midwife she doesn't she's not a designer

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,740
she's not a developer so maybe cuz she

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,300
lets people ask questions about

00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,470
pregnancy online maybe that's a good

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,280
format for video too

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:54,199
okay so it's the case so okay how does

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,300
this what does this have to do with

00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:59,900
accessibility so let's look wheel it all

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,070
up the thing is if you let people brand

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,599
something the first thing you would

00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:06,560
think of is Cola but if we let people

00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:09,410
pick any Cola

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,750
what about the contrasts in a bunch of

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,419
services I'm not here to bash just to

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,430
give some well-known examples if you for

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,680
instance avoid shoes our gel yellow for

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,150
my profile at Twitter that the contrast

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,800
is not good enough or if I choose yellow

00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,970
for our intercom messenger the contrast

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,669
really isn't good enough I have to pick

00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:29,539
another color to make sure that the

00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:31,370
contrast is sufficient and then then I

00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:33,080
and I have to know that that's specialty

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:37,280
knowledge you know what contrast is not

00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:40,070
everybody knows that so here we are CEO

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,650
I was like well I won't post I wanted to

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:45,949
pee can we just let people just pick any

00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:49,009
color and then we just make sure that is

00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:51,560
accessible so the questionnaire for my

00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,630
CEO and then us in will our senior

00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,610
engineer Ivan isn't a designer and

00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,250
looking and I was also here because I

00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,580
took the photo yeah so that's was the

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,690
thing that were we trying to figure out

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,530
okay but to get everyone on the same

00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:08,509
page I think a lot of us know that

00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:12,409
intuitively colors have contrast towards

00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:14,750
each other but what does actually the V

00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:17,330
CAG requirements say for contrast color

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,580
so it says that the visual presentation

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,469
of text and images of text has to have a

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,349
contrast ratio of at least four point

00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:26,990
five to one and for large text the same

00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:28,880
requirement is three to one one of the

00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,919
new things now is that in 2.1

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,780
specification that just came out also

00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,240
non-text elements like interface

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,279
elements buttons and the likes and icons

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,730
also have to have sufficient contrast

00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,810
ratio

00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:44,490
but yeah so what exactly is contrast so

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,320
it turns out that contrast has a

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,940
definition but together that it's

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,160
important to understand one thing first

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,410
and that is that according to V CAG

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,750
every single color has what's called

00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:58,110
their relative luminance or a lightness

00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:01,620
ratio basically telling you how light a

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:05,070
color is from 0 which is pitch black to

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,140
1 which is bright white and get the

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,750
contrast between two colors you do it

00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:13,260
like this so you take the luminance of

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:15,660
the lighter color plus a constant 0.05

00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:18,330
that's just to avoid any division by

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,520
zero issues and stuff like that and then

00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:23,640
I divide that by the luminance of the

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:28,230
darker color like here and that gives

00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,480
you the color contrast ratio to give you

00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,310
a proper example let's look at this

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,370
button right here it's the yellow button

00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:37,320
with black text on it so together the

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,000
contrast ratio between the text color

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,820
and the background here we take the

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,070
luminance of the yellow and divide that

00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:49,260
by the luminance of the black and we

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:50,910
arrive at 12.4 as we know that is larger

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,470
than 4.5 which means that this has

00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,370
sufficient contrast according to

00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,420
requirement and according to the law

00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,860
actually researching this and

00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,020
understanding what where that number

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:02,790
came from was just so cuz we always put

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,230
it into some calculator no yeah that's

00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:07,230
the right number ones like but where

00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,640
does it come from now we know and so the

00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,990
thing is this there's nothing really

00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,450
wrong with this yellow button this is

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,340
our default it's just and then maybe

00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,560
someone comes along that's like a doctor

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,470
or something doctors like blue and there

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,480
Brian color is dark blue and now it's

00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:23,100
suddenly kind of hard to read the button

00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,380
but if you're a designer and you've met

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,210
so this is a quite easy solution to this

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,910
from a design perspective let's just

00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:32,220
flip the call of the text of the button

00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,560
to white and said and then the contrast

00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,800
is sufficient and then we were trying to

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,180
thinking about well what about grey does

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,349
would it will will it work for

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,410
everything but actually if you think

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:46,140
about the math that we just went to when

00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:49,110
the criteria is 4.5 if you have either

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:52,500
black text or white text it will

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,450
actually validate against any color Eve

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,390
any color your shade of gray will either

00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:59,670
violate against white or a black so

00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:04,050
there you have the solution maybe you

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:05,760
can just fix that for me sure okay so

00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,310
you and I we sat down and we started

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,200
going about this problem and we started

00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,030
thinking this is way before we knew

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,850
anything about color contrast or how

00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,530
that was defined I started thinking what

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,400
if we could do math on colors wouldn't

00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:20,610
that be kind of cool

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,590
I mean intuitively colors in computing

00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:26,040
are bits or numbers you should be able

00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:27,480
to do calculations on numbers right and

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,540
it turns out we're not the first one to

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,580
think of this there's an NPM package for

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:36,060
that actually because of course there's

00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,040
an NPM package for that so the NPM

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:41,700
package color lets you do a lot of cool

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,730
stuff with colors it can manipulate or

00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:46,620
convert colors it can rotate them it can

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,140
mix them with other colors you can check

00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:53,040
your lightness ratio you can also test

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,210
their VK color contrast and more but

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,830
there's one problem here all of this is

00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,839
in JavaScript and we don't really want

00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,830
to do all these calculations for every

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,540
single component on our entire page

00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:06,450
ideally we'd want to do this once and

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,370
then apply that or store that in some

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,880
kind of variable that we can use in our

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:14,100
sauce sheets and as Mike just told you

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,530
we can do that now so just in case you

00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,300
are out for that talk I'm gonna go run

00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,850
through it for like one minute and just

00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:22,500
tell you the basics again so CSS custom

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:26,730
properties allows you to define

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:28,290
variables in CSS basically you know that

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,420
means you can reuse color definitions

00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:33,480
and more that can be complex values

00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,480
throughout your stylesheet and they are

00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,339
cascading and they can be overwritten

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,990
the syntax looks like this used a double

00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,570
dash notation to define our custom

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,070
property and you assign it a value then

00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:48,750
you can use that using the VAR keyword

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:51,089
like so you can also manipulate these

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:54,240
from JavaScript using the set property

00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:56,880
function the first argument is the name

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,850
of the custom property and of second one

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,770
is the value this also works for inline

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:04,230
styles if you're using JSX that is one

00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:05,540
approach you can use as well I think

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,970
that's pretty nice

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:11,040
but back to our problem so to solve this

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:15,210
first things first we should import the

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:18,390
color library then we create an instance

00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:20,310
of the of color with our brand color or

00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:23,640
whatever brown color

00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:25,560
the customer wanted it can either be

00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,630
hard-coded like here or do like us we

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,700
load it from the back end and apply it

00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:33,210
asynchronously at runtime for our entire

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:35,550
application then we can simply check if

00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,950
the primary color is white and if it is

00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:41,779
the contrast color is designed to black

00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:44,640
and if it isn't is assigned to white

00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:48,300
then we simply set that using the set

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,310
property tag back to your CSS and in

00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,980
your button component you set the

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,310
background color with war and a text

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:59,100
color to the contrast color like so and

00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:01,589
automatically updates now there's a

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:05,400
bunch of different best use cases here

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:07,170
and Mike talked a lot about those but be

00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,160
diligent and use custom variables

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:10,200
throughout if you're going for this

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,870
approach for theming otherwise you get

00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,700
into issues later and such sensible

00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,980
defaults to avoid any flash of and water

00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,060
content what's neat about this is that

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,950
when we change this at runtime

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:24,209
everything updates at the same time

00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:25,800
which is very good so that was a bunch

00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:29,670
of buttons and that was the talking

00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,740
thanks for coming or wait a second the

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,230
thing is what we have guaranteed now is

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:37,380
that you will always be able to read the

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:40,250
text on the button but what if someone

00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:45,540
comes along and they have a really light

00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:47,130
Frank color where did that button go so

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,600
even you can still read the text your

00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,459
mail might not even understand that it

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,500
is a button at all so the thing that we

00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,779
figure then is well what we would

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,430
typically do and maybe what if we could

00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:59,130
have like a darker version of the same

00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,570
color and add an outline so that we will

00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,310
be sure that people will still see the

00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:06,209
button even if the brown color is really

00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:08,580
light you want to fix that too right so

00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:11,010
this problem is a bit more complex right

00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,810
because there's actually two problems

00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,270
here first we need to generate a

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:17,339
secondary color now a darker primary

00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,790
color which is as close to a primary

00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,170
color as possible

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,490
but still validates against our

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,250
background color which in this case is

00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,380
white and the second problem is that we

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,690
want to add a conditional border that

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,240
only gets applied if the primary color

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,630
is lighter than the current minimum

00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,540
constant ratio how do you do that well

00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:39,550
remember colors yes again so I told you

00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,580
that it allows you to mix colors and

00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:47,380
test contrast oh I was supposed to click

00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:50,110
here yeah so but intuitively if you want

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,850
to make a darker color in real life this

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,650
is the first problem if you have a

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,210
palette with a color that you want to

00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,670
make darker you take a little bit of

00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,380
black and mix that in until you get the

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,350
desired color there are sort of the

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,390
thing for that

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:06,310
okay so let's try to make a function

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,200
that can do this for us is that a

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,390
function get validate the color takes a

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,210
couple of arguments it takes the color

00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:15,100
that we want to change in this case our

00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,780
primary color it takes the color that we

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,240
want to validate against it defaults to

00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:21,490
white there's the minimum contrast ratio

00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:25,180
that we want to achieve and it takes a

00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:26,740
mixing amount mmm this is 0.5 it's quite

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,020
important that this is cool it's a bit

00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,520
low because imagine the same palette

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,530
that you had earlier and you take a

00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,240
bucket of black paint and pour it all

00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,610
over the end result is going to be black

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,810
and you made a mess right so that's not

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:42,610
gonna work you have to do it in small

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:44,020
baby steps to get a proper color and

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,380
then of course last you take the mixing

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:50,020
color so let's look at the body of this

00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:53,020
function so first things let's generate

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:55,270
a new color using the mix function so if

00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:56,650
the color to want to change mix and we

00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:00,730
mixed up with the mixing color and the

00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:03,640
mixing amount then we check if the new

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,830
colors contrast towards white is less

00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:09,070
than a minute constant ratio and if it

00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:10,780
is we call the function again this time

00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:13,090
with a new color as the color we want to

00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:16,960
change and a smaller mixing amounts we

00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:19,890
just do it very very close until

00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,860
eventually we get a color that validates

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:24,110
against white

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,310
someone engineers serum I think well

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,380
haven't you made a function that could

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:30,320
potentially run forever and the thing is

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,000
that black will always validate against

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,410
white lease for the minimum conscious

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,880
ratio there is no chance that this

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,370
actually running forever you always end

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:42,380
up with a color that does validate

00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:43,790
against white and once we have that we

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,620
can simply call the function with a

00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:48,350
primary color and get the primary color

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:55,010
darker primary color back and we set

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:56,510
that back into our CSS so onto our next

00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:00,140
problem adding a conditional button

00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:03,440
border how would you does well in the

00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:05,360
normal case there is no border at all so

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,480
let's tackle that problem first so we

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,530
create a custom variable custom property

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,930
that has the button border which has the

00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:16,430
default value of none and then we assign

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,100
that to the border property of our

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:23,780
button and now presto we have a button

00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:26,210
with no border but in our CSS we can say

00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,980
if the primary colors contrast against

00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,790
white is less than minimum constant

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:34,160
ratio update that property and set it to

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:36,950
2 pixels solid and our second or are

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,560
darker primary color and that means that

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,600
now we have a conditional border that

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,400
will only show up if the color that the

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:48,440
customer set is less than the minimum

00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:49,790
contact ratio so just to sum it up a

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,490
little bit so for instance if we have

00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,230
the Year color yellow we will generate

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,600
lighter and darker versions of that

00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,920
because we also you suffer other

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,870
interface moments like hovering and

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,300
stuff like that if we have a darker

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,830
color we would change the text to white

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,839
and then also have the lighter in the

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,640
darker if the color is really light we

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,010
add a border and also have these lighter

00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,449
and darker ones but then you know so

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:12,589
they're doing the math in the back here

00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:13,970
and mean the design you're working

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,830
together and you would also think well

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,480
aren't you done now what more is there

00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:19,070
like how many colors you really need on

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,910
the website and this time I was like

00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:25,310
well what about secondary colors and you

00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:26,750
should never base any functionality on a

00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,760
color alone because of colorblindness

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:30,620
but for people that do see the whole

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,940
spectrum it can actually be kind of

00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,620
confusing if everyone thing is like

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,180
really strong in the same yellow it's

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,000
gonna be overwhelming

00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:40,430
and and he's like if we have a brand you

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,870
typically have more colors and I'm I

00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:43,730
really rolled in the companies to work

00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,700
with user friendliness and usability in

00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,320
UX and they're like oh my god I'm trying

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,540
to imagine how I'm gonna explain to you

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,370
sir yeah pick one color and we're gonna

00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,080
use this for that and pick another color

00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,400
maybe is gonna use this for that and

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,290
like it was like this is never gonna

00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,330
wouldn't work just we have to make it so

00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:01,520
simple if we just ask them for one color

00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,020
and every we just fix the other one so

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,000
again we're looking well we've figured

00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,190
these other things out how can we go

00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,490
about can we try to generate the

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,500
secondary colors somehow and so just to

00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,360
give you an example this is like our

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,810
default colors so what we would want

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:19,820
we're using the secondary colors here

00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:21,500
for instance if there's a notification

00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:24,410
or like a warning or something like that

00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,850
so ideally we want to color the face

00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:28,130
with the original brown color that

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:31,910
doesn't crash too much but it also seems

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:33,680
like a different color and when you

00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:36,170
think about it like looks nice together

00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:39,530
it's kind of different where's the

00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:41,210
where's the math in that the other ones

00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,310
required clear was like is that is there

00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:46,400
a number for that looks nice together if

00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:47,810
it's kinda different and so I just we

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,460
were discussing trying to like bullet

00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,810
has to be a pattern here so we discussed

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,360
this with our design you like so when

00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:55,190
you make brands you know from the ground

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,380
up how do you go about choosing the

00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:00,500
secondary colors and you started talking

00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:02,420
about color wheels and there's like a

00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,500
bunch of different people for hundreds

00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,950
of years people have thought about

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,300
colors and concept of color wheels it's

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,290
not really important what color wheel

00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,570
we're talking about they're just the

00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:13,790
concept of color wheels and the thing

00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:16,730
isn't how all of these are represented

00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:18,650
if you go on the top here and then you

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,270
try to move what he said it's like well

00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,580
I try to just move slightly down the

00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:26,270
circle until we find something that

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,970
looks like a new color but it still goes

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:30,710
good together you know so you don't go

00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,800
all the way around the circle could then

00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,390
is gonna look quite horrible and then

00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,310
I'm gonna introduce you to on your color

00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:40,370
wheel these are quite old but then here

00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:44,300
we have the HSL color wheel so HSL color

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:46,910
is built up by tree values you have Q

00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,600
which is a degree from 0 to 360 degrees

00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:52,770
so that's important for us and RL

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,570
saturation and then we have lightness so

00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,370
actually this color wheel expresses

00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,130
exactly what our designer was talking

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:01,500
about because what if we could just

00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:04,170
rotate to hue so for instance if we

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,750
repair the brown color is red we would

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,640
rotate it and we're like and some I

00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,900
discussed this with like a developer

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,840
like how did you come up with this

00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,730
number of sixty degrees just like no we

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,590
just went with sixty degrees that's just

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:18,090
like a gut feeling thing so like there's

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,670
no math behind sixty that's just

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,500
intuition that's just competence of our

00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,140
designer six degrees we looked around

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,060
the circle like yeah that's gonna work

00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:31,260
and you know mid there was the math

00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:32,760
there after all yeah so going into this

00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,430
we thought well this is gonna be super

00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:38,160
hard to do but turns out it really isn't

00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:40,890
because you just use only color jazz you

00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,600
can use to rotate property and get

00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:46,110
another color and what it does

00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:49,440
essentially is just add the hue degrees

00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:50,790
in CSS and actually funny thing is we've

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,310
been fretting about this talk for maybe

00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:55,140
two months now and try to go over and

00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:59,130
find stuff we could improve never meet

00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:00,570
Mike earlier and then we've been talking

00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,220
about but he shows me this demo I've

00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,770
actually can do all of this in CSS and

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:08,790
I'm like damn it I wish I'd done that

00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:11,010
I've told her that before yeah so with

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:13,410
this you get a secondary color you can

00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:14,790
set that back into our CSS and we can

00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,620
also use the same functions to generate

00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:20,340
darker or lighter variants of that as

00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:23,220
well okay so now we have a bunch of

00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,620
rules how can you actually bring that

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,450
back in together into a team engine so

00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:30,360
what we did is they created a rack

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,580
component that we call theme and what

00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,260
this component does is that it takes a

00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,750
property brown color which we load

00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,880
asynchronously and it uses that to

00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:43,290
calculate all other colors according to

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:46,350
our rule sets and when working this like

00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:48,000
this it's important to remember that you

00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,150
never hard-coded values anywhere here

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,190
CSS you always use CSS custom properties

00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:55,140
because what you get out of it is a

00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,480
single style sheet that is infinitely

00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:00,120
brandable we can apply to any color and

00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,309
it gives you a decent result back

00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,159
and it also means that you can do a lot

00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:06,240
of cool performance things for example

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,970
you don't have to do server-side

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,770
rendering to generate a new CSS for

00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:13,890
every single customer you can just store

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:16,380
one value and then apply it at runtime

00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:19,529
this means you can cache at CSS forever

00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:22,140
for example you can also do critical

00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:23,190
path rendering and stuff like that and

00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:27,330
you don't have to do that for every

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:28,620
single organization you might serve and

00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,039
using the thing component looks like

00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,289
this

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,779
so theme applies all these custom

00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:36,570
properties to its own element and thanks

00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:39,899
to CSS when we wrap our entire Apple

00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:41,820
component in it every rule will or every

00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:44,159
color will apply to every component ins

00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,140
and outs and this is also infinitely

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,899
nests table so for example we want to

00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:50,549
give a rich preview the updates in real

00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:54,210
time for the customer to see how their

00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:57,720
color looks in real time we can do that

00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:59,580
we just wrap the preview in a new theme

00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:02,600
component and it doesn't affect anything

00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:05,669
else on the page which is really neat

00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,039
yeah yeah so the thing is now we could

00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:10,380
like to confidently say to see yeah just

00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:12,270
pick any color you like it's not her job

00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,730
to think about the accessibility law

00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:16,799
that's our job and what I think is

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:21,059
really fun here is that when we put in

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:23,610
her brand color which is pink look can

00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:25,649
you see this automatically generated

00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:29,309
secondary color there in the progress

00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:31,289
bar and then look at her logo so the

00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:33,240
algorithm actually went for a secondary

00:23:31,289 --> 00:23:35,039
color that's basically the same that was

00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,380
already in her logo so it's like it's

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,520
something's nice to have a designer and

00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,110
your team they just give you the

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,929
algorithm that's how you make your

00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:46,770
brands oh maybe not that easy but anyway

00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:49,020
so this is a with the simple thing now

00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,840
like if people pick different colors it

00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,460
still has like really this clear picture

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,169
of their brand it looks very differently

00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,299
depending on the color that you pick but

00:23:55,169 --> 00:24:01,230
it's still the same elements and really

00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:03,179
like brings the brand forward so of

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:06,360
course there's gonna be a demo so now if

00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:08,130
you can pray to the demo god I promised

00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,520
myself I would never do a live demo on

00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:13,340
stage and I'm gonna do it anyway and

00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,920
gonna work I promise yeah so here we

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,600
build a tester that lets you test out

00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,790
all these colors using the color picker

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,430
for input and you can see in real time

00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:25,360
here that now we have applied the border

00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:28,820
property live and if ever example go

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,200
here you have some darker colors and it

00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,000
works you can see all the code if you

00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,050
scroll down you see the buttons - yeah

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,790
ok so here are some test things so even

00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:40,130
if I pick bright white that actually

00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:42,260
works and you can rotate this around and

00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:44,360
it's really fast and snappy thanks - we

00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,010
only do this once we started into CSS

00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,930
and it automatically updates everywhere

00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:51,580
and we can try looking at with

00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:53,240
colorblindness - yeah so we have a

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:56,630
what's it called again

00:24:53,240 --> 00:25:00,230
oh yeah but if I click there we go oh

00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:02,800
yes let's try for example red week yeah

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:08,360
that works good how about monochromatic

00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:11,200
yeah that looks good yeah so this also

00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:15,440
works for different kinds of

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,090
colorblindness and so there's a link

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,130
where you can test this we'd be really

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:22,250
fun if like if someone manages to break

00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,900
it or like find the color where the like

00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,480
automatic thing just makes like a

00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,300
there's a horrible job that would be fun

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,510
and just tweet us with it and like

00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,860
there's a hole but it looks it doesn't

00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:35,300
look that good with red I don't know

00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,900
what's wrong with red than yellow

00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,970
something the algorithm fails there yeah

00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:42,560
definitely not done yeah so the thing is

00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,180
so we're gonna leave this link up a

00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,410
little bit hmm

00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:47,870
so we've been talking here about

00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:50,480
accessibility and accessibility law and

00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,970
and of course important for me to just

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,500
underline it this means in the way that

00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,470
I believe that our team is done with

00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,160
accessibility and I don't think

00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:00,950
accessibility is a thing that you can

00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,330
never think of us done it's it's but it

00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,100
does goes for everything that we do

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,540
online if it's performance or usability

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,890
and accessibility just has to be

00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:09,740
intertwined with the work that you do

00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:12,590
and something you do continuously but I

00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:15,710
think that I want to come bring to you

00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:18,410
is through this process it became really

00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:21,320
clear to us that Jesus all right yeah

00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:23,280
sorry he just pressed the keyboard what

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,710
I thought I saw the many on time

00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,040
is that it's the team effort yes yes you

00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:30,030
can see here a great time effort and

00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,470
thanks so much better when you work

00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:35,220
together someone gonna click the keys

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,960
for you but the thing is we we are and

00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:38,220
we were an interdisciplinary team and I

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,780
don't think we would ever have come up

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,040
with the solution if we would have been

00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,260
working on it on our own that's a

00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,800
combination that made this possible and

00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:48,990
I also want to I really love this law I

00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,540
think it's wonderful I don't see it as

00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:52,860
like a constraint or something oh no we

00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:55,850
have to make it accessible it's not a

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:58,740
deterrent to us at all and I think that

00:26:55,850 --> 00:27:02,040
for developers and or designers I think

00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:04,620
would almost always really love with our

00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:06,600
jobs it's this challenge it's like when

00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,340
you get these puzzles like how am I

00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,500
gonna solve this and suddenly you find

00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,350
the aha moments and that's such a

00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,720
satisfying feeling and accessibility can

00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,700
give you a bunch of those and in that

00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,420
perspective you know this is one of the

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,610
most fun things that I've done and and

00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:25,290
and it's a good thing for someone let

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,150
that's like a bonus it's fun and you're

00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:30,120
making the product accessible for more

00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:34,430
people as I mentioned here like a demo

00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,480
resource and yeah thank you thank you

00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:36,070
[Applause]

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,560
[Music]

00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:40,650
[Applause]

00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,650
