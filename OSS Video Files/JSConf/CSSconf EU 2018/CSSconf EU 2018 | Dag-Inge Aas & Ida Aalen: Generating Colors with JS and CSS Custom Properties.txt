Description: 
	Accessible by Law! Generating Colors with JS and CSS Custom Properties

In Norway, all websites are required by law to be accessible. That has inspired us rather than constrained us when building our video consultation service. How could we make it easy for users to pick their own brand color, and still make sure they had sufficient contrast? Combining CSS Custom Properties with a sprinkle of JavaScript we were able to create a color palette and components that also meet the WCAG criteria (and learned a lot on the way).
