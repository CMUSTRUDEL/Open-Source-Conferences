	Container Queries: The Past, Future, and How You Can Actually Even Use Them Today

Container queries have been one of (if not the) most requested CSS features for several years now, and yet there are no specifications attempting to design them nor browser vendors attempting to implement them. Why is that?

The truth is that while high-level CSS container query APIs aren’t currently being worked on, several low-level web primitives are being developed that will make container queries possible. In this talk I’ll present the history of container queries, explore the challenges they present, and show you how several new browser APIs actually do make container queries possible today.
