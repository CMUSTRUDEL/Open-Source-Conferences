day I will show you some machine

00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:10,180
learning stuff and it's very specific

00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:14,920
it's not only machine learning but it's

00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:17,619
newer networks and zero slides all I'm

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,320
showing you in this next 30 minutes is

00:00:17,619 --> 00:00:22,390
this thing and unfortunately even though

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,939
it's very powerful is it's a great thing

00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:29,140
it overwhelms you when you when you file

00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:31,630
at all and how do you do that like this

00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:34,860
it's called playground dot ten o'clock

00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:37,690
and when you start it looks like it I

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,350
think they made a mistake in showing too

00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:43,570
much at first but first thing we will do

00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:46,329
is disable all that stuff so if you try

00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:49,449
it at home you scroll down and then you

00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:52,230
find if you check boxes and then you

00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:52,230
uncheck all of it

00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:00,749
no double-clicking I'm very bad at that

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:03,670
you see it may take five minutes sorry

00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:06,490
I'm checking all of them people check

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:11,550
some of them again later but first I'm

00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:14,800
check over then refresh the page oops

00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:18,130
and looks like this so it's much simpler

00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,580
now because a lot of stuff has

00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,350
disappeared the main thing the main

00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,000
thing or the thing that you should use

00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:29,770
to get started on the right side here

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,230
and what you see is a two dimensional

00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:35,320
coordinate system and on that coordinate

00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:41,230
system you have dots the blue ones and

00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:46,330
the orange one and it works like this so

00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:48,280
this is pressed axis it's called x1 and

00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:52,210
this is the second one it's called x2

00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:57,340
and what do you have here as an axis

00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:59,229
this one x1 x2 is this thing here also

00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:01,149
called x1 and x2

00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:04,320
so this is important to know that

00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:06,969
there's some sort of like like

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,129
connection between those two and works

00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:12,519
like this and so each of those parts is

00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:15,310
one orange one every one it is somewhere

00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:20,819
on that coordinate system so the input

00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:24,569
for something has to be x1 x2 so simple

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:29,799
now what the whole system tries to do is

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:34,030
you fit in all those blue points and we

00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:36,280
feed in all those orange points and what

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,829
the system is supposed to do is to learn

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,220
in which area of that calling system

00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:45,700
will blue points appear and in which

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:49,810
area will orange point and of course

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,940
it's City to do this unless you want to

00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:53,950
do predictions later so this is what you

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,769
see now is it's the so-called training

00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:59,549
set which you feed into the system so

00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:02,260
you tell this whole system here at a

00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:03,910
certain point and it should be blue and

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,579
it changes something in that system

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:08,790
elbow shoulder and later you feed in

00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:12,190
something that you haven't seen before

00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:15,400
and then you hope that the system will

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:19,060
make a good prediction so for example if

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,319
something appears here or color blend it

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,920
has what would you say

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,329
what is it all right right and for us

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,280
it's very easy because we're very good

00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:29,319
at something like pattern recognition we

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,100
see the pattern so there it looks like

00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:35,350
like a circle in the middle and rest

00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,970
properties already we see that because

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,750
we have brains we can do that but the

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:44,260
machine it has to learn it and now I

00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:46,060
will try and make the Machine done that

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,450
stuff and by the way if you have

00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:53,170
questions I know it's a big room but

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:56,349
just shout I don't know so um now I'm

00:03:53,170 --> 00:04:00,370
trying to change the system but I can't

00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:02,410
because I'm check too many boxes so

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,359
there's the play button and the play

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,770
button it actually starts the whole

00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:12,110
training thing you can do

00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:14,720
something else a motion layer set button

00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,610
is also interesting so you would see the

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,780
effect of this in the second so test

00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:23,420
data is also good level that we don't

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,310
need it so picking refresh so if you

00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,660
want to repeat that you do this the same

00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,750
thing and now all of a sudden if this

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:35,120
button is the play button and the reset

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:39,440
button and you can do something like

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,320
this I'm just making it simpler so what

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,210
I did is I configured the neural network

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,310
like the architecture of the network and

00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,520
I told the whole thing just to use a

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:52,280
simple and single neuron so those are

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,150
the input to remember that this X 1 this

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:59,180
is X 2 and this is a so called simulate

00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:03,380
in Europe and what it can do it takes

00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:05,540
two inputs this one it multiplies it

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,520
with weight the weight that you see

00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,060
there and you can change it like

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,490
manually I'm doing it now and by

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:19,280
changing it you see that something on

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:21,860
the right side chain you see that this

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,620
is very big way and you see it expressed

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:27,230
in the thickness of this this connection

00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,390
and I can also change this thing it's

00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:32,120
like multiplying this input with a

00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:35,060
certain number and what I'm trying to do

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,070
like many of you right now is to what

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:41,900
I'm trying to maybe you tell me what

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:45,020
what is it then I'm going to do you I'm

00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,620
trying to adjust those ways that this

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:51,680
thing here this whatever this is I am

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,600
trying to separate the blue dots from

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,870
the orange dot but what you can see

00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:01,190
maybe you see it is whatever I change

00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:05,180
here all I get is a light you see this

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:08,060
is like the like how hard is this place

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,490
and the the slope the speediness of the

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,990
line I can change or changing those

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,849
weights you see that

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,340
but what I cannot change is that it's

00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:20,220
the line and this is because this is how

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:25,870
a neuron works like a simulated neuron

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:28,120
what it does actually is to sum up those

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,699
things as I said multiplied with weight

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,250
then put it through so-called activation

00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:35,590
function twitches should not concern you

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,289
and then it outputs something and this

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,870
makes the prediction I'm dry I'm drawing

00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:48,190
it for a second round so what it does

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:54,840
here is x1 times weight 1 plus X 2 times

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:57,969
y2 and if you do this like in a in

00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,300
equation you may know that this is

00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:03,550
actually the equation for what

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,169
mathematically book it's a lie right so

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,509
if you if you do some sort of

00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:09,780
transformation at a certain point you

00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:14,349
get something like I know steepness

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:16,210
times X plus offsets and it'll be and

00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:19,240
this is this is the equation for life

00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:21,880
so what you see is in single you earn

00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,479
can draw a line and this is what it does

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,210
right is it a good line I mean is it

00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:30,370
good it's that line good at separating

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,529
the blue dots from the orange dots is it

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:36,639
good it sucks

00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:38,740
right because you don't even you can

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,250
only see it but there's also a measure

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:47,740
up here and it helps you how good it is

00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:48,310
at it and it is not even 50% so 53% are

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,960
wrong

00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:55,029
so this is a very bad line but I started

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,979
like doing this manually but what I can

00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:58,979
do is I let this run

00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:08,209
it's still such a lot I reset it sorry

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:10,999
settle sometimes it was run now and

00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:15,979
outward it as it tries very hard to like

00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:20,269
draw the line properly and I can go and

00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:23,149
come as meta it will try for a while but

00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:26,029
now you can see there curacy up here

00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:29,599
like how well is doing it's 40%

00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:33,349
no it's the other way around so no it's

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:37,069
right no worries so 40% is wrong so 40%

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:38,629
is still wrong would you be able to draw

00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:42,310
the line in a way that it could actually

00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:45,500
separate the blue from the orange things

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:49,569
it was a circle that's 2 but if it is a

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:52,430
light not possible as a circle thing I

00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:55,939
think it's even possible here let me see

00:08:52,430 --> 00:09:01,759
it should be this right it doesn't make

00:08:55,939 --> 00:09:03,259
any sense so let's see holy goodness so

00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,589
with the circle it's possible and you

00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:08,389
see the test gloss it's it's almost you

00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:10,459
so it's almost possible with a circle

00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:12,860
and but this this was something like a

00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:14,180
trick this is unusual probably most of

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:17,750
the time you don't pre process the

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:20,420
inputs but you use just the line but I

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,269
think if you stick to a line we really

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,790
see that it's not possible to ever get a

00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:28,880
good result line because there's just no

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:31,250
way what I can do now and this is the

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,449
like the trick of the neural network if

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:39,769
you add neurons and I'm doing it

00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:41,449
second one so the initial weight which

00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:43,399
is the thing that is actually variable

00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:44,600
is that he can change the initial weight

00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,180
it's just random

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,380
it's just something now when I'm

00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:54,170
starting the training let's see that now

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:57,139
you use two lines and you see how they

00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:59,059
look how they look by looking at this

00:09:57,139 --> 00:10:02,500
with visualization here this is the

00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:02,500
first time this particular

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:08,480
and now they're combined in a way that

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,569
they form this shape and now the test

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,699
laws like how many wrong predictions you

00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:17,360
have with the testing thing is 18

00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:20,540
percent it's much better do you think if

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:27,379
I keep on training would be possible to

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:35,029
get close to zero no certain I'm good

00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:37,579
I'll do it that line I reset that and as

00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:39,050
you may have expected after a while you

00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:41,149
get something that's pretty close to a

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:47,199
triangle because you're free line right

00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:47,199
it's not perfect but it is very close to

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:55,370
well still goes down I think we get very

00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:57,470
close to at least less than 1% so this

00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:59,839
actually fixed the whole thing so this

00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:04,509
was good enough this was was a preview

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:10,840
of thing so you can keep adding things

00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:18,160
no it's wrong sorry or neurons

00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:21,220
more batteries brain good you can't see

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,680
it but my cell actually started like

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:27,070
working here my machine but quite

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,890
intense for this small machine that she

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:32,130
can't calculate that prediction and you

00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:34,840
see this thing here is totally useless

00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,880
anything this thing is useless probably

00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:41,310
already have too many of those but I

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:45,940
could still keep anything doing it again

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:48,640
okay what works so it doesn't get any

00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:52,570
better or much better so we see probably

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:57,570
good architecture for new your net three

00:11:52,570 --> 00:12:01,960
of those now next thing I said the real

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:03,790
purpose of this is not to get a very

00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:07,900
good prediction for the so called

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:10,230
training set like the the dots that I

00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:14,070
feed in but for something else like four

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:20,080
dots that I have not seen before yet and

00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:24,580
this thing actually can do it I think I

00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,000
need to check one more box should be

00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:28,480
called

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,860
I know there's something that's called

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,860
test you see it anywhere

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,630
where is it

00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,160
I have

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,550
oh good yes it is all the places now you

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,070
see two losses here I don't know why we

00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:53,070
didn't see it earlier and this is

00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,959
because there's two sets of dots here I

00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:58,140
think it's hard to see but some of those

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,790
dots they have a black surrounding like

00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:03,440
back black borders and has a white

00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:07,589
border you see that is it possible and

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:10,800
the data that I used to train the whole

00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:15,060
thing it has obviously it has a white

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,220
border but there's another set of data

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,519
and this set of data it has black

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,140
borders this is like randomly splitting

00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,760
your group like the amount of

00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,220
information that you have it is

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,779
something they use for training to start

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,060
with the white borders and it is

00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:34,709
something that you use for testing like

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:36,930
how well did I do and you get two losses

00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:40,200
now you get one for testing that's

00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:42,000
useful like sorry the other way you get

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,709
one for training that you use to train

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,120
the network and the yellow fantastic and

00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:50,730
that's let's have a look and you also

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:53,399
get like to grasp on I see that it's

00:13:50,730 --> 00:14:01,949
slightly diverting here they're both

00:13:53,399 --> 00:14:03,930
going down still going down so training

00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:07,350
is a little bit better than test but

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:09,060
only with a very small margin and what

00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,519
we say if you if you had the training

00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:15,110
result like this is a good result as a

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:18,810
bad what do you say like intuition good

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:20,699
it's a good one it's pretty good so this

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,529
is exactly what we wanted so some of

00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:24,360
those spots we didn't know that they

00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:27,420
would be there but we just save that for

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,579
later and we can actually choose how

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:34,130
many of them this is 50% like splitting

00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:37,079
50 for training and 50 protesting and

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:40,610
that's quite unusual spread like this

00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:43,560
but it's a default you often see 60 for

00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:45,630
training and 14 for testing or even 80

00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:47,970
for training and 20 for testing it

00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,560
depends it depends how how many data

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:51,209
sets you want to save to make very sure

00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,250
that that you have very good results and

00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:54,640
it also depends on how many data sets

00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:58,330
you have at all

00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:03,850
to change it to I don't know eggie think

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:06,340
this is pretty common so that means 80%

00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:09,640
of those thoughts used for training and

00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:14,050
20 for testing it's still good still

00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:15,490
works well but you can do something else

00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:18,460
or we can see something else

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:21,370
with the whole thing and this is when I

00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:24,430
make the your network ridiculously

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:28,090
complex and I can do it so this thing

00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:30,370
allows me to have one so-called hidden

00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:32,290
layer this is a hidden layer and has

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:36,790
three new yarns but the whole thing

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:40,180
allows me to add layers like this quite

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:42,070
a few we already know that the

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,780
complexity is too high now what it means

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,210
we will see in a second because we knew

00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:48,660
when we saw that just one single layer

00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:51,610
the three neurons it was enough right

00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:53,620
like the model waswas complex enough in

00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,710
the architecture and it's even

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,810
mathematically approvable that a single

00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:02,650
layer always is enough to solve any

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:07,150
problem in theory practically it's not

00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:08,650
but it's provable that any is a

00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:12,000
continuous function can be approximated

00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:14,860
using the single thin layer but

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,810
sometimes it's just not practically

00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:24,390
feasible and then you can keep on adding

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:24,390
layers and it may be give me

00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:32,760
Lennie's here showing you something that

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:41,820
I didn't prepare any slides and to lie

00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:44,400
to another form there they go this is

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:48,870
the architecture of the Google Network

00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:51,240
the inception network for classifying

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:55,020
pictures and each of those things here

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,420
of these is a layer so there are many

00:16:55,020 --> 00:17:00,030
layers and it's a is branching those

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,780
this would be like the complex model for

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,940
something that's real

00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,340
not-not-not something like separating

00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:08,040
the orange dots from the blue dots

00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:10,140
because this thing is you can can see in

00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,830
a picture what is not the picture like

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:17,190
an example maybe hold it's funny example

00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:19,380
this is this reCAPTCHA it's real so I

00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:22,680
didn't get it some some somebody else

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:26,490
had to like choose three dogs it's not

00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:31,170
very easy especially this thing here and

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:33,110
this and I don't know is this puppy so

00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:37,500
is it nothing I think we can do it and

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:40,440
this thing that I just showed you I said

00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:43,110
this Qi ba ba it's a chihuahua I didn't

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,030
know before I fed it into tensorflow

00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:48,210
like the full version of the playground

00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:52,560
and this is the result that I got so it

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:54,480
had like 86 percent it was very sure

00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,000
like 86 percent sure that it's a she

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,560
mother I had no idea that it was a fear

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,190
while I thought with the dog for the

00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:04,500
random dog so actually that capture this

00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:08,730
thing here of sorry this thing here

00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:10,650
actually it was meant to like tell the

00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:12,840
robot from the human but it's no longer

00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,760
possible like do it because the machine

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,330
can can tell me which is the muffin and

00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,510
which is

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:20,730
already but if you want to do it this is

00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:23,220
our Center and as I said each of these

00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:27,630
things is a layer it has many neurons

00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:29,970
inside and you may know we may like

00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:33,480
understand and believe that training

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:35,910
such a thing is very expensive and you

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:40,230
need a lot of data trainer and I could

00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:43,430
do it like with all my mind so that was

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:48,630
like an excursion you can go practically

00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:51,390
no yeah so I'm doing as much as I can

00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:55,860
now but moneth fixing layers I can't I

00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:58,920
can keep on adding neurons here I'm

00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,960
trying to achieve something to give me a

00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,640
second so now I'm beginning the training

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:10,500
and it doesn't look good right

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:12,560
goes down something good happens oh it's

00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,240
a good sorry I have to do it again

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,690
because it's quite good it should be

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,890
shitty

00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:21,720
sorry and it's always like it you can

00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:25,200
never reproduce the results even in a

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,060
few you have the same like architecture

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,130
and setup of the system there's a lot of

00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:33,690
random stuff inside maybe I'm changing

00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:36,870
this for a while generator

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,870
let's see

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,970
oops as I said so that's random stuff

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,970
inside no training possible in that case

00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,690
okay good

00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,670
they're not good

00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:05,650
you see I'm um getting nervous

00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:05,650
it should be shitty give me a second

00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,500
so if it doesn't work I would have to

00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,410
like tell you what I was trying to

00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:22,550
achieve it's still so good I have no

00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:23,600
idea why so I will tell you what I'm

00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,730
trying to achieve something maybe

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:30,620
someone can help me to mess it up it

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:31,970
should be really bad okay last try if it

00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:40,450
doesn't work then I would just explain

00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:42,740
what I was trying to achieve you know

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,600
okay what I was trying to achieve when

00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,240
the tipping worked quite well I was

00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,770
trying to get those two curves it

00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,990
actually took curves one curve for the

00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:53,810
training loss and one for the test loss

00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:59,180
to get them out of sync like to have

00:20:53,810 --> 00:21:01,100
them one very good and one very bad more

00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:05,150
complex data said not possible I thought

00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:08,500
I should try a more complex model but it

00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:08,500
just doesn't cut it

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:20,060
ah good idea that should be really bad

00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,060
there yes yes

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:29,539
yeah but almost I don't stop it now wait

00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:37,149
I will have at least fake the curve yes

00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:37,149
now huh oh sorry okay last try

00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,900
increase it

00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:57,740
let's see or let's say this is the

00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:01,720
finals I dunno I'm just not getting it

00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:04,820
done and if you saw something like the

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,190
likely loss for the training is very low

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,750
but the loss for the test is high what

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:11,450
will you say is that still a good test

00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:14,740
result is all still good training done

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:17,510
what do you say and what does it mean

00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,670
you could visualize it here so I'm

00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:21,920
having it very hot oh wait I don't I

00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,490
know how to actually like that think

00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:30,170
about it

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:33,220
I'm trying to fix it I'm using a more

00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:35,570
complicated that's what you said right

00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:38,090
it's possible although it was not

00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:40,850
possible so what we're doing now I'm

00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:45,280
using a more complex data set like a

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:48,560
mean data set and I'm trying it again

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:52,280
it's not fair yes there was just a

00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:54,650
perfect it's exactly like I thought it

00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:59,840
should be like the result is still not

00:22:54,650 --> 00:23:06,020
good but getting better now always

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:07,850
perfect thanks a lot so what it tries is

00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:10,760
like to do very good separation between

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:13,370
those two things it doesn't do very well

00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:16,640
yet I think we would have like have it

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:19,160
run for a bit more time I see things are

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,930
actually much more complex now and it's

00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,820
getting better all the time you see the

00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:26,290
the training thing goes down all the

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:28,490
time but the testing it goes up right

00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:31,550
this is exactly what I was trying to

00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:35,000
show it obviously was hard to show it

00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:36,890
with a too simple data set and it's you

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,230
see this will go on for quite a while

00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:41,360
even one with this very simple thing on

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:44,150
my machine it will probably take like 10

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,610
minutes until it actually is very good

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:49,310
at predicting but you see those two

00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:53,470
things are not out diverting what does

00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,470
it mean like what does it mean

00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,440
it's called overfitting right but what

00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,970
does it mean I actually did very good at

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,950
training with my training data but in

00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:06,650
real life which is represented as the

00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:09,440
test data I totally suck I'm not even as

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:12,140
old okay I just crossed 50% but this is

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:17,150
getting this is just like I'm as good as

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:20,030
getting so what it means is this model

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:23,080
here this thing here is still too

00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:25,610
complex so that it is very good at

00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,770
exactly predicting those things if I

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:30,010
keep on training but it's very bad at

00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:33,560
seeing new things so it's always like

00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:36,950
like almost an art to make the model and

00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:40,850
then the the training just as complex

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:43,730
too should be general enough to make

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,260
predictions when you think and this is

00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,870
where we're messed up and this is just

00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:51,470
sort of like like the spiral it's not

00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:53,620
very hard it's a very simple thing it's

00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:56,600
just two dimensions now think about

00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:58,700
training for for data yeah 1 million

00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,740
dogs like though you don't want to just

00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:05,000
recognize those dogs but off in yellow

00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:08,900
and you can also see this here it's

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,660
pretty cool if you know like I did not

00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:15,980
how to probably set it up and because

00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:18,500
time is overall most I will again check

00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:21,530
all of those so if you try it yourself

00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:25,030
that you can see how will look if you

00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:28,220
start it and there's much more stuff but

00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:29,870
all of those stuff you should probably

00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:33,440
just ignore for from the beginning

00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:35,270
because it's over so this thing here you

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,950
just ignore these things this is for

00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:39,800
like how the training looks and this is

00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:41,810
totally esoteric stuff so even though

00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:47,060
like the most advanced people I talked

00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:49,430
to they say it means something it's less

00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:51,290
data tape I read it but it's almost

00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,170
impossible to explain maybe maybe the

00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:56,750
young can do it in in tweets I'm trying

00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:58,940
to implement to make a do it but you

00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,830
probably won't ever touched it so this

00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:04,950
is something you will never touch so

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:07,780
probably you just wanna deactivate it

00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:13,270
that's from my side we still have three

00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:15,070
minutes other questions anything you

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:16,750
like it will you try it at home who will

00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:19,960
actually try it at home and do something

00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:26,470
with so many people this is like this is

00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:28,720
what I try to achieve maybe we have a

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:31,470
quick look at the other data set this is

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:37,380
super simple it's just one line right

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:37,380
this is harder this is the hardest

00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:52,220
so what I'm doing here I did this for

00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:54,770
the circle remember the circle thing is

00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,290
that I'm pre percent in the input I'm

00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:59,060
not just using the pure input but this

00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:00,140
is also common in machine and yet you do

00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,980
something to the input before you

00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,170
actually feed it into the machine

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:06,680
learning and if you choose the right

00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:11,260
thing which I may have chosen now Liana

00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:13,790
isn't fooling me then it might work well

00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,250
and we start with the circle that we

00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:17,660
actually could do it with one urine that

00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,080
probably takes whatever on my machine

00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,080
right

00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:32,790
so I know it's affair it's you watching

00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:37,200
me play you can do it yourself

00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:39,630
I thank you if it if you remember like

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,350
half of what I said you should be up to

00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,360
my level

00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:45,710
at least and then be able to try that

00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:50,070
out it's almost half cool

00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:52,760
okay maybe just if there's no no

00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:57,920
question you can finish it off with this

00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:57,920
entertaining part starting those slides

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:05,790
copy your chicken wing I got all of them

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,820
right but there's one thing this is like

00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:14,100
bagel or a dog and this is really very

00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:16,440
hard and this thing was the hardest is

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,510
it is it like the bottom of the dog or

00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:20,670
is it a loaf of bread and this thing

00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:21,540
here this is this thing here up there I

00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,860
got it wrong

00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,130
but then I thought it was a loaf of

00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:32,550
bread but then I saw the teeth you see

00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:34,860
it's a dog so with that I think they are

00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:36,630
now good to close it and thanks a lot

00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:47,059
try it out at home

00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:47,059
