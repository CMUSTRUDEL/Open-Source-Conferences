okay everyone thanks for coming

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:08,610
yeah first there will be good and then

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:12,090
there will be cake

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:16,590
after that hurtful word okay

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:18,690
yeah my name is Marco I'm from Bremen I

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,740
work at the company called loyal ants

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,890
back to that later

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,340
I'm 42 years old so I guess I found I

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,619
may have found the meaning of life well

00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:32,759
probably maybe CSS maybe it's something

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:37,559
different I'm a front-end developer I've

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,809
been doing that since 2001 and yes I

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,750
work at Norland and we are Silver

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:46,010
Sponsor and we hire all that stuff so if

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,559
you're interested come visit our website

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:54,020
so why am i doing a talk about grid

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:58,079
layout that's easy because it's awesome

00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:02,789
and then some so do you have any

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:07,710
questions no okay um well how did we

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:10,380
build websites in the past here's a

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:15,390
here's a slide which you might be

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,670
familiar with what is that frame says

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,460
right that those are the good ol frames

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:24,420
I'm proposing we use frames now no i

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:28,380
don't but frames were pretty easy to use

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,530
I think and you just head up a frame set

00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,320
and it loads automatically a

00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,479
synchronically in the background every

00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,939
containing element on the website but

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,500
yep there were some problems with that

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:45,479
it wasn't really accessible for them so

00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:49,649
that was bad and it was bad for search

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,860
engines and some other stuff and you

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:56,270
could even include content you don't own

00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:59,240
which nowadays would be quite crucial

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:05,210
back in the past and no one really met

00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,210
took took Mara so um yeah

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:14,430
right so what could that be

00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:19,110
tables right the good old tables yep

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:22,020
many many people even maybe in this in

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:27,600
this house or so were were always teach

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:29,370
taught how to create a website and for

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,640
many years it's been always table layout

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,010
you always do it with tables and yeah of

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,569
course it was quite easy because you had

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,600
easy aligning and centering and

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:41,220
everything you could Center elements

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,250
vertically horizontally however you want

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:49,620
and you could create some pretty

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:53,160
interesting layouts like for example do

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,680
stuff like having a circle and aligning

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,850
things around it that was all pretty

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,840
easy with table but the eventual HTML

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:06,950
looked pretty ugly yeah and that was

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:12,060
what most people would call halo hell

00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:16,019
and it was only good for fixed layouts

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,870
and so we're living in 2017 and

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,690
everything is responsive tables don't

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:26,519
really work on small devices well they

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:31,980
do but they're kind of small right so

00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:35,840
then thanks to people so first what what

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,840
could that be what would you call that

00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:43,380
yes you could call it this hell yeah you

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,109
could call it dividers whatever right

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:52,109
that is what most people called CSS

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:55,650
layout in the past yes those came all at

00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:58,410
once no matter yeah you had websites

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,030
like then Zen garden and you had a list

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,030
apart and you had people like Jeff

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:06,660
resentment who all proposed that and and

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:10,320
said well don't use table layout you CSS

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:12,660
for for laying things out and yeah that

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,959
worked quite good you had to mess with

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:19,600
things like floats and clearing floats

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,750
and which sometimes didn't work like in

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,509
ie6 and sometimes you probably remember

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,639
websites like position is everything you

00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:29,590
had all these crooks that you had to

00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:33,729
mess with and there were all kinds of

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:37,389
hacks how to fix these problems and yet

00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:38,979
eventually we wound up doing only

00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:41,500
display:inline-block and display:block

00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:48,460
and and not messing around with clothes

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:53,530
anymore but then in 2013 I was happy to

00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:57,610
be at a conference in Vassar and I saw a

00:04:53,530 --> 00:05:01,840
talk by by Rachel Andrew and she talked

00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,979
she talked about the stuff that well was

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,750
in the near future

00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:09,729
it wasn't really possible at that point

00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:13,860
but I was really looking forward to that

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:17,620
and one thing of course was flexbox and

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:22,750
as the name suggests it's really super

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:25,830
flexible and right now I back to now

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:28,360
it's it's green and can I use also

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,099
probably everyone in this room if you

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,599
mess with fear that has already used

00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:37,300
black box is that can I have a hand okay

00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:39,130
so that's good but there's only one

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,550
problem it's only working in one

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:44,949
direction right you can only choose two

00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:48,250
to have it in a row or in a column and

00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:51,219
and this sometimes may be a problem so

00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,440
you have like flex boxes inside flex

00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:55,840
boxes and and all that stuff and that

00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,909
really reminds me of tables inside

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:05,110
tables so in this talk by Rachel Andrew

00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:07,090
there was another thing and that was CSS

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:08,680
grid layout if you look at the numbers

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:13,199
well I don't have a cursor right now but

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:17,800
it started in at the end of 2012 and

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:20,229
yeah it's I think it's still it's not

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,460
really finished but of course yeah it's

00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:26,780
the candidates candidate recommendation

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:31,430
but what happens this month

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:33,650
at March 7 Firefox got green and two

00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,780
days later chrome got green so in your

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:39,350
brother's right now of course if you

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,990
have the developer editions you have had

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:45,440
that before but this is green and

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,450
concerning Safari and opera well they

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:54,620
will be when the next version of Java

00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:59,800
and yeah arise iOS not yet there no idea

00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:03,500
when that will come and interestingly

00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:07,220
the part on the on the left is Microsoft

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,460
of course and they have been supporting

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:13,790
it a little longer

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:17,650
eventually since version 11 I think

00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:21,290
maybe yeah that means the first version

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:25,130
yeah but but you need a prefix for that

00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:27,460
and it's only the older version of the

00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:30,830
specification but you can propose

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:33,380
there's a website for honor for that

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,330
where you can propose that Microsoft put

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,790
some more work into it and they are

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,550
currently working on it but it will take

00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:46,130
some time but hopefully not too too much

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:53,840
time okay so yeah let's code not life

00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:59,169
unfortunately but somehow life okay yeah

00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:02,539
what do we have here we have yeah simple

00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:07,700
simple disk with with tips inside I

00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:10,460
think and the dip around it is simply a

00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:14,479
display block and so the elements inside

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:16,550
are also blocked so in cases in all

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,760
these cases you put elements inside this

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:26,419
is the eventual container will grow or

00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:29,810
shrink and yeah that's about it so as I

00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:34,700
heard the only thing to do to enable

00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:40,190
grid layout is to say display grid well

00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:40,919
okay so why why is there no no

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,839
difference to the

00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:49,589
just lock anyone or any idea well it's

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,920
just because the container has no no

00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:55,170
explicit height so if you don't mess

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,630
with the with the elements inside the

00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:04,190
container it will stay the same as this

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:04,190
like block so go there okay

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:21,310
okay that was wrong so that's this play

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:26,950
grid right now and the element around it

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:31,870
has a height 480 pixels so they all

00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:37,590
align vertically from bottom to top and

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:43,150
fill up all the space letters there yeah

00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:45,790
what we can do also is layout the grid

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,030
so we can specify the columns and the

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,300
rows

00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:52,360
unlike flexbox we can do is both way so

00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:56,970
I can say that D I won't have three

00:09:52,360 --> 00:10:01,480
columns and each of them have to have a

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:06,550
value of 300 pixels and the right one I

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:08,920
did in 240 pixels and yeah basically the

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,680
rows defines the height so this is

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,890
hundred 160 pixel and this is 240 pixels

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,890
and

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:27,070
I should have married it unless and now

00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:28,980
okay so when I when I do it smaller

00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:37,750
stays the same

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:43,270
okay what I can also do is no let's

00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:48,340
basically the same what I can also do is

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:51,790
is use another thing but I come to that

00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:54,250
later so this is just good gap you

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:57,160
always know what to do when when you

00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,110
have like good systems like 960 grid or

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:03,820
something like that you always have

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:06,490
defined these gotta a part and in CSS

00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,130
grid layout these are called grid lines

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:12,070
and you can copy it you can define the

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,860
width of these grid lines by pixel or by

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:18,310
percentage and that everything you need

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:21,460
to do you know how in these frameworks

00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:24,490
you always have to make sure that if

00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:28,360
it's the half of margin right or half of

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:31,510
the of the gap and then or margin left

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,930
on the other element and that is also

00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:40,180
quite a hassle in this case with grid

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:43,180
you always only need to put value there

00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,820
and it will lay out automatically and of

00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:49,450
course in this case I'll make the

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:52,620
smaller the grid size stays the same the

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:58,560
gap size stays the same but the elements

00:11:52,620 --> 00:12:03,300
are variable and that's because I am I

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:08,589
used this thing which is a fraction unit

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:11,830
that means I define how many yeah

00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:14,880
columns I want to have and I say how

00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:17,500
much space they have relative to

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:22,210
relatively to each other so when I have

00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:25,839
three values there then each of these

00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:30,410
elements will have one-third eventually

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:34,070
of of the space that is there so that

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:38,420
that's about it so if I do that like

00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:42,860
this like that then the result is that

00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:46,370
you have the width of the container and

00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:51,970
then the gaps get reduced by that and

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:51,970
then the space is evenly distributed

00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,980
yeah

00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,770
what I can also do let's also another

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:05,140
way like in flexbox with order but I can

00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:08,800
say where to certain elements in my grid

00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:12,470
start so I can say grid column start

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,870
right here and grid road start for point

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:18,740
element I get that on the on a second on

00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:22,430
good item - so instead of this it's now

00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:28,010
- is now in the first position on left

00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:34,640
to right there's also a shortcut for

00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:40,070
that which we added some pretty strange

00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:43,460
stuff so this item spans across rows not

00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:45,980
only across columns and I define the

00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:49,880
line the line where it starts and where

00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:52,790
it and so it's not from 1 to 2 which

00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,030
would be quite obvious but now it's 1 to

00:13:52,790 --> 00:14:02,180
3 because I always define the start

00:13:55,030 --> 00:14:05,530
where where the elements are so and of

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:09,800
course I can do stuff like that so this

00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:14,960
this item here this graduate item spans

00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:19,600
from this point across two rows and two

00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:22,170
columns okay

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,170
so

00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:39,000
yeah this is quite interesting because

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:43,649
you have this thing called min max which

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,540
means you define that columns can have a

00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:49,410
minimum size and a maximum size and you

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:53,699
can define it like that so this left

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:58,350
column will always be at least 300 and

00:14:53,699 --> 00:15:02,490
no a max to the max of 360 pick 320

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:06,839
pixels and when I am when I grab the

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:11,310
window and make it smaller it shrinks

00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:15,110
until it's 40 pixels and it doesn't get

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:18,660
smaller than that but the other items

00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:21,440
change so you wonder might wonder what's

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:25,100
with that I just included some

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:30,870
non-breaking spaces so in this case

00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:39,170
these two aren't the same so although

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:42,480
they have the same fraction unit then

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:45,720
there's another thing inside the

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:50,220
specification which is repeat and you

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,839
can have values one is all the fit and

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,579
one is autofill I can't really tell you

00:15:51,839 --> 00:16:02,069
the difference there it's quite

00:15:53,579 --> 00:16:05,130
confusing but what you do like that and

00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:09,209
all of it can be used to have media

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:12,380
queries without media queries so I have

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:16,079
this value of 240 minimum and I have a

00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:20,029
maximum of one fraction and I make it

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:25,290
smaller end the items just arranged

00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:27,420
inside the container when they have to

00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,389
be arranged because there's there's not

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:33,500
enough room anymore

00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:37,040
depending on my sides of my container so

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:40,130
it's quite nice I don't know if I would

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,640
really use it because if sometimes we I

00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:50,060
have to middle with it maybe maybe it's

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:52,540
better than media Cruz yeah that's also

00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:57,560
another thing that's quite nice about

00:16:52,540 --> 00:17:01,340
grid layout you can have named areas and

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:04,490
that's the thing so I created an HTML

00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:06,770
where we have a header and a side and

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,600
article and the footer and I gave them

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:11,810
the names header sidebar content and

00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:16,610
footer and I can actually lay these out

00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:19,699
Crichton up the art so I say that I have

00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:21,890
two columns right and which I define

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:25,130
here so one column is one fraction and

00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:29,240
the other column two fractions or twice

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:32,960
the size of that one and so that means

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:36,020
the head of fans because those two

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,370
columns and the sidebar is here and the

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:44,390
content is here quite obvious like okay

00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:48,490
that put that's kind of explicit so it

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:55,930
may be nicer to layout things like that

00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:55,930
what the HTML here okay the HTML

00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:14,399
quite simple huh okay okay yeah some of

00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:16,799
you might remember that one that's also

00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,419
from the days of Zen Gardner and stuff

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,169
this is the Holy Grail

00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:24,659
where I have a sidebar which has a fixed

00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:26,429
size and I have another cipher which has

00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:31,140
another fixed size and they will always

00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:36,539
stay the same and when I when I make it

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:38,429
smaller only the content really changes

00:18:36,539 --> 00:18:40,460
the size and the other thing stays the

00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:40,460
same

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:50,510
okay and so far for the code now back

00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,340
back to the little right

00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,490
this is a website I've been working on

00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:04,570
for the wheeler for the last three years

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:08,600
I think this is the last version of it

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:11,720
and they came up with was quite

00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:18,050
interesting choices how to how this

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:20,960
article list has to look yeah what cart

00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:25,000
obvious is there are articles inside

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:28,190
that article list but there's also this

00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
thing where where where there since know

00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:37,640
what wears wooden shaft with us and

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:40,880
that's not an article so how do I have

00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:44,620
to what what do I have to do that this

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:50,390
item has the same size as the articles

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:53,660
yeah I did that before CSS grid layout

00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:55,400
and I did something which is which isn't

00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:59,180
really nice so don't look look to the

00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:02,260
code it's their hidden element which

00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:05,780
have a padding top which spans these

00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:09,950
even in these items that don't have that

00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:14,300
so basically where the text behaves like

00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:17,930
the other like the articles inside the

00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:21,110
article list but let's just yeah

00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:25,100
boilerplate HTML inside that only to

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:27,290
have the effect that every every row has

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,770
the same height no matter what's in

00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:35,180
there and of course that's for these 100

00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:38,900
tools and 300 Joules the same and what

00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:43,460
they also wanted to have was yeah that's

00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:47,090
a grid but they wanted to have you

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:50,780
having lines but only inside so I did

00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:54,980
something very ugly I used outline for

00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:59,690
that and of course outline it goes

00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:02,630
around everything so in fact I put white

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:05,990
divs on the left side on the right side

00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:09,929
on the bottom and on the top and yeah

00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:12,600
that's not really nice so eventually

00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:16,289
I will propose to our client that we

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,879
reuse we do that with great layout

00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:20,759
because in grid layout all you have to

00:21:17,879 --> 00:21:25,379
do is is have a background for that have

00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:28,559
a fixed width for example a FOID and it

00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:34,769
will lay out like that because grids

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:37,409
always put the gap inside not on the

00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:40,230
outside if you want to have outside you

00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:46,769
can use border and whatever of heading

00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:53,029
over you want yeah okay there are many

00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:56,419
other features in CSS grid layout like

00:21:53,029 --> 00:21:59,580
you can align these like in select spots

00:21:56,419 --> 00:22:02,129
in most of my examples everything was

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:05,639
stretched but I can all I can say it

00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:07,289
starts at the bar top and it starts at

00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:15,480
the bottom and I can say these for all

00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:18,779
elements individually so I can change

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:22,129
things I can even do something like that

00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:24,869
an element inside the grid spans across

00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:28,230
another element which is which is at the

00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:31,710
bottom you know what I mean so they

00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:34,019
overlap like that I have one that goes

00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,789
there and and that maybe there's a use

00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,830
case for that I don't know and of course

00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:40,440
there are a lot of short hands are most

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:45,899
of the things that I use can be written

00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:52,080
in shorthand so that's kind of nice ok

00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:55,399
so if you wanted deep does if you want

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,019
to dig deeper into a grid layout

00:22:55,399 --> 00:23:00,720
actually Rachel andrew has this

00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:02,909
wonderful website called grid by example

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,049
which lists all these things and she

00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:10,649
also has video tutorials about that so

00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:14,009
go there and it's quite easy to learn

00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:18,869
you take one one afternoon and you're

00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:22,759
basically done and ready to go ok and

00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:22,759
that's about all what I have for you

00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:43,679
are there any questions I'm still here

00:23:34,649 --> 00:23:48,009
Yeah right I didn't so far but I think

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:50,249
when browser support raises them there

00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:56,619
will be no problem with that

00:23:50,249 --> 00:24:01,509
yeah one thing that I think is mostly

00:23:56,619 --> 00:24:03,999
you used you would only prove have in

00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:06,460
effect if you use these on desktop

00:24:03,999 --> 00:24:08,470
devices because grids don't really make

00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,440
sense or you don't have to really do

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:13,899
much on mobile devices because there's

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,730
not not so much base or you can have

00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:20,950
items just on top of each other but yes

00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:25,269
you can use good layout there too

00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:28,529
unfortunately not in iOS so far bottom

00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:28,529
