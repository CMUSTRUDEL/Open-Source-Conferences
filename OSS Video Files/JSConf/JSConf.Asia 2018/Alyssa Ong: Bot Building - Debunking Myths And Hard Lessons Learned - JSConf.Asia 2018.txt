Description: 
	Building a bot isn’t hard… or is it? In this session, we’ll be going through fun code stories and demos to uncover some best practices in building bots and NLP models. Find out about common challenges & limitations faced, and the top scenarios and myths when it comes to bots for enterprises. In this session, I will share personal stories during my bot building journey, and learnings from the successes and failures that resulted.

Alyssa works with Microsoft's Commercial Software Engineering team and is the resident expert in bots. Featured in VentureBeat as one of the top 100 people to watch in the chatbot space, she loves working with startups and enterprises across Southeast Asia and bringing their bots to life (not literally). She is also a part time bubble tea addict, cryptocurrency trader and student of life.
