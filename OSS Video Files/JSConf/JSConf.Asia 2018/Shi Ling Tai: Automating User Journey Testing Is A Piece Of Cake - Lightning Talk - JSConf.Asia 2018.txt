[Music]

00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,070
I'm Shirley

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,869
you can find me on Twitter that's me I'm

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,600
gonna share with you about UI testing

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:26,699
today and you guys are saying is Papa

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,189
important it's really important because

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,000
your users use your service using the

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:36,450
user interface duh so if you have bugs

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,540
on your users you have - - users even s

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,719
users who make less money so your

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,329
testing is really important so the UI

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,910
testing is such a pain this is what UI

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:52,020
testing looks like today so many devices

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:55,649
so many browsers Oh a day so we totally

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,949
got a automate this right but automating

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,989
UI testing is also a pain because it is

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,750
what you guys testing scripts looks like

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,729
today so that's like a popular JSI read

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,299
nightmare dodge it and spend a little

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,140
bit time

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,549
look at it it's nothing you know while

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,350
to figure out what this that's right

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,320
it's just basically going to sometime go

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:20,040
to fight into a search for get to search

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,070
for nightmare dodge yes well there's a

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,820
lot of code smells in this it has hard

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:29,490
code IDs yes matching ways it is really

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,920
the ball so he really needs to be so you

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:35,280
know but we can really make this make

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,530
testing a lot better so I think this is

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,650
what that should really look like I go

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,880
to dark god calm eye surgeons computer I

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:47,250
press the Enter key and then I see HTTP

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,740
2018 James Caan's Asia is short

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,470
this is readable this has inherent

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,530
meaning is decoupled from your UI and it

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,180
is maintainable so this is the way we

00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,640
are writing our tests right now users

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,460
developers specified objects we tested

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,470
up front no we shouldn't be doing that

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,770
have the test and Geney term in their

00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:11,580
users could what to determine objects to

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,770
test at runtime so let's make testing

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,690
create again and this is what I'm

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,860
working on is called relations and this

00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:28,800
is a pancake so let's show you a quick

00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:30,810
demo okay so so this is the test which

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,440
I've written on your leashes what I'm

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:37,560
not going here is running on Chrome and

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,330
it's time to set up the test and you'll

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,459
see the test running on the right side

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,850
here with the screenshots I will just

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:48,720
tell you hey it works you know I'm going

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:51,300
to go home and just call Asia press

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,790
Enter key and I see the result there

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,160
that's wonderful but of course these GS

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,350
called Asia we gotta see some JavaScript

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,209
right so let's do something a little bit

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,060
more complicated and try to buy some

00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:06,180
beer from red mark so I am the list here

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,730
of beer by Chun beer and Tiger leg

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,000
appeal and the complicated thing about

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,830
read my comments that there are many

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,100
buttons they're similar to each other in

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:20,640
macomb such as the Add to Cart button so

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:23,730
if I wanna say let's add the chung-kai

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,380
cable to the case to the cart I need to

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,510
say I see

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,239
Chun tiger beer and then I add it to

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,720
cart and then when I want to add a tiger

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,470
beer

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,209
I added I do a check to see the type of

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,130
yourself first and heading to college so

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,709
we can verify that this working here so

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:43,530
let's go to Chun tiger view I see right

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,930
here I press Add to Cart and there you

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:49,530
