Title: Thomas Gorissen: JavaScript Feud Opening - JSConf.Asia 2018
Publication date: 2018-02-06
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	During sign-up for the JSConf.Asia 2018 conference tickets we asked our attendees a bunch of fun and serious questions. How do you start a front-end project? What's the worst thing about being a developer? When do you do your best work? How many coffees do you drink per week? Guess along with our volunteers on stage during this JSConf.Asia Opening!

Thomas and his team are the organisers of JSConf.Asia in Singapore for 6 years running. When budget runs low for fancy effects in the end (as it always does) he sometimes codes up a little something that is dubiously entertaining.

[Music]

00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:19,619
good morning at this really very early

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,180
hour thanks for coming out

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,670
I hope you were able to get a coffee

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,849
already it is the sixth time you're

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,220
doing this it is likely gonna be the

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,520
biggest we might have just a few more

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:36,329
people than we had in 2016 I'm sorry I

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,329
was a bit late this time over issues and

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:42,149
reasons and we're in January now which I

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,309
hope you'll still gonna appreciate James

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,640
Camtasia like every J s conf is a

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:50,070
community event it is for you

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,649
specifically for the attendees and we

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,829
want to make sure that in this event in

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,960
these three days you get ample chance to

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,760
get to know each other as well and not

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,199
only learn we did this survey online

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,460
with everybody who checked in and thank

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,850
you for answering all these slightly

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,310
funny questions and we asked what is

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,070
RJ's comes the best place for to do and

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:18,090
you answered with the vast majority a

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,680
great place to meet people so like you

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,750
can give yourself a big round of

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,670
applause just for that I think that's

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,159
actually a good reason to do a

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:30,150
conference so please let's get this

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,549
warmed up in general this applause stuff

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,689
you need to really get get going over

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:38,130
the day we're gonna have some fantastic

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,869
speakers today 24 in total and then plus

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,630
a bunch of workshop hosts they bring

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,890
their TAS teaching assistants tomorrow

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,770
too so they're gonna be a lot of people

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,240
tomorrow at the shangri-la and this is

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,210
the major change we have this year

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,130
compared to the last time we have three

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,320
days the middle day is our community and

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,680
workshop day the biggest feedback that I

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,820
got in 2016 was that the conference was

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:05,430
great but it was really three days of

00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:07,350
listening to people and that's not very

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,200
interactive is it so that's why we

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,750
created this workshop day it's an expert

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,450
if you will one that's sold out quicker

00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,280
than we thought so it's gonna be rather

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,010
packed tomorrow be sure you go there

00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,870
early and it's not gonna be the

00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,180
shangri-la in the city it's gonna be the

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,569
one on sentosa just to make that clear

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,739
for everybody also for us you already

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:33,800
went to the wrong one yesterday so

00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:36,440
getting to know yourself is the part of

00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,200
my opening that I want to cover and I

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,299

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,610

this before in 2015 we had a jeopardy

00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:09,199
DJ's party at the time and I thought

00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:11,569
well we ran out of budget in the end and

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,589
I had to code something up again so here

00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:27,159
it goes

00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:35,539

00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:42,829
because you want to get this full on do

00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:46,629
we have it audio up I still don't hear

00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:07,740

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:29,220

00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,640
cute look you know that you don't know

00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:37,520
family feud is an American TV show where

00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,450
two families that we have just created

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:43,110
are gonna compete

00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:45,030
meaning we did a survey with a lot of

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,700
people and we looked for the top answers

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:52,050
and so you have to guess the top answers

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,920
to questions that I'm gonna ask you so

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,730
how this works

00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:59,400
I will ask from the left to right the

00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:02,370
leftist person over to my gameshow board

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,670

let me introduce the teams please

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,820
and I'll fade this music out now - so

00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:19,250
you have a buzzer here on the left and

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:20,990
on the right so you see we have Team

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,169
Unicorn family unicorn is the Wright

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:27,169
family here please give it an applause

00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:32,719
for the Team Unicorn and you may try the

00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:35,589
buzzer sound there we go

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,120
keep the sound up it's nice there we go

00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:40,520
alright and we have team kittycat which

00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,630
is the leftmost table please give it up

00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:47,000
for Team Kitty head you might try a

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:50,839
buzzer - Cara right so this is all

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,480
working I love it so I have my little

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,150
game card here and we asked you during

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,550
check-in like a lot of questions and

00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,050
about 300 of you responded and I sifted

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,300
through all of them and I got the top

00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,980
answers to these so we started with

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,230
level 1 which we have here and we are

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,839
looking for the top 7 answers your job

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,510
is now to find one of them whoever hits

00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:14,270
the button faster and get the question

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,830
up we're gonna play with your team right

00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,360
it should the answer be wrong we're

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,209
gonna sift it over to the other team and

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,920
he gets the chance to steal it

00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:22,670
should he be wrong again you get another

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,980
chance

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:29,120
if you then don't get it the level has

00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:31,610
gone to nowhere okay go for it back we

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,260
play with the team afterwards so you

00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:37,279
have to find one of the seven top

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:43,600
answers - we asked a hundred people what

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,600
is my worst habit while coding unicorn

00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:00,480
in context switching context switching

00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:05,310
let's see if context switching is one of

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:12,810
the answers and now it is not that means

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:16,350
we'll get to you watching YouTube and I

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,450
let's put it in the context of something

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,850
else which I think we might have and

00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:25,770
that is actually the top answer

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,860
procrastinating with 18% of you that

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:30,450
means we gonna play with Team Unicorn

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,820
you may go back to the table and then

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,560
we're gonna continue with Jo you can now

00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,060
take a guess on what you think is gonna

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,040
be on the board please use the

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:44,730
microphone can you repeat the question

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,100
again we asked a hundred people what is

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:52,770
your worst coding habit worst habit

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:55,110
while coding not commenting my code not

00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:58,320
commenting my codes let's see if that's

00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:04,500
on the board that's correct

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:10,020
nice Karis wrong inventing wrong

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:13,650
indenting let's see if that's part no

00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:14,460
it's not so now we go back all the way

00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,770
to the front

00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,720
we started with Wilson again you have

00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,340
three access that you can earn and then

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:29,480
we're gonna go over and they can steal

00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:29,480
oh no it's just you it's just you

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:38,960
my worst habit while coding think of

00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:44,090
yourself don't write this not writing

00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:55,780
test is that one of the answers yes not

00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:59,390
testing 8% why not I'm gonna say not

00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:03,050
using good coding standards not using

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:11,210
good coding standards see if that's on

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:12,590
the board not on the board not cleaning

00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,990
up all the mess you made

00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:17,360
sagen not cleaning up all the mess you

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:21,190
may not like properly refactoring after

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,190
you not properly filling around

00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:32,160
unicorn here can actually steal so you

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:36,779
may actually join here and discuss with

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,940
your teammates if you are able to find

00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:47,399
one answer on the board you can see all

00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:48,420
the points okay this is the difference

00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,920
in game shows you typically have

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,130
background music in these situations

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,130
right

00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,510
all right do you have an answer so we

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:12,520
say leaving technical debt leaving

00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:15,790
technical debt just admitted people I'm

00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:20,380
sorry this round will therefore go to

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:23,920
wait you were team kitty cat those

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,500
points great other answers on the boards

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:33,450
were with number two and the audience

00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:39,720
may repeat over optimizing number three

00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:46,630
over thinking number five copy pasting

00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:48,520
number seven perfecting overdoing it all

00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,740
right now you get how the game works so

00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,180
I can now get the second player of every

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,420
team to come over for the next question

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,420
please

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:04,450
so Martin versus toe

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,900
yes team kittycat Team Unicorn everybody

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,310
okay

00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:13,540
we asked 100 people about my last coding

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:22,000
project had too many or too much this

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:24,010
team kitty cat you were first at too

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,200
many errors let's see if that's one of

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:30,190
the questions too many bugs they go

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,210
fantastic they're gonna play with your

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,500
team team kitty cat

00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:41,140
the next person of team cat head can

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:44,830
then choose an answer too much code too

00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:51,270
much code sound stupid but turns out to

00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:51,270
be right very good next one

00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,400

entertaining if you have an idea just

00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:13,890
shout it in there is no demo demo how to

00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,650
use it

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:35,760
my last coding project had too many

00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:37,650
demos just checking to complex alright

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,710

talk answer fantastic

00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:55,500

libraries whoo let's see how that turns

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:06,380

all by yourself now we take the newfound

family back apart so we had one stupid

00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:10,650
question in this whole check-in process

00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:13,360
some of you might remember and it was

00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:17,020
you may click this box now if you'd like

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,850
clicking boxes so it's a guessing game

00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:26,980
how many percent of the audience do you

00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:30,190
think like clicking check boxes eighty

00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:33,970
eighty six percent okay great a hundred

00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:39,040
percent it's unlikely but okay fifty

00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:47,110
percent okay so let's see who is closest

00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:49,240
and I will be marching with 17 that's

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:54,700
the closest so Martin you win the final

00:29:49,240 --> 00:30:00,330
