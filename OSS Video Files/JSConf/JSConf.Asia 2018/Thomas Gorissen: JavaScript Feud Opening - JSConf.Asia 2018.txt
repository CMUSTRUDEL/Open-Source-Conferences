Title: Thomas Gorissen: JavaScript Feud Opening - JSConf.Asia 2018
Publication date: 2018-02-06
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	During sign-up for the JSConf.Asia 2018 conference tickets we asked our attendees a bunch of fun and serious questions. How do you start a front-end project? What's the worst thing about being a developer? When do you do your best work? How many coffees do you drink per week? Guess along with our volunteers on stage during this JSConf.Asia Opening!

Thomas and his team are the organisers of JSConf.Asia in Singapore for 6 years running. When budget runs low for fancy effects in the end (as it always does) he sometimes codes up a little something that is dubiously entertaining.
