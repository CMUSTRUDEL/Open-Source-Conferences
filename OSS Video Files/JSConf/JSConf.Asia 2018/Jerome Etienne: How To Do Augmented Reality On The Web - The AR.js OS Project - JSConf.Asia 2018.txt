Title: Jerome Etienne: How To Do Augmented Reality On The Web - The AR.js OS Project - JSConf.Asia 2018
Publication date: 2018-02-08
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	WebAR is coming! And some would argue that it's already here. Developing augmented reality on the web can sound very complex. This is why I developed a way to make it easier for anyone to do AR, and I want to share it with you. It is called AR.js. In this talk I will take you through what WebAR is, what are its possibilities and its challenges. We will take a look at the major players and the recent developments in the AR world. Finally, I will share some demos made with AR.js, a fully open-source solution to do efficient augmented reality on the web!

Jerome is the creator of AR.js, making WebAR a reality! He is the author of the Learning Three.js blog and the 8th most active user on Github. He has been CTO at Daqri and is a hardcore Javascript and WebGL developer.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,580
I am general machen on today I will

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,730
speak to you about a muttered rarity I'm

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,689
passionate about it on especially web of

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:30,560
muttered rarity so what is web augmented

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:35,160
reality versus augmented reality

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:39,540
pictures better than words so here below

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:42,960
you have blood rather and you have a

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,030
wonderful ear Oh looking at a very big

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,700
Allah Graham he has no device on the

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,610
head nor device on your hand everything

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,899
is working well well that's cool but

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:58,350
that's Hollywood unfortunately so this

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,530
is what augmented reality could be we

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,870
would like it to be like that for

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,489
Hollywood that's specially fight for the

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,270
real world and that's a good definition

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,909
of augmented reality you would mount

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,299
reality by adding information on top of

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:19,350
it so let's see what clock w was to

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,320
serve address this is a possible

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,290
application of what augmented reality

00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:28,110
could be or would be in the future

00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:31,020
so check review suppose you are in a

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:34,200
shop and you see a lot of product on the

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,299
shelf you take your phone you point your

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,520
phone at the product and suddenly you

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:42,210
see the world view from your friend so

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,840
review from other people wet on the

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,909
internet suddenly you make a more

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,950
knowledgeable choice about to purchase

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:56,490
or better use of your money another well

00:01:52,950 --> 00:02:00,570
suppose you want to wash some clothes

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:05,640
and you have a tag on your clothes most

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:08,429
of the time it is quite cryptic and you

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,180
do not understand it will be great if I

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,920
can point my phone axis tag and suddenly

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,670
it is explained to me

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:22,020
in plain words once again I avoid a

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:24,390
lower rate so this is nice this is a

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,209
dream this is what reality will be in

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:32,760
the future but let's see about what it

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:35,220
is today and today for at least for me

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,870
augmented reality can be run in ten line

00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,610
of HTML so this is quite important first

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,739
because this is tan line on Sudan

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,310
because this is a sh t ml let me explain

00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,239
why

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:55,290
so this is what you see on the screen is

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:56,880
a basic example of a rjs so you have

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,890
only ten line of HTML

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:05,790
this is a basic script here body any web

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,799
def can do it and if you do this

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,230
wonderful example you will have this

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,319
result so a basic cube on top of a

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,870
marker this is a very basic example

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,030
because this is only tan line but you

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:22,519
can build significant application in the

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:25,350
very little line this is a point here

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,180
let me come back to this one this is

00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:30,810
important because this is tan line

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:34,829
so tonight is short so you can learn on

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:37,890
Ted page that somewhere and this is our

00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:41,400
channel so it mean anybody on the planet

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:45,000
anybody who is a web developer can do

00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,579
this this is short and simple to

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,600
understand on any web developer can do

00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:55,590
it this is definitely point here you can

00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,500
see Aleksandra my wife doing that inside

00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:02,160
cut pen so you take this basic example

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:06,420
you place that into Capel and certainly

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,430
you can do a mozzarella t on the left of

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,040
materiality is easy where they are

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:16,500
chairs at least I try to make it easy

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,760
let me show you this videos that we used

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,120
you know in order to have Wi-Fi know we

00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,660
have Wi-Fi so here you have a marker

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,380
we've no freaking table

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:32,320
and if you look at your marker

00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:35,710
sousaphone drugs augmented reality you

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,030
can move around this is 60 FPS so it's

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:43,750
working on on old phones very important

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:45,850
full open source and based on web

00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:50,860
standout we will see all the advantage

00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:53,680
of a spatula in to talk on dot forget a

00:04:50,860 --> 00:05:04,600
phone without much energy it's fun

00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:08,170
enough okay let me try to okay so when I

00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:12,090
did they are Jess what was in my head is

00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:15,730
some other things first I wanted to

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:19,330
realize my dream about a hour meaning

00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:22,510
that for the controversial reason I had

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:25,390
a lot of free time and I wanted to build

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:28,060
a are as it should be where they are so

00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:32,050
it should be so I use on drug part of my

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:35,260
free time to do that and but in my head

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:38,950
when I did that it was a lot like being

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,930
a drug let me explain why when I did

00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:44,530
this project just I forgot to say it's

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:48,610
open source so I had to look compose on

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:51,670
unruffled on the surface but below

00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:55,240
I had to paddle like hell because this

00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:59,770
was an open source project so I did that

00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:02,620
with my two hand and under the hood I

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:06,310
had a lot of responsibilities I had to

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:10,180
do fixing bad I had to do testing to

00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:13,140
improve the accuracy of the camera

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:18,390
tracking so augmented reality accuracy

00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:21,220
all of this software engineering stuff

00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:26,050
this was longer than grateful as be

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,890
honest but it was needed so I did it but

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,590
yes

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:32,200
so I was alone to hand out doing all the

00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:35,110
design or jaw structure also called

00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,580
working ten hours a day not making a

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,260
penny because I happened to be

00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:42,150
unemployed

00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:46,290
but good for the free time health center

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:49,700
point but for me LGS was realized my

00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:54,200
dream to make a are as easy as possible

00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:57,600
because I believe it has to be easy so

00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:02,040
let's look deeper on what is our chairs

00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,770
first mission the mission of AES is to

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:10,110
bring air to the web or to make where

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:13,970
they are a reality so for that I wanted

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:16,020
to make energy as very fast web-based

00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,420
open-source and realizing and

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:23,820
stalled-out force as a principle and try

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:26,250
to apply so first very fast while it has

00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:29,160
to be very fast is because when you do

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:33,090
augmented reality basically you need to

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:36,960
work that at 60fps or close if you do

00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:41,580
that at 5 PS this is boring and this is

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:45,570
not moving well so you are not in mass

00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,940
if you already know that a trick if you

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:52,080
are 60 FPS this is a lot better for

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:55,320
ability so when I took it it was 5 PS on

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:59,270
an eye on phone on right now this is 60

00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,270
FPS even on a two-year-old phone

00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:05,250
additionally LGS is web-based what does

00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:07,740
this mean this mean this is full

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,890
JavaScript and this is a pure web

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,810
solution it has plan consequences when

00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:14,100
you are on the phone when you are on the

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,900
phone you don't want to install

00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:19,080
application this is not something you

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:22,380
like all statistics shows that to

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,210
install application is really some

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,880
things that people don't want to do on

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:30,990
the more it goes with time so let's

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:34,380
install applications so to be pure pure

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:37,979
web is very nice additionally it is

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:43,349
relying on standard this means that any

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:45,360
web browser can with WebGL on WebRTC can

00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:48,230
do way out yes there is no need so

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,360
specifically a public API sorry or

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:54,290
specific application

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,779
modern web browser is enough this means

00:08:54,290 --> 00:09:01,309
that a RGS work on Android Windows Phone

00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:05,480
on iOS so basically every phone of the

00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:06,579
planet it's good now you know how it all

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,199
started

00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,600
but what happened after the beginning of

00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:15,799
our chairs

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:19,399
well 2017 has been a big year for motor

00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:20,980
reality and at the middle of the year in

00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:25,999
June 2017

00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:26,720
Apple announced a our kit so what is the

00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:29,600
accurate

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,369
this is markerless tracking mikelis

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,259
tracking means that you can take your

00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:36,110
phone you don't need to print a marker

00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:38,839
to look at your marker you switch on

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:40,369
your phone and you can have a granted

00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:44,179
relative right there and to middle of

00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:46,819
the street I our kit as well as

00:09:44,179 --> 00:09:50,569
something we call it testing so it

00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:52,639
testing is the phone is able to

00:09:50,569 --> 00:09:55,399
understand the topology of the world

00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,980
meaning is able to detect the plane on

00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:01,160
the ground is about to detect a table

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:03,429
and you can put augmented reality on the

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,769
table on the ground whatever

00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:09,649
another interesting aspect is racket

00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:12,410
will be will be is available on

00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:18,529
monocular camera we will see more about

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:20,839
what is a monocular camera man so racket

00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:22,610
when it has been announced it was really

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:27,079
really really big it for augmented

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:30,410
reality it was a bump in the world why

00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:33,649
because of materiality was by default on

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:37,220
the phone in your pocket before a

00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:39,529
hatchet to havoc materiality you needed

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:44,419
to have a specific devices Pacific

00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:45,199
device on you had a specific form but we

00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:48,470
they are cheap

00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:51,739
you got ignited reality by default there

00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:55,069
is no need for anything else so yeah it

00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:58,879
was a very first step for massive user

00:10:55,069 --> 00:11:02,809
adoption all that faith to the monocular

00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,829
camera support everybody was rightfully

00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:09,769
in prayer

00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:15,339
and in August 2017 Google replied with

00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:20,089
air crawl so two months after that and

00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:22,309
in for all normal purposes they are

00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:25,670
co-owner a kid are very very similar

00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:29,389
from a factual point of view but it was

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:34,639
very good from augmented reality echo

00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:38,569
system because before Apple was under

00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:41,589
multiple and suddenly said you don't

00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:44,089
have it anymore we are Google and Apple

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:46,930
kelabra collaborating competing with

00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:50,629
each other it's very important

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:55,459
Google is with Android 88% of the world

00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:58,309
one market an iPhone is 12% but both of

00:11:55,459 --> 00:12:00,829
them competing with each other is good

00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:03,319
for see a consistent diversity and

00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:05,860
competition is healthy for the users Co

00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:08,209
system as well

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,819
another advantage with this announcement

00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:13,850
of air crore is Google exposing

00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:19,370
augmented reality to the web we are all

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:21,879
on our kid native API is not something

00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:24,649
that you can easily reach from the web

00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:27,939
because Google is so very keen at the

00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:33,550
web they build to application in which

00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:38,209
they expose Eric watch it to web browser

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:40,579
most application suite name of where

00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:43,040
they are on air core and where they are

00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:47,809
on achieved will can feel that an

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:50,660
engineer kind of world so what are those

00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:53,750
application where they are near crow is

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:59,179
a chromium modified to read air crawl on

00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:03,170
exposure to two column where they are on

00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:06,589
arch it is reading air jet unless it is

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:09,199
expressing that to an iOS web view what

00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:13,220
is interesting from the web a our point

00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:16,370
of view is they expose air co-ownership

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,819
with the exact same api so when you

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,179
build you

00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:22,939
a application on the web you need to

00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:25,699
build it only once and it will work on

00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:30,999
those two application on a across on iOS

00:13:25,699 --> 00:13:35,979
or on a aqua on-air kid

00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:38,959
let's look at some example so this is a

00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:45,019
typical application that you can build

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:49,369
that in whatever I have a bunch of video

00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:49,819
so I hope we can have Wi-Fi apparently

00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:54,139
not

00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:58,279
come on be nice with me this is not nice

00:13:54,139 --> 00:14:01,100
with me so this is a wonderful

00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:05,479
application in which you can fetch you

00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:09,609
can throw a stick on you god I'm trying

00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:12,470
again come on

00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:15,759
that would be a very sad talk if I don't

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:17,809
have okay

00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:22,869
partly YouTube doesn't go through

00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:27,350
anymore so let me comment on the picture

00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:33,799
so what is a keypad so basically you are

00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:36,799
a very cute dog and you throw a virtual

00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:39,439
stick to this virtual pet on the go

00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:43,429
fetch and come back the video is very

00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:48,279
cute on am evilly sad very sad

00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:51,350
okay alright we're gonna try this ammo

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:51,889
here it's another video let's try this

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,009
one

00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:58,819
oh this one is working I don't get it

00:14:55,009 --> 00:15:01,279
ugly cool let's be appear bad so this

00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:04,669
one is a portal so here's the iron

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:07,279
Englund and they see that materiality

00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:12,379
door meaning that your portal to another

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:15,289
reality I foolish you see San Francisco

00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:18,739
and you see Sir Francis course was a

00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:22,339
portal but you can a well walk through

00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:26,319
this wonderful portal and you piggy you

00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:28,730
I in San Francisco the bird is really

00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:30,589
too and San Francisco you can route

00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:35,269
around and be in San Francisco you can

00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:37,190
recognize a bridge and see the portal on

00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:43,100
your back in England

00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:49,579
it's a fastest way to travel okay let's

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:54,399
be up full on the video staff this other

00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:59,149
video is a teresting for the realism

00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:02,440
always grown flying around look quite

00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:06,699
immersive I mean you don't see them as I

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:10,149
don't know talking too much 3d because

00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:13,459
this really is used something called PBR

00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:15,380
which make it very realistic when you

00:16:13,459 --> 00:16:17,329
look matted relative justly it's very

00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,220
important to be as well stick as

00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:25,250
possible this way you are a lot more

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:28,579
immersive the arrows are air heat

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:30,740
apparently this was only occur but

00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:36,459
almost demo can be done on air crawl and

00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:40,250
air kit so after a occur on an arcade

00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:44,149
what should we do with a RGS well we

00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:47,899
made a RGS evolve since we parted that

00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:50,269
to a frame API we parted that as well to

00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:53,690
Babylon so you can use a GS with three

00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:57,470
GS a frame and Babylon J's its report a

00:16:53,690 --> 00:17:01,519
our kit on our craw - so this is quite

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:04,610
good because let me explain so my

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:08,000
kitchen not sure about that

00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:11,929
what is interesting is when you do an

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,449
application with a RGS you can support

00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:17,179
every tracking possible we have your

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:19,970
LG's application when you are on air

00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:23,419
core device LGS will use air core

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:26,360
tracking if you are on an iOS device it

00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:29,120
will use our keep tracking and if you

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:31,760
are on a normal phone which is not

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,350
supporting our on air kit it will use

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,070
pure web tracking

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:39,230
so now chess will provide the best

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:42,020
tracking available on your device no

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:45,420
matter what device you have

00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:48,030
which is nice about this is when you

00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,650
build your application you don't need to

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:52,250
build one application for their CRO

00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:55,080
another for your kit and another for

00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:57,000
Joseph phones you have a single

00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,100
application which report of the

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,470
available tracking you write your

00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:10,910
application once or it will run on every

00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:13,440
platform here is another example YouTube

00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,920
Twitter is working but youtube is

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,030
failing

00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:21,840
what okay this one is working through so

00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:23,940
this is in my apartment and when you do

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:27,060
a mounted reality it is let's say a

00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,810
tradition to do a tsunami KU I'm not

00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,570
sure why

00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:33,090
so this one is actually Miku dancing in

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:36,150
my apartment it has been done on trongo

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:40,670
device and you can see you can be close

00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:47,700
you can hear a thing you can see my cut

00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:51,120
this one is real and I have to cut

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:56,790
search if you want to love more this is

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,890
my first video of with affair GS with a

00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:02,190
our crow

00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:04,230
yes not very impressive but as it is my

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:07,880
first demo so it's basically the cube

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,880
floating in the air inside my apartment

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:18,500
so what can you do with energy s one

00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:21,300
thing that I like to do is refraction

00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:23,880
because when you talk mantle reality one

00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:27,750
things you really need to do is to match

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:30,720
the virtual on the real meanings that

00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:34,640
you want anything that you add to the

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:39,890
real world to appear as real as possible

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:43,650
so one aspect that I did is refraction

00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:45,210
we okay cool so refraction is not

00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,490
arresting because here you have

00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:50,730
obviously big tourists please Victoria

00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:53,250
sees obviously not real but I did it

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,950
it's such a juicy spool it appears a

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:57,820
glass

00:19:53,950 --> 00:20:00,490
so you see fools are 3d this way this

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:04,390
really seems a lot more included into

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:07,960
the real so you see and after that you

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:11,160
can see my wife at the end so you see

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:15,810
through and you can see the 3d and

00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:21,070
suddenly it's become a lot more real yes

00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:26,980
Erica that's yet it is rather simple to

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:29,320
do this one is when you do augmented

00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:32,530
reality you like to do something magical

00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:36,730
as well here this is a background my

00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:41,290
table but I use some 3d tricks to make

00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:44,320
it appears as inside the whole that's an

00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:46,540
effect called hole in the wall so you

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,060
use some 3d tricks which way you believe

00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:52,390
that is included inside the table but

00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:54,940
obviously it is not gone after certain

00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:59,550
dose really experts of 3d years in

00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:04,030
Butler expect so I do stupid models like

00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:04,780
rubber jack which will model guy contact

00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:10,060
me please

00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:12,910
oh so this one is a version of the

00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:17,230
portal in SL fashion but this one is

00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:21,070
done by a yes yes YouTube is working

00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,900
again so this one is on marker but you

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,620
can use of the streets or something for

00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:29,320
arte aqua we go through suddenly we are

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:33,190
in another world but still with these

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:36,130
are real worlds with a portal and we

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:39,160
gonna come back on every time you switch

00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:41,250
from a web to the others that's like a

00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:45,930
bridge between two world

00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:48,700
oops here we go

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:52,780
that's a friend that I have on my desk

00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:56,530
so which kind of force application can

00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:58,650
you build now we got where they are this

00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:02,890
is good because you can build

00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:06,340
application on any mobile phone

00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:08,799
but which kind of application do you

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,500
wanna build because you got tracking on

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:16,059
you good you do portals you do drawing

00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:19,210
but it's not really useful so you can do

00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:23,559
a are gaming so a are gaming obviously

00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:27,760
you may have heard of Pokemon go that's

00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:30,370
one and also one is for example this

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,220
game those game has not been done by air

00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:37,169
chess but you can definitely consume but

00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:39,660
we've a obviously if you have the time

00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:43,330
on the Internet

00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:46,470
this is on pace Vita so they use marker

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:49,570
in order to interact with a with a game

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:52,929
so you move your marker on the table

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:59,020
it moves the object on Ulysses laaser

00:22:52,929 --> 00:23:02,320
game so these last a being I don't know

00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:03,549
how to say that protected you describe

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,940
stuff like that

00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:12,460
in short your markers are a new way a

00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:17,490
new input so this is a lousy game let me

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:22,960
show you other games this one is a

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:28,480
strike race it's a race track after we

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:31,090
had right okay so this was interesting

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,970
because this is dynamics so you move the

00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:39,370
back around and you change the shape of

00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:43,809
the track another game for example when

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:46,090
you yes he's doing that if you are paid

00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:48,309
but on also ahead

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,860
so you can see that the pet is following

00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:58,929
you when you are moving the Macra around

00:23:50,860 --> 00:24:01,470
oh I don't know here 51 version inside

00:23:58,929 --> 00:24:05,980
your retrimmed about it

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:08,530
probably not okay so when you do that

00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,179
for example so we have seen games or

00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:13,380
stuff like that see is one good

00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:15,960
application that you can do is education

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,210
because suppose you are in

00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,910
cool you put a marker inside your book

00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,310
on instead of reading a sentence like I

00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:27,480
don't know

00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:29,520
such qing conquest such a country you

00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,740
can actually do an animation something

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,190
funny which can entertain the kids

00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:37,140
this way the kid will be less bored

00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:42,650
which happen quite often when you are

00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:47,160
doing school so it's a very good way to

00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:51,840
contact just get to for example so

00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:54,030
that's an example and so you can see

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,790
some markers on you see an animation

00:24:54,030 --> 00:25:01,200
directly on top of the book which is

00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:03,600
obviously much more entertaining you got

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,970
this one and so you can use a

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,140
materiality for example in the industry

00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:12,180
it has been shown that with proper

00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,860
etcetera if you are in the under screen

00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:17,610
you'll reduce quite significantly so

00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:21,690
error rate so definitely interesting you

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:24,330
can use it for commerce on e-commerce as

00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:29,760
well or you can use in for medical

00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:32,220
training of subs and also well so well

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,370
it all mountain reality right now need

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:38,220
better application we have the tracking

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:41,550
which is good you can produce good

00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:45,990
augmented reality on any phone you don't

00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:49,830
need to have the latest iPhone or Google

00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:54,330
pixel or and so on you can start to

00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:56,070
build your Barton reality today and you

00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,210
need to be highly creative that's what

00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:01,380
we need at the moment

00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:03,300
and we not gonna have questions so

00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:07,299
that's the end of my talk partly I

00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:09,360
completed results thank you

00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,360
