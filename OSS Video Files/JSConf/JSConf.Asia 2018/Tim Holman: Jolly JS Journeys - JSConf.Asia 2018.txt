Title: Tim Holman: Jolly JS Journeys - JSConf.Asia 2018
Publication date: 2018-02-02
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	Ever started a project you didn't finish? Ever sat and stared at the screen, knowing you wanted to make something, but unsure of what? Ever felt like you're alone in making something? Well this talk is for you. 
Join me, though some weird and wacky wonderings through the web, and find how building, learning and having fun are all connected together... and gain a little more appreciation and love for javascript along the way!

Tim is a tinkerer, tuner & tamperer of all things online, and a massive fan of alliteration. He prides himself in the overall uselessness of the code he's written, as well as the overall joy it brings to the world.

[Music]

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,230
my second time in Singapore I really

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,820
like it here I think there's a huge

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,560
diversity of people and it just makes it

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,240
really really fun everybody that I talk

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,090
to seems to be doing three different

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,060
things with food and with just kind of

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:34,050
goes all over the place I am Tim this is

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,760
me I'm an avid tooth brush ax and you

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,070
might know me from some of my online

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,870
things you might have seen me from some

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,700
of the the previous events today so I'm

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,340
a tinkerer tuner tempura I just like to

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,620
make stuff I'm not really big on titles

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,670
but I'm an engineer I guess it had a bit

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,030
of a design or a bit of everything

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,379
really like all of us yeah so you might

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,860
have seen me on the first day where we

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,570
we won the family feud the JavaScript

00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,789
family feud you might have noticed that

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,530
our team got absolutely no correct

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,000
technical questions but we were very

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,119
very good at guessing how much coffee

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,770
everybody drinks you might have seen me

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,710
ad code in the dark which was really

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,119
awesome on a couple of nights ago was

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,830
really fun I've never actually seen that

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,110
before people kind of coding without

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,090
being able to look look at what they're

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,549
making and and just see the results it

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,189
was really really fun event with Justin

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,400
organizing that and as they are standing

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,290
it as an as an emcee yeah maybe you know

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,640
me from some of my online things or

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,729
maybe you can get to know me through

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,210
these online things I was emceeing at

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,880
the CSS comfy you just late last year

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,650
and I kind of released a bunch of things

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,049
just for for a kind of potty pack

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,659
obnoxious that CSS is an example of one

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:48,329
of these I kind of wanted to do a take

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,720
on animate CSS but I wanted to do kind

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,579
of obnoxious animations obnoxious

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,110
animations are really really fun to make

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,820
they kind of go really big they kind of

00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,189
get up in your face

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,770
and this is really what you need to grab

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,460
the attention of your users for all of

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,460
your websites

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:07,320
you know it's phenomenal I made this

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,780
website off four or five years ago the

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,890
useless web it you will click on this

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,090
please button and it will take you to

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,970
other kind of random websites that are

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,319
very weird and Audion line eel Slough is

00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,090
an example of something like that

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,560
this whole website just exists so you

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,150
can kind of slap people with eels is

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,060
phenomenal who made that it doesn't make

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,650
any sense this is a library that I made

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,569
a couple of years ago

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,650
elevator jsut kind of scroll to the bone

00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:31,180
on the page and there's one of those

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,740
back to the top buttons that everybody

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:39,900
always kind of sees

00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:43,319
[Music]

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,470
provides you a nice enjoyable smooth

00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:48,930
scrolling to the top experience last

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,910
year again CSS come for I put out smell

00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,069
vodka I opened up the Helvetica font

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,020
file in font foregin and messed around

00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:58,620
with all the kerning and made it really

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,880
ugly and messy and you can install it on

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,000
your friend's machine and it kind of

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,790
replaces the whole system Helvetica font

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,260
and it's just just weird enough that you

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,910
know if I put her on my mom's computer

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,769
she thinks that it's weird but she lives

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,450
with it and you have you know it's a

00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:14,310
frustrating thing you know later on

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,360
someone will say all these websites have

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,459
looked really weird lately

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,680
oh whoops forgot to put forgot that I

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,420
put that on there again I released this

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,190
office simulator slack while we had a

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,560
great talk up here about buds before

00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,049
which was really cool this slack ball

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,610
kind of simulates the mundane office

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,290
messages that you get every now and then

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,900
you know whoever left yoga in the fridge

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,970
got to get it out of there and and and

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,319
all that kind of business don't forget

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,690
you know the passive-aggressive don't

00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,430
forget our dynamics lunch later on today

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,470
that's office life maybe you've seen

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,640
some of my more serious things these get

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,019
hub corners are all around the internet

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,910
you kind of hover the thing and it gives

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:50,489
you a little wave it's an i7 that was

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,810
regular for Cle buttons there's a fun

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,090
little project to make because you kind

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:55,709
of see it all over the place maybe

00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,109
you've seen my LinkedIn profile pull of

00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,549
dog pictures if you don't you can

00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:01,350
connect with me on LinkedIn and you can

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,350
have dog pictures daily it's really

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:07,049
really fun look at these top top notch

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,420
analytics over here yeah so that's so

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:11,730
that's me if you've ever seen me speak

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,859
before you're gonna kind of realize that

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,829
this this talk topic is the same talk

00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:18,570
that I've been doing for a while now and

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,370
I just thought I would just go straight

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,910
up front and tell you what the goals are

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,160
and what I want one of the point that I

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:28,229
want to make to everybody before we even

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,350
go and that's to kind of look at what

00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:33,389
inspires you and and look at what gets

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,580
you excited and and not just kind of on

00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:37,710
a web perspective but on a kind of much

00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,360
grander scale I want you to realize that

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,700
you can kind of follow your feelings

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,050
with your ideas and you can chase them

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,830
down to the end and you can see where it

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,240
takes you

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,409
and it doesn't have to be big it doesn't

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,550
have to be small you can just kind of

00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:50,070
get into it

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,050
I want you to kind of embrace the weird

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,430
a little bit you know just because

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,510
you're building something that nobody

00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,070
else can use doesn't mean you should

00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,780
stop building it because it is gonna be

00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,950
a quirky thing and you're gonna learn a

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,100
lot along the way it's gonna be really

00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:05,970
really fun and so the best way that I've

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,800
learned to do that is just by showing

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,140
you a few of my own kind of journeys in

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,420
my own explorations and where I went

00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,090
with them and what ideas I had and the

00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,590
kind of outcome and then hopefully you

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,450
can kind of see that and go well that's

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,780
really doable that's a that's something

00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:24,840
that I can totally totally get into so

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:27,510
let's do that yeah recently I was at my

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,790
mom's house in Australia we're right in

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,220
the country beautiful place sugar cane

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,380
fields everywhere beautiful sunsets and

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,910
I was sitting in the lounge room the

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,980
lounge rooms just got kind of a big

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,500
comfortable couch lots of lots of

00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:43,680
windows a small TV and a DVD player and

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,140
I found myself really really really

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,190
entranced and and I kind of snapped out

00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,020
of it a little bit and I thought what

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,050
what was that what was just happening

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,640
and I was looking at oh these are the

00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,070
movies that we have we've got very

00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,490
Australian selection I was looking at

00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:01,800
this on the screen DVD video and I

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,440
imagine probably everybody's seen this

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:10,440
and the DVD video if you if you haven't

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:12,720
seen what it does it does this it

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,330
bounces around the screen it's a square

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,820
box let's look at that first bounce

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,860
again once more for those in the back

00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:23,880
this is where it destroys my hopes and

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,280
this is where it destroys my dreams we

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,550
can assume really that if I hate is

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,140
gonna hate and a potato's gonna - Tate

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,810
then a DVD logo will never hit the

00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,400
corner of the screen and it's so

00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,960
frustrating because you kind of lock

00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,340
onto it and you watch it and you watch

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,470
it you watch it and I talked to a ton of

00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,300
people about this and it's just I don't

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:45,750
know what it is some kind of odd human

00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,430
nature that you want it to bounce splat

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,170
bang in the corner and I kind of thought

00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,940
to myself what is actually happening

00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,260
here let's look at the math let's kind

00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,290
of try to understand it a little bit

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:57,900
let's put our scientific or hats on so I

00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,180
started to try to dig into you know into

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,850
this world

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,680
and I found this fantastic blog online

00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,840
called the lost math lessons is one of

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,330
those nice little Nishi internet things

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,860
it's this high school teacher who kind

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,740
of comes up with weird ideas from math

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,540
lessons and and writes about them and

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,310
kind of explains the math and I don't

00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,470
think anybody kind of explained the math

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,180
behind this better than him so I thought

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,010
I'd put it up here so here you would

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,530
imagine that that square is a logo or

00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:27,770
maybe a 1 pixel by one pixel logo and

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,360
it's 16 across and it's 10 high and we

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,190
can kind of see the numbers here and we

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,720
can kind of draw some conclusions so it

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,630
seems to be bouncing on the bottom and

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,180
the top every nine squares every nine

00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:41,990
moves and it seems to be bouncing on the

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:44,060
sides every 15 and so we have 16 and 10

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,639
but if you minus one for the space that

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,039
the logo actually is you kind of get

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,780
that you get those numbers 9 and 15 and

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,370
the total moves it takes to hit onto the

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:57,620
corner is 45 which is actually the

00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:59,240
lowest common multiple of 9 and 15 and

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,400
so that kind of fits into this formula

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,349
the steps to take to the steps that it

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,180
takes to get to the corner is the lowest

00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:07,010
common multiple of the width of the

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,940
screen minus the width of the logo and

00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,669
the height of the screen and the height

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,349
of the logo and yeah we just kind of

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:15,169
keep going with this math just just for

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:16,849
the sake of it if you put velocity is

00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:18,349
its velocity equals distance over time

00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:20,479
into that and kind of mix it around a

00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:23,330
little bit you get this I won't go too

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,039
much but the time that it takes equals

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:26,930
the horizontal time which is the time

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,870
that a logo takes to hit one side to the

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,490
other side times the lowest common

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,010
multiple of the things before divided by

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,209
the width minus the logo with its top

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,909
stuff with the math I'm gonna start with

00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:39,560
the math but using that I could then

00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:41,000
calculate how long is it actually going

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,300
to take how long am I gonna have to sit

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,750
here until I get the corner hit that I

00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,190
want it's like a drug and then I built

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,330
like let me like build a little demo

00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,800
around here so I can look at the

00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,450
different numbers and it's it's kind of

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,820
random because lowest common multiples

00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,440
work that way so that you'll get some

00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,230
numbers they're really really small you

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,120
know a hundred and 122 seconds that's

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,880
fantastic but then you get some that are

00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,850
you know 3,000 seconds and it's just the

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,770
kind of depth and dynamics of the screen

00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,480
3500 it's like what 50 minutes or

00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:15,810
something like that there's our agreed

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:18,990
and so I thought well I've come this far

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,550
I can't stop what can I do about this

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,920
how can we fix this problem it's such a

00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:25,740
it's such a huge thing as plaguing

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,090
society and of course the initial

00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,980
reaction would be ah let me just speed

00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,940
up Logan let's just walk into the lounge

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:36,560
room oh yeah there it is get that fix

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,560
this was the second second solution

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,540
that's kind of a COMSAT aspiring

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:46,920
satisfying result you think that's one

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:51,870
good let's get this going on just hook

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:53,340
it into my veins you know but after

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,870
making these little demos I kind of had

00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,280
to think to myself and this is the

00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,350
saying that I'm gonna use at what point

00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,440
am I just eating ass last time I was in

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,960
Singapore I went to a cocktail bar with

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,790
Thomas and they had this ant cocktail

00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,410
and they got ants and they put him on a

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,210
leaf and then they put him in liquid

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:12,150
nitrogen or something like that and then

00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:15,480
you kind of eat the ants and drink the

00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:17,970
drink and I was definitely intrigued I

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,820
had to taste the ant cocktail but after

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:24,990
a while I was kind of thinking this is

00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:26,850
just eating ants this I know what adds

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,800
taste like now this is just eating ants

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,150
and these demos are a little bit like

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,610
that you know I'm getting a little bit

00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,710
of satisfaction here but I'm not getting

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,140
the satisfaction that I would get if it

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:39,720
bounced lowly into the corner so I do

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,700
some drew some very technical graphs

00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,690
here actually did these yesterday

00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,770
there's happiness and it's overtime and

00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,680
this is the one where it just hits the

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:52,760
corner all the time you get a plain base

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,170
level of happiness but this is the

00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,110
regular experience in my lounge room as

00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,520
I watch my happiness level goes down and

00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,680
down and down and down and down and down

00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,140
and down until I'm rock-bottom you know

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,470
really depressed and then hits the

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:09,090
corner bounces in the other direction

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,640
adrenaline everything goes go straight

00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:14,700
up and so this is the wasted time in

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,250
this in this algorithm and it's just

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,900
crazy to think like how much how much

00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,810
human time really goes into this what's

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,610
going on can I come up with another

00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,820
solution can I come up with a better

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,500
solution

00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,560
can I just take that time out of it and

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:31,230
just jump straight up into the happiness

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,100
and you're like stuff no this is how

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,360
intelligent a eyes are made they're

00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,649
gonna take over the world you know it

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,570
starts with the screensaver and then it

00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:40,060
is Skynet but we're not stopping we're

00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:43,240
gonna keep going so I yeah so I built

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,000
the intelligent screensaver so it

00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,290
bounces around as normal but then after

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,970
a certain amount of time it hits a point

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,829
it hits it goes super saiyan you know it

00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,350
goes whoa wait a second what's going on

00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:56,350
it puts a cost out where where am i

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,329
aiming to go ooh that's close what if

00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,829
the angle is really small just small

00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:01,870
enough that a human wouldn't notice it

00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:06,880
yeah let me just redirect let me refocus

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:09,160
on that bingo we're in you hit the

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,600
corner we got the happiness we can just

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,579
we can just go we can move on with our

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,100
lives I can go outside again Wow what

00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:16,540
that was so weird but this is this is

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,089
exactly what I'm kind of talking about

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,160
today is this is a journey this is a

00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:23,170
something that we've kind of gone on

00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,120
I've started with something and I've

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,949
gone somewhere weird with it in my own

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,560
time in the afternoon a couple of

00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:32,380
afternoons actually without any stress

00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,029
without any real goals but at the end of

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,699
the day you can kind of say whoa look at

00:12:34,029 --> 00:12:39,370
what we made here I made four demos Java

00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:41,949
Script canvas html5 I did enough

00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,750
research and enough kind of things here

00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:45,579
for a small lightning talk or a big talk

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,959
in front of everybody played with the

00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,730
requestanimationframe that Jake was

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,279
talking about played with cubic and

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,680
quadratic Bezier to do these curves I

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,510
had to look that up I had to understand

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,160
how that stuff worked a lot of line

00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:59,380
intersection mouth kind of goes into the

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,300
into the one that actually focuses you

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,529
know if the first angle isn't immediate

00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,510
then we're gonna have to see when it

00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:07,750
does kind of land closer to the thing

00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:09,519
and that's a lot that's a lot for a

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:10,899
square bouncing around the screen and

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,760
that's a lot of information that I'm

00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:16,690
gonna retain and then I'm gonna have at

00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:18,310
hand in any other kind of situation and

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:19,690
yeah that's that's what I'm kind of

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,449
talking about I also worked on a white

00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:24,819
paper I'm kind of submitting it around

00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:28,810
trying to try to stir people up I've

00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:30,880
called it the screen Savior and it's a

00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,350
yeah a whole writing about reducing the

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,180
overall time wasted you know it's that

00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,399
white paper guff that they give you I

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,209
just want the information but no Julius

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,009
time

00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:43,449
oops skipping some head yeah but that's

00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:46,269
it that's a lot to produce just from

00:13:43,449 --> 00:13:49,329
such a such a small little experiment I

00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:51,759
think about balance a lot and whenever

00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:53,290
whenever we talk about balance in tech I

00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,540
think everybody immediately your head

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,949
will jump to the work-life balance which

00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:59,259
of course we know is important then when

00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:00,730
your balance is off you get you get

00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:03,850
exhausted you get irritated you get

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,829
frustrated you get so so tired and it's

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,929
just hugely detrimental to your life of

00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:09,519
course but the balance that I think

00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:11,920
about a little bit more is the kind of

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,600
inter project balance so if we took that

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,790
red line there and expanded it and

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,589
looked at the balance within that this

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,869
is the this is the area that I find

00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:21,519
really interesting in tech I I like to

00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:23,490
use these kind of two terms on my scales

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,509
practice which would be oh you know

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,639
building Kings with the knowledge that

00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:28,839
you have and then creativity is the part

00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,149
where you're exploring different

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,850
solutions and you're trying to find

00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:34,990
different ways to solve these problems

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,389
you're using different technologies

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,220
you're doing some research that's the

00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:42,639
kind of creative side of it and I think

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,319
when this gets overflown and and it just

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,790
becomes maybe all practice you just come

00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:47,679
in today as like oh what am i building

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,999
this is what they told me to build and

00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,920
you don't have the creativity you get a

00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:53,019
same kind of similar burnout and I think

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,809
when you're talking to somebody and they

00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:57,429
get all antsy and gruff about what

00:14:55,809 --> 00:14:59,439
framework you're using oh this isn't

00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,850
good this isn't the best these are the

00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:02,889
kind of people that tend to have a

00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:06,999
little bit of a offset balance on that

00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:10,660
on the inside yeah I also think a lot

00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:14,139
about this guy gets electric shock III

00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,579
talk a lot I think a lot about where my

00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:17,199
mind is going when I'm doing certain

00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:20,410
things I sometimes find what I'm doing a

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,519
project my brain is thinking oh here's

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,629
another thing that I want to do here's

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,889
another thing that I want to do here's

00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:26,470
another thing that I want to do and you

00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:29,019
kind of got I better rein myself in and

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,309
I similar that similarly down that vein

00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:33,100
I have a little bit of a hard time kind

00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:36,220
of meditating and having like a clear a

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,540
clear mind so I thought oh I'll go on

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,970
another journey I'll build something

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,220
else I'll do some experimentation and

00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:45,009
I'll use myself as the guinea pig and

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:47,350
the the kind of thoughts and ideas that

00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:48,519
were coming into my head of what project

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:50,430
should I even do in the first place you

00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:52,140
know a lot of people have trouble just

00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,149
taking that initial step oh I don't have

00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,910
any ideas but there's so much stuff you

00:15:54,149 --> 00:16:00,089
know kind of touched on this yesterday

00:15:55,910 --> 00:16:01,649
when she said there's so much more

00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:02,940
inspiration than just online you know

00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:05,160
don't look at don't look at other

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,630
websites so yeah I was kind of looking

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,279
at myself I was thinking about menial

00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,620
tasks I was thinking about things like

00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,120
the screen saver but and then the other

00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,430
the other kind of dimension that I

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,050
wanted in this project was what are

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,970
things that I find captivating and of

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:21,060
course that menial tasks captivating the

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:23,220
there kind of opposites but can I

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,630
include them into the same in the same

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,480
project because that's what meditation

00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,640
seems like to me really people just kind

00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,470
of zone out into a special place and

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,300
they want it they need it it's

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:35,490
captivating to them they have benefits

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,959
to it but also they're kind of not doing

00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,360
anything

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,970
and so yeah I kind of went out and

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,279
looked in search for in search for this

00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:45,750
project and I just thought I'd mentioned

00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,980
briefly this kind of streetlight effect

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,410
the people sometimes get when they're

00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,270
searching in for new projects the

00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,820
streetlight effect is this kind of idea

00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,320
about a bias that humans have where the

00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,850
way that it's usually told is this drunk

00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,589
guy is kind of lost his keys on the

00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,760
ground and he's searching around trying

00:16:58,589 --> 00:17:01,500
to find him searching around trying to

00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,970
find him and a police officer comes and

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,140
he goes I just lost my keys and the

00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,059
police officer was kind of looking

00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,530
around as well and they can't find him

00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,630
and he goes are you sure you lost him

00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,980
here and he goes oh no no I'm just

00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,470
searching under the streetlight because

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,300
it's the easiest area to look whereas in

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,280
reality I think there's so much more out

00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,569
there and in the world rather than just

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,150
kind of going straight to the internet

00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:24,660
for your ideas so I was just looking at

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:26,010
everyday life menial but captivating

00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,650
brushing your teeth I brush my teeth

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:31,020
every day twice a day and it's kind of

00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,940
weirdly I'm into it you know I want to

00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,770
do it

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,290
wake up you EU breakfast knives and

00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,340
forks you switch the light on and so I

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,230
thought I'd run with this idea of

00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,670
switches switching things on you know

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,900
that's a part of meditation in the first

00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:45,809
place really you don't know you want to

00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,730
kind of switch on by switching off so I

00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:49,950
looked online I found a few nice kind of

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,809
designs code pen was a really good

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,460
resource switches

00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:54,870
I thought have I done anything with

00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,220
switches before oh yeah I've done a

00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,559
couple of projects I built this

00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,760
programming simulator that's very very

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,760
accurate everyone can play at home

00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:07,679
I I did another one a trying to fall

00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,630
asleep simulator what what did I do that

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,940
today how much if I go to sleep right

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,850
now I'm gonna be like I was so down five

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:17,039
years ago you know this is the the going

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:18,419
to sleep cycle in my head I've done

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,159
things with switches before I've kind of

00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:22,590
played with them what would happen if I

00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:24,899
put a ton of switches on on the screen

00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:27,929
and so that's what I thought I would do

00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:31,850
I would just kind of make a screen of

00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:33,389
switches oh this is kind of nice like

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:36,990
going green

00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:40,259
oh maybe I'll go down here a little bit

00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,190
it's weird it's captivating I've started

00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:42,570
now I gotta finish

00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:46,009
oh I filled in this whole square I'm

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:48,299
gonna gonna make everyone stay until I

00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:56,149
originally I had a hundred on here but I

00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:56,149
thought I'd cut it down to the top oh

00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:04,830
it's weird like you see that reaction Oh

00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:08,820
what you know this this idea totally

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:12,240
hooked onto me now the idea of focusing

00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,470
on something like switches yeah that

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,940
just did it so I figured oh I'm just

00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,470
gonna build a bunch of game similar to

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,389
the switches similar to the switches

00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,710
screen what other things are captivating

00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:22,080
what do I do when I'm bored what do I do

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,399
when I'm you know just laying around or

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,379
in meetings or something like that

00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:27,299
oh I doodle a lot I kind of draw and the

00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:29,309
way I tend to draw is either spirals or

00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,289
draw a box and then try to kind of color

00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:33,090
it in and then I thought about

00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:34,740
meditation of course the other big angle

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,929
there's kind of these zen gardens which

00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,730
I guess is what I'm doing now you know

00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:41,340
the the monks would do these gardens and

00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,379
it's just a captivating task for them

00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:47,279
when they're really just trying to learn

00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:48,870
to be blank in their mind so I thought

00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,120
okay well let's make a let's make a

00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,720
spiral game here's the spiral and you

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,029
hover it

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:58,860
I can I can abolish it I can get it I

00:19:54,029 --> 00:20:02,190
went too fast go to slow down nice and

00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:05,070
centering whoa slow down I'm nervous in

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:07,139
front of everybody it's like live coding

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,560
but live spiralling that's an eSport of

00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:13,130
the future

00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:16,430
yeah let's give me that all right so

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:19,070
spyro is awesome I've got a second game

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,240
again wow this is really I'm enjoying it

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,190
I'm enjoying it let's do another one

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,500
let's let's keep going with this

00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:26,420
nature is something you know you're out

00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,600
for a walk you're out having fun nature

00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:31,790
was a perfect inspiration for for this

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,020
this project and I thought yeah let's

00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,520
make another game let's kind of keep

00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,130
going with this here's a it's almost

00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,810
like how things in the forest will will

00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:44,780
rot away and they'll slowly break down

00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:46,250
oh yeah this is doing it as well I can

00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,720
go fast you know but it's not as

00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,830
rewarding I'm gonna have to start

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,630
sitting down gonna have to start

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:56,030
concentrating to kind of hit all these

00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:57,920
points off oh I'll do this one Oh at

00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:02,180
least get all the big ones no I'm just

00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:04,520
gonna do it all okay all right you get

00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,720
the point and I thought oh this is kind

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,090
of great let me just wrap all these

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,860
games up let me put them in a bundle and

00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,270
so that's exactly what I did I thought

00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,520
I'll build out a little website I called

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:16,790
up the Zen zone registered domain put it

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,700
on there and yeah so that's it that's

00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:21,110
the kind of Zen zone you can come in

00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:24,590
pick a game that you want to do let's do

00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:26,180
the swirl let's do it for three minutes

00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:27,260
so you can kind of see when you do one

00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,630
there will be a second one that will

00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:31,010
kind of slide in and you get you get

00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:33,110
kind of focused out on you'll get

00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:34,280
enjoyment and this is exactly what I'm

00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:35,500
talking about it's like oh here's

00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,880
something that I've made from nothing

00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,260
with random ideas that I've kind of just

00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,030
picked up along the way

00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:43,340
it kind of provides a little bit of use

00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,750
it's super nice you know I'm stressing

00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,510
out about the talk over here I can kind

00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:50,150
of sit and focus myself away and and

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,830
build something just for fun and yeah so

00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:53,480
that's the lesson it's kind of a just

00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,190
wanted to demonstrate so much that you

00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,080
can just kind of put things together and

00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,910
not only that is I've kind of build this

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,260
whole platform you know I build a whole

00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,000
website experience I played around with

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,190
react I made a bunch of different games

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,730
canvas in react is this whole whole

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,430
different thing

00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:09,440
recursion for those those crushing bowls

00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,970
the spiral it turns out is called an

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,620
alchemy daeun spiral and there's all

00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,600
this kind of math behind it I just

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,940
messed things up put everything on

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,580
Amazon you know do all the domain it's

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,650
like oh this is a huge bundle of things

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,540
that I've had to learn and

00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:25,130
just to get on that way and not only

00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,480
that is I've kind of built a platform to

00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,400
build other things you know if you have

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,290
more kind of weird meditation ideas or

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,600
anything like that I can just kind of

00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,740
add them on a dam onto the side so

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,760
that's yeah that's kind of what I want

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,260
to just want to talk about I just

00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,450
hopefully give everyone a little bit of
