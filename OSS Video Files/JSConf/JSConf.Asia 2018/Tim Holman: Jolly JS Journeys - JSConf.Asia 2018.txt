Title: Tim Holman: Jolly JS Journeys - JSConf.Asia 2018
Publication date: 2018-02-02
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	Ever started a project you didn't finish? Ever sat and stared at the screen, knowing you wanted to make something, but unsure of what? Ever felt like you're alone in making something? Well this talk is for you. 
Join me, though some weird and wacky wonderings through the web, and find how building, learning and having fun are all connected together... and gain a little more appreciation and love for javascript along the way!

Tim is a tinkerer, tuner & tamperer of all things online, and a massive fan of alliteration. He prides himself in the overall uselessness of the code he's written, as well as the overall joy it brings to the world.
