[Music]

00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:22,080
so it's a huge crowd which is lovely at

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,699
this time of the day you can come closer

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,820
by the way there's gonna be a little bit

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,260
of life coding so probably like it

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,029
should be large enough but you know we

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,430
have so much space in the front rows

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,829
come on don't like highs in the back I'm

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,660
not gonna ask you questions I totally

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,480
will ask you questions No

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,059
so yeah thank you very much rollin for

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,070
the introduction I'm Martin Schmidt head

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,600
of engineering and archaeologic doing a

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,760
little bit of everything in the last

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,530
couple of month we started off with the

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,940
tool like this this is in a browser so

00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:57,149
you could build and show interiors and

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:59,520
like offices houses whatever in your

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,840
browser and also like walk through them

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,070
furnish them and also do like VR

00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,799
experiences in your browser based on

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,950
that VR I'm also Google developer expert

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,600
for web technologies and polymer so

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,299
that's that's something that I kind of

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,670
want to bring to everyone help them I

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,500
want to help you all to build better

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,570
stuff on the web and if you have any

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,770
questions I'm happy to help if I can't

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,600
answer them I'm gonna find you someone

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,009
who can answer them I also work with the

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,590
Mozilla community and the web standards

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,150
community so I try to encourage everyone

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,369
like did you for instance know that all

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,229
the w3c specs and stuff are on github

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:35,909
and you can actually collaborate by

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,009
opening issues or pull requests and

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,869
stuff so definitely check that out the

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,040
next time you see something where you're

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,470
like I don't think this is a good

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,450
decision bring up your comments with the

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,700
standards bodies because we all need

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,189
your input if if we developers want

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,590
better api's we have to give feedback to

00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,030
the browser vendors so now comes the

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,549
boring part of the presentation which is

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,409
the introduction to all this because we

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,600
kind of want to go right into VR but

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,729
let's you know go over a few things that

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,040
make it more like reasonable and put

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,210
things into context so first things

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,390
first there's a lot of abbreviations

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,700
around there acronyms overload right so

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,410
we have like virtual reality we have

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,670
augmented reality we have

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,830
XR like x-reality what mixed reality and

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,840
then what else is there right so how do

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,010
these relate to each other so let's

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,070
start with something that is probably

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,170
not too new has been around since the

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,410
1960s actually when the first couple of

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,150
experiments started it's virtual reality

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:35,910
virtual reality is basically

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,830
constructing a virtual space that the

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,840
user is in so we are basically

00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,400
completely ignoring the real world

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,970
around us we're completely shutting it

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,000
out and building our own little virtual

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:50,490
space what you can use and wander around

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,110
then there's augmented reality which has

00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,330
become more of a buzzword recently

00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,970
especially with Apple and Google putting

00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,170
out a our core and they are KITT

00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,690
respectively actually a Arkady's apple

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,030
and a our core is Google there has been

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,560
experiments with like markers before

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,940
that but now you can actually just use

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,350
your phone you don't need special

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,890
Hardware anymore you can just use a

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:13,200
phone that supports these two like SDKs

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,730
or platforms and just tap on something

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,590
and then it figures out where in space

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,450
you are so that's pretty cool and the

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,000
difference is that we are not shutting

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,400
out the world we are using the

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,440
environment that you are in and adding

00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,990
something to it we augment it so for

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,580
instance you can say one of the first

00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,960
apps that were probably relatively

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,790
popular in Switzerland at least in

00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,460
Switzerland we have mountains as you

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,290
might know and the question and

00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,970
sometimes is especially for like someone

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,430
who's emigrated interest with sidin like

00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,040
me is what mountain is that so I would

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,410
basically bore my friends with friends

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,120
to death by what mountain is that aha

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,790
mountain is that like a freaking six

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,500
year old and with this augmented reality

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,690
what you could do is I could hold up my

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,060
phone my phone figures out here's where

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,700
I am this is where I'm pointing at so

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,530
looking at an database of moms and their

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,080
positions and basically triangulating I

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,970
show you this is that amount this is the

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,280
Duke pizza for instance or whatever like

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,350
this is warm blonde and you can

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,840
basically just like use that it augments

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,760
my view of reality by embedding

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,420
information into the surroundings that

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,419
I'm in at the time all of this is

00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,580
encapsulated when we talk about both we

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:27,660
don't have to say VR and AR we can say

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:30,360
mixed reality or XR for some reason

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,340
so basically it all encompasses both

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,620
things that you can also have like other

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,300
things you can for instance

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:38,280
hypothetically have VR but embedded

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,660
video feed of some other space so then

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,790
you would have to be a likely they have

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,740
a tiny little bit of virtual reality

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,540
with the tiny little bit of like

00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,250
augmented reality so you can mix them

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,780
together so basically when you hear

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,780
these terms you should now know that if

00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,460
I talk about mixed reality or XR I mean

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,389
either virtual reality or augmented

00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,310
reality most specifically VR and AR are

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:02,160
not excluding each other they are not

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,690
like competing in the same space there

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,669
are two different things

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,560
so a lot of people came to me in the

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:09,990
last like year or so and asked like

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,889
Martin do you think AR is gonna like

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:17,370
kill VR or VR is gonna kill a AR and

00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:20,850
like hey do you think carrots will kill

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,860
potatoes because it makes no sense to

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,660
ask this question really it's not a dumb

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,490
question it's just like we haven't done

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,380
a good job explaining this and luckily

00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,510
clay beaver from the Google VR team has

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,120
a wonderful explanation so basically in

00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,430
virtual reality what we do is we take

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,889
you somewhere else

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,180
we are constructing a new reality that

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:41,130
is not the reality that you are in right

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,560
now so while I'm on stage if I go into

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:46,620
VR I could be on a beach which I would

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,120
really enjoy I could be on a really

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,560
really high mountain which I would not

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,180
enjoy because being on a high mountain

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,470
in t-shirt and shorts is usually not a

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,300
good idea

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,490
I could be under the sea which I would

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,710
probably also not enjoy because I have

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:01,830
to breathe somehow so yeah basically

00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:04,830
what it is it is a teleporter it takes

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,539
the user using virtual reality somewhere

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,310
else it can even be like a Fantasyland

00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:10,530
from Alice in Wonderland it doesn't have

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,470
to be a real place it can be anything

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:15,510
that I make up they are on the other

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,750
hand brings some information bring some

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,760
data to me so I'm not teleporting

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,169
somewhere else I'm still on stage but I

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:24,780
get an additional information for

00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:26,700
instance maybe if I had like magical

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,919
goggles like I don't know Google glass

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,190
hololens or whatever they could tell me

00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:34,080
I don't know the your favorite

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,650
Backstreet Boys song or something like

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,450
that or maybe I have an app that allows

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,139
me to put different things here like

00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,539
have to

00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,039
and fake you know virtual people here

00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:46,080
sitting here having a panel discussion

00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:47,939
or something like that so basically it

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,159
brings something to me so it's like

00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,289
magic x-ray goggles it shows me

00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,669
information that I'm not seeing normally

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:55,259
like x-ray goggles would show me

00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:57,659
something that you know is under the

00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,789
surface they are can surface information

00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:02,370
that I'm not having by just using my

00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:04,319
natural senses so this is the difference

00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,529
and now it should become clear that

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,180
they're not competing they are come

00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:11,219
they're basic aliy completing each other

00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,169
or like complementing each other really

00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:14,400
nicely because basically there's two

00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,259
different use cases and they're

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,879
completely different one is bringing

00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:20,400
information to me in the situation that

00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,740
I am right now and you could say like

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,659
basically Google Maps as a augmented

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,090
reality application in the broadest

00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:28,680
sense because it tells me where to go

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:30,479
right so it gives me information that I

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,229
don't have at the moment

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,000
whereas VR takes me somewhere else

00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:38,580
biggest difference so what's the

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,259
landscape of we are like at the moment

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,439
so what is the kind of like the market

00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:46,909
looking like so we have the HTC vive for

00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:51,150
instance this is like more or less like

00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:53,009
a high-power sports car you have these

00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,839
little trekkers here and here you have

00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:56,069
to put them up it's a little hassle to

00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:57,599
set that up because you have to

00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:59,460
literally like bring it on the wall or

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,139
put it on tripods or something but then

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,729
you can move along in the room and the

00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,110
the trackers track you so you actually

00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:05,879
know where in the room you are so you

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:07,289
can walk around in a virtual room which

00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,060
is like super cool you have two

00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:11,159
controllers with lots of buttons and

00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:12,569
touch pads and stuff so you can really

00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:14,399
nicely interact with your virtual

00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:17,189
environment however that comes as a

00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,330
prize and the price is quite expensive

00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:20,849
and it's more or less the same in

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,159
dollars probably and then we have this

00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:25,409
one this is different oh by the way this

00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:26,729
one requires a computer that is strong

00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:29,159
enough to actually power so you need a

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:31,649
gaming pc or a gaming laptop so that

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:34,110
laptop is probably around $1000 as well

00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:36,719
so like you have to add that on top then

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,909
we have this one this is different first

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,010
things first it is like untethered you

00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:43,680
have no cables here you put your phone

00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,079
in and you put that thing onto your head

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,339
and off you go

00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,959
however there has a downside that this

00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:52,420
thing does not know we're in the room I

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:55,540
am so it doesn't it can't tell this

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,700
is different than this position yes sure

00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,860
it has gyroscopes and stuff but they're

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,660
not accurate and fast enough to actually

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,910
do this kind of tracking in a room scale

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,530
so it's gonna get like imprecise and

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,030
when something doesn't add up in your

00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:09,010
brain then you're gonna vomit which is

00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,210
not a nice experience so this one the

00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:12,100
only thing you can do is you can look

00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,760
around the space there you're standing

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,040
or sitting but it comes as a lower price

00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:21,280
it's around $100 maybe even less these

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,750
days but you also have to have a samsung

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,970
phone that is compatible with it this is

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,740
the gear VR from Samsung there's other

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,970
headsets as well I'm just picking a few

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,980
of them that's like daydream there's a

00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:33,340
oculus rift all these exists somewhere

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:37,060
on the spectrum then we have this any

00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,860
guesses on the price five Google

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,420
cardboard is around five dollars it's

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,180
like if you'd ship it from China it's

00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,560
probably like two dollars really but it

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,360
also has the downside you don't have

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,980
like any buttons any controllers

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,510
anything and you only have the

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,850
orientation so you can only look around

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,070
but it works with most phones not all

00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:57,610
phones if you have a potato phone os

00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:03,730
then that's gonna be a bad time if you

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:06,220
have a Windows Phone moving on so the

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,810
mark kids in 2016 I still haven't seen

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,920
numbers for last year so I'm waiting for

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,390
the numbers for last year I was

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,150
basically like frantically checking

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:15,520
Google like are the numbers out for 2017

00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:18,640
they're not okay fine I'm gonna go with

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,410
the numbers for the previous year 2016

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,230
so here we see how many of these devices

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:26,650
have been sold and you see like oculus

00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:30,120
rift is around like 450,000 HTC vive

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:32,710
around like 489 500 thousand devices

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:35,560
PlayStation VR a little over 600

00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,850
thousand devices daydream that just came

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,350
out this year so it's a little bit like

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,840
comparing apples to oranges because

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:43,180
daydream basically came out in q3 of

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,830
that year so they'd only got like two

00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,270
quarters instead of the full four

00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:48,820
quarters so it sounds like a few hundred

00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,380
thousand devices and give er that has

00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,350
been around the longest probably

00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:55,720
together with oculus rift has been

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:58,990
around like a couple of million 2.2

00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,420
million devices sold and so you can you

00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,430
can draw conclusions from this so if you

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,680
think about it this is like the high-end

00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,339
VR experience you have to have a gamer

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,980
PC

00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:11,410
like really strong graphics engine in

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,180
there you have to set up the room for it

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,800
and you have to like buy this hardware

00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,769
that is I think the rift is now like

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,139
$300 or $400 or something like that the

00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:23,829
HTC survive still a little more like 700

00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:25,540
600 $700 and these require a bunch of

00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:27,670
effort and you really have to really

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,100
really want it because you have to like

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,339
buy hardware for it and then we have the

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,629
the mobile VR here and you can tell

00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:36,519
about the gear VR that Mobile is

00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:38,800
probably the thing that people are ok

00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,189
with and like around 100 bucks is what

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,480
they are ok with spending for and then

00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:45,730
surprisingly game consoles I just have

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,290
that in for the you know for the fun

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,490
conclusion that gaming consoles

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,620
apparently are also something that

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:54,550
people want to invest in for new gear

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,680
and for so this looks like give yards by

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,149
far the most popular player and the

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,459
market has been the most popular player

00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:06,160
in the market in 2016 can you tell me

00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:08,499
which one is missing here a cardboard so

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:14,410
why did I forget that well I didn't

00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:18,399
forget it it's just it's changing the

00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,689
graph a little so we had and that's like

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,029
estimated numbers like that's a

00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:23,709
conservative estimation because a lot of

00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:25,899
devices that are not technically

00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:27,850
cardboard are actually cardboards like

00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:29,679
you can get like plastic versions of a

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:33,480
cardboard which is not really counting

00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:35,889
towards this number but we get like 82

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,899
I'm sorry what what is the number right

00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,610
it's - my name is eros I keep getting

00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:44,199
confused yes it's like 80 something

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:45,730
million devices out there so you could

00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:49,629
say yeah

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:51,069
the high end is where I go for this is

00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:53,470
what I should build for because you can

00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:58,420
build amazing experiences but then your

00:12:53,470 --> 00:13:01,209
users are less likely to have them so

00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,279
what we have to keep in mind is we are

00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:05,649
at a stage and this is probably still

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,679
true today with its changing but we're

00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:12,100
still not there yet that the market is

00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:13,660
mostly low-end we are explorers which is

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,519
cool because we actually haven't figured

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,350
out how to do we are like what we can

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,060
all do with we are in total like we

00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,030
haven't even under

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,430
stood what the medium can deliver so far

00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,500
and the same goes for ARS was basically

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:27,090
XR is unexplored territory so we need

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,010
some time to basically build stuff and

00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:31,380
try things out and we can do that

00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:34,110
because users are willing to is to spend

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,160
a little money to try it out with us but

00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,960
we have to understand that the

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,060
capabilities are the minimum

00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,680
capabilities we're not having like two

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,020
controllers and room-scale tracking

00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,390
where can I go oh my god no we are at

00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,680
the very very beginning so bear in mind

00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:49,350
that most people are actually running

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,540
card boards these days still and I think

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,060
the web is the best platform to start

00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,850
exploring for the simple reason that the

00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:59,280
web as web developers we have learned to

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,830
not expect much from the devices we are

00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,200
on we don't know where our browsers

00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:06,420
running could be a fridge it could be a

00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,210
watch it could be a potato who knows

00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:12,150
right if it has a browser it can run the

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,680
web so unlike native developers who are

00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:15,810
like no no no no no I know the screen

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,130
sizes like this and I remember the day

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:19,740
when the two different screen size

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,090
iPhones came out and the iOS Department

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,670
in a company that I worked for at the

00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:26,550
time just went bananas like two screen

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,870
sizes who can deal with that right we're

00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,520
gonna need the next two months to

00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:31,950
actually factor all our application

00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:35,360
layouts and I'm like how's the web team

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:38,850
doing we're like what oh we're done

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,320
solved so the same goes for VR because

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,670
we don't know what kind of device we're

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,050
having and even if we would know what

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,430
kind of device we're having there's a

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,770
lot of assumptions we can't make the

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,480
controller's from the wife you have two

00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:50,820
controllers so I can totally do like oh

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,400
yeah the you start the game by dragging

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,840
something open with two controllers

00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,640
that's cool but the controls are

00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,090
wireless so they have to charge every

00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,680
now and then so imagine the experience

00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,510
of a user having one thing in the

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,430
charger base somewhere and then going

00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:08,640
like I'm gonna play this game start the

00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:10,950
game by dragging with two hands it's not

00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,260
working right it's not a good experience

00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:16,200
so basically we know how to deal with

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,150
responsive capabilities we have to deal

00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,710
with what we can build and then

00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,120
basically enhance until we reach the

00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,770
level of the capabilities of the

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,270
hardware that we're running on and I

00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:26,880
think the web is perfect for that and

00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:28,800
everything that has a browser is able to

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,420
basically display content so we can

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,800
figure out a way to actually make all

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,770
our content respond

00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:37,080
so for instance if you're coming to my

00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:39,630
page with a Netscape Navigator I might

00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,300
show you an image of a building instead

00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,040
like a 3d image JPEG image your Netscape

00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,530
Navigator can probably deal with that

00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,000
cool and then if you're coming with a

00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:51,000
more modern browser on a desktop without

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,430
any VR hardware or on a phone you get a

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,530
you get a 3d thing that you can like use

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:57,240
the mouse and keyboard or touchscreen to

00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:58,740
navigate around and then you have a

00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,900
button that you press and then you go

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,030
into VR and actually experience it as if

00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,380
you were there that's pretty cool and

00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,810
the web is basically the perfect

00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:10,290
platform because it fits the paradigm so

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:12,890
well also the other thing is if I build

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:15,360
something for let's say vive or oculus

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:17,040
and then I build something and I is

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,020
let's say we have like a paint

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,670
application we can like paint something

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,170
and it's like I want to show this to you

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,980
and then maybe you want to add something

00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:27,420
to it but then you have a cardboard

00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,460
that's sad right so the only way to

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:30,720
actually collaborate or share would then

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,730
be to take my wonderful

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,290
three-dimensional scene and take a

00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,350
picture of that and send you a picture

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,030
what's the point of that right so I

00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,890
think the web is flexible enough to do

00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,140
that but the question is can we even

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,930
like do 3d graphics on the web and the

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,910
answer is yes yes like WebGL has been

00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,560
around since 2011 so most browsers are

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,050
supported opera doesn't support it

00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,280
because it is usually relatively sorry

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,130
Opera Mini doesn't support it because

00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,650
the VR sorry the 3d content is usually

00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,210
pretty heavy on data and they don't want

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,100
that kind of data so they're not

00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,600
supporting it so that you have to then

00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,910
deal like okay right I'll give you the

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,320
image version here you go and that's

00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:10,440
perfectly fine that's a reasonable

00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:12,210
assumption so eighty six point five

00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,980
percent of the global browser users

00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,780
actually are capable of displaying 3d

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,270
graphics interactive 2d graphics in the

00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,950
browser with no plugins required that's

00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,960
pretty cool

00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:24,960
but for vpr we need something else so

00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:28,470
basically we do need actually WebGL to

00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:32,310
render things to display 3d content but

00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:33,960
VR or XR AR whatever needs something

00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:35,760
else on top of that because we need

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,260
access to the devices we need access to

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,330
other information like the sensor

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,700
information the controllers we need all

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,010
that and that's exactly what the web XR

00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,830
API and the web via our API before that

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,690
our

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,789
about so it gives us information is

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,679
there a headset available on the phone

00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:52,720
it usually says yes because you have

00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,010
cardboards so we can't really detect

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,500
that because you just put your phone

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,090
into a piece of cardboard but basically

00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,570
the assumption is yes you have a headset

00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:03,669
you could go into VR if you wanted it

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,380
also checks if we have information of

00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:06,640
where in the room you are which you do

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:10,090
have on higher-end

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,000
devices or at least where you're looking

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:16,360
at at the moment the orientation of the

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,980
users field of view and it exposes the

00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:21,100
controller so we can actually work with

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,620
this so don't confuse the vet VR or the

00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:26,649
web xrap eyes as something that renders

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,179
2d graphics it does not it's the only

00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:30,100
thing that it does is it gives us access

00:18:28,179 --> 00:18:32,260
to the headsets and send like image data

00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:35,260
there it gives us your orientation and

00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:38,200
position of the user if available and it

00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:40,419
exposes any possible controllers using

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,269
the gamepad API so that's pretty much it

00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:45,100
it does not create 3d graphics we have

00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:47,529
to do something else to get 3d graphics

00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,360
and that was what WebGL is for I see

00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:51,399
that often confused it is two different

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,019
things and this is also why it's so

00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:55,000
responsive because we can start with a

00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:59,669
3d experience so yesterday I had a

00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:05,529
workshop on on VR at the center's our

00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:07,960
shangri-la thing hotel and I was telling

00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:09,130
like yes this is all VR already but

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,899
we're not going to test it because it's

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,730
just like putting up more time we would

00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,230
need more time to like put it on the

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,870
headset and see if it looks good and

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,570
then go back to the computer and refresh

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:21,130
but because it is basically just sending

00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:23,649
more information to us so that we can

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:26,409
actually change our our camera and stuff

00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:28,870
like that we can just start with the 3d

00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:31,539
experience and then enhance VR or a are

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,700
on top of it which is exactly what we

00:19:31,539 --> 00:19:35,860
want because we can't expect that any or

00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:40,419
like all of our users want to be in VR

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:42,580
all the time we don't know that now the

00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:45,519
VIP VR API currently exists in version

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:49,600
1.1 2.0 coming out soon it's gonna be

00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:52,210
renamed it's gonna be called the web XR

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,889
API the immersive devices API or

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,289
something like that so it's going to be

00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:58,730
renamed because in version 2.0 we are

00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:01,130
also addressing other mixed reality

00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:04,310
concerns so we're also having a are in

00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:07,160
there so we're moving from VR to broader

00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,990
API that also supports a are in one set

00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:13,460
of API so that you don't have to worry

00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:16,550
about this which is nice but the AVR 1.1

00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:19,610
VR 1.1 implementation is a little

00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,810
lacking so far but what's cool is a few

00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,260
browsers shipped it in production

00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:27,200
already you have Firefox since version

00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,390
55 shipping it Chrome for Android is

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,360
shipping it since Chrome for Android 59

00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:34,220
it there are builds for chromium that

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,140
actually supported but in April we're

00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:39,170
gonna ship or we're gonna problem

00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:41,570
hopefully see web X our API is shipping

00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:47,770
and Chrome regular on desktops as well

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:53,060
and holy moly

00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:54,560
Edge's shipping them what right so yeah

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:58,400
I think that's like that's pretty cool

00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:01,490
actually and not only them so like we

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,900
have seen edge we have Samsung internet

00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,610
ships them as well

00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,520
we have Carmel which is an experimental

00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,350
browser from Facebook for oculus

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,360
definitely there's a chrome version

00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,850
there's chromium chromium version

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,290
there's Chrome for Android shipping it

00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:17,930
Firefox nightly has had it for ages

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:20,390
already and then there's the out one out

00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,550
there servo server has support for web

00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:24,020
excel as well and it's like super cool

00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,390
because they are proposing in addition

00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,010
to WebGL that makes it even faster and

00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,110
better and nicer so that's pretty

00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:32,090
exciting so we have it available on many

00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:34,100
many many devices already and it's only

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:37,850
going to be more devices having this

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:40,540
support soon it's an open standard it's

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:43,580
not one company doing it all vendors I

00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,620
hear that someone has joined the working

00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,180
group from Safari so safaris team is

00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,400
also on the working group they're not

00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,960
signaling much yet but they are on the

00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,640
working group which is a good sign I

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,350
would say but it's an open standard

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,150
where all the vendors are working

00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,400
together to bring us in the set of api's

00:21:56,150 --> 00:22:00,320
and they work together with oculus and

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,180
HTC and Samsung and all the other

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,160
companies that make headsets for us as

00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,930
well so that's pretty exciting daydream

00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,000
supports it as well so that's like

00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,530
really nice and there's so much tooling

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,210
and a really strong community going on

00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,500
like whenever you are having a question

00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,380
you pop into a slack that is

00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,750
like dedicated to epics are or one of

00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,280
the libraries and everyone's like super

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,810
keen to help you there's like lots of

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,300
activity on Stack Overflow for all these

00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:25,610
things lots of tutorials available so

00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,520
you can get started relatively quickly

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:31,250
and it is just easier to create and

00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,440
share a co-worker of mine has tried to

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,300
do it with unity and if this unity is a

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,360
perfectly fine tool unity is an amazing

00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,700
tool for when you want to do what unity

00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:42,110
does so if you're a game developer unity

00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,400
is a great way to like quickly build a

00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,130
game that is cross-platform that's

00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,860
amazing it also exports to WebGL also

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:50,900
amazing however the developer cycle is

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,180
different because you code you compile

00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,920
you take your head you run you take your

00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,080
headset you pull it on you'll be like ah

00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,060
damn I made a stupid mistake here you

00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,450
put it down you go back to your computer

00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,430
you like rewrite you recompile you rerun

00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,470
you you know it takes a little while to

00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:09,560
get that going the cycle is quite slow

00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,780
actually so basically with the web you

00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,230
just like write the code try it out oh

00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,530


00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,640
fix it reload or still not good and

00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:18,800
then you basically iterate really

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,590
quickly over that this is how you get

00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,970
started no just kidding this is the

00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:24,140
current another concern like everyone's

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,910
like super concerned that it's super

00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,950
hard to get started that's not true

00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,330
anymore so let's quickly try this I

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,520
tried this for like one minute and then

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,490
we're gonna have to have to move on

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,470
unfortunately so here I have a very very

00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:38,000
boring website and I have the code for

00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,190
this very very boring website but I love

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,620
to libraries I load Mozilla's a frame

00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:45,470
and I load our libraries shameless plug

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,360
the 3d i/o library and I have something

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,120
here that looks suspicious right I have

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,830
something here called the a scene so

00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,300
what can I do it will have an a scene

00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:54,860
what I can do is I can create entities

00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,380
basically this is like a stage this is

00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,850
an empty stage and I can put something

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,960
on this stage I can say I want the

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:06,590
geometry to be a box and I want a

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,240
material that has a color red and now I

00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:10,190
want to move this around on the stage so

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,560
maybe I say like and all of these

00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,990
numbers are meters because that's the

00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,160
metric system is a sensible system so I

00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,450
don't want to move it to the left or to

00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:19,130
the right I don't want to move it up or

00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:23,620
down but I want to move it two meters

00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:24,770
into the screen and now if i refresh

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,390
tada

00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:28,370
there's a red box now

00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,470
is not an exciting demo but I have a VR

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,300
button here so I can go into VR if I

00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,130
would have a VR headset what was really

00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,530
cool is a frame has a bunch of developer

00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:38,750
tools so we get a full-blown 3d editor

00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:41,060
as developer tools in here and that

00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,310
allows me to like move The Box around so

00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:45,170
I can move it here and there and then I

00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:48,170
go back and hey look at that the box has

00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:49,640
moved I can also change things about

00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:54,380
this box so I don't want the box

00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:57,050
I want a eye one day I don't know Taurus

00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,580
not boom here we go we have a Taurus not

00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:01,640
cool I don't know why you would want

00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,560
that but go ahead I don't judge I don't

00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,780
like the color so hey how about we make

00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:07,760
this like blueish and I don't like that

00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:11,120
it's not very metally and shiny I want

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,100
this to be shinier so I would go and

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,600
where's the metalness parameter here it

00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:17,090
is here we go like we make this like

00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,370
super shiny hey we have a shiny thing

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,990
now and you can basically build your

00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,060
application like this you can explore

00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,700
and what I can also do is I can go like

00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:28,730
hey 3d IO people who did something for

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,890
me here so I can drag-and-drop something

00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,930
that they build and just use it in my

00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,400
application and if the Wi-Fi holds up

00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,560
yes here we are

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,120
we can go back in and hey look at that

00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,540
there's a weird tourist not in an

00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:44,980
apartment that you might know we can

00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:48,680
stand in Sheldon's spot just to you know

00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:50,510
anger him so it's really easy to get

00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,160
building really really quickly and you

00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:55,190
don't have like I don't have to know any

00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:58,130
math here I basically just just add HTML

00:25:55,190 --> 00:26:00,830
tags and that's more or less it so I can

00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:05,360
say hey maybe I want to copy out what I

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:06,650
just build in here so I can go here now

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,020
that's the light that's not what I want

00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,300
it I can go here and I can just go okay

00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:15,020
I want to copy this into my code now and

00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:16,610
then I paste this into my code and if i

00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:20,570
refresh Hey look at that

00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:22,400
tada right so this is a really really

00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,770
nice and fast way to get going and

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,100
basically start building things with no

00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:29,900
big deal and no big pain so this is

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,040
really nice to get started and actually

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,300
you can build really exciting

00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,890
applications with it you can build

00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,190
production-ready applications with a

00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:39,500
frame and that's actually pretty expand

00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:40,100
so as I said this is not just VR and 3d

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,200
this is all

00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,000
also going to have a our capabilities

00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,640
thanks to the API broadening up in

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,770
version two to be an X our API so that's

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,850
exciting and you can do things like this

00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:55,130
oh no the video is noting again anyway

00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:57,140
this is a VAR application we have oh

00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:00,049
look at that so here we are in Zurich

00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:03,580
and we're basically plotting out where

00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:06,620
the walls of this wonderful room are and

00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:08,330
turned it on turn this is an open source

00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,890
demo you can basically clone that from

00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:13,130
github if you ask me for the URL I'm

00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:16,100
happy to share that later on and then we

00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:18,320
say we're door is so here's a door tada

00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,000
and then there's another door tada which

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,919
is like a super weird living room but ok

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,450
let's go for it you get a floor plan

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,580
based on that and then you can say I

00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:28,130
want to furnish this and using our API

00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:30,590
you get furniture and you see like this

00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,940
is actual this is a our we are in a real

00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,679
world context and we're adding

00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,570
information to it and this is on the

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,789
phone and this is on the browser so this

00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,350
demo is actually available you need an

00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,880
experimental browser right now but

00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:44,299
that's gonna change in the near future

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,370
so here we go they are settled that's

00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:49,460
gonna be an interesting talk on that by

00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,840
a 180 and later today there's more stuff

00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,130
out there there's the a-frames school

00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,990
that gets you going with a frame really

00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,789
quickly there's the up crater 3d dot IO

00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,700
that's our thing that gets you like a

00:27:55,789 --> 00:28:00,320
playground environment I actually do

00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,210
videos together with my co-workers that

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,159
explain you all the important things or

00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:06,140
the steps that you need to do we have a

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,960
bit of a blog shameless plug

00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:11,090
there's an amazing group the WebEx our

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,590
Asia group on Facebook you want to join

00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,720
them and basically connect to your local

00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:17,000
community because they're awesome people

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,830
that want to help you face-to-face so

00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,860
definitely go there and check it out and

00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:24,470
also exchange ideas and stuff and I want

00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:26,870
you to build stuff with this if this is

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:29,960
the one takeaway that you take away make

00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:31,940
it the following if compute if the

00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,549
computer is the bicycle for our mind

00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:38,240
which accelerates our natural abilities

00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:40,190
then VR is a teleporter and it can take

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,620
you anywhere and now is the time to

00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:45,650
start exploring so build something and

00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,419
show me what you build I want to see

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,240
what you all are coming up with and

00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:51,830
there's so much to explore and thank you

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,239
so much for listening to me and coming

00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,189
out this early in the morning

00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:56,959
and I'm around the entire day for

00:28:55,189 --> 00:28:59,659
questions and I'll be at the Mozilla

00:28:56,959 --> 00:29:01,579
booth I think for questions as well and

00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:03,469
definitely come talk to me and show me

00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:05,269
what you build and I'm like super

00:29:03,469 --> 00:29:10,039
excited to see what's gonna happen next

00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:11,320
in this space thank you very much Thank

00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:14,660
You Martha
