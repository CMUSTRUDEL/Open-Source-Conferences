Title: Pasindu De Silva & the Node Party Bot Attendees: Party Bots United - JSConf.Asia 2018
Publication date: 2018-02-15
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	This short demonstration wants to show the results of Pasindu De Silvas workshop at JSConf.Asia 2018. Attendees created party themed within 2 hours and learned about getting started and how to control a device with servos and LEDs. The attendees then came up with their own ideas on a party robot and built it with the rest of the time. 

Pasindu works on building open source text to speech systems for low resource languages by day and does various JavaScript Nodebots projects by night.

[Music]

00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,750
so this is party bus United so

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,270
previously we always had note bots at

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,670
JavaScript conference but in all this

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,400
what we did was the right-hand side

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,050
which were like simple BOTS cars that we

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,300
you would we would give the participants

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,759
and they would work on it and make it

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,380
stylistic so this times we wanted to be

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,690
more adventurous and try something new

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,960
so in the first session what we did was

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,210
we met made that so everybody get a

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,879
clear idea on how to control robots

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,789
using nodejs then what we wanted to do

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:51,530
was for them to make a bot that you

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:55,469
would use in a party it can be vaguely

00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:58,469
at a party but then it's okay so we

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,420
brought a lot of stuff for them we had

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,899
poppers we were hoping to use some

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:08,280
flames or five lugs also but then we

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:11,700
didn't thank God I guess so those are

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,390
the things so I'll present to that two

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,700
that are here so this is one of the bots

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,340
one of the participants made its a

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,790
clapper so there is a motor running that

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:27,420
raises the wood thing and then it just

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:32,490
drops the next one is something like a

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:34,680
windmill so there's a fan so the idea is

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,920
when you turn up the turn on the lights

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:41,759
at home or the party is finished and

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,880
everybody turns of the lights then the

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:49,710
fan try gets blowing so that's the idea

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,560
behind it so then we'll go into the

00:01:49,710 --> 00:02:01,649
other demos so if you can go to the live

00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:05,180
demo live view so yeah so this would do

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,180
it first and the second

00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:17,260
so this is supposed to be a cocktail or

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:26,110
a drink maker kind of thing so the idea

00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:28,270
is let's see first okay so the idea is

00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:30,670
this is supposed to work wireless in the

00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:33,460
future or it's supposed to be working

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,940
Wireless so the idea is when somebody is

00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:41,200
pouring the water here for the water

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:44,830
there so if there is a cup it if it pour

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,960
the water there in if you do it really

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:52,810
good it could be something like a magic

00:02:46,960 --> 00:03:02,260
trick so that's our first pot that we

00:02:52,810 --> 00:03:06,250
made so the second one so the second one

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:11,970
is supposed to be something like so it's

00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,970
another variation of a fan okay

00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:41,370
yeah so you it actually blows very good

00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:44,100
vend that's all right so let's now take

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,880
a look at the the other four who's gonna

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,340
talk about it

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,380
so first up please introduce yourself

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,660
for yourselves so my name is James and

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,280
this is Leon what did you set out to do

00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,060
and is that the same thing is what it

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,980
became

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,470
roughly is so we started in the morning

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,300
with a car and then we decided that this

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,220
what looks like a toilet seat is

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:04,140
actually a basketball hoop so the

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,340
concept is like an arcade game where you

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,489
have a basketball hoop and you shoot it

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,630
in except one person can control it so

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,720
it makes it difficult for the other

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:18,079
person to score yeah passive aggressive

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,079
basketball hoop yes that's it

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,850
[Laughter]

00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:53,809
except so oh it is my name is having us

00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:56,449
and I have created a bot that that uses

00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:58,999
mobilizer controller and besides it to

00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:02,749
be can you the wise command like front

00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:06,139
back left or right and it will do its

00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:09,129
job accordingly so and this is working

00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,129
yeah Wow

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:45,480
yeah so if I am giving the front

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,230
[Music]

00:05:54,930 --> 00:06:21,320
it will go left it will go right if I

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:21,320
will speak front walk back left right

00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,870
[Applause]

00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:35,340
for this I have used the emesis web RTC

00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:38,400
SDK and I am recognizing the Y's and

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:41,639
after that I am sending that to the SDK

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,130
of RTC channel and after that it is

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,169
sending the signal to the robot and it

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,630
is doing its job accordingly that's

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:49,830
impressive to the design change while

00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:53,610
you were producing it did you objective

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:54,539
change the intention change while you

00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,789
were building it or was this more or

00:06:54,539 --> 00:07:02,880
less what you set out to produce mmm

00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:05,120
actually we can do little bit more thing

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,270
like machine learning on device

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:13,349
recognition so we can call either Google

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:18,360
library Google API dot AI or Watson or

00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:20,880
we can use Alexa library and rest of the

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,930
things commands will be changed same the

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:27,509
similar thing can be used for mind

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:29,789
controlling we can train this for

00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:32,580
controlling by mind so if somebody is

00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:35,870
thinking far left it will go left it

00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:47,099
will overwrite but for that I know one

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:50,880
emitter okay so let's start with who are

00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:52,530
you oh hi I'm Melvin and this is San our

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,419
third member of the team is well yeah

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:58,560
he's somewhere out there having lunch

00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:03,930
and a party but is going to dance and

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:06,050
any of a surprise what could possibly go

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,050
wrong

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:06,680
okay yeah so hi this is Terry and this

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:09,830
is my partner mathÃ© we have another one

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:15,470
para I couldn't find him so this is what

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:21,430
we this is the LED stripe and see what's

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:21,430
on it can alright okay what if I spin it

00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:31,750
it's going up

00:09:44,660 --> 00:10:00,000
intermittently okay the idea is you're

00:09:54,629 --> 00:10:03,319
supposed to see something this doesn't

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,189
seem like a robot how is this a robot

00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:10,009
it's this is a robot who can have this

00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:13,290
one-dimensional thing as a

00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:14,250
two-dimensional degree display had you

00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,310
intended that the Rebbe will have its

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:20,790
own arm to do this with it's actually

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:23,910
it's harder to use a human's beam

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,319
because you don't have like a steady rpm

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:29,189
that's the idea

00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:35,129
so okay very cool okay how do we do on

00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:36,650
the it's that called tech support

00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:39,050
Lavallee

00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:40,500
[Laughter]

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:44,329
all right

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,329
do you have other go this one or is this

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,820
[Laughter]

00:10:48,139 --> 00:11:08,720
no are we giving up or is it all right

00:10:53,339 --> 00:11:08,720
this might be an appropriate moment okay

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:40,610
we're not seeing it sort of text okay

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:43,579
version two okay so this is me

00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:45,740
attempting to pronounce names this time

00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:48,140
because my co-host has already gotten

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:52,339
his turn so I'm just repeating the names

00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:55,250
for those who have been who's had their

00:11:52,339 --> 00:12:01,070
lightning talks being selected so first

00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:05,140
up is yuzu schwa the second person is

00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:09,920
and um I've met the third person is from

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:12,529
param Sandra I'm sorry I'm really sorry

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,220
if I met any of your names the fourth

00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:26,899
person is shilling Thai the fifth person

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:30,740
is you're sure you use person is rjl

00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:33,230
elbow yeah that's that's it so if your

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:36,649
name has been caught you really should

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:39,500
show up at the through that is 2:45 time

00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:40,760
slot where you'll be you'll be have a

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,040
chance to actually talk about your

00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,630
lightning talks

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,940
great great thank you

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,010
hopefully all six people have heard at

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,980
least one of those announcements so

00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:56,510
apparently this final partybot

00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:59,380
having now built up the expectation is

00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:59,380
going to dance for us

00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,020
[Laughter]

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:17,650
this needs some music I if I sing

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:19,660
everybody will leave okay the most

00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:22,630
exciting part of the dance hasn't yet

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:28,860
happened and I think all the electronics

00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:33,180
just fell apart that's cheating

00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,180
[Laughter]

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:46,810
but also effective yes okay anything

00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,370
else we have a few minutes we'd like to

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:53,980
talk about things that didn't didn't

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:58,510
work yeah so one of the ideas was so one

00:13:53,980 --> 00:14:02,100
of the ideas we had was to do there was

00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:05,350
a sound controlled

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:09,580
so a sound control audio equalizer kind

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:12,790
of thing but with with actual like LED

00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:15,940
no strips and one one thing we found out

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:18,490
was the the port or the sensor that we

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,860
were using was not not that powerful

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:24,490
enough or the quality was not that good

00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:26,080
so we weren't able to do it one of the

00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,560
other things we tried was like a nerf

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:32,290
gun that you can shoot one of the the

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,350
problem there was there was a thing in

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:38,950
the nerf grande one in in the nerf gun

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:41,890
that we had you have to charge it or do

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,780
some action beforehand and that was it

00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:44,620
it was not only a trigger so that was a

00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,930
hard thing too

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:51,520
so you need a sort of IOT optimized nerf

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:56,440
gun yes so those were those are the

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:59,530
things we tried well we did try we I

00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,990
think we lost many boards on our Dino

00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:07,000
nanos and who knows trying to make these

00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:09,690
things and yeah it's hard yes I think

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,800
that's pretty much all that we try

00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:15,810
did try alright well it's fantastic

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,670
I think huge round of applause for

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,350
actually making hardware work that's

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:27,159
always tough

00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:27,159
