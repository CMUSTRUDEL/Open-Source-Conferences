Title: Bruce Lawson: If You're Going Out Of San Francisco, Be Sure To Wear... - JSConf.Asia 2018
Publication date: 2018-02-03
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	We do like our Holy Wars, don't we? â€” tables vs CSS? Responsive vs mdot? React vs Angular? CSS or CSS-in-JS? Let's look at the real issue: getting the free and open web to the other 4 billion people.

Bruce has been working on the web since 2002. He was a member of the Web Standards Project on the authoring committee of BS8878, the British Standard for commissioning accessible websites, helped develop HTML responsive images, was on the W3C Mobile Web Apps Best Practices Working Group, and co-authored "Introducing HTML5", the first full-length book on the subject. He was Deputy CTO of Opera Software until 2016, and now helps Wix Engineering with web standards and products.

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,539
hippie and I'm really nervous

00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:30,810

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:39,629
over 25 years a tour of all of Southeast

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:57,809
it fast try not to fall asleep if you do

00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:00,420
just ask me what you missed afterwards

am than Jake Archibald and it'd all be

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:10,860
good my talk is called if you're going

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:14,820
out of San Francisco the be sure to wear

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:18,030
web standards in your hair as I've said

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,159
I'm an old hippie and I made this slide

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:27,540
myself I'm available for freelance

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:31,409
design work if anybody needs me I'm here

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,530
to talk about war and peace I'm a hippie

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:38,009
I love peace peace guys I'm not talking

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:41,220
about you know huge devastating clashes

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:44,040
of civilizations I'm talking about you

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,390
know not not the really really important

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:53,640
things like this guy's icons I I fix

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:58,439
them for him yes we can talk later about

00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:02,549
that I'm talking about holy wars holy

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:06,090
wars are kind of doctrinal clashes

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:09,599
between different sects of a religion

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,800
like Catholicism and Protestantism or

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,310
Shia and

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,100
that matter greatly hello man with a

00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,950
camera mattered greatly to the people

00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,440
involved but to people outside its

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,420
really really incomprehensible I'm

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,070
talking about the kind of big questions

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:33,820
like Beatles or all the stones or big

00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:39,880
macs or whoppers or Iron Maiden

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:43,030
or proper music sorry Jake we've had

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:47,920
many many wholly web wars ie versus

00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:51,220
Netscape tables versus CSS jQuery versus

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,550
vanilla JavaScript angular versus embarr

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:58,240
and the vs. react all these kind of

00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:02,709
things and there's a new holy war that I

00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:05,200
am hoping to help solve today so we can

00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:09,190
actually get away from holy wars and

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:13,930
factor on focus on the important things

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:17,860
the current holy war is about how to do

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:21,940
styling in component-based development

00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:23,890
so one side says CSS is completely

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:26,890
unsuitable for styling modern web

00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:28,959
applications and CSS in j/s is much

00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,670
better because javascript is better and

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,170
anything that can be written in

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,060
javascript should be written in

00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:40,120
javascript and that's true because Jeff

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:43,900
Atwood says so and your mum smells the

00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,360
other side says oh yeah well you're just

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,250
a back-end developer with no idea how

00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,380
the web is meant to work you're so

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,440
stupid you don't understand inheritance

00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:56,049
and you're scared of the Cascade

00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,170
hahahaha and your mum's so fat she has

00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:01,560
her own namespace

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:04,080
we've all heard these arguments

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,680
regardless of which side you're on

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,690
it doesn't really matter now I love

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,170
component based development I didn't

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,410
used to but I do now because it reminds

00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:20,880
me of when I was a software engineer

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:22,540
writing Fortran and COBOL and 6502

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,900
assembler

00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:32,790
in the late eighties yes I know I might

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:32,790
look 24 but I'm actually nearly 30 um

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:40,030
I'm talking mostly about react but we

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:43,240
could also talk this could also be

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:47,170
appropriate for web components which is

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:51,040
a spec that Alex Russell from Google has

00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,570
been heavily promoting Google are really

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,620
behind this

00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:59,680
I don't want you to read too much into

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:03,490
the fact that web components is pushed

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:08,770
by Google and it's an anagram of spec

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:10,930
own entomb that's just a coincidence I'm

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,850
absolutely certain but I love

00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,380
component-based architecture because it

00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,290
reminds me of when I used to write

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:20,080
little modules because the computer I

00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,480
worked on could only have 8k in memory

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,070
at any one time and we could take

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,580
modules and share them and link them all

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,910
together

00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,260
I like reusability because I don't know

00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:32,650
about you you're all terribly

00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,720
hard-working but I'm really lazy and if

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,780
I could write something once and use it

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,540
a thousand times in the future while

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:43,450
continuing to build the client I'm a

00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:47,110
happy guy and I get to go to the pub I

00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,090
like composability I like testability if

00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,730
you have a small component it's easy to

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:54,820
do unit tests on it because a component

00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,919
is a unit and I like shareability

00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,740
I like to be able to give these two

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:02,230
people on my team or put them on github

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,330
so other people in the world can take

00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,760
them because that's what we do we share

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:10,090
stuff of course you've all seen this

00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:15,940
this gift about out about the

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:18,280
complexities of CSS and maybe this isn't

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,680
so true anymore now we have flexbox and

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,800
CSS grids

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:27,760
you CSS grids Jing gets $10 every time

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:31,870
you use them from the w3c but it's true

00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,560
that CSS for components is a bit of a

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:37,180
pay

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:42,220
in the ass or ass depending upon what

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:44,639
you call your ass we can talk about that

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:47,740
later when we talk about toilet paper

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,120
the trouble with CSS four components is

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:55,870
everything's global you can't adequately

00:06:51,120 --> 00:07:00,130
scoop your rules to a component easily

00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:02,320
so Styles can leak or clash the order

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,880
affects the Cascade and when you're

00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,880
pulling in lots of different components

00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,970
that can easily become unmanageable and

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,889
give you surprises it's really hard to

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,370
make an adequate dependency system for

00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:18,639
CSS also it relies upon markup structure

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:22,060
yes your HTML doesn't no need to know

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,250
about your CSS but often your CSS really

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,290
needs to know about your HTML structure

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,930
because you're using selectors that

00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,970
might depend upon it and the problem of

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,990
course is if you break something it can

00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:37,330
break silently when I used to work as

00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:40,570
the front-end developer of a

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:43,180
governmental legal site in the UK before

00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:46,300
the days of all the modern cool stuff we

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:49,660
have now it will be midnight on Saturday

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,570
when I would copy over CSS changes by

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:55,960
FTP it to the live server and then it

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:58,900
was absolutely terrifying because some

00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,750
forgotten page in the hundred thousand

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:04,630
page CMS driven system would have

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:07,750
terrible font or the layout would break

00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,850
and well that's why I look so terrible

00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,610
that's why I look like this because of

00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:16,000
all the stress of CSS breaking silently

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:19,300
and me not being able to test for it so

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,680
we've invented something called Bing CSS

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:26,500
in JavaScript this is probably CSS rules

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,039
but in some kind of object notation like

00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,289
JSON rather than the squiggly brackets

00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:38,700
we all love this isn't you

00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:42,430
Netscape 3 had this thing called j SS

00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,820
JavaScript style sheets you could only

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:48,530
use this JavaScript way

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:52,200
to style things in Netscape three and

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:57,480
they proposed it for the w3c the w3c

00:08:52,200 --> 00:09:03,150
said whatever and like whatever whatever

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:08,130
whatever because it's three w's and so

00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:12,750
the Netscape people then wrote a J ssnoa

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:15,290
CSS 2j sss converter which is why a

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:18,960
netscape if you turn javascript off

00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:21,390
style was wouldn't apply with CSS but

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:24,680
anyway this thing j sss or as i like to

00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:29,970
call it G's didn't really take off

00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:35,100
terribly well so I've looked at some of

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:39,380
the the CSS in JavaScript solutions I

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:43,410
counted 59 competing solutions on

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:49,500
Michelle buteau Lee's list on github and

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:51,690
I have an opinion about CSS in j/s I've

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,150
looked at them and I can exclusively

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:57,510
reveal without risk of contradiction

00:09:54,150 --> 00:10:01,730
that CSS in j/s is a sick perverted

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:05,060
world a sadistic Candyland in the sky

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:07,770
write it down there will be a test later

00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,400
legal notice other opinions are

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,400
available

00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:19,730
CSS is great I love it it's great

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,310
because you get fantastic ID support

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:26,030
whether you're using visual studio that

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:30,260
other thing webstorm jetstorm whatever

00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:34,040
or sublime or Adam you getting loads of

00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:36,040
ideas support for your CSS we get syntax

00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,870
highlighting you get code completion

00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,720
validation their CSS generators and

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:46,100
there's a huge community who know and

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:49,430
share tips about CSS it's also designers

00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:52,130
anybody here a designer a few of you

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:56,090
well these are designers in the wild

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:59,150
drinking some flat skinny saw white

00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:02,030
cappuccino frothy thing eating some

00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:05,870
avocado toast lamenting they can't

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:09,920
afford a house and using Apple machines

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:12,140
and they're designing things and the

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,780
thing is of course these guys and girls

00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:17,150
are really great at designing stuff and

00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:19,370
because we all do responsive design now

00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:23,780
we don't design in Photoshop comps we

00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:27,290
design in the browser CSS is their tool

00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:30,800
and we are making these expensive and

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:34,940
highly creative people abandon their

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,760
tool of choice to fit our development

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:42,230
methodology which is naughty of us and

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:45,470
it's discourteous and it's just bad form

00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:48,020
if you disagree ask your designer to

00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:50,600
open up your computer and choose the

00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:53,480
fonts and colors that they want for your

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:56,000
operating system and IDE and then see if

00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,490
that makes you more or less productive

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,980
and happy I'm happy to do this for you

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:04,970
myself you've seen my design skills I'm

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:07,310
pretty good CSS in JavaScript also costs

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,620
us you have to load a j/s library to

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,960
handle CSS creation at runtime you're

00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,730
creating and modifying CSS at runtime

00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,370
and if you're doing server-side

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:19,610
rendering and if you're not why are you

00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:21,560
not doing it you're doing the CSS twice

00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:23,860
once on the server and then squirting it

00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:25,899
down the wire so I

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,570
been consulting now for seven or eight

00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:32,500
months with wicks who are a website

00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:34,750
builder and I'm advising them on web

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:39,459
standards because they wanted to solve

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:41,560
the CSS four components problem and I've

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:45,310
been helping them and giving them

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:48,790
fashion advice this is my colleague edo

00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:52,120
edo rosen tile and he was asleep in our

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:55,269
smoking room in our tel-aviv office you

00:12:52,120 --> 00:13:01,810
can see that the famous CSS blind is

00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:05,200
above him and he was dreaming about a

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:07,870
solution and in his dream he wanted CSS

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,180
that was modular and only scoped to a

00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:13,660
component but he wanted it also to be

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:16,779
dynamic he wanted it to be performant so

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:19,600
working at build time rather than run

00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:22,269
time he wanted it to have all the

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,760
capabilities that CSS also gives us

00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:27,670
because many CSS in JS libraries you

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,310
can't even do things like hover and he

00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:33,070
wanted compatibility with all the

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,980
existing tooling and he wanted to be

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:39,060
able to customize components from the

00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:41,890
outside too as well as have their

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:44,199
styling wrapped up with the components

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,060
well we came up with a single scalable

00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:48,910
which is CSS four components

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:52,240
it's a preprocessor like less or sass

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:54,579
for styling components with typed CSS

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,610
basically what we're trying to do is do

00:13:54,579 --> 00:14:00,070
for CSS what typescript does for

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:04,350
JavaScript so the first thing we wanted

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:07,660
to do was abstract stuff so that your

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:10,180
styling doesn't have to know about the

00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:13,180
internal architecture of the component

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:17,140
so if you had a component from another

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:18,940
team or another another company and they

00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,930
change something about the internal

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:24,550
markup structure your CSS won't break so

00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:28,930
what we decided to do was have custom

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:30,880
States like like hover or focus we

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:34,029
wanted to be able to say if you are a

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,050
nav button in my gallery and it's in the

00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:38,870
state of loading don't show it

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:41,269
it's a custom state like hover or focus

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:44,810
of course you can use those two but this

00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:49,550
gives you custom ones and we also use

00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:51,800
the pseudo element syntax here to

00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,740
address things that are inside a

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,620
component without having to know the

00:14:54,740 --> 00:15:01,130
structure anything that you give a class

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:03,829
name to is exposed as a pseudo element

00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,680
that you can hang styles from without

00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:09,579
having to know what the structure is or

00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:13,339
if the structure changes your CSS won't

00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:15,529
with type CSS you beget a superset we've

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:18,529
got inner parts of pseudo elements we

00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:21,940
have custom pseudo classes type aware

00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:25,519
dependencies IDE and build support and

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,950
we can optimize so we can do analysis at

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,890
Build time and do what we call rule set

00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,380
shaking which is like tree shaking but

00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:36,110
for rock sets

00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:39,890
this gives us all kinds of useful

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:43,070
developer tooling like IDs like code

00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:47,000
completion this is us using style in

00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:49,459
visual studio with style intelligence

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,190
plugin and you can see that once it's

00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:55,510
analyzed your structures it's offering

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:58,640
you all of the pseudo classes and the

00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:01,010
internal stylings that you might want to

00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:04,370
use which makes your life much more

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,690
productive this is how it works I don't

00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,130
want to go to more deeply into the

00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:09,740
syntax because I don't want to bore you

00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:12,980
or waste your time or fall over that

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:16,880
thing again but I want to show you that

00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:21,100
this syntax is entirely compatible with

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:25,610
CSS so we use this st4 styler ball

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:29,360
vendor prefix so that you don't get an

00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:31,910
error in your IDE at Build time all of

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,180
these vendor prefixes are compiled away

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:39,829
and it compiles down transpires down to

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:43,940
static valid cross browser vanilla CSS

00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:47,000
and of course you can mix stainable

00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,880
compiler directives with absolutely

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,949
normal

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:55,610
CSS because we're importing from a

00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:58,500
component we're giving it a default name

00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:02,759
extending it and we can use all of our

00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:04,709
CSS as usual we have a type system you

00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:09,660
can define the gallery internals this is

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:12,660
saying this component can have states of

00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:14,370
loading or empty to set them you have to

00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,100
do this in JavaScript depending upon

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:20,250
when you know you're loading or you're

00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:22,319
empty and you can do that by default you

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:26,010
do it with a data attribute but you can

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,299
customize that some more the status of

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:30,390
it at the moment is we have pseudo

00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:34,350
elements and classes imports mix ins

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:37,610
with JavaScript or typescript theming vs

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:41,990
code extension that I showed you for

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:45,210
code completion etc coming up

00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:48,270
integrations with more things and just

00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:50,130
react and web pack and at the moment

00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:52,440
we're working on pseudo classes with

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:55,559
parameters so you can say if this is a

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,809
column and its name is email make it

00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:01,320
golden rod because golden rod is the

00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:03,000
best color for matters we know this is

00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,630
in other languages and we want to be

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,850
compatible with those my guys committed

00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,590
this stuff to get up last week I'm not

00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:14,130
actually sure if it's released yet but

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:17,010
it's in the repo declaration interfaces

00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:19,320
so you can say for example you can style

00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,360
any of the colors or the fonts in this

00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,210
component but you cannot actually change

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,520
its layout so you won't break it if

00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:29,880
you're laying out with grid or flexbox

00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:32,370
for example more integrations and with

00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,220
dogfooding it and battle testing it the

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:38,850
reason we've written this is because Wix

00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:43,049
has had a problem with its websites that

00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:48,510
it hosts particularly on mobile because

00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:52,130
everything is done with CSS that is made

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:55,559
at runtime and sent down the wire to be

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:58,169
parsed in JavaScript it's very slow on

00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:00,450
mobile this is much more performant and

00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:03,240
within the next six months

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:08,100
you will see styler ball powering nearly

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:10,530
all of wix's 110 million websites that

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,140
it hosts at the moment another thing

00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,970
we're doing is getting rid of lots of

00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,760
JavaScript to layout we've done some

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:20,460
analysis and we've realized that nearly

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,560
all of the websites that currently have

00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,830
some JavaScript to lay them out can be

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:28,230
done with CSS grid so there will be

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:30,720
about a hundred million Wix websites

00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:34,230
using styler ball and CSS grid for

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,450
layout rather than runtime CSS in j/s

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:39,000
and rather than javascript it's going to

00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:42,390
be a lot faster and we're battle testing

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,730
it for that this is a robust system and

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,980
it's going to be compatible with web

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,500
components and we're also keeping a

00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:52,710
close eye on the Houdini spec which is

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,900
the ability to extend CSS with

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,690
JavaScript we've just committed that to

00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:01,590
the repo so you can have JavaScript

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:05,850
macros in your CSS that will compile at

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:09,210
Build time into static CSS it's BDSM

00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:12,570
license so you can get it right now and

00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:15,090
try it out get it while they're hot it's

00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:19,800
styler border IO and the repo is github

00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:23,160
coms week's styler ball I want to

00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:25,020
emphasize that I do not hate JavaScript

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,420
this is me having a beer with Brendan

00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,690
Eich who invented JavaScript and how

00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:33,060
come we Emily who invented CSS and you

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:36,780
can see that we're all smiling and none

00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:40,530
of us hit each other at any point until

00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:43,320
about the fourth or the fifth point and

00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:47,430
I'm not a Luddite I used to be anti

00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:51,030
frameworks when I was living in an ivory

00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:53,520
tower of of web standards and then I

00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:55,590
went into industry and saw how real

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,350
industry makes websites and it was

00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:01,200
eye-opening to me I'm not afraid of

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,990
frameworks in Bucharest somebody had

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:08,160
written react wrong but I was not scared

00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:09,930
I'm not scared of frameworks if you want

00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:12,750
to use reactant bengi allure bone

00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:15,870
strapped hub patch Jas

00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:19,600
use it knock yourself out do whatever

00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:22,630
makes your life faster and more

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,880
productive but remember that all of

00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:28,860
these things are just tools they might

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:36,159
be well known tools but they are just

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:39,220
tools and using your tools well is the

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,950
definition of an artisan or craftsman or

00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,600
craftswoman a worker in a skilled trade

00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,010
especially one that involves making

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,070
things by hand

00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:51,820
but I prefer this Japanese word any

00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:53,350
Japanese people in the house good then

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:56,380
you won't hit me for mispronouncing it

00:21:53,350 --> 00:22:00,039
shokunin means not only having technical

00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:02,740
skill but implies an attitude and social

00:22:00,039 --> 00:22:04,720
consciousness a social obligation to

00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,929
work is best for the general welfare of

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,600
the people an obligation both material

00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:12,490
and spiritual and I think that's what

00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,730
we've been in danger of losing sight of

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:19,720
as we fight our holy wars

00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:22,030
now I'm an HTML coholic okay this is uh

00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,850
it's actually a brand of clothing in

00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:26,679
Japan so they kind of looked very

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,090
weirdly at me at this department store

00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:36,580
when I lay down next to it but I first

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:38,710
encountered the web in 1999 so instead

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,169
of talking about my employers product

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:45,039
let's talk about me let's talk about me

00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:50,830
going me this is me a couple of years

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:54,820
ago okay this is me in 96 when I went to

00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:57,549
work in Bangkok Thailand setting up a

00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:00,400
school a primary school and a

00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:03,909
kindergarten which I set up and ran for

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,220
a few years and when I was there is some

00:23:03,909 --> 00:23:07,720
of my students it's really nice they

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,630
were married now and they invited me to

00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:13,020
their weddings blessum when I was in

00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,760
Thailand I got sick

00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:19,539
basically I lost the use of my left eye

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:22,030
and my left leg and my arm and I went to

00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:24,850
hospital because I had private medicine

00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:25,320
and they diagnosed me with something

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:27,470
called mole

00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,380
- boss chlorosis which is lots of these

00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:33,809
in the brain and that was really really

00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,909
lucky because in Southeast Asia

00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:39,330
multiple sclerosis is a really rare

00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:41,820
disease it gets more and more prevalent

00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:44,730
the further north or south you go from

00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:47,909
the equator so it's very big very

00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:50,070
popular in Scotland Norway etcetera but

00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:52,440
I was lucky because the lady who

00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,210
happened to be the duty neurologist had

00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:59,190
just done a year's work in an MS

00:23:54,210 --> 00:24:01,830
facility in the US and because it's so

00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:04,019
rare in Southeast Asia they couldn't

00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,769
give me any english-language information

00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:10,049
the only thing they could find was

00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:12,330
Xeroxes from a medical textbook full of

00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:15,690
encouraging photographs of autopsy

00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,740
brains which are about you but it didn't

00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,259
really make me feel better

00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:22,019
but when I got out of hospital and

00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:24,929
taught myself to walk again I went

00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:27,179
downstairs from my apartment in Pratt

00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:29,730
Nam in Bangkok and there was this thing

00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:31,559
called an internet cafe so I went to

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:34,379
this internet cafe and I typed in

00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:36,269
multiple sclerosis into Alta Vista which

00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:39,600
was like Google but powered by steam and

00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:43,470
black and white and it came back with

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,289
this julie's joint which is a global

00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:48,690
support network for people with MS it

00:24:46,289 --> 00:24:49,320
was founded in 95 by Julie hull up with

00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,600
Julie Howell

00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,580
when you're first diagnosed you may not

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,799
know anything about MS or anybody who

00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,620
has it it can be a scary and lonely time

00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,269
I created Julie's joint so that people

00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,549
were living with this disease can get to

00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:04,379
know others around the world to share

00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:06,990
experiences and give each other support

00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:09,419
and that was great

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:11,460
instead of autopsy brains I was talking

00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:13,889
to people who had the disease had lived

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,049
with it for a few years it made me feel

00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:18,690
better and taught me that I hadn't been

00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:21,269
just handed a death sentence there were

00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:24,509
people from the UK USA Australia Canada

00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:27,629
Germany Sweden Switzerland rest of the

00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:32,580
world etc but this blew my mind because

00:25:27,629 --> 00:25:34,500
what I had here was a collective of

00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,149
different people around the world with

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,200
different backgrounds different hopes

00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:41,440
different experiences different kind

00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:44,350
Computers this is 99 all coming together

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,770
to work together on something and it

00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:50,620
made me realize that the web was where I

00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:52,750
wanted to work so I went back to the UK

00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,440
and set up a publishing company for web

00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:59,230
professionals became a web developer

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:02,740
became deputy CTO of opera and now I'm

00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:04,030
consulting for weeks because this opened

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,310
my eyes about the web

00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:09,130
weirdly when I got back to the UK and

00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:11,560
set up a book publishing company the

00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,960
first book we commissioned was about web

00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:17,110
accessibility and one of the reviewers

00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,810
was a woman called Julie who was the

00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:22,090
woman who set up that ms support site

00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,950
that I found in Bangkok and we've become

00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:28,090
good friends who we are going to see the

00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:30,550
Sex Pistols here we are at a party for

00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:33,880
the 10th anniversary of that web site

00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:37,180
here's Julie with my daughter going to

00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,850
an art gallery and I met her and became

00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:42,760
friends with her through the web and it

00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:46,840
made me think what what is the web it's

00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:49,210
not loads of computers it's on loads of

00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:53,080
computers but that's not what it is it's

00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:55,960
certainly not clowns it's definitely not

00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:59,200
a series of tubes this is what the web

00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,700
is it sees African women it's this blind

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,640
guy in Toronto

00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,200
it's these ladies on a bus that I

00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:09,790
photographed when I was visiting

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,730
Bangladesh it's this lady in Korea that

00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:15,640
I photographed it is these two farmers

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:17,890
in Thailand that I photographed it's

00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:21,150
these guys that I found on a stock

00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:21,150
images image

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,330
it's this man with Down syndrome on the

00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,240
New York subway

00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:30,940
it is these ladies on the beach in South

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:37,630
India that I photographed a year ago the

00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:40,240
web is people and people are here there

00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:42,490
are more people living inside this

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,580
circle than the rest of the world

00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:48,910
outside this circle and that was fat

00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:56,429
checked by The Washington Post Asia is

00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:56,429
now four billion people I've counted um

00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:07,150
by 2050 or 20 know by 2050 the

00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:11,230
population of Asia will be 5 billion the

00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:14,500
United Nations predicts China 1.3

00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:16,960
billion people with a GDP growth of 7.7%

00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:20,500
I don't know what the GDP growth of

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:24,280
Singapore is but in the West and in the

00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:28,390
u.s. they would kill to have growth at

00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:32,290
this level on Black Friday and Cyber

00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:35,710
Monday in 2015 the last dates I have

00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:40,750
figures for 2.9 billion US dollars

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:45,669
changed hands in the US on double 11 day

00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:48,549
the 11th of November 2015 in China nine

00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:51,040
point two billion dollars changed hands

00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:54,190
total online retail spending in China

00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:58,330
reached 307 billion in 2013 and is

00:28:54,190 --> 00:29:01,600
forecast to grow at 20% until 2019 when

00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:05,260
XI it should exceed a trillion the

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:09,210
numbers of startups valued at a billion

00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,210
or over that's China

00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:19,150
Africa is 1 billion people now by 2050

00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:22,179
that will rise to 2 billion by 2100

00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:26,260
which may be a little late for me but

00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:28,870
maybe not for you by 2100 the population

00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:32,650
of the world will peak at 11 billion

00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:33,340
people five billion of them will live in

00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:37,000
after

00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:39,549
Africa has relatively good connections

00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,309
now this is a map of the submarine

00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:44,230
cables going into Africa you can see it

00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:45,280
starts pretty small and then it's

00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:47,830
getting bigger and they're getting

00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:51,250
faster and faster connectivity but of

00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:55,929
course submarine cables go under the sea

00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:59,620
and they end up at the shore and Africa

00:29:55,929 --> 00:30:02,830
is really really big so whereas people

00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:06,070
on the outside the shorelines of Africa

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:09,970
have good connectivity people inside

00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:11,679
don't and maps lie to us or release maps

00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:15,070
that are done in the Mercator projection

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:17,980
Africa is really really really big you

00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:21,730
can fit China the UK India the US

00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:26,020
Eastern Europe in the landmass of Africa

00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:28,690
so if you live here away from the coasts

00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,760
internet access is slow and really

00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,970
expensive landlocked countries play

00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:37,840
higher prices for bandwidth in Africa

00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:42,390
for instance being landlocked adds 232

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:45,790
US dollars monthly for fixed broadband

00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:50,400
imagine I mean in a rich economy like

00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:53,530
Singapore or the US or the UK my paying

00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,350
230 dollars a month more for my

00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:59,620
broadband would be a real bummer

00:30:56,350 --> 00:31:03,040
imagine how prohibitive that is in

00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:05,590
low-income countries like sub-saharan

00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:09,400
Africa and as a safer mobile broadband

00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:11,799
the difference is a hundredfold for

00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:14,950
landlocked countries in Pakistan it's a

00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:18,070
dollar 48 for a gigabyte of data a month

00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:20,919
in South OMA and Princip it's a hundred

00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:24,490
and seventy US dollars but the paradox

00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:27,400
is people become richer when their

00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:29,260
broadband becomes faster the employment

00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,320
rate in connected areas relevant to

00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:35,919
unconnected areas increased by 4.2 and

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:39,730
between 4.2 and 10% when fast internet

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:42,040
became available in most countries in

00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,570
our sample the increase of skilled

00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,320
employment was bigger for workers with

00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:48,210
secondary or tertiary education but

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,910
who only completed primary school are

00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:53,760
also more likely to hold down a job once

00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:56,850
fast Internet becomes available but it's

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,500
not just about affordability despite the

00:31:56,850 --> 00:32:00,990
fact that Africa has the lowest income

00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,870
per capita of any region affordability

00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:06,570
was only identified as the most

00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:10,170
important barrier in one of the 13

00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:12,060
countries at the GSMA surveyed network

00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:15,000
coverage is not perceived as an issue

00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:18,090
for most countries however mobile

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,450
broadband 3G or 4G still remains low in

00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:23,760
Africa the biggest problem was a lack of

00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:28,740
awareness or locally relevant content

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:31,020
and its lack of digital skills it's the

00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,730
same in Asia a lack of awareness and

00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:34,680
locally relevant content was the most

00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:39,090
commonly cited barrier to Internet

00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:41,070
adoption 50% of websites in the world

00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,140
are in English but that's only spoken by

00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:46,140
10% of the speakers in those countries

00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:51,060
only 2% of the websites worldwide are in

00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:53,280
Mandarin and 0.1% are in Hindi in Africa

00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,440
7 of 10 people who do not use the web

00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,810
say they don't know how to use it and 4

00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,930
in 10 do not know what the internet is

00:32:57,810 --> 00:33:02,790
and that's not just in emerging

00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:05,370
economies in high-income Poland and

00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:09,570
Slovakia one-fifth of adults cannot use

00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:10,830
a computer in the States 41% of seniors

00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,710
do not use the Internet

00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:17,850
53% don't have broadband natural access

00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:20,580
and 23% don't have cell phones this is

00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:23,400
my friend Paul Arnett and he tweeted

00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:27,360
this on Christmas Day he's doing tech

00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:29,790
support we heard about that earlier me

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:33,000
on tech support what buttons are on your

00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:36,990
screen my mom a hot water bottle and a

00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:41,550
dentist's chair it's funny right but you

00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:45,330
can see her thinking here the things

00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:48,660
that we take for granted as obvious are

00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:52,170
not a friend of mine called Sophia

00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:57,660
Parvez does route just usability testing

00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:59,070
in rural areas in Pakistan and she's

00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,879
given me permission to show you this

00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,389
video

00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:07,619
I've edited it down but it's still

00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:08,909
bloody painful this is a guy in his 20s

00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:12,059
in Pakistan

00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:14,940
he's a feature phone user he's been

00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:19,109
given a smartphone and he's been asked

00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:21,740
to google the name of his favorite

00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:21,740
actress

00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:36,710
two minutes 53 seconds

00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:55,200
and he gives up at 3 minutes and 15

00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:57,600
seconds of course the problem he had was

00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,420
that his feature phone and Nokia have

00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:04,080
physical keys he simply doesn't know how

00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,820
to call up the virtual keyboard I show

00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,070
you that because the next time you make

00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,880
something that you think is incredibly

00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:14,490
intuitive think of this guy he's not

00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,320
maybe yet he just doesn't know how to do

00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,720
it and of course not everybody has

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,540
trouble with smart phones this this

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,610
Cambodian boy whom I met on a beach when

00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:26,400
I was on vacation in Cambodia

00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:29,750
I don't speak any climber but he was

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,550
very interested in my Google Nexus 5x

00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,680
within one minute of me miming

00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:37,260
instructions he'd managed to take this

00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,210
selfie of himself a photograph which

00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,820
never fails to cheer me up when I'm

00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,860
feeling a bit melancholy there's a

00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,580
digital divide not just between the

00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,870
wealthy nations and emerging economies

00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:52,350
there's a digital divide in Africa

00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:56,820
between poor and rich old or young ruler

00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:59,250
urban and men and women and as a digital

00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:02,750
divide in India when I landed in India

00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:05,100
last year to do some press and TV work

00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:08,490
the in The Times of India they announced

00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:13,110
that rural mobile Internet users grew by

00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:16,470
93 percent year on year but that 93

00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:20,310
percent growth means that a staggering

00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:24,000
nine percent of people in rural India

00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:27,060
have any internet access at all that is

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,610
compared with 53 percent in urban areas

00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:32,820
the World Bank in a report they

00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:34,890
published early last year called Digital

00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:38,400
dividends it's actually really

00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:41,370
interesting and it's 370 pages I know

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,830
what has happened to my life the World

00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:46,200
Bank have said making the internet

00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:49,470
universally accessible and affordable

00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:52,670
should be a global priority the web

00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:56,100
foundation which was founded by Timbo or

00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:58,770
certain berners-lee to you the web

00:36:56,100 --> 00:37:02,250
foundation said in a

00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:04,110
shocking blog post in Nigeria the data

00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,990
needed to watch a two minutes of online

00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:10,800
video a day can cost more than sending

00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:13,610
your child to school for a month in the

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,710
words of the car parking machine in

00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:23,480
Chinatown in my home city of Birmingham

00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:26,370
change is possible and change is coming

00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:30,120
there is a grassroot initiative called

00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:33,110
fast Africa and they had lots of

00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:37,500
activities across lots of African cities

00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:40,620
in 2016 fast Africa they are agitating

00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,540
for fair and transparent ICT taxes they

00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:45,510
want governments and donors to step up

00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:47,760
efforts agree on affordability and

00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:52,200
affordability is defined as one gigabyte

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:55,440
of mobile data for two percent of

00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:58,230
average income and I was actually very

00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,720
pleased that yesterday the broadband

00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:03,450
Commission of the UN has actually

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,090
adopted this as their target for

00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:08,730
affordability fast Africa also wants in

00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:11,700
public access solutions things like

00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:13,260
computers in schools or community

00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,110
colleges which are open to the public

00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,930
after hours and making getting women

00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:21,090
online a top priority the World Bank

00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,940
online work can prove particularly

00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,290
beneficial for women youth older workers

00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,120
and the disabled who prefer the

00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:30,060
flexibility of working from home or

00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,670
working flexible hours in India women

00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:36,000
are 62 percent less likely to use the

00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:38,010
internet in the men in rural India two

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,950
percent of women use the internet or

00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:42,840
actually no two percent of the nine

00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:45,990
percent of people are internet access

00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:49,530
are female the other 98 percent are male

00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:53,040
but the paradox of this is we know that

00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:55,500
the web empowers women globally in

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,810
non-agricultural employment women are

00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:01,770
twenty five percent of the workforce but

00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:05,210
in online working portals 44 percent of

00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:09,570
the workforce are women when asked why

00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:11,920
women said the ability to earn extra

00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:13,750
money was not as important

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,180
the ability to work from home and work

00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:19,450
flexible hours because worldwide of

00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:22,510
course women bear the brunt of the

00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:25,230
requirement to do child-rearing looking

00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:29,620
after sick or elderly relatives

00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:32,500
interestingly and sadly the biggest

00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,870
disadvantage for women was payment is

00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,120
not good enough which was much less of a

00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:38,770
disadvantage for men suggesting that

00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:42,940
just like everywhere else in the world

00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:46,870
there is a disastrously unfair pay gap

00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,470
between what women and men earn it's not

00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:52,050
all bad news

00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:54,700
I was recently in Kerala in South India

00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:57,250
they speak a language called Malayalam

00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,110
there it's the only language name in the

00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:01,480
world which is a palindrome and spelt

00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:04,030
the same backwards interestingly and in

00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:07,390
Malayalam this says khuddam battery and

00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:09,880
khuddam Bashi translates as prosperity

00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:13,900
for the family it's an initiative by the

00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:16,480
caralyn government interestingly Kerala

00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:18,790
has the highest female literacy the

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,880
highest literacy the highest life

00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:26,790
expectancy the lowest infant mortality

00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:28,870
in India and it's consistently run by a

00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:32,080
democratically elected marxist

00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:34,540
government which is interesting but they

00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:37,120
set up the could and battery project to

00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:39,670
outsource IT services to cooperatives of

00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,620
women from poor backgrounds 90% of those

00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:44,290
women had not worked outside the home

00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:46,930
before okay so I've given you all these

00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:49,840
facts and figures which are pretty

00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:51,280
pretty demoralizing I didn't swear do

00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:57,070
not get me for the code of conduct I

00:40:51,280 --> 00:41:00,070
said oath feet I just tripped over what

00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:02,620
can you do you can make a progressive

00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:04,810
web app I'm not going to go into what

00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:08,800
they are particularly now because I'm

00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:11,140
running over time doubtless you know it

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,600
is no coincidence that the best and

00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:17,250
earliest progressive web apps have come

00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:23,500
out of Asia and Africa Indonesia

00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:25,519
Indonesia Kenya Nigeria India because

00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,579
downloading a typical app on

00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:30,919
an Indian network of 20 megabytes will

00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:34,309
take more than 30 minutes and more often

00:41:30,919 --> 00:41:36,679
than not just craps out and cheaper

00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:39,890
Android devices are pretty low in

00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:42,380
storage at Google i/o last year it was

00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:45,880
announced that 25% of new Android

00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:50,390
shipments only have 512 Meg of RAM and

00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:53,390
very low storage space so if you have a

00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:56,029
massive downloadable app even if the

00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:57,890
user can actually download it it is

00:41:56,029 --> 00:41:59,479
taking up space on their phone with

00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,159
space that's limited the user is

00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:05,239
comparing their personal photo

00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:07,249
collection with getting your app we

00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:08,989
didn't stand a chance said birdly in

00:42:07,249 --> 00:42:10,849
there below with their blog post why you

00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:12,919
shouldn't bother creating a mobile app

00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:15,199
we didn't send a chance we're fighting

00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:17,689
with both our competitors and other apps

00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:20,689
for a few more megabytes of room inside

00:42:17,689 --> 00:42:22,549
people's phones and our Geryon developer

00:42:20,689 --> 00:42:24,649
that I interviewed a year ago said

00:42:22,549 --> 00:42:27,140
Nigerians are extremely data sensitive

00:42:24,649 --> 00:42:29,809
they sideload apps and other content

00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:33,409
from third parties and they never update

00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:35,689
them with PWS without the download

00:42:33,409 --> 00:42:37,459
overhead of native apps developers in

00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:41,679
Nigeria can now give a great and

00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:44,479
up-to-date experience for their users

00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:47,899
what else can you do you can simply

00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:50,149
optimize your images in 2011 I had a

00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:51,769
slight hangover it's a very unusual

00:42:50,149 --> 00:42:55,429
thing for me but it was one of those

00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:58,399
times and I'd read a blog post by Jake

00:42:55,429 --> 00:43:01,729
and lots of developers had said it's

00:42:58,399 --> 00:43:04,519
really difficult doing images because if

00:43:01,729 --> 00:43:08,269
you send a really nice shiny image to

00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:11,749
these new Retina devices on a three inch

00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:13,789
square black and white Nokia screen it

00:43:11,749 --> 00:43:16,459
has to be compressed down which takes

00:43:13,789 --> 00:43:18,469
CPU cycles and uses the battery and

00:43:16,459 --> 00:43:20,659
people are downloading far more data

00:43:18,469 --> 00:43:25,459
than they actually need whereas if you

00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:28,249
give a low resolution images otar if you

00:43:25,459 --> 00:43:32,899
give a low resolution image it doesn't

00:43:28,249 --> 00:43:34,369
show very well on the retina things now

00:43:32,899 --> 00:43:37,569
you told me I can go on for as long as I

00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:37,569
want there's only another 40 minutes

00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:51,670
and you're fueling me now the average

00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:55,450
webpage not websites not web app is for

00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:57,880
Meg of which 1.8 Meg is images if you

00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:00,760
can make your image is smaller with

00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,980
responsive images you are using less

00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:04,720
bandwidth I did a talk on responsive

00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:07,240
images because I was one of the team of

00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,550
handsome men who made the picture

00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:12,940
element etc that's in all the browsers

00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:14,920
now and a developer saw my talk and he

00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:17,110
put into practice of things I've talked

00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:20,830
about and then told in the next day his

00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:23,790
website his web page had gone down in

00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:27,910
size by 70% because that matters in

00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:32,380
Germany in Germany to afford entry-level

00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:35,320
mobile broadband for a month you need to

00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:37,240
work one hour at average wage in the

00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,880
States you need to work six hours at

00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:42,670
average wage in Brazil you need to work

00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:45,610
34 hours at average wage and if you are

00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:48,070
sending down vast bloated images you are

00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:52,440
making Brazilian people work harder and

00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:57,000
that's rude liberal hand-wringing ahead

00:44:52,440 --> 00:45:01,480
please guard the web as you work on it

00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:03,220
it's a medium that has given you a great

00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,170
sound of a living it allows you to come

00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,240
to a nice aircon room and listen to

00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:11,260
interesting people and listen to me as

00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:13,800
well and it gives you a nice

00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:16,420
middle-class life it's been good to you

00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:19,660
make it good for other people preserve

00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:21,130
it for example someone or something or

00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,290
combination of people of things are

00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:25,090
using YouTube to frighten traumatized

00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:27,400
and abused children automatically and

00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:29,350
scale and it forces me to question my

00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,900
own beliefs about the Internet at every

00:45:29,350 --> 00:45:34,060
level this is available on Amazon this

00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:37,270
is an iPhone cover of a woman having a

00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:40,660
armpits waxed of course this doesn't

00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:42,910
actually exist a bot has posted this and

00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:45,040
if you were foolish enough to buy it

00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:47,650
then they would make it on demand and

00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,550
send it to you you can also get this

00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:55,370
rather nice iPhone case

00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:58,820
of toenail fungus if you want to or more

00:45:55,370 --> 00:46:05,660
regrettably and much less funnily you

00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:08,240
can get this t-shirt made by a bot even

00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:11,650
worse I was reading a really really

00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:18,620
in-depth report about how fake news in

00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:21,710
Myanmar has contributed to the ethnic

00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:25,610
cleansing / genocide of the reinjure

00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:28,250
Muslims access to the web is critical

00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:29,840
but not sufficient so the World Bank the

00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:31,640
full benefits of the information and

00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,680
communication transformation will not be

00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,840
realized until countries continue to

00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:37,880
improve their business climate investing

00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:40,730
people's education health and good

00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:43,070
governance but we need to do this the

00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:46,520
developing countries are home to ninety

00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:49,040
four percent of the global offline

00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:52,250
population and those people deserve the

00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:56,300
benefits that we have realized from the

00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:59,120
web if my hippie doesn't

00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:01,100
convince you here's some numbers from a

00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,620
big management consultancy group called

00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:05,630
McKinsey an increase in internet

00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,400
maturity similar to the one experienced

00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:10,070
in mature countries over the last five

00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:13,790
years creates an increase in real gross

00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:16,490
domestic product per capita of 500 US

00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:19,310
dollars on average during this period in

00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:23,240
five years it took the Industrial

00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:26,450
Revolution of a 19th century 50 years to

00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:29,720
produce the same result you in this room

00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:32,420

00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:46,520
people do it properly please remember

00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:50,630
there are tens of millions of people in

00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:53,000
Bangladesh Nepal Pakistan who cannot

00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:56,260
afford a school textbook but a feature

00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:59,570

we'll have to walk miles for it but

00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:11,990
feature phone access and the web and a

00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:15,500
copy of where there is no doctor in

wrong religion the wrong political

00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:28,849

believing they've been handed a death

00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:39,109
sentence and the web makes that better
