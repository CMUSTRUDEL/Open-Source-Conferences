The workshop will cover different techniques on adapting websites to the upcoming HTTP/2 protocol. By the end of the workshop, participants would be well equipped with the tools and skills required to update and deploy a production-ready HTTP/2 website. We will be discussing the problems of HTTP/1.1 and how HTTP/2 helps obviate hacks such as bundling, domain sharding, etc. that were required in the HTTP/1.1 world. We will then discuss new architectures and paradigms enabled by features like HTTP/2 PUSH and the caveats to keep in mind when deploying such features to your users. Participants will learn to analyse, measure and optimise common performance problems when deploying such applications by working through the exercises in the workshop. They will also learn how to adapt their front-end tooling to be HTTP/2 ready. Finally, we will be talking about some of the new standards and protocols that are coming up after HTTP/2 and how to remain ahead of the curve. 

Requirements: Bring your own laptop and chargers
