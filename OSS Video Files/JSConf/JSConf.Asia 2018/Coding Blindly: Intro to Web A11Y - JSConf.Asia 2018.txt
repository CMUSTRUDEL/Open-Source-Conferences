Giang Nguyen, Grab
Dickson Tan

As developers, we take great pride and responsibility in ensuring a safe and seamless experience for visitors. However, this isn't very much the case for 39 Million blind and visually-impaired people. While America & the EU pledge efforts to make all governmental service websites accessible, there are no systems in place in the APAC region. 
Join us to find out what it takes to make a web experience truly seamless for those living with blindness and visual impairment, complete with challenge tasks and some prize swag. 

Requirements: Participants should come prepared with an Apple Laptop (Macbook, Macbook Air) running El Capitan 10.11 minimally, a laptop charger & a pair of headphones/earphones, a mouse if your trackpad is not working and Firefox browser installed.

Giang earned himself a computer science scholarship in Vietnam, interned at Intel and Captcha before joining Grab as the companies first fully blind coder. Today he manages accessibility at Grab and co-leads (these)abilities’ Web & Mobile Accessibility Initiative. 

A true lifehacker at heart, Dickson is pursuing a degree in Computer Science in the NUS School of Computing and represents Singapore at accessibility conferences. He interned at Singtel IT and GovTech and is also the co-lead for (these)abilities’ Web & Mobile Accessibility Initiative.

okay so mmm hi everyone sorry to keep

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,500
you waiting

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:11,190
I think just nice some other guys just

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,469
just streamed in as well thanks so much

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,320
for coming for talk this talk really is

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,900
going to guide you to you know a little

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,630
bit about web accessibility what it is

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,660
how you can get started you need zero

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:32,189
experience coming in here to learn about

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:35,070
it so just to introduce the team a

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:36,690
little bit they're the five of us that

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,600
started this web and mobile

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,969
accessibility initiative in Singapore

00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,860
because we identified that web and

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,750
mobile accessibility was very lacking

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,239
not just in Singapore but I think in the

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,440
region and we needed to do something

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:56,820
about it so the fire of us put put

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,280
together to essentially learn more about

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,399
web accessibility from young and Dixon

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,739
the first two on the left so they are

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,650
both people have visual impairments so

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,490
as users but they also developers so

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,409
they've been you know interfacing with

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:20,090
web and mobile accessibility the entire

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:23,700
lives so they teach us a lot about it so

00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,930
I think over the past four to five

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,229
months we've actually come up with some

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,240
sort of a curriculum as to which we can

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,490
invite more deaths to kind of learn

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,979
about web accessibility you know be on a

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,600
fortnightly basis or whatsoever

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,329
you know looking at the different steps

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,009
on how as a collective those that wanna

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,299
join us can go out to the different

00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:47,509
regional companies with their websites

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,149
and mobile apps to make them accessible

00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:53,460
so the agenda for today's workshop

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,100
released in three parts the first part

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,740
is just me nagging a little bit so this

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,110
the power you can doze off and then

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,079
section 2 will be the users perspective

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:08,220
how a person is a visual impairment kind

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,289
of interfaces with a website and then we

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,690
also do a screen reader walk through web

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,010
step by step we will go to a website

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,659
together we've asked you

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:20,370
and then we'll we will also give you a

00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:22,680
challenge later where you have to blank

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,510
out your screen so you can't see your

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,420
screen at all and then interface as

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,700
though you were someone who's blind to

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,849
fight we see some information on our

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,489
website so then section three will talk

00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:37,680
about developers perspective what do you

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,659
actually need to do if you're if you're

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,250
a practicing web accessibility in order

00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:47,370
to reach a high standard of web

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,810
accessibility law so essentially the

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,180
focus for us for this session

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,340
I think it's focused more towards web

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,069
accessibility and less towards mobile

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,290
accessibility I think because of the

00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:01,950
nature of the conference but also for us

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:04,650
a lot of the information that is you

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,689
know on the internet is still on

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,629
websites and a lot of the information

00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:12,049
that is necessary for daily living think

00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:14,879
of banking think of transportation

00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:17,849
travel if they are not accessible then

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,650
people vision impairment cannot access

00:03:17,849 --> 00:03:22,169
those services in an issue everything is

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:29,930
you know being digitized and going oh -

00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:31,980
oh yeah so the first part what really is

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,599
a 1:1 why

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,699
so we use this term quite a lot a 1:1

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:41,819
why and why is it important so

00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:45,870
essentially a11y is a numeral name for

00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:47,549
accessibility so the reason why they

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,500
came up with such a term was because

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,090
blind people used to it as well they

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,849
want to feel everything 140 characters

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:58,280
so that's why they they came up with

00:03:53,849 --> 00:04:02,510
this little shortcut as well right and

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:05,909
why is the important is because I think

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:08,159
traditionally about 70% of the

00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:11,340
information that we process as humans is

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,260
true site right if if you kind of

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,720
reflect on the last 30 different

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,949
websites they've you've interfaced you

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,090
could have done it without any sound

00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:20,519
right

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:25,330
we're just visuals you're able to

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:28,760
interface to the website really well but

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:32,510
what happens if you know you can hear it

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:34,100
but you can't see think of maybe the top

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:36,350
three websites that you visit on a daily

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,510
basis how you interface with them what

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,930
kind of structures do they have that's

00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:45,980
what I think people vision primal face

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:47,810
and this is not so much a a point to me

00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,070
you feel like a bit sad that you know

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,270
they don't have access or whatsoever but

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:54,050
to show you that there's actually a

00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:56,990
different way a more a refreshing tick

00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,580
on how you can kind of you know assess

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,590
the structure of your website or

00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,020
different websites that might even

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:07,540
improve the way you look at things in

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:09,850
the products that you build up okay so

00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:12,620
just a little bit of a background here

00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:14,420
on how people with vision impairment or

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,000
those who are blind use computers there

00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:20,000
are two main ways the one on the right

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,610
is I can't really capture the audio but

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,300
he's using a screen reader so what a

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:28,250
screen reader is is everything that is

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,070
displayed on your screen you can

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:35,720
actually hear it out so it's that's how

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:37,669
is it's a it works right and you know

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,050
now I think we're also transitioning

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:44,410
into a phase way because we have a lot

00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:47,690
to do with voice UI so we definitely can

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,730
interface with you know the Internet in

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,350
many different ways but on the Left we

00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,370
still have what we call a refreshable

00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:55,130
Braille display

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,050
so they take line by line of text that

00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:01,100
you get on websites or what documents or

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:03,500
whatsoever and it processes it to you

00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,980
know display little dots that are

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,690
Braille and the reason why they would

00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,730
still use Braille in this day and age

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,669
and not just everything show audio is

00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,740
because they want to look towards having

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:18,410
good grammar and punctuation something

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,960
that you know audio just can't do at a

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:24,890
moment so that's the currently the two

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:28,820
is that people have visual impairment

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:30,770
interferes what I like to say about Brio

00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,450
is it's like how my mom forced me to

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,870
learn Chinese even though I don't want

00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:38,090
to so parents who are blind or have

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,900
blankets or so the one that kids to

00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,220
learn Braille you

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,210
cause it helps them with their education

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:47,360
on the aspect as well yeah so the next

00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:50,630
question is who does accessibility right

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,720
in one run why so I think on a global

00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:57,259
scale if we look towards the west they

00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,199
have been a lot of developments in you

00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:04,300
know the past decades one example give

00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:08,180
us in the EU this was fairly recent

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,699
early last year the EU had a legislative

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:13,100
legislative mandate to say okay all the

00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:18,470
websites of governmental services need

00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:22,190
to be web accessible and after that

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:24,110
essentially they said since I was a

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,180
great success let's make all the mobile

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,710
apps of governmental services web

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:33,560
accessible sorry mobile accessible right

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:35,720
so the EU is working towards that in the

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,479
US it's also a very interesting case

00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,800
whereby for the past 27 years they have

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,240
this thing called American Disability

00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:47,590
Act and what happens is if you are a

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,680
person with a disability and a

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:53,449
particular company you know it's not

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,970
accessible to you you can actually plan

00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:58,400
up a lawyer to sue the company and they

00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:01,430
can't come to sue they have to comply so

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,680
this one example about three three

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,710
months ago is it what's the date day I

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,050
can see October yeah

00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,060
so people with visual impairment

00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,669
actually used to match calm because they

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,349
say that we want to find love as well so

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:19,430
we value your service and we want it to

00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:21,770
be made accessible right so this is the

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,110
story also of how when we've spoken to

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,970
you know places like a B&B and the rest

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,780
they start their accessibility journey

00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:28,780
because they get sued

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:38,380
so they actually also is a global

00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:40,570
community of web accessibility experts

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,830
mainly other accessibility engineers

00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:45,250
from all the large tech companies you

00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:48,310
can think of all there and when I joined

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:50,470
this I think one of the the things that

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:53,080
really stood up for me was I shall

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,360
define other people in Southeast Asia

00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,130
they were on this chat and I couldn't

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,550
find anyone right

00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:02,800
I saw a private slide shadow a11y - sta

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:06,089
and I thought you were Southeast Asia by

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:14,830
it was Seattle right so there really was

00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:16,420
no one for watchin so I mean John back

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:20,350
to this point first so to talk about

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:22,750
ASEAN I think the examples I gave you of

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,850
the EU and in the u.s. those were

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,070
essentially legislative mandates the

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:28,270
government has enforced it down and I

00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,339
don't think we expect to see that

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:32,589
happening in Southeast Asia in the next

00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:34,690
10 years because we are very

00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:36,760
pro-business maybe in places like I

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,079
think Korea and Japan are starting to at

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,850
the moment to have a little bit more

00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:45,100
legislative mandates so the the

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,800
responsibility lies with the community

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,529
to ensure that there is web

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,980
accessibility so then I think that's

00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:55,089
this there's a stronger community aspect

00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:00,520
of this if we want to do this together

00:09:55,089 --> 00:10:03,880
for the ASEAN region so the question is

00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:06,550
you know you guys probably work in

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:10,930
different companies of different you

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:13,089
know products rd you know web web

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:15,040
accessible and what does it take to

00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:19,480
actually make your web accessible right

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,910
so a very very short answer will dive

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,709
deeper later is that it's not very much

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,420
different from your daily grind it does

00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:33,700
not take a lot of extra effort for you

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:34,899
to to be web accessible sorry so one of

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,620
the main things is just you know you

00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:41,350
need proper labeling indexing of all the

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,600
different web elements that you have on

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,259
your product and you know to constantly

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,479
review

00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:48,220
if a screen reader that's what we call a

00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,799
manual scanning now that's also

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,669
automated scanner also to check for

00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,799
accessibility

00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:55,899
so that's on a user needs basis and then

00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:57,879
there's actually a global standard for

00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:01,059
web accessibility as well they will look

00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:10,419
to us for compliance so normally we try

00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:13,089
meet both of those so you know one of

00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:15,519
the the first steps in which we would

00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:17,919
try and help a company to become web

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,989
accessible which we are currently doing

00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,239
so we go to two different companies and

00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:24,129
every audit there are their websites and

00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:26,410
say hey you're not accessible do you

00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:27,819
want do something about it mmm so it's

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,769
very fun for us it's like you know

00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:31,479
companies that we interface with daily

00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:34,839
knowing that we can do something about

00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:38,499
it so we were audit by using a screen

00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:39,789
reader and I think it's really fun when

00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:41,489
use of screen reader because it's all

00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:43,499
about being a keyboard shortcut Pro

00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:45,399
because you can't use a mouse because

00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:48,459
people a vision impairment cannot see

00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,350
the cursor right so everything is you

00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:52,029
see later when when takes and demos it's

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,429
it's super fast you know the way he goes

00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:55,899
through it and I think it's refreshing

00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:57,629
that you get to view the structure of

00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,889
your website with a different sense

00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:01,899
canet bring about the new form of

00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:03,220
innovation in a way you see things

00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:07,539
that there might be interesting to

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:09,999
explore mmm so yeah so I think I'm

00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:11,949
reaching the last few parts for my my

00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:15,399
aspect but I wanted to share a little

00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:18,100
bit about you know these abilities are

00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:19,499
shy and a11y initiative so these

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,639
abilities is a company that I started

00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:24,899
it's a social impact startup that

00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,879
marries disability designing technology

00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:30,009
and we essentially a social enterprise

00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:32,139
and and you know with this initiative

00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:34,600
what we're doing is we're saying can we

00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:36,480
get more developers who are keen to

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,839
learn about web and mobile accessibility

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,479
to learn from young and Nixon about

00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:46,419
those aspects and then together as a

00:12:43,479 --> 00:12:48,009
group we'll go out and either you don't

00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:49,239
make your company's products more

00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:50,859
accessible first take it back to your

00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:53,350
own companies and at the same time

00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:55,659
together we would you know venture out

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,939
and help other companies as well so

00:12:55,659 --> 00:13:00,519
that's really what we

00:12:57,939 --> 00:13:01,659
I'll be doing and essentially like like

00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,189
I mentioned because action is

00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:04,539
pro-business we can't expect the

00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:07,539
government to come up with anything like

00:13:04,539 --> 00:13:09,220
that to ensure access to the Internet

00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:12,549
which is considered basic human right in

00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:15,489
some cases if it's not web accessible

00:13:12,549 --> 00:13:18,249
then people visual impairment don't have

00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:19,659
access to the Internet so we would have

00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:27,699
to be the enforcers of this new web

00:13:19,659 --> 00:13:30,999
standard action yeah so the stages of

00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:33,999
web accessibility at the moment really

00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:36,069
briefly is you know to do an audience

00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:38,769
and then we fix the box and then the

00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:40,059
last step is to have make sure that we

00:13:38,769 --> 00:13:41,679
comply with the global standards

00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:43,889
sometimes the global standards there are

00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,869
a lot of things that we can do it out

00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:50,019
but it just gives you that the stamp of

00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:51,519
approval I guess and it really covers

00:13:50,019 --> 00:13:53,949
not just people with vision impairment

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,479
but a wider range you find it very

00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:57,279
interesting how people who are deaf or

00:13:55,479 --> 00:14:00,009
hard of hearing or people who are

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,049
severely paralyzed interface of the

00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:04,229
internet and this guidelines cover that

00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,229
as well

00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:09,429
so how can you start like I mentioned

00:14:07,869 --> 00:14:11,319
you can take this back to your own

00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:14,139
company to practice whatever simple

00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:16,029
things you learn I think at the very

00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:17,709
most by the end of this workshop you

00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:20,559
would have learned how to use screen

00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:22,059
readers quite a bit so try and use

00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,249
screen readers on the products that that

00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:26,649
you felt built so far and and see how

00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:30,339
accessible this and then at the same

00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:33,009
time if you choose to join us on for

00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:35,349
meetups for for the Asha and a 1-1 Y

00:14:33,009 --> 00:14:37,089
initiative then we will go to other

00:14:35,349 --> 00:14:43,029
companies with better web and mobile

00:14:37,089 --> 00:14:44,409
accessibility and help them out so the

00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:48,279
next step is I think we're gonna have

00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:50,589
Dickson to demo a little bit how he

00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,409
actually uses the screen reader to

00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:57,359
interface with websites and from a user

00:14:53,409 --> 00:15:00,699
standpoint and inkyung I think he also

00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:04,059
demo a little bit on how he uses a text

00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:05,649
editor or while using Eclipse so he will

00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:08,319
use Eclipse IDE to essentially show you

00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:10,239
how use a screen reader to do that

00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:11,410
I didn't reduce them well enough but

00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:13,480
Young is grabs for

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:14,709
blank order Dixon is any rescue of

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,690
Computing's first visually impaired

00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:18,550
student so they've definitely had to

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,029
jump through a lot of Hoops in terms of

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:24,160
how their colleagues or schoolmates

00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:26,050
collaborate so that they can you know be

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,470
at the same level so that's definitely

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:30,939
very interesting the the last two points

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,189
I want to mention is because we're in a

00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:35,050
very very small group so let's keep it

00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:37,110
very informal if you can't follow

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:39,699
something or you have a burning question

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,439
just raise your hand voice it out and

00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:43,240
then we will address it because I think

00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:46,750
there's something that potentially would

00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:49,329
be very new to everyone let me just have

00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:53,350
a show of hands who is looking at web

00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:59,170
accessibility for the first time okay

00:15:53,350 --> 00:16:00,490
most I said one two okay so therefore I

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:03,459
think any questions that you have

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:08,920
someone else might have as well so don't

00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:12,279
feel shy to just voice up in the the

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,170
next time so I think we want to have a

00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,699
to check so you should have a your

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:19,000
headphones with you I think we'll use

00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:21,160
the Safari browser and there will be an

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,050
info sheet with a bit of keyboard

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:27,670
shortcuts as well do you have that on

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:29,620
your to the ready okay so this is

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,779
distance Twitter account he will post

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:36,730
your pin a post with the download link

00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:38,769
to this info sheet and yeah okay so just

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:46,149
give us a minute for the extent to kind

00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:49,319
of post this on Twitter just before the

00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:49,319
actual session so soon

00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,300
so now is your day moving on jacquard we

00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,370
shop at first

00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:02,959
okay okay is the Bluetooth setup really

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:07,360
okay guys so you just give us a few

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,360
minutes we set up you can hear

00:18:52,640 --> 00:20:35,460
yeah and okay just duplicator okay okay

00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:40,880
yeah okay

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,880
so now can learn this begin okay

00:20:41,590 --> 00:21:03,560
Amazon and buy all day to me to drink is

00:20:50,060 --> 00:21:06,260
a visit I smoked it was a dialog and so

00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,300
it's actually the speech view or because

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:18,380
I measure you cannot get on you so I

00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:22,190
think you can see what right so hi

00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:25,220
everyone so over here I am currently

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:28,850
running a screen reader which is self

00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:32,090
talking and so now what I'm gonna soft

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:36,410
show you guys is how I would sort of go

00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:40,730
about using Amazon as well as a local we

00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:42,440
a local retailer to sort of get

00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,360
information about buying a specific

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,760
product and nvo you know compare and

00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:49,430
contrast the differences between these

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:52,070
two websites so right now what I'll do

00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,670
is to press the it's a standard or D

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:59,120
shortcut

00:21:52,670 --> 00:22:08,950
since I'm on Windows to go to to

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:18,470
amazon.com and see if this loads ah okay

00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:20,540
over here okay so over here I I know

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:23,360
that the page has finished loading

00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,760
because it's it started talking and

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,890
reading out you know the title and and

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,320
so forth so right now let's say that I

00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:32,270
wanted to buy I actually do what if you

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:37,910
do on the game buy a new laptop so let's

00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:39,830
see if I can find the end the search bar

00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:41,990
on this page so over here

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,450
one thing that screen readers provide is

00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:47,210
are actually very like efficient and

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:49,460
fast ways of finding various structural

00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:52,940
elements of your page so right now I'm

00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:57,739
going to move to the next or edit field

00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:59,389
and navigation network network so so it

00:22:57,739 --> 00:23:01,340
said a bunch of things that this is it

00:22:59,389 --> 00:23:04,009
this is all part part of of the banner

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:11,330
of the page and now I am on this search

00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:13,070
field and I can start typing so so let's

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:15,830
say that I I was buying this particular

00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:17,299
machine so one thing about screen

00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:22,999
readers is that they are used this is

00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:26,570
this is this is synthesized speech so it

00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:29,059
so it always pronounces the same words

00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:31,159
or sentences or phrases in exactly the

00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:35,330
same way so it sort of becomes possible

00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:38,479
to get used to how it speaks and then so

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:46,369
you can slowly like increase the speech

00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:48,830
rate so this is like typically how I use

00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:52,999
this page so right now I'm going to try

00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:55,669
to do is to I so I I could start off by

00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:57,499
just pressing the arrow keys to you know

00:23:55,669 --> 00:24:01,369
slowly sequentially read through the

00:23:57,499 --> 00:24:03,729
entire page so this is roughly what it

00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:03,729
sounds like

00:24:05,889 --> 00:24:11,389
so as I you know move down you can hear

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,330
that I'm moving you you you can see that

00:24:11,389 --> 00:24:18,049
I'm moving past the search field and

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:20,599
then after that this is this is

00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:22,460
basically the neck the sign in via the

00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:24,019
pages and stuff so let's say that I

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,989
didn't want to do this because this

00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:29,059
would take me a long time so what I will

00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:33,080
now try to do is to move to the first

00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:36,049
level one heading so we soft rely a lot

00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:39,619
on on having correct structural amounts

00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:41,269
on this page so it's it main landmarks

00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:44,299
search results so I know that this is

00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:47,989
exactly where I want to be and I can

00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:49,820
move so so was quite a fan above result

00:24:47,989 --> 00:24:51,970
so I I can sort of move to the next

00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,970
heading

00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:58,959
so here let's say that I wanted to you

00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:00,940
know buy this computer but you know so

00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:03,329
it it's it it's it a bunch of things

00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:06,909
like the processor speed the hard drive

00:25:03,329 --> 00:25:10,509
size capacity Rev and so off so I can

00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:13,299
also move more slowly work by what

00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:17,109
instead of only relying on it reading

00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:24,159
the entire line or peg or paragraph at a

00:25:17,109 --> 00:25:25,989
time yeah so this is you know the screen

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,059
and it's anything there and so forth

00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:33,579
so let's say that I've wanted to go to

00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:36,609
come to this page so I've just okay and

00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:38,139
so it has finished loading and again one

00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:41,459
girl what I'm gonna try to do is that

00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:44,619
since the main content of the page was

00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:51,159
after in level one hitting I'm going to

00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:58,299
try this again to to to CV box yup so

00:25:51,159 --> 00:26:03,249
I'm here and and so it told me that so

00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:08,440
it told me that five point five stars

00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:12,129
Wow okay with for customer reviews so

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:19,449
over here like this is all what it it

00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:21,190
says and I can continue to move down and

00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:31,299
so you know the list price is the price

00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:35,739
and so forth so I can so this list it it

00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:38,469
told me that I am entering this list and

00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:40,419
I can sort continue to move down and so

00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:43,149
forth and what I can also do is that you

00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:45,249
know this move since moving by hitting

00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:49,449
worked for me earlier so I'm gonna try

00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:52,539
it again because now I'm makings of a an

00:26:49,449 --> 00:26:55,649
educated guess out there the other major

00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:58,239
sections of the webpage are also

00:26:55,649 --> 00:27:00,269
preceded by hitting so I'm gonna try

00:26:58,239 --> 00:27:00,269
that

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:07,430
oops yup so now I'm I'm in a level 2

00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:12,890
heading so this is a the frequently

00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:18,680
bought special offers have a question so

00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:21,020
forth yup and so the technical details

00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,870
and so forth are heading level 1 so I I

00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,600
can move to the next or previous heading

00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:29,150
or I can also move to a specific level

00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,390
heading so you know it's of depends on

00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:36,290
what I know this page has so this is you

00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:39,410
know roughly like how I would use I

00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:41,540
would navigate web page so like you know

00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:44,530
up to this point you know do any of you

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,530
guys have any questions

00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:54,789
holiday tea for you to like be able to

00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:04,059
everything yes I started using this in

00:28:00,469 --> 00:28:09,799
like 2004 so I have to come backwards

00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:11,330
yeah tough 13 Oh 13 years yeah so I mean

00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:12,889
you know so like it's like as you stuck

00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:15,619
I think I started around you know the

00:28:12,889 --> 00:28:17,570
way that it was earlier than you as you

00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:19,519
become more used to how it says certain

00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,499
things and then you just slowly increase

00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,379
it by a few percent every you know a few

00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:26,809
victor or something like because ii

00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:29,210
imagine with me using the computer at

00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:30,649
that we you know so it's like you you

00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:33,409
basically just spending your time

00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:35,269
waiting for it to tell you things rather

00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:40,039
than you know you doing your your own

00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:50,599
thing hmm yeah so it is possible to get

00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:55,009
used mmm any more questions so right so

00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:58,239
if not you know I will Nix compare the

00:28:55,009 --> 00:29:04,960
experience on you know Amazon versus a

00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:08,619
local retailer how do you so I can or

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:21,999
how how do you spell it

00:29:08,619 --> 00:29:21,999
thanks dot sg3

00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:28,590
well why is it taking so long to Lord oh

00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:49,840
yeah I remain a trifle so yes I know

00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:51,909
yeah it's okay thanks it's yeah so over

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,890
here it's you know it's not sort of

00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:56,409
notice that it's also telling me exactly

00:29:53,890 --> 00:30:10,000
the characters that I selected and so

00:29:56,409 --> 00:30:14,769
far so so that I know that ah yes okay

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,769
so now we are you know we are here so on

00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:20,080
this page I'm gonna try the same trick

00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:24,130
again because I want to move there first

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:28,590
you know and add edit field on this page

00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:35,980
and I can I can do so

00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:38,679
oops oh okay so it seems that there is a

00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:40,539
some Moodle dollar dialog so this is

00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:42,700
totally unscripted because the previous

00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:50,820
time that was here this thing didn't

00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:59,350
exist so let's see wait what why what

00:30:50,820 --> 00:31:04,690
with what the hell okay whatever yeah

00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:06,850
okay okay I mean that has to be

00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:10,620
something for you know for par on the

00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:10,620
path of the developers but anyway okay

00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:18,010
so the meanders party so I'm I've just

00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:19,659
did the same thing that I tried so I am

00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:22,169
now in the search field and I can start

00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:22,169
typing again

00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:37,480
and okay and so I'm here so now let me

00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:39,730
repeat the same X you know navigations

00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:49,450
off method so I'm gonna try to move the

00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:50,889
next hitting that I find so you know

00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:52,840
like I mean I I haven't gone through all

00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:55,750
all the headings of this page but just

00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,190
by the the headings that I see this is

00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,950
probably not gonna get me anywhere

00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:02,320
quickly so the next thing I'm gonna try

00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:05,710
is to go back up to the top of the page

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,440
and so besides headings that I I guess

00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:11,080
that you guys would be would have you

00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,570
know have heard of there is of another

00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:18,039
way of dividing the structure of your

00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:20,440
web page so these soft and this is

00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:23,470
called a region so you you can think of

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,929
a region as a way of expressing in the

00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,970
HTML what you guys must perceive

00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:30,190
visually on the page you know so for

00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:32,230
example if the page has a bunch of

00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,179
navigation links at the top you know

00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:36,909
going across the top then you were

00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:39,789
actually um and close that in HTML you

00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:42,039
know in a banner in a path and closing

00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:45,809
you know less banner greater tags so

00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:48,399
this is how a you know someone who is

00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:51,610
using some other interface can also

00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:52,929
perceive this page so let me try to see

00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:57,809
if this works to see if they have

00:32:52,929 --> 00:33:01,929
divided their page into regions right

00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:04,419
sorry that's that's all this okay so

00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:08,049
it's it navigation Lima okay I mean so I

00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:11,039
guess this is where the they are the

00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:14,440
site navigation stuff is and then oh

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:17,980
okay so there are no more landmarks so

00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,139
okay so these two are the real huge

00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,059
states that I often try to quickly get

00:33:20,139 --> 00:33:24,490
past the page you know past the

00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:26,169
irrelevant stuff to the main content of

00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:28,570
the page so I guess you you you can

00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:30,250
think of it as the equivalent of skim

00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:32,440
reading or just you know your eyes

00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:35,440
moving to where the main parts of the

00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:38,320
page is so now I have no choice I have

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,100
to you know explore this page more that

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,280
most

00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:49,660
thought thoroughly from the top and I'm

00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:55,150
going to start reading all right so why

00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:59,789
hurt so I noticed that over here after

00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:03,309
the after dr such after the search view

00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:04,450
right so after the search view there's

00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:08,560
actually this thing that says such

00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:11,859
results and then I know that so there

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,960
are a lot of hits and I've okay so this

00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:17,100
is this appears to be a way for me to

00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:24,760
select what I want to solve so let's see

00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:26,710
what this reads are e okay I mean I've

00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,560
known about this stuff so I'm just going

00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:35,230
to escape and and hope that this didn't

00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:38,980
do anything right so yeah so I'm so so

00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:42,820
so now I know that so so this appears to

00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:47,590
be the first actual hit that this is the

00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:50,950
Dell XPS 13 so what I sort of learned

00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:55,030
from soft light this is that I can also

00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:57,250
move to the next or previous combo box

00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,830
which is what the soft HTML this

00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:03,130
particular element is caught on the page

00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:04,570
so I know that in the future I can from

00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,520
the top of this page I can basically

00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,710
move to the next combo box and then you

00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,200
just below that is the main content of

00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:14,140
the page but you know the point that I'm

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,710
so drunk that guy you know do the point

00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:20,410
I'm trying to illustrate is that since

00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:22,750
you know the first tool like method sort

00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:25,359
of fail then I have to work a bit harder

00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:28,600
to find where the main content of the

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,730
page is and although I know now that the

00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,040
contents or does all these search

00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,810
results are actually right after this

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,750
combo box where you are supposed to be

00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:40,570
able to select how you saw the results

00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:42,670
that this is site-specific you know so

00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:43,690
one thing isn't a site specific and the

00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,510
other is that this is bound to change

00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:51,040
when perhaps the visual layer of the

00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:52,540
page changes yeah so let me just go to

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,770
the first

00:35:52,540 --> 00:36:01,119
our bazaar for the XPS 13 and Sivir I

00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:06,130
can read the the specifications for this

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:10,900
particular computer so the pitch has

00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:13,060
again finished loading oh okay so now I

00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:33,670
just tried to see if I can move by

00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:37,240
hitting any work so now I'm I'm here so

00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:41,050
so so this is how this is it

00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:53,470
reading you know the details of this

00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:56,170
page okay so you know this like

00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:58,900
hopefully this or gives you an idea you

00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:01,180
know of like the difference you know of

00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:04,030
having you know good structural elements

00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:08,500
in your in you know your webpage versus

00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:10,000
not having the structural elements you

00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,040
know so like like if I'm actually gonna

00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,260
buy an XPS 13 I guess you guys would

00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:22,140
know recite over he preferred to buy

00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:22,140
from so any questions up to this point

00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,650
yeah professional

00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:44,309
always so it depends on the on how the

00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:48,150
website was done so in the previous what

00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:51,779
the previous example for Amazon what I

00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:53,309
was able to do is to actually so in this

00:37:51,779 --> 00:37:55,679
page I didn't really have to do any

00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:59,069
site-specific workarounds because moving

00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:00,660
by hitting sort of books so headings are

00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:03,359
sort of sort of you know thing is

00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:06,029
defined in the HTML specification as a

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,039
way for you to logically divided content

00:38:06,029 --> 00:38:11,009
and to use you know like levels like

00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:13,229
level one could be the read you know the

00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:15,569
actual title and so forth and then level

00:38:13,229 --> 00:38:18,719
two would be sub headings or subsections

00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:21,630
and so forth so one is that on Amazon I

00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:25,849
didn't have to you know like spend extra

00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:28,469
you know brain brain cell cycles to

00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:32,459
understand you know the layout of this

00:38:28,469 --> 00:38:33,900
page and you know and so hopefully you

00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:35,849
know that like answers your question

00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,130
like if you're the website you know has

00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:40,799
this like standard width or standard

00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:46,039
ways of navigation then no we need those

00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:46,039
specific workarounds would be necessary

00:38:53,869 --> 00:39:05,609
hmm yep so like doing a single page

00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:10,140
application so that's that's gonna be

00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:12,960
sort of I'll cut a bit on that later on

00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,599
in sort of the little examples but soft

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,150
like the day see that there's a widow

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,970
actually mark parts of your page as

00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:24,240
being so called a live region so so

00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:27,150
you're saying that this page has this

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,460
part of your of the page has something

00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:31,890
that can change so you can have elements

00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,319
add or remove from the Dom you know in

00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:38,849
this particular section and then if

00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:40,500
you're if a particular interface that

00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:42,869
you are using to access the site

00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:46,710
understands this mock-up which is creamy

00:39:42,869 --> 00:39:49,650
deliciousness then it's able to be

00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:52,890
automatically announced changes to the

00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:55,109
specific part of the page only yeah so

00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,010
you do have a fan of L the value of

00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:59,040
control over that

00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:03,540
yeah so I'll be talking in a you know

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:06,630
data in a data section so also one

00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:10,230
finals of thing about how I you know use

00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:12,930
headings and regions to move about this

00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:16,950
page I can also move by region here on

00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:19,319
Amazon yup so I know here that don't

00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:21,599
there's such a place I can search and

00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:23,809
it's the mean content so the other thing

00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,130
is that a three-meter isn't the only

00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:28,140
thing that is gonna be there's going to

00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:30,900
benefit from your site being you know

00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:33,510
structure e having good structural

00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,859
markup so you know I guess that some of

00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:37,230
you would have used some resource like

00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:38,569
Instapaper or readability or you know

00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:41,640
that your browser's really more to

00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:43,260
extract the main parts of the page you

00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,530
know the articles we talked without the

00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:48,660
distraction of the sighs you know links

00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:50,790
and have this one site so forth so I bet

00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:54,930
that part of how it does this is

00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:57,089
actually relying on good structural your

00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,890
your site being structurally easy to

00:40:57,089 --> 00:41:02,109
analyze by a computer program

00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:04,960
mm you know so like having this mock-up

00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:07,089
not only you know it interrupt me

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:18,029
benefit more more you know people then

00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:18,029
you think it does so so you know

00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:41,309
[Music]

00:42:36,569 --> 00:42:46,420
okay guys sadly you stand up if I said

00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:50,140
all days I understand a bit so can you

00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:55,150
hear at the back can you guys hear me

00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:57,819
clearly okay alright so uh you guys is

00:42:55,150 --> 00:43:05,349
accelerated into the very high speed so

00:42:57,819 --> 00:43:09,099
good a little bit so a lot of people

00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:11,740
will like ask me some questions like how

00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:15,339
can I go to do programming how can they

00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:17,859
run a program what is my difficulties so

00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:21,190
now I just give you guys a brief

00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:24,780
demonstration to see how can you do it

00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:24,780
using screen readers

00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:33,790
so um usually everybody use a mouse but

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:40,000
for me I just keep our only everywhere

00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:41,950
everything is based on a shortcut so

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:51,099
here I'm using Eclipse to write some

00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:54,700
Java code lower the bond package like

00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:58,540
they love it let them look there so here

00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:04,780
for example if you want to create a new

00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:09,599
class right it's mostly space limit

00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:09,599
values what they're doing videos

00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:19,240
application context meant so in July so

00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:21,550
to open this menu usually of you you

00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:26,700
guys will press right arrow right but

00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:30,240
for Piero press application so if

00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:37,510
instead of writing mouse click I use

00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:42,180
application so here you can see that

00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:45,460
screen reader we support line user body

00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:48,820
gives them a lot of information so from

00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:52,359
here you can make any other possible use

00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:55,750
organic don't you Oh plus XI plus W this

00:44:52,359 --> 00:45:06,460
is the shortcut so after them then the

00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:08,950
menu if you show me the new something

00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:14,619
new something new I will press right

00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:20,319
arrow to open a new insight project a

00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:29,880
classic that will be classy name calling

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:34,660
it y de ello CSS never cancel button

00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:38,430
leaving them blank blank blank race

00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:43,140
never ever ever get talked into this

00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:44,700
okay so like what usually

00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,349
they want to read something I just

00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:55,200
simply read from top to bottom

00:45:46,349 --> 00:46:00,930
how about leg for the class my plank ok

00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:05,940
first you know tell Artie Lange leg leg

00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:07,200
leg leg leg simplest public key lamb

00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,450

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:13,920
each maybe father he look like the snake

00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:19,279

less st t tea party trailer stays a

00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:28,099
equals thing does nice hey let's create

00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:28,099
left right there semicolon

00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:38,069
okay so if i write something like this

00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:41,819
so usually you will ask me okay how can

00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:44,039
i know that there is some error there's

00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:45,989
a typo error orgasm same things that

00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:49,140
error or even unlike for example I

00:46:45,989 --> 00:46:53,450
forgot import my library or something so

00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:57,150
I am using the different screen reader

00:46:53,450 --> 00:47:02,309
from exams and using just this one is

00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:06,390
using NVDA so for Charles you can write

00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:08,489
some script to support this community so

00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:12,170
there's the built-in script

00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:15,210
that man will tell me like for example

00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:17,410
in some some in some part of the code

00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:21,010
because some error it will show

00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:23,440
like I think the red color right so it

00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:27,070
will tell me that this this part is

00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,200
invalid so lower leg plot the class

00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:31,270
might never clash leg brace this one is

00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,340
finite black publicly bring luck there

00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:36,430
right there tamela's with Nicolas

00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:37,840
invalid least it's been the listen world

00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:41,350
here evening and we have some

00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:48,360
probabilities oh the values I so let's

00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:48,360
see what happen so here I I guess I can

00:47:53,710 --> 00:48:01,300
also a specially made necessary evils

00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:12,080
menu file menu to move through items

00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:13,490
with almost evil then the move

00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,210
provides results out there of your

00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:23,120
controlling the 2012 control Eagles

00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:24,770
mostly menu menu file menu to vote to

limit men who said I would text

00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:37,850
curiously control the default control

00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:48,100
your equals let's go through people's is

00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:48,100
it big race

00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:51,880
right great

00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:57,910
sorry where's the problem with the

00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:57,910
little speaker

00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,720
okay

00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:24,430
now we combine again how often I you

00:49:21,789 --> 00:49:28,140
know and find the error and and then

00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:28,140
find find out how to solve this error

00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:47,259
control one again this is also a

00:49:39,779 --> 00:49:49,539
shortcut for the pastoralism absolutely

00:49:47,259 --> 00:49:52,029
live parrot java camera so you can see

00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:56,829
that it will rig me reason we like in

00:49:52,029 --> 00:49:59,650
import ' ELISA ' because now and you

00:49:56,829 --> 00:50:11,430
writing codes I need to know every bump

00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:14,430
situation measurements parenthesis the

00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,430
ID

00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:24,790
it was able to raise my brain up there

00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:28,060
Mike there's any cool and as he did so

00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:31,250
another thing is how can I use that code

00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:34,490
completion so usually when you type

00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:36,980
right you can see the list of suggestion

00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:41,830
for me again I have to press like

00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:41,830
shortcut to move to this for example

00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:49,100
periods you show me a list of available

00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:50,990
function so I just simply press that to

00:51:49,100 --> 00:52:00,520
beneath them so I'm going to use the up

00:51:50,990 --> 00:52:00,520
and down arrow to find it to do it

00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:21,350
please

00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:24,260
one that will never ever see deep deep

00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:26,480
deep he says stay home say that by his

00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:41,600
heat right guys de lettres her s monkey

00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:50,359
teeth as indeed he left Paris to go

00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:54,820
bigger so when public questioning blank

00:52:50,359 --> 00:52:59,830
public staff robbery like to call my

00:52:54,820 --> 00:53:06,120
class why

00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:09,100
e o controlspace my demo class and space

00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:13,300
variables so that interface level

00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:15,340
control space when I don't like left and

00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:19,240
right there or like right there a clam

00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:25,600
pepper my demo question when when ii ii

00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:27,970
o period and wait let them wait look

00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:31,570
wait look wait wait the street wait look

00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:34,150
there right there plan semicolon control

00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:38,230
and now away from control dec 11 and

00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:41,170
we're stuck yeah again this is another

00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:43,330
situation that will show me the error so

00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:45,880
now for example I have a big project I

00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:47,530
don't know where where the Airways I'm

00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:52,930
gonna open all the glasses to see the

00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:56,170
invalid nice I just again use all my

00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:59,620
shortcut to see this the menu of the

00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:01,570
error I'll check in with see cybertek

00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:05,140
this game state this game function cube

00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:07,390
X 3 new the level 0 arrows arrows left

00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:09,880
at level 1 invalid character constant

00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:11,650
reason and entered his game and it

00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:14,320
selected Lisbon and left there the

00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:16,960
apostrophe s the faster we get the

00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:19,680
transnational quote left barren quote

00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,190
quote invalid I didn't in our tea and

00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,370
sent right back

00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:26,440
' right there ' Shiva quote and infamous

00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:27,400
quote list on and left a request read

00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,400
one quote right there

00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:33,610
control s and close my demo and it will

00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:39,520
instead plan man when Sonny

00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:46,210
control control that $11 and see my note

00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:48,090
and then string one when okay so from

00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:50,660
this you can see the way how can

00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:53,850
- coding how can I deal with like

00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:57,000
problem how to I can't I can recognize

00:54:53,850 --> 00:55:01,200
the red line of era or anything's the

00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:04,440
final thing is how can I debug the

00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:09,930
answer is right right now it's almost

00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:16,170
impossible so for example I want to know

00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:18,240
how the codes were I just simply I want

00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:21,120
to see how the prints function work

00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:24,230
really I just simply go to this function

00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,230
and the press f3

00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:33,170
okay so do you have any question

00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:45,350
yeah so how do detects in this yeah I

00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:48,080
can detect syntax error by like for

00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:49,820
example when I worked there and we try

00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:52,730
to make an error now we've got a clerk

00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:56,780
and so he called me at a semicolon

00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:58,520
okay so we're if I go through this line

00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:04,670
we start we start at left arrow

00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:06,980
straighten both record tell me this this

00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:09,170
one this one is in invalid with that

00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:11,660
left arrow straight through cable is

00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:14,120
like very invalid right parent is mean

00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:17,540
this right presence yeah we got some

00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:20,900
problem there so I can guess that I

00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:23,360
never miss the semicolon semicolon and

00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,860
right with police target left Perico

00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,890
streets and code right there is any

00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:29,750
colon and then it will not read invalid

00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:34,520
anymore so that is all I can detect

00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:36,530
leaks obvious syntax error but this one

00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:40,820
only working for my screen reader is

00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:45,830
mcjones if you use me Nvidia if we have

00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:48,950
to run and after running fell I can open

00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:51,530
the arrow real viewer and then try to

00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:53,710
find the errors it's very visible we are

00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:53,710
of course

00:56:54,800 --> 00:57:03,410
yeah Happy's like different in different

00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:06,140
IDs on things other things that you'd

00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:09,500
like you wish the IDS this better in

00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:22,130
general or just general like what you're

00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:26,270
like things really frustrate them for

00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:29,380
example Eclipse is very good visual like

00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:31,970
Microsoft Visual Studio is also good I

00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:35,390
mean it's a bit heavy but it is still

00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:43,640
fine I can I can code I can things that

00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:46,280
I use stss Springs those as sweet is the

00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:49,310
website the other thing to building

00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:54,110
website which is spring from work is

00:57:49,310 --> 00:58:03,050
also what we do Nina but now I'm using

00:57:54,110 --> 00:58:04,550
Android studio to work in and one dress

00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:08,270
you know I have some problem with

00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:13,850
configuration I cannot change something

00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:15,920
and setting and sometimes it's when

00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:21,070
whenever I want screen reader is going

00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:21,070
to be slower than then no more yeah yeah

00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:27,769
so I think the next part when we're

00:58:24,479 --> 00:58:30,660
going to walk through the screen reader

00:58:27,769 --> 00:58:33,989
process right mm I think the key thing

00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:35,819
to note for you is the concept of what

00:58:33,989 --> 00:58:37,289
you see is right here make sure

00:58:35,819 --> 00:58:40,229
everything that you see they're looking

00:58:37,289 --> 00:58:42,509
for as you go to the your visual flow

00:58:40,229 --> 00:58:44,999
can match up with the audio flow that

00:58:42,509 --> 00:58:47,099
you're listening to I think that's the

00:58:44,999 --> 00:58:51,679
most important thing to emphasize as

00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:55,380
you're as you're going to era so yeah so

00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:57,089
there's a cheesy here and I think with

00:58:55,380 --> 00:59:01,319
the white used what you see is why you

00:58:57,089 --> 00:59:02,969
here we're gonna demo with a different

00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:24,349
kind of e-commerce site we're going to

00:59:02,969 --> 00:59:27,150
go to so already as in its own hangar so

00:59:24,349 --> 00:59:29,729
so if you want you can just wear one

00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:30,959
side it is possible so you can hear the

00:59:29,729 --> 00:59:32,880
instructions as well hmm

00:59:30,959 --> 00:59:35,039
that's not me honey do but if you find

00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:38,069
it too difficult then disprove or sighs

00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:44,579
laughs right this is what Eugene what

00:59:38,069 --> 00:59:46,799
content you visit okay so the first

00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:49,529
thing is you know that you guys will

00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:53,849
want to be to be do is to turn on

00:59:49,529 --> 00:59:58,679
voiceover itself and so the key the key

00:59:53,849 --> 01:00:01,380
stroke for that is command + f5 so this

00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:03,749
is this is a toggle that turns it on and

01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:07,650
off and you and this works in any

01:00:03,749 --> 01:00:09,509
application so the other thing is that

01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:11,939
voiceover in its default configuration

01:00:09,509 --> 01:00:17,640
if this is the first time that you guys

01:00:11,939 --> 01:00:20,099
switch it on okay if this is the first

01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:22,829
time that you guys have it on then you

01:00:20,099 --> 01:00:24,449
might have this dialogue that asks you

01:00:22,829 --> 01:00:27,089
if you want to if you want to take part

01:00:24,449 --> 01:00:28,979
in this a QuickStart tutorial so few

01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:31,619
feet or you just use your mouse to or

01:00:28,979 --> 01:00:34,170
okay pal keyboard to cancel that first

01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:38,280
or I believe you you you can press as

01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:40,890
Cape so it's so once you know voiceover

01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:44,420
is on the other setting change that

01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:54,530
might be very helpful is to modify a

01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:56,850
particular Safari setting as a list and

01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:59,100
some other sort of pretty important

01:00:56,850 --> 01:01:01,410
things is that voiceover its default

01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:04,440
configuration is also extremely verbose

01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:06,810
so it is sort of trying to be helpful by

01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:11,490
telling you what are the keys that you

01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:13,680
are able to press but what black bar the

01:01:11,490 --> 01:01:16,440
keys you are able to press when you're

01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:19,050
when your focus is on a particular place

01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:21,030
so if you find that tool you know if you

01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:23,790
need to stop it from speaking just press

01:01:21,030 --> 01:01:25,740
the control key and another key that is

01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:28,430
very that would be very helpful for your

01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:31,890
exploration of learning on voiceover is

01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:36,420
using its keyboard help come on

01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:38,040
so on that pitch I said that a lot of

01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:40,950
commands use something called a

01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,950
voiceover key and I said on this page

01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:45,780
that you have to press control and

01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:47,750
option I believe to search on but

01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:51,630
actually I didn't know that you can also

01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:53,610
use the caps lock key itself as your

01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:56,070
voiceover key so you know just we

01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:58,590
remember that you you can press let's

01:01:56,070 --> 01:02:01,650
say caps lock + key or you can press

01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:04,950
control + option + K so both are

01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:07,260
equivalent so since now I we know that

01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:09,450
we can use the caps lock key then that's

01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:11,280
probably easier to use in pretty much

01:02:09,450 --> 01:02:15,330
every situation

01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:18,510
yeah so one thing that is yeah and the

01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:22,320
reason you use this keyboard help that

01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:24,330
you can activate by although it was all

01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,960
commands presses a key the corner this

01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:27,860
works out

01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,860
yup teachers

01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:35,640
is the is the current screen reader

01:02:32,610 --> 01:02:42,240
that's playing is it a bit too fast

01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:46,640
control shift our cursor and how about

01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:46,640
your own on your own computer it's 512

01:02:48,650 --> 01:03:03,210
percent volume 100% initiative boys I'll

01:02:51,930 --> 01:03:05,720
come back is a 50 percent 25 percent 26

01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:08,340
growth this was 31 percent maybe I think

01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:11,690
does this people at all for you want try

01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:15,890
get know as I'm just trying

01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:18,840
hey OH

01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:21,000
takes account as well close Dixon can

01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:25,470
add the vertical lines winter button

01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:29,570
okay window toolbar so anymore this PC

01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:31,980
the old on down giraffe so the the the

01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:34,070
way that you know about help works is

01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:38,340
that when you activate it by pressing

01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:42,990
voiceover plus K is basically it

01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:45,990
basically tells you over GG sorry it in

01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:47,490
B city allows you to it sort of a safe

01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:50,780
sandbox for you to experiment with

01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:54,660
pressing various keys on your keyboard

01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:56,850
so for example control okay so just

01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:58,590
bored out studying currently we're

01:03:56,850 --> 01:04:02,700
conscious if you enjoy what area

01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:05,060
question okay so if you were to give me

01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,060
a second

01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:17,040
I'm sure wise not speaking oh no visible

01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:23,130
table to interact voiceover chichi

01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:26,220
welcome okay see how the press right so

01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:31,290
if you depress if you if so it tells you

01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:33,180
the keys of function when you press a

01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:38,730
particular keystroke so for example if I

01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:41,849
pressed voiceover plus F control I also

01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:44,339
control every tax within the window so

01:04:41,849 --> 01:04:46,470
all these are it's basically a safe soft

01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:49,020
sandbox for you to play with different

01:04:46,470 --> 01:05:04,440
commands and so that you know what these

01:04:49,020 --> 01:05:06,000
commands do control meaning and the

01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:14,280
hotel cold means that like the concept

01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:19,190
to the beach party on the beach you know

01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:21,750
unique one floaties and we have one fire

01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:23,640
if it's not raining at 5:30 you're gonna

01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:25,109
still meet on the beach we have some

01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:31,260
drones and we still want to pretend

01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:34,710
right control then you're gonna move on

01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:36,690
to level five stops early and gets the

01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:38,130
whole glass room it's almost as good as

01:05:36,690 --> 01:05:39,900
being at the beach and we're gonna set

01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:42,030
up the party in the dinner they're great

01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:48,690
it's gonna be a lot of food and drinks

01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:52,130
and a lot of DBS so anywhere see you

01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:52,130
later thank you

01:05:52,579 --> 01:05:58,130
I fired what's the time now 5 5 what 5

01:05:55,999 --> 01:06:01,789
no no I said no she didn't okay

01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:10,640
step one of also anything else no that's

01:06:01,789 --> 01:06:13,609
not enough right this mess okay starting

01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:16,309
keyboard hell right so you know if

01:06:13,609 --> 01:06:20,479
you're ever not sure on which key to

01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:24,349
press and then you know just just use

01:06:20,479 --> 01:06:27,380
this if I helped to do experiment and so

01:06:24,349 --> 01:06:29,089
the other soft thing that is some it

01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:31,729
might be helpful for you guys to

01:06:29,089 --> 01:06:35,410
configure Safari a source data on the

01:06:31,729 --> 01:06:35,410
help sheet right at the top

01:06:41,170 --> 01:06:48,250
no tab search around your website so now

01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:52,070
has all kinds like suit surgeon

01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:54,860
vegetarian so one thing is like you know

01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:58,060
that our young order he did to was that

01:06:54,860 --> 01:07:00,260
there are multiple screen readers are

01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:03,320
available so since Windows is sort of

01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:05,870
the most like populist platform there

01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:09,050
are currently two actually three major

01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:11,630
ones but the way that Windows screen

01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:14,480
readers work and Mac three meters well

01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:16,820
are substantially pretty different so

01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:20,150
you know peaceful I'm you know not so

01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:22,220
like I'm some not as some familiar you

01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:26,330
know we've met you know so please bear

01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:29,780
with me a bit on that so here the the

01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:31,250
website that we want to go to to for

01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:34,580
this particular demo so what what we're

01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:38,080
gonna do is to look to see if we can

01:07:34,580 --> 01:07:40,550
look for information on a particular a

01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:43,990
particularly popular book by going to

01:07:40,550 --> 01:07:48,800
book repository so if you open a new tab

01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:51,230
on safari your focus should be should be

01:07:48,800 --> 01:08:00,280
on the address bar and you should be

01:07:51,230 --> 01:08:00,280
able to start typing okay hey-oh

01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:13,970
and then and then you can just and this

01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:16,520
is the and this is the site for book

01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:19,810
repository this book depository sees

01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:22,490
everyone able to you know hear what's

01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:25,280
here or something that roughly matches

01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:31,000
what you heard just down or is anyone

01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:31,000
having sharing something different

01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:42,979
okay so here so here on this web page

01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:46,400
there are some ways that you can

01:08:42,979 --> 01:08:48,079
actually navigate to the you know try to

01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:50,479
the next heading to the previous heading

01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:54,679
to the next list and so forth at least

01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:57,650
but in the bottom of the of the document

01:08:54,679 --> 01:09:00,859
but there but voiceover I guess in a

01:08:57,650 --> 01:09:03,819
vision you know update they create a

01:09:00,859 --> 01:09:06,919
more you know finger efficient way of

01:09:03,819 --> 01:09:12,469
moving so what you can do is that you on

01:09:06,919 --> 01:09:14,869
this page you can you can press the left

01:09:12,469 --> 01:09:24,499
and right arrows to together to toggle

01:09:14,869 --> 01:09:27,679
on to to um you can press it to toggle

01:09:24,499 --> 01:09:29,929
quick quick nap on and what this allows

01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:33,519
you to do is that you can move around

01:09:29,929 --> 01:10:02,479
this page by pressing the left arrow

01:09:33,519 --> 01:10:03,439
keys yeah so press control option shift

01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:04,849
and down arrow

01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:09,829
if you don't appear to be able to

01:10:04,849 --> 01:10:28,639
actually move anywhere inside inside

01:10:09,829 --> 01:10:32,269
this content please stop us yeah right

01:10:28,639 --> 01:10:34,479
so now that the sort of though so this

01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:36,889
is of one difference the way voice of

01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:40,550
dustings what it does is that in sort of

01:10:36,889 --> 01:10:44,059
groups logically logically distinct

01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:45,890
items to together and then what it

01:10:44,059 --> 01:10:48,920
allows you to do is to efficiently get

01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:50,420
for an overview of the main video window

01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:53,420
without having to tab through every

01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:57,140
single link on the webpage so for

01:10:53,420 --> 01:11:00,200
example if I stop interacting with this

01:10:57,140 --> 01:11:04,760
particular web content if I if I were to

01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:09,440
press the left over arrow keys I'm now

01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:11,480
on this particular part of Safari and

01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:13,760
this is the real head button and so

01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:15,380
forth so this if you lets you explore

01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,950
the interface without necessarily being

01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:21,110
bogged down by details which is why you

01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:24,590
need to so-called interact or zoom into

01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:32,600
or set your particular focus on to this

01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:36,380
web content right so now I'm interacting

01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:39,200
with this web content so to move to the

01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:42,410
beginning of the pitch you were pressing

01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:46,520
over server plus home and voiceover plus

01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:49,460
end okay

01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:54,440
is there hope no one is it function with

01:11:49,460 --> 01:12:00,700
its no okay I forgot the key sorry my

01:11:54,440 --> 01:12:04,310
house it's okay it's donkey okay

01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:07,460
and so what you can do now is that when

01:12:04,310 --> 01:12:09,140
you switch is that you can press left or

01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:22,880
right arrows to visit clean house

01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:30,890
oops oh my Khan house so yeah it's over

01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:36,250
appears that are there isn't homes home

01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:36,250
there isn't a home key on soft your

01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:48,740
screen is breaking those piercings oh oh

01:12:41,590 --> 01:12:57,560
okay function function is the very end

01:12:48,740 --> 01:13:02,750
here is andreas woman thanks yep so what

01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:04,850
was all can you just an auskey home so

01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:07,760
when you when you mentioned a home key

01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:11,240
on Mac its function left and then and

01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:13,850
this function right so for if you want

01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:16,790
to modify with a voiceover modifier in

01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:19,000
total it caps lock function left for

01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:20,710
home capsule function and for right Oh

01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,630
hmm

01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:28,810
so if I were to press caps lock function

01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:32,510
and and I met but so yeah so this works

01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:35,330
contact so so that means that the first

01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:44,810
item on this peak is a PC contact is a

01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:46,460
contact link and si and as I use as I

01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:48,650
use the left and right arrow keys to

01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:52,040
move I'm soft moving through different I

01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:56,270
elements of this page click information

01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:59,320
source link rocket leg truck link heart

01:13:56,270 --> 01:14:01,160
situation so another way of navigating

01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:03,380
let's say that you want to define a

01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:06,440
specific thing is to use something

01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:10,220
called the voice of rota that you can

01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:12,290
turn on using voiceover plus you and

01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:14,099
what this brings up you can think of

01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:16,739
this as a two-dimensional

01:14:14,099 --> 01:14:20,429
menu where you can press up and down to

01:14:16,739 --> 01:14:21,570
basically move true sorry so what what

01:14:20,429 --> 01:14:24,360
you can do is that you can press the

01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:26,790
left or right arrow keys to move to up

01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:32,909
to select a particular type of web

01:14:26,790 --> 01:14:37,050
element that you wish to move by so it's

01:14:32,909 --> 01:14:41,070
either come control option you are just

01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:44,159
are caps lock + you to activate this

01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:45,510
voiceover / rotor so you can just you

01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:48,270
know use the left and right arrow keys

01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:50,550
and up and down to explore this voice

01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:51,719
while rotor and what you can do is that

01:14:50,550 --> 01:14:55,409
the other thing you can do is that let's

01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:57,090
say that you know that you you know you

01:14:55,409 --> 01:15:04,829
you know filter display so you can

01:14:57,090 --> 01:15:08,369
basically just start to type and over

01:15:04,829 --> 01:15:11,670
here myself I've narrowed it down to

01:15:08,369 --> 01:15:14,070
three things and over here if I were to

01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:18,179
press ENTER then you actually be taken

01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:20,250
to the to the link or the kind of

01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:24,380
element that you chose so what you can

01:15:20,250 --> 01:15:28,679
do is also so these are one way of also

01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:31,230
navigating this page and so if you look

01:15:28,679 --> 01:15:33,420
at these headings if you can if you find

01:15:31,230 --> 01:15:46,500
this you know a list of headings there

01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:49,829
are lots of headings on this page so

01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:54,599
just by just by looking at this list are

01:15:49,829 --> 01:15:56,460
you can actually gain some sense of how

01:15:54,599 --> 01:15:59,550
this page is structured so in the

01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:03,420
heading level one is the main is where

01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:07,050
the main content starts followed by the

01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:09,150
this best-ever book lists popular

01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:11,099
reading books and so forth so this is

01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:14,670
one way that you can navigate by using

01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:20,070
the route and you can escape by pressing

01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:22,469
the escape so the other so an adult of

01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:24,360
thing that you guys can try is um

01:16:22,469 --> 01:16:27,760
besides using this rotor

01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:29,860
you can also arms off press the

01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:33,780
up arrow and right arrow keys to

01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:35,910
together and what this does is that

01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:41,130
sorry

01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:44,020
controls it allows you to choose again

01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:47,110
allows you to choose what type of

01:16:44,020 --> 01:16:49,120
element you wish to move by so you can

01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:51,520
press up arrow and right arrow or up

01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:53,620
arrow and left arrow to sort of cycle

01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,530
through this list and then what and then

01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:59,800
what you can do is let's say marks that

01:16:56,530 --> 01:17:02,740
I am words without fast legs

01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:06,460
hey so let's say that I press you know

01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:10,870
up and right repeatedly until I'm

01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:12,970
heading so oh yeah this only works so I

01:17:10,870 --> 01:17:17,110
can press up and down to actually move

01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:27,520
by that particular elements type so so

01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:30,490
now my second was a headings so this is

01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:35,320
another way of navigating around by

01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:37,540
using the this by using dr up and left

01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:38,950
or right arrow keys to select by the

01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:42,520
kind of element that you want to move by

01:17:38,950 --> 01:17:45,730
and then using up and down to - to move

01:17:42,520 --> 01:17:48,520
to the next or previous of occurrence so

01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:50,860
this is so so so far I've shown you two

01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:52,990
ways of navigating and then there's

01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:55,300
another way that you can also navigate

01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:57,700
by activating some something called

01:17:55,300 --> 01:18:00,370
single letter quick navigation mode

01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:03,100
which you so for this to work you need

01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:08,110
your your original quick navigation mode

01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:10,360
we on by pressing left and right okay

01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:12,520

01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:16,360

in just now

01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:40,160
then can you turn quick nap on starting

01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:43,400

equipment even water to turn on single

01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:18,170
letter quick navigation whoa it's okay

01:20:06,950 --> 01:20:20,870
if it that's all it's okay it's okay

01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:23,510
it's okay it's okay

01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:25,460
so maybe this feature might have been it

01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:27,650
could have been you know introduced in a

01:20:25,460 --> 01:20:31,310
or you know you know different version

01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:35,090
of voiceover or mic so when I when I

01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:38,090
tested it only but when I when I tested

01:20:35,090 --> 01:20:40,730
it it worked for me but it but perhaps

01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:46,840
it requires some up some existing update

01:20:40,730 --> 01:20:46,840
oh it doesn't worry

01:20:47,200 --> 01:21:07,490
yeah yeah okay so yes it uh or is

01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:09,080
overcome when you six items you're

01:21:07,490 --> 01:21:11,030
currently in a voiceover closing

01:21:09,080 --> 01:21:15,140
voiceover he'll menu having a level two

01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:17,750
favorite others so another useful sort

01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:21,140
of command you can try is also bringing

01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:24,350
a voice voice of our our help and in

01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:25,850
this menu it sort of this is way where

01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:28,520
you can self get helped online

01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:32,330
controller commands to draw action a

01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:35,420
change to fall for various voice over V

01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:39,260
V resources or not control option K

01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:41,660
commands help control option HH and help

01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:45,850
many fourteen items you are currently in

01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:50,000
a voice 140 so over here in this in

01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:54,020
Venice in the command menu you can start

01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:55,820
typing to basically filter for to look

01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:58,880
for a specific command so this is useful

01:21:55,820 --> 01:22:01,850
if you forgot the keystroke for a

01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:03,920
particular command and you wanted to use

01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:06,260
it anyway

01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,749
so let's say I wanted to activate this

01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:11,119
fine previous landmark oh man

01:22:08,749 --> 01:22:13,340
heading level one link okay how's Atari

01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:13,670
calm you are her in the other heading

01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:19,670
month

01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:22,760
yeah right so the next thing that I

01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:29,590
would like to sort of demonstrate now is

01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:33,800
to is to move is to move to the nearest

01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:37,599
farm field so let me see the command for

01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:41,110
this is all its give me a second

01:22:37,599 --> 01:22:41,110
enter search times

01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:59,820
is such fun are getting such boys over

01:22:56,430 --> 01:23:06,840
chichi quick second and this aside and

01:22:59,820 --> 01:23:08,310
research times creating such long furry

01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:10,140
owners now padding in the whole three

01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:12,930
elements navigation without single key

01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:14,670
quick nap information so this is so vo

01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:16,790
be using that work even without single

01:23:14,670 --> 01:23:19,080
key wouldn't have to go one column on

01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:21,330
action-comedy keystroke Corral two

01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:23,460
column one move to next item regardless

01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:28,110
of level comma to the old press command

01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:30,140
+ H so so this is this table will be the

01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:32,580
set of commands that view will be using

01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:35,700
so you can go to the next hitting by

01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:39,060
pressing voiceover fast

01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:41,430
c'mon class voiceover plus command plus

01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:44,820
each and if you add shift to the

01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:48,570
previous keystroke that should allow you

01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:54,050
to move the previous that should allow

01:23:48,570 --> 01:23:57,630
you to move them to the previous element

01:23:54,050 --> 01:24:01,890
and you can also do a voiceover plus

01:23:57,630 --> 01:24:04,710
command + X Oh

01:24:01,890 --> 01:24:06,630
okay so in this case that moves you to

01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:10,200
the next or previous list but in this

01:24:06,630 --> 01:24:16,610
case this page has no lists and the

01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:16,610
corresponding graph the corresponding

01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:21,240
excuse me

01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:24,000
the so you can stop experiment with this

01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:27,960
so on voiceover plus command it sort of

01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:30,300
the common keystroke followed by various

01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:33,930
are letters on the keyboard that allow

01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:35,790
you to move to various various things or

01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:40,850
is a virtual chip or is emergency oil

01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:40,850

thanks thanks inside welcome all right

01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:22,250
so to move to the next or the previous

01:25:16,489 --> 01:25:23,480
you know form here you will do no more

01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:26,060

01:28:03,869 --> 01:28:07,119
you are currently on a heading level

01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:09,489
three so this is the first

01:28:07,119 --> 01:28:10,959
result and we can sort of just be like

01:28:09,489 --> 01:28:13,959
what's next

01:28:10,959 --> 01:28:16,659
what sort of beneath this heading blank

01:28:13,959 --> 01:28:19,479
Michael Wolfe black outline black star

01:28:16,659 --> 01:28:21,939
it works so over here it actually said

01:28:19,479 --> 01:28:26,260
outline black star

01:28:21,939 --> 01:28:30,939
so it's not able to tell you how many

01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:34,780
stars are we how many stars this

01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:37,659
particular book has so I guess it's I

01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:41,469
guess at this um because it's sort of

01:28:37,659 --> 01:28:44,189
the soft isn't a label for this so it

01:28:41,469 --> 01:28:46,749
doesn't translate 0-5 gentoos euro 1/8

01:28:44,189 --> 01:28:47,800
so that's and so that's it I'm not

01:28:46,749 --> 01:28:49,899
insane

01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:52,239
fire it fear in this particular book and

01:28:49,899 --> 01:28:56,889
then I can just press I can just

01:28:52,239 --> 01:29:01,179
activate this particular link link hours

01:28:56,889 --> 01:29:05,860
blank envelope contact and now I am here

01:29:01,179 --> 01:29:08,139
on the on the details for this

01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:11,169
particular book heading level one fire

01:29:08,139 --> 01:29:13,449

01:29:11,169 --> 01:29:15,729
details you are currently heading level

01:29:13,449 --> 01:29:19,389

01:29:19,389 --> 01:29:24,659
the arrow keys to explore this page

01:29:21,909 --> 01:29:28,300
connected via parities link by link

01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:31,749
share link envelope link that link T

01:29:28,300 --> 01:29:34,119
link so over here if you are cooling if

01:29:31,749 --> 01:29:37,209
you were to arrow right a few times from

from the heading you were he not notice

01:29:37,209 --> 01:29:45,909
it saying blank F F worklink

01:29:40,179 --> 01:29:48,849
t.t worklink P P and so forth so I start

01:29:45,909 --> 01:29:52,239
I suspect this is because the link isn't

01:29:48,849 --> 01:29:54,789
currently label but I guess it is the

01:29:52,239 --> 01:29:57,249
distance for Facebook Twitter the first

01:29:54,789 --> 01:30:01,059
time and this is the restriction

01:29:57,249 --> 01:30:03,039
outrages of the book and then and then

01:30:01,059 --> 01:30:06,189
now if we move to the next heading

01:30:03,039 --> 01:30:07,449

01:30:06,189 --> 01:30:10,179

pages you are a cup dimensions one five

01:30:14,530 --> 01:30:19,260

01:30:15,789 --> 01:30:23,080
information on this book yeah

01:30:19,260 --> 01:30:28,320
so you know like try to see if if you

01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:28,320

01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:44,219
mmm publication date 0 5 10 to 0 1 8 you

01:30:41,710 --> 01:30:44,219
are currently

01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:10,140
does anybody have some difficulties or

01:31:03,490 --> 01:31:13,810
questions up to up to this point Jesus

01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:16,720
because different laptops I've imagined

01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:22,840
Windows laptop surgery how do you

01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:27,160
overcome that do you have like yes so

01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:30,160
this is so pop why I also have it harder

01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:32,680
for me to conduct this portion of the

01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:34,660
bookshop because when I was doing sort

01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:37,150
of the preparation and testing I was

01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:41,550
doing it so on a windows keyboard deal

01:31:37,150 --> 01:31:45,430
so the hero here on the Mac is very

01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:47,980
different so I kept on trying to I kept

01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:59,860
on trying to perform home antonin even

01:31:47,980 --> 01:32:05,740
work initially let's see why do business

01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:08,830
laptop so how do you example the whole

01:32:05,740 --> 01:32:11,740
keyboard almost cease only a few those

01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:13,060
function keys and so forth yeah so what

01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:15,210
we do is that probably have to you know

01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:19,330
consult the menu or whatever of the

01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:20,710
manufacturer and then excuse me and then

01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:24,910
I'm sick and then see if that you know

01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:27,520
we can figure out C on it inside of

01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:29,910
content she likes it sorry and then see

01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:33,240
them and then see if we can rescue it's

01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:35,770
okay and then see if we can figure out

01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:37,990
how this works the other sort of thing

01:32:35,770 --> 01:32:40,720
that I've usually tries to turn on the

01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:42,640
equivalent of the keyboard help mode and

01:32:40,720 --> 01:32:49,000
impress various key combinations and see

01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:54,730
why it says use that your fingers always

01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:57,160
stuff yeah so I guess it's similar to

01:32:54,730 --> 01:32:59,670
like touch typing so whether you don't

01:32:57,160 --> 01:33:03,070
BAM usually type you don't look down

01:32:59,670 --> 01:33:06,900
onto the keyboard like once you are used

01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:06,900
together yeah mmm

01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:16,690
yeah so if you guys are like comfortable

01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:19,210

about how the it's a bit confusing so

01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:40,140
what happens is that the way that

01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:42,170
Amazon's page is structured the heavy

01:58:40,140 --> 01:58:45,540
heading level one that describes the

01:58:42,170 --> 01:58:47,520

result of the name of the product but

01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:54,660
then the place that they put the window

01:58:50,930 --> 01:58:56,190
price might actually be before that so

01:58:54,660 --> 01:59:00,240
that might happen sometimes so that's

01:58:56,190 --> 01:59:03,090

02:05:17,020 --> 02:05:20,590
the way that the result is a key

02:05:18,429 --> 02:05:23,679
structure is a bit funny because you

02:05:20,590 --> 02:05:25,960
have information about the price and

02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:29,469
shipping options before the actual title

02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:32,190

02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:24,579

02:06:22,690 --> 02:06:26,530
continue the move heading level two

and this is economy on heading level two

02:06:42,530 --> 02:06:47,750
so actually the winner this is leader is

02:06:45,949 --> 02:06:51,890
also not perfect because the product

02:06:47,750 --> 02:06:55,640
details which is you know is is right

02:06:51,890 --> 02:06:57,320
here at the bottom car cover three three

02:06:55,640 --> 02:06:59,300

02:06:57,320 --> 02:07:01,550
are currently on attacks on cover

02:06:59,300 --> 02:07:05,410

02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:16,280
and then if I just continue to move down

02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:17,570
a few more times heading level two more

02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:19,250

02:07:25,790 --> 02:07:31,910
smooth slow go clink 5.0 out of five

02:07:29,239 --> 02:07:34,850
stars so this is like zero out of five

02:07:31,910 --> 02:07:36,710
link reading this book is like January 5

02:07:34,850 --> 02:07:39,699
so this is the you know so this is the

02:07:36,710 --> 02:07:42,530
information for the top customer review

02:07:39,699 --> 02:07:45,710
so like you know hopefully like the way

02:07:42,530 --> 02:07:49,360
that I sort of did like most of that was

02:07:45,710 --> 02:07:54,260
by using hitting navigation by using

02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:56,989
voiceover + command + H to move to the

02:07:54,260 --> 02:07:59,480
next hitting and voiceover + Tramonto

02:07:56,989 --> 02:08:02,660
Shift + H to move to the previous

02:07:59,480 --> 02:08:05,420
heading and then using the left arrow or

02:08:02,660 --> 02:08:08,090
right arrow key stroke moves you with

02:08:05,420 --> 02:08:13,040
using sequentially from your current

02:08:08,090 --> 02:08:18,260
position as well as using voiceover +

02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:20,690
command + G to move to the next or

02:08:18,260 --> 02:08:22,040
previous form view so this soft

02:08:20,690 --> 02:08:25,699
particular keystroke keeps on tripping

02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:31,010
me up because J isn't really it isn't

02:08:25,699 --> 02:08:35,530
intuitively intuitively assigned yeah

02:08:31,010 --> 02:08:35,530
son of a giveaway button page one

02:08:35,860 --> 02:08:44,119
okay Becky yeah

02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:50,599
loaded loaded thank you so much yeah

02:08:44,119 --> 02:08:55,520
yeah yeah no girls gonna do it segment

02:08:50,599 --> 02:08:58,840
on hey get off because he's dead you

02:08:55,520 --> 02:09:03,340
guys to smell sorry

02:08:58,840 --> 02:09:03,340
yeah I think

02:09:28,739 --> 02:09:33,690
notes safari voiceover off

02:09:47,010 --> 02:09:49,670
didn't

02:09:51,739 --> 02:09:53,889
yeah

02:09:58,530 --> 02:10:00,799
what

02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:30,470
so now we've been talking all about like

02:10:27,470 --> 02:10:32,630
all the rules the compliance and that is

02:10:30,470 --> 02:10:36,470
what we should strive it so after like

02:10:32,630 --> 02:10:38,600
auditing a website then you find a box

02:10:36,470 --> 02:10:40,790
and then you try to become plain so I'm

02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:43,130
just gonna do a quick overview of what

02:10:40,790 --> 02:10:44,690
it do what we're talking about so this

02:10:43,130 --> 02:10:48,380
is think of web content accessibility

02:10:44,690 --> 02:10:50,600
guidelines WCAG right now it's on 2.0

02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:54,740
and then it's about how to make website

02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:56,840
accessible in all ways so current so it

02:10:54,740 --> 02:11:01,010
comprises of principles guidelines

02:10:56,840 --> 02:11:03,560
success criteria and techniques so so

02:11:01,010 --> 02:11:06,020
these guidelines are kind of governed by

02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:08,510
four overarching principles so

02:11:06,020 --> 02:11:11,600
perceivable operable understandable and

02:11:08,510 --> 02:11:14,480
robust and then these under these four

02:11:11,600 --> 02:11:16,690
principles are twelve guidelines so the

02:11:14,480 --> 02:11:20,690
success criteria for these guidelines is

02:11:16,690 --> 02:11:22,790
for a two double-a to triple-a so this

02:11:20,690 --> 02:11:26,540
is just how you see how complying you

02:11:22,790 --> 02:11:29,000
are these standards and each of them has

02:11:26,540 --> 02:11:31,940
the techniques you can take so gonna go

02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:35,450
into some ways of how you can achieve

02:11:31,940 --> 02:11:38,660
these guidelines theta and it is also

02:11:35,450 --> 02:11:42,460
like done and that's a lot of stuff

02:11:38,660 --> 02:11:45,200
online but you can learn more about and

02:11:42,460 --> 02:11:48,170
sort of us the first the first one is

02:11:45,200 --> 02:11:50,450
perceivable so this is not just for

02:11:48,170 --> 02:11:53,660
people like we have different types of

02:11:50,450 --> 02:11:58,130
disabilities but also for web crawlers

02:11:53,660 --> 02:12:01,850
robots so this is just like Dickson

02:11:58,130 --> 02:12:05,330
mentioned like apps like instant paper

02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:08,870
that actually depend on the ability to

02:12:05,330 --> 02:12:10,520
pass a website in perceivable manner so

02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:14,450
making sure your website is perceivable

02:12:10,520 --> 02:12:17,650
in this way second is operable so the

02:12:14,450 --> 02:12:21,730
user is able to use it that they can

02:12:17,650 --> 02:12:21,730
achieve the intended function

02:12:22,210 --> 02:12:30,290
that is to be understandable so this is

02:12:25,670 --> 02:12:32,750
so this is just that you you can convey

02:12:30,290 --> 02:12:36,160
the message of the website and that your

02:12:32,750 --> 02:12:38,990
users don't feel like they're lost and

02:12:36,160 --> 02:12:42,920
4/5 robust so it's a bother to keep

02:12:38,990 --> 02:12:45,380
updated with latest like different

02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:47,210
technologies for example SmartWatch if

02:12:45,380 --> 02:12:49,460
you want like all these new technologies

02:12:47,210 --> 02:12:51,650
and platforms coming up you need to make

02:12:49,460 --> 02:12:54,950
sure that your website is robust to all

02:12:51,650 --> 02:12:57,800
these new stand new technologies also

02:12:54,950 --> 02:13:00,470
for different users so there are twelve

02:12:57,800 --> 02:13:03,950
guidelines as you can see it's lumped

02:13:00,470 --> 02:13:07,460
under different principles we'll just

02:13:03,950 --> 02:13:11,420
focus on one for today so we don't

02:13:07,460 --> 02:13:14,030
overwhelm you so and the first one the

02:13:11,420 --> 02:13:15,650
most basic it's providing text

02:13:14,030 --> 02:13:18,440
alternatives so this is not just for

02:13:15,650 --> 02:13:24,440
images it's also for videos for graphs

02:13:18,440 --> 02:13:27,230
like anything that is not text so in in

02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:29,330
terms of HTML the practical meaning of

02:13:27,230 --> 02:13:31,220
what you have to include it's like for

02:13:29,330 --> 02:13:34,150
input fields you need to include a name

02:13:31,220 --> 02:13:37,310
so let's say you have an input field for

02:13:34,150 --> 02:13:39,770
just like writing your credit cut in but

02:13:37,310 --> 02:13:42,230
then if you don't put in a name

02:13:39,770 --> 02:13:43,640
attribute in your HTML tag there's no

02:13:42,230 --> 02:13:45,490
way the screen it is gonna understand

02:13:43,640 --> 02:13:48,830
what are you trying to ask the user

02:13:45,490 --> 02:13:51,290
input in here and then for images you

02:13:48,830 --> 02:13:54,230
should all give an alt text and because

02:13:51,290 --> 02:13:56,510
like for example when Dixon was

02:13:54,230 --> 02:13:59,180
navigating Book Depository he was going

02:13:56,510 --> 02:14:02,450
to like the Home icon but they just ran

02:13:59,180 --> 02:14:04,640
up home but I just read a house and then

02:14:02,450 --> 02:14:06,800
like for similar things as well so for

02:14:04,640 --> 02:14:07,910
icons for images you need alt text so

02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:10,520
that the screen reader kind of stand

02:14:07,910 --> 02:14:12,260
what is this image and quite the note is

02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:15,590
that alt text should also be descriptive

02:14:12,260 --> 02:14:17,030
so for example if you like just right

02:14:15,590 --> 02:14:20,090
picture of a student it's not very

02:14:17,030 --> 02:14:22,960
helpful and some someone who can see the

02:14:20,090 --> 02:14:24,860
visual input you can get a lot of more

02:14:22,960 --> 02:14:27,350
information or this picture than just

02:14:24,860 --> 02:14:28,639
picture of a student so you can put some

02:14:27,350 --> 02:14:30,310
small details like

02:14:28,639 --> 02:14:34,610
engineering student working in

02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:37,520
microscope lab and in another last

02:14:34,610 --> 02:14:41,210
example is link text so a lot of times

02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:42,949
on websites people will write describe

02:14:41,210 --> 02:14:45,110
my link it's just like click this link

02:14:42,949 --> 02:14:48,260
but you should be more descriptive also

02:14:45,110 --> 02:14:50,869
like click this click to view this

02:14:48,260 --> 02:14:54,860
article on web accessibility something

02:14:50,869 --> 02:14:58,639
like that and now yeah it's gonna talk

02:14:54,860 --> 02:15:00,199
about Aria so Aria it's one of the ways

02:14:58,639 --> 02:15:03,830
you can achieve these guidelines and

02:15:00,199 --> 02:15:06,429
it's a pretty fundamental for web

02:15:03,830 --> 02:15:06,429
accessibility

02:15:10,490 --> 02:15:17,330
generally using your laptop for this

02:15:40,330 --> 02:15:45,469
[Music]

02:16:02,450 --> 02:16:13,140
what do you need is yours and then I

02:16:06,150 --> 02:16:16,710
ever read from mine that's my place

02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:19,929
already connected anyway yeah I cannot

02:16:16,710 --> 02:16:22,500
hear any sense on Rios

02:16:19,929 --> 02:16:22,500
thank you

02:16:25,840 --> 02:17:01,100
you can't hear your sound oh is it a

02:16:28,730 --> 02:17:04,280
brutal thing okay so you can just reach

02:17:01,100 --> 02:17:06,469
our son yeah yeah okay nice so now I

02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:09,950
will talk about just give you a brief

02:17:06,469 --> 02:17:13,990
introduction about area accessibility

02:17:09,950 --> 02:17:13,990
ipi and as a and

02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:21,780
like how how and why we have used this

02:17:19,650 --> 02:17:27,690
and then this one will give you a

02:17:21,780 --> 02:17:34,440
details like implementation how we used

02:17:27,690 --> 02:17:36,620
area roles in attributes so at first I

02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:39,810
will talk about excessively

02:17:36,620 --> 02:17:42,570
accessibility API so what are

02:17:39,810 --> 02:17:45,240
accessibility API is actually it is the

02:17:42,570 --> 02:17:48,650
tours to give information to screen

02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:52,650
reader for example you have a lot of

02:17:48,650 --> 02:17:55,110
elements in your UIs so how can really

02:17:52,650 --> 02:17:58,200
don't know what to reach out for the

02:17:55,110 --> 02:18:01,230
user so they need the I try to provide

02:17:58,200 --> 02:18:04,440
for example okay we have how many

02:18:01,230 --> 02:18:08,610
elements in the unites have many images

02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:13,460
and what what type of element we have

02:18:08,610 --> 02:18:17,940
like images are label links or headers

02:18:13,460 --> 02:18:19,889
so so that is why I mean it is so for

02:18:17,940 --> 02:18:25,020
example on the website everybody know

02:18:19,889 --> 02:18:28,530
that Dom tree right so down to the Dom

02:18:25,020 --> 02:18:31,560
tree is one of those accessibility API

02:18:28,530 --> 02:18:34,469
actually actually Dom tree itself it's

02:18:31,560 --> 02:18:36,360
not the accessibility right but the

02:18:34,469 --> 02:18:41,570
screen reader can make use of this and

02:18:36,360 --> 02:18:41,570
it become API accessibility API

02:18:41,930 --> 02:18:48,820
successfully please Yelling's so and now

02:18:45,320 --> 02:18:53,810
what is the accessibility tree so

02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:55,460
specifically on website we this are

02:18:53,810 --> 02:18:59,530
applicable for website because

02:18:55,460 --> 02:19:02,660
accessibility tree actually is the sub

02:18:59,530 --> 02:19:05,150
subset of the dom tree system modified

02:19:02,660 --> 02:19:07,881
downstream so they're different between

02:19:05,150 --> 02:19:09,890
its and the dom tree is usually

02:19:07,881 --> 02:19:15,860
accessibility is smaller than don't you

02:19:09,890 --> 02:19:21,250
why because they it doesn't contain you

02:19:15,860 --> 02:19:27,560
are decorating elements so for example

02:19:21,250 --> 02:19:30,260
website we have a lemon feel and then we

02:19:27,560 --> 02:19:33,410
have a deep fried and then I believe we

02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:36,680
have a few elements like a few Spanish

02:19:33,410 --> 02:19:40,040
just for decorating like we want to show

02:19:36,680 --> 02:19:43,040
some icons that is for beautiful focus

02:19:40,040 --> 02:19:48,230
sorry and we have some links and some

02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:50,830
header inside this div so the Dom tree

02:19:48,230 --> 02:19:54,440
contains all Beltane but for the

02:19:50,830 --> 02:19:58,040
accessibility tree we only need links

02:19:54,440 --> 02:20:02,650
the header and yeah that's all all the

02:19:58,040 --> 02:20:02,650
space or the icons will be chopped outs

02:20:02,659 --> 02:20:09,050
so it's only contest any necessary

02:20:04,609 --> 02:20:14,229
information for screen readers so and I

02:20:09,050 --> 02:20:17,000
forgot to mention one point that in in

02:20:14,229 --> 02:20:21,290
enriched internet complication not on

02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:25,580
website we need something to convert the

02:20:21,290 --> 02:20:29,080
usual accessibility I tried to platform

02:20:25,580 --> 02:20:36,649
specific accessibility as well

02:20:29,080 --> 02:20:40,340
what is so what is and then I can ever

02:20:36,649 --> 02:20:42,590
move on to area so what is area and area

02:20:40,340 --> 02:20:46,180
is the tours that I'm innocent

02:20:42,590 --> 02:20:49,159
before that used to map web

02:20:46,180 --> 02:20:53,449
accessibility rights in the platform

02:20:49,159 --> 02:20:59,830
Pacific today yeah

02:20:53,449 --> 02:21:03,680
why are so area why we need to use area

02:20:59,830 --> 02:21:06,979
we need this because uh at first is very

02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:11,869
easy very easy to use and you only need

02:21:06,979 --> 02:21:15,109
to add some absolutely they are acting

02:21:11,869 --> 02:21:17,689
elements and second thing is is it

02:21:15,109 --> 02:21:18,560
reduce coding I mean you don't need it

02:21:17,689 --> 02:21:23,210
it doesn't add up

02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:27,619
calling overhead it's mean you don't

02:21:23,210 --> 02:21:30,409
need to like write a two-minute code you

02:21:27,619 --> 02:21:34,100
don't need to build a separate module or

02:21:30,409 --> 02:21:38,720
any complex thing for this and then it's

02:21:34,100 --> 02:21:42,850
a quite effective case isn't you can you

02:21:38,720 --> 02:21:46,189
can use you can improve accessibility of

02:21:42,850 --> 02:21:50,390
your UI and without affecting your

02:21:46,189 --> 02:21:55,840
current design for example you have one

02:21:50,390 --> 02:21:58,850
icon for example you have an icon to the

02:21:55,840 --> 02:22:01,399
soft at a button to make a phone call

02:21:58,850 --> 02:22:03,439
so the icon is look like the telephone

02:22:01,399 --> 02:22:07,040
no but you don't have any text on this

02:22:03,439 --> 02:22:09,800
so if if you want to change yeah

02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:12,380
you have many ways but I give you two

02:22:09,800 --> 02:22:14,600
ways first is

02:22:12,380 --> 02:22:17,960
this icon into the button with the text

02:22:14,600 --> 02:22:20,450
for example coal or please press this

02:22:17,960 --> 02:22:22,790
button to call anything else so this

02:22:20,450 --> 02:22:25,610
will if you change like this your design

02:22:22,790 --> 02:22:28,070
will change the second way is using use

02:22:25,610 --> 02:22:30,860
areas so you only add one attribute to

02:22:28,070 --> 02:22:35,990
this to tell screen reader that ok this

02:22:30,860 --> 02:22:38,810
icon is a button and it is it its name

02:22:35,990 --> 02:22:41,330
is called so the screen reader will read

02:22:38,810 --> 02:22:41,899
out loud to the user that ok there is a

02:22:41,330 --> 02:22:44,030
call button

02:22:41,899 --> 02:22:48,590
but the design rules will stay the same

02:22:44,030 --> 02:22:52,010
and the last thing is it is standardized

02:22:48,590 --> 02:22:58,729
it is support by its fully support and

02:22:52,010 --> 02:23:01,550
which have documentation as well so the

02:22:58,729 --> 02:23:04,189
thought is I don't know how can you we

02:23:01,550 --> 02:23:08,240
use okay I will move on to the next part

02:23:04,189 --> 02:23:11,210
that's how we use area actually we use

02:23:08,240 --> 02:23:16,910
area by adding attribute mostly by

02:23:11,210 --> 02:23:22,000
having our wheel to your XML elements if

02:23:16,910 --> 02:23:25,220
I show you injury so then and nice we

02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:27,200
after adding this to do to help us we

02:23:25,220 --> 02:23:30,680
need a recognized elements you should

02:23:27,200 --> 02:23:36,680
divide your website into resume how

02:23:30,680 --> 02:23:41,960
reagent and next you should we should

02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:45,200
buying dynamic elements into some s SVD

02:23:41,960 --> 02:23:48,860
events so that we can update any changes

02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:51,610
from those dynamic element so listen

02:23:48,860 --> 02:23:57,590
we'll talk more about this later

02:23:51,610 --> 02:24:02,120
you specification but even though we

02:23:57,590 --> 02:24:05,300
have area already I think we should use

02:24:02,120 --> 02:24:07,610
the basic XML elements as much as

02:24:05,300 --> 02:24:10,399
possible for example you have it the

02:24:07,610 --> 02:24:15,260
simple website

02:24:10,399 --> 02:24:18,680
I think basically marries enough for

02:24:15,260 --> 02:24:22,490
example we put out text for images we

02:24:18,680 --> 02:24:25,220
use button we use header I think this is

02:24:22,490 --> 02:24:28,450
you know some simple ways we don't even

02:24:25,220 --> 02:24:36,290
we even don't it as well

02:24:28,450 --> 02:24:39,380
Aria loops it's the clamor so to build

02:24:36,290 --> 02:24:42,140
we have two types of area attribute

02:24:39,380 --> 02:24:46,780
usually we have area rose and area

02:24:42,140 --> 02:24:53,060
attributes so what is area Rose rose it

02:24:46,780 --> 02:24:55,370
attribute that will we help screen we

02:24:53,060 --> 02:24:58,130
will help screen it and know that what

02:24:55,370 --> 02:25:01,550
is the purpose of this element for

02:24:58,130 --> 02:25:04,520
example if you put a roll equal to like

02:25:01,550 --> 02:25:07,970
radio button or equal to but then for

02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:10,189
example your icon your spans your DV or

02:25:07,970 --> 02:25:12,920
whatever we become radio button become

02:25:10,189 --> 02:25:15,770
actually when it's generated from dom

02:25:12,920 --> 02:25:19,220
tree to accessibility three if we

02:25:15,770 --> 02:25:21,170
convert this leaf or this span or

02:25:19,220 --> 02:25:24,710
something out there that we come to

02:25:21,170 --> 02:25:27,020
radio button for example so it will help

02:25:24,710 --> 02:25:29,990
user know what is the purpose of your

02:25:27,020 --> 02:25:32,260
icon well and how do second request is I

02:25:29,990 --> 02:25:32,260
can't

02:25:32,660 --> 02:25:41,240
all right so next is re attribute and we

02:25:38,090 --> 02:25:43,370
actually build yourself at the thing to

02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:47,750
to tell you the state and the properties

02:25:43,370 --> 02:25:50,561
of the elements so for example again

02:25:47,750 --> 02:25:54,470
radio button or check text box

02:25:50,561 --> 02:25:58,730
alright so if you put our checks give

02:25:54,470 --> 02:26:01,970
them to true if you show that it is

02:25:58,730 --> 02:26:05,240
checked and another thing is we have

02:26:01,970 --> 02:26:09,170
area hidden attributes really will help

02:26:05,240 --> 02:26:11,960
you to hide this element to from from

02:26:09,170 --> 02:26:16,490
screen readers so all most of the

02:26:11,960 --> 02:26:19,280
attributes will be prefixed by area so

02:26:16,490 --> 02:26:23,360
if you need further information you can

02:26:19,280 --> 02:26:25,870
go to those references to define the

02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:28,430
articles about area

02:26:25,870 --> 02:26:33,950
okay thanks guys so now Dixon will

02:26:28,430 --> 02:26:38,620
continue my hearts even or any questions

02:26:33,950 --> 02:26:38,620
about you having a question area or WCAG

02:27:03,729 --> 02:27:15,949
maybe I think us gang antics like

02:27:13,460 --> 02:27:18,260
Singapore webs like website from

02:27:15,949 --> 02:27:29,260
Singapore like how much of it is the

02:27:18,260 --> 02:27:32,119
affiant is like complying to these hmm

02:27:29,260 --> 02:27:34,130
maybe like less than half I mean yeah so

02:27:32,119 --> 02:27:38,090
soft depends like just if the website is

02:27:34,130 --> 02:27:39,859
that say a wordpress blog and using you

02:27:38,090 --> 02:27:42,800
know your default theme so actually by

02:27:39,859 --> 02:27:44,779
default I've either the saw the themes

02:27:42,800 --> 02:27:47,149
actually have all these accessibility

02:27:44,779 --> 02:27:50,239
started by default so it's you usually

02:27:47,149 --> 02:27:52,520
only when the website has some what

02:27:50,239 --> 02:27:54,260
wants to leave some let's say a button

02:27:52,520 --> 02:27:58,430
or a checkbox tech she looks a bit

02:27:54,260 --> 02:28:02,119
different to what you usually see so

02:27:58,430 --> 02:28:03,470
that's so so sometimes instead of using

02:28:02,119 --> 02:28:06,439
an actual checkbox

02:28:03,470 --> 02:28:08,090
you know element and then using CSS to

02:28:06,439 --> 02:28:11,449
start it but the do you say they just

02:28:08,090 --> 02:28:13,609
use a div element and then visually they

02:28:11,449 --> 02:28:16,789
make it look like a checkbox but as far

02:28:13,609 --> 02:28:19,399
as your um is concerned is actually not

02:28:16,789 --> 02:28:21,699
a checkbox so that's usually where it

02:28:19,399 --> 02:28:21,699
happens

02:28:44,521 --> 02:28:47,521
hmm

02:28:54,930 --> 02:29:00,510
first those

02:29:01,830 --> 02:29:23,130
oh sorry

02:29:15,630 --> 02:29:26,250
do do la do la like this Aden is no yeah

02:29:23,130 --> 02:29:42,360
so it's because you are by default it's

02:29:26,250 --> 02:29:44,250
already no no this just the the core

02:29:42,360 --> 02:29:47,490
elements are already by default method

02:29:44,250 --> 02:29:49,350
access at 38 yeah all right I trusted 33

02:29:47,490 --> 02:29:51,120
so you don't have to do anything special

02:29:49,350 --> 02:29:54,210
it's only when you want to do like rich

02:29:51,120 --> 02:30:02,811
applications so there's four areas like

02:29:54,210 --> 02:30:02,811
you wanna do then you need to use Aria

02:30:03,021 --> 02:30:08,070
landing a div to be the main part of

02:30:05,610 --> 02:30:11,190
your web page article that info or a

02:30:08,070 --> 02:30:13,850
banner and we also need Aria attributes

02:30:11,190 --> 02:30:17,811
to set the state and properties on these

02:30:13,850 --> 02:30:17,811
on your like a checkbox

02:30:19,450 --> 02:30:23,930
so it's like it's it's funny when you

02:30:22,101 --> 02:30:27,370
are thinking of creating that a custom

02:30:23,930 --> 02:30:30,021
react component or customer or a custom

02:30:27,370 --> 02:30:33,920
angular component so that's typically

02:30:30,021 --> 02:30:36,141
when you would reach for using Aria

02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:40,370
obvious or these types of opportunities

02:30:36,141 --> 02:30:42,141
just like whenever you can talk the

02:30:40,370 --> 02:30:46,190
recommendation is to use the built-in

02:30:42,141 --> 02:30:48,550
like html5 or we do have a lots of the

02:30:46,190 --> 02:30:52,820
energy goes for example this even now

02:30:48,550 --> 02:30:54,980
and attribute unless audio or less video

02:30:52,820 --> 02:30:56,960
great attack so that is you don't even

02:30:54,980 --> 02:30:59,980
need flash player anymore to do some of

02:30:56,960 --> 02:31:03,200
these things so this that we go

02:30:59,980 --> 02:31:05,150
recommendation to use doing elements

02:31:03,200 --> 02:31:08,601
when possible and only one is really not

02:31:05,150 --> 02:31:11,990
then to reach for aria to succour thick

02:31:08,601 --> 02:31:14,960
you know what by thing I mean you you

02:31:11,990 --> 02:31:19,580
make the eleven of here as if it's it's

02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:21,200
a normal HTML do int element so this so

02:31:19,580 --> 02:31:23,180
like this off of what are we going

02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:26,180
through so hopefully then the student

02:31:23,180 --> 02:31:29,141
mix and hopefully the next section in

02:31:26,180 --> 02:31:42,610
time will clarify a bit hmm

02:31:29,141 --> 02:31:42,610
okay so on yes okay

02:31:54,391 --> 02:32:03,370
we don't like

02:31:56,880 --> 02:32:04,720
so in this sort of final section so you

02:32:03,370 --> 02:32:07,710
know I would like to like explain about

02:32:04,720 --> 02:32:10,990
how how you you guys can actually create

02:32:07,710 --> 02:32:13,630
custom HTML like you know I mean custom

02:32:10,990 --> 02:32:16,420
UI videos then when there's really no

02:32:13,630 --> 02:32:23,980
other you know way of achieving of

02:32:16,420 --> 02:32:30,010
achieving what your site requires so

02:32:23,980 --> 02:32:31,420
this is this is the advice that I saw I

02:32:30,010 --> 02:32:35,410
talked about we fee

02:32:31,420 --> 02:32:40,180
just now he's basically used in HTML

02:32:35,410 --> 02:32:42,010
whenever possible and you know

02:32:40,180 --> 02:32:44,800
accordions are pretty popular so you

02:32:42,010 --> 02:32:49,860
will see that later on but there's

02:32:44,800 --> 02:32:49,860
actually now an html5 element to do this

02:32:52,380 --> 02:32:59,950
right so also over here so this is the

02:32:57,220 --> 02:33:02,351
landmarks that we touched on briefly so

02:32:59,950 --> 02:33:05,500
maybe just let me just quickly like

02:33:02,351 --> 02:33:08,561
devil's tree because we went to this we

02:33:05,500 --> 02:33:13,601
eventually bit of this armoire go with

02:33:08,561 --> 02:33:16,601
like really really fun so we this pitch

02:33:13,601 --> 02:33:19,601
I can remove by landmarks so over here

02:33:16,601 --> 02:33:23,561
from the top when I press the command to

02:33:19,601 --> 02:33:27,670
move the next landmark so this is on

02:33:23,561 --> 02:33:31,090
navigation you know lemma such lemma so

02:33:27,670 --> 02:33:33,641
this way I can find such items the mean

02:33:31,090 --> 02:33:36,070
they're not followed by another

02:33:33,641 --> 02:33:38,470
navigation that map and this

02:33:36,070 --> 02:33:40,990
complimentary are and this complimentary

02:33:38,470 --> 02:33:43,360
sort of landmark is but it basically

02:33:40,990 --> 02:33:45,700
means information that complements the

02:33:43,360 --> 02:33:49,000
main part of the page but it also makes

02:33:45,700 --> 02:33:54,700
sense then standalone as well and

02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:56,290
content info means are means that this

02:33:54,700 --> 02:33:57,910
is information that you find at the

02:33:56,290 --> 02:34:00,510
bottom of the page so you can think of

02:33:57,910 --> 02:34:00,510
it as if

02:34:06,180 --> 02:34:15,789
so the width so the way that you

02:34:13,060 --> 02:34:18,159
actually write a landmark is that you

02:34:15,789 --> 02:34:21,459
why he say that latter then you enclosed

02:34:18,159 --> 02:34:23,590
your menu bar in a day for example so

02:34:21,459 --> 02:34:27,880
one possible way to make that landmark

02:34:23,590 --> 02:34:29,050
we see less deep space raw equals quote

02:34:27,880 --> 02:34:32,829
Neff unquote

02:34:29,050 --> 02:34:35,470
so that basically gets translated to a

02:34:32,829 --> 02:34:39,010
part of your web page with a navigation

02:34:35,470 --> 02:34:42,340
landmark so so I'm doing this in sofa is

02:34:39,010 --> 02:34:44,709
these are pure HTML solutions so when

02:34:42,340 --> 02:34:48,039
doing this you the recommendation is to

02:34:44,709 --> 02:34:51,670
ensure that every part of your web page

02:34:48,039 --> 02:34:54,390
is within some lemma and so basically

02:34:51,670 --> 02:34:56,649
what which lemma to pick is usually

02:34:54,390 --> 02:34:58,749
quite intuitive and because you know you

02:34:56,649 --> 02:35:02,050
were used there for your Lobby for your

02:34:58,749 --> 02:35:03,909
navigation bar and so forth but the

02:35:02,050 --> 02:35:08,229
preferred solution is again to use built

02:35:03,909 --> 02:35:10,270
in html5 elements over here some html5

02:35:08,229 --> 02:35:14,170
elements already have implicit rules as

02:35:10,270 --> 02:35:17,039
you can see from this table so you know

02:35:14,170 --> 02:35:23,249
I highly recommend using these whenever

02:35:17,039 --> 02:35:23,249
whenever you you whenever possible so

02:35:24,930 --> 02:35:30,909
next is you know implementing a custom

02:35:28,300 --> 02:35:35,279
button so if you really need to do this

02:35:30,909 --> 02:35:35,279
sort of the way that you implement this

02:35:35,850 --> 02:35:41,020
so like insert in the in Alex use of

02:35:38,890 --> 02:35:45,670
sections what I want to show you guys is

02:35:41,020 --> 02:35:48,340
on how to how sort of all of these

02:35:45,670 --> 02:35:49,770
custom vision should sound so that when

02:35:48,340 --> 02:35:55,030
you guys are implementing these things

02:35:49,770 --> 02:35:59,260
you know what what do

02:35:55,030 --> 02:35:59,740
but nine two minutes maybe you that's

02:35:59,260 --> 02:36:01,600
right

02:35:59,740 --> 02:36:03,190
f5 in the next two minutes or so say

02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:09,750
what the party needs two minutes

02:36:03,190 --> 02:36:09,750
Oh Rafa yeah coz Phi 3d Oh

02:36:09,940 --> 02:36:18,601
so over here this so this is soft

02:36:15,280 --> 02:36:23,980
roughly how a button Ranma or it can

02:36:18,601 --> 02:36:27,040
sound like so this is a vintage button

02:36:23,980 --> 02:36:29,260
so it actually said finish button and as

02:36:27,040 --> 02:36:32,860
far as I am aware of just by listening

02:36:29,260 --> 02:36:37,180
to this is a regular button so if I were

02:36:32,860 --> 02:36:40,420
to activate this button it actually it

02:36:37,180 --> 02:36:42,970
actually prints as you expect but the

02:36:40,420 --> 02:36:59,920
WIDA is actually implemented is usually

02:36:42,970 --> 02:37:02,021
using a custom set your so on your diff

02:36:59,920 --> 02:37:04,391
that you will have for this button you

02:37:02,021 --> 02:37:06,790
basically said roll equals to button and

02:37:04,391 --> 02:37:13,420
then let's say that your button has

02:37:06,790 --> 02:37:15,970
multiple possible states for example so

02:37:13,420 --> 02:37:18,340
this is a mute button and it said mute

02:37:15,970 --> 02:37:20,110
button toggle not pressed so the way the

02:37:18,340 --> 02:37:23,771
reason it in those days

02:37:20,110 --> 02:37:26,380
it's because it has n area - pressed

02:37:23,771 --> 02:37:28,680
equals to true or false a trivial attach

02:37:26,380 --> 02:37:31,120
to it and when I press ENTER on this

02:37:28,680 --> 02:37:35,710
pressed so I know that this button is on

02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:44,561
act is active so the way that you do

02:37:35,710 --> 02:37:51,010
this is just using this is this is v1 a

02:37:44,561 --> 02:37:55,141
thickness now so the the our next thing

02:37:51,010 --> 02:37:55,141
is implementing two tips

02:37:59,521 --> 02:38:12,970
so in this right so I'm on this username

02:38:09,880 --> 02:38:14,170
I'm near this you user you feel so what

02:38:12,970 --> 02:38:17,700
I'm going to do is I'm just gonna press

02:38:14,170 --> 02:38:22,540
the tab key to bring my my focus here

02:38:17,700 --> 02:38:24,819
and it's it also known as user ID

02:38:22,540 --> 02:38:26,880
so this is the text of the to tip

02:38:24,819 --> 02:38:31,090
annually and he was able to

02:38:26,880 --> 02:38:33,340
automatically read it out and the winner

02:38:31,090 --> 02:38:35,710
it's implemented is basically by there

02:38:33,340 --> 02:38:38,590
is a diff right next to this arm edit

02:38:35,710 --> 02:38:42,939
box that is initially set to be hidden

02:38:38,590 --> 02:38:44,830
when the page loads and when your car

02:38:42,939 --> 02:38:47,439
when this thing with is focused their

02:38:44,830 --> 02:38:49,870
scripting them reacts to this event and

02:38:47,439 --> 02:38:51,279
then is basically unhides the two team

02:38:49,870 --> 02:38:52,950
but then the next question you might be

02:38:51,279 --> 02:38:56,140
wondering sir how does the screen reader

02:38:52,950 --> 02:38:58,720
know that you know that to tip is

02:38:56,140 --> 02:39:13,420
related to this box so the defense has

02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:19,680
this row equals to this row over here so

02:39:13,420 --> 02:39:19,680
the input trough box actually has this

02:39:40,529 --> 02:39:53,890
and then after this is the corresponding

02:39:44,380 --> 02:39:56,470
HTML the input IRA - described by it

02:39:53,890 --> 02:39:59,229
equals to something and this basically

02:39:56,470 --> 02:40:01,000
means that this element has some

02:39:59,229 --> 02:40:02,319
additional description that lives

02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:05,800
somewhere else

02:40:02,319 --> 02:40:08,680
and we refer to this element by its ID

02:40:05,800 --> 02:40:11,920
so this is how it knows about how to

02:40:08,680 --> 02:40:14,439
read the routine and then after that the

02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:17,560
Softee if I know like thing to note is

02:40:14,439 --> 02:40:20,050
that for two tips to work properly you

02:40:17,560 --> 02:40:21,640
should not only the Sun for onmouseover

02:40:20,050 --> 02:40:24,729
events but you should also be listening

02:40:21,640 --> 02:40:27,970
to the on focus event because the on

02:40:24,729 --> 02:40:29,770
focus is sort of more device agnostic

02:40:27,970 --> 02:40:32,729
and I believe that also works for

02:40:29,770 --> 02:40:35,729
touchscreen devices as well and

02:40:32,729 --> 02:40:35,729
correspondingly

02:40:55,170 --> 02:41:00,369
yeah yeah sorry I swear they were

02:40:59,050 --> 02:41:01,869
showing us like sushi last night

02:41:00,369 --> 02:41:10,239
oh yes yeah but it's actually what you

02:41:01,869 --> 02:41:14,260
just arm so we gonna do - see ya soft

02:41:10,239 --> 02:41:17,170
running a bit soft on Oh times oh but

02:41:14,260 --> 02:41:25,600
over here I'll just vvp describe this so

02:41:17,170 --> 02:41:27,819
this is just a non accordion so um this

02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:33,250
is so an accordion it was something that

02:41:27,819 --> 02:41:34,630
you do see fairly frequently and over

02:41:33,250 --> 02:41:36,909
here what is that button like

02:41:34,630 --> 02:41:38,680
unavailable expanded personal

02:41:36,909 --> 02:41:40,869
information so the fact that it's

02:41:38,680 --> 02:41:44,290
expanded its also due to the same reason

02:41:40,869 --> 02:41:47,979
as before it said sorry as a similar

02:41:44,290 --> 02:41:51,399
reason SN R er - expanded equals to drop

02:41:47,979 --> 02:41:55,689
falls attached to this and next when I

02:41:51,399 --> 02:41:59,619
have my focus on this element when I

02:41:55,689 --> 02:42:02,020
press down the down arrow key its it

02:41:59,619 --> 02:42:04,689
billing address button collapses now I'm

02:42:02,020 --> 02:42:06,430
here and I know that this off header is

02:42:04,689 --> 02:42:11,560
collapsed and I can press ENTER to

02:42:06,430 --> 02:42:15,939
visibly open it up yeah and then I can

02:42:11,560 --> 02:42:18,369
sort of V V what's under here so this

02:42:15,939 --> 02:42:20,729
what what I mean by accordion so

02:42:18,369 --> 02:42:23,199
basically the trick the trick to

02:42:20,729 --> 02:42:25,689
implementing the accordion is just to

02:42:23,199 --> 02:42:28,390
descend to the appropriate keyboard

02:42:25,689 --> 02:42:32,680
events to make sure that when visually

02:42:28,390 --> 02:42:35,271
you high you know the section you also

02:42:32,680 --> 02:42:38,480
say that you know that this is

02:42:35,271 --> 02:42:40,940
they collapse to BCC area - expandables

02:42:38,480 --> 02:42:45,381
Falls yeah so that's the trick to doing

02:42:40,940 --> 02:42:50,511
this sometimes hump okay custom which

02:42:45,381 --> 02:42:52,790
isn't too long okay so guys I think we

02:42:50,511 --> 02:42:55,521
are also cognizant of the time we are

02:42:52,790 --> 02:42:57,440
slightly riding over D there there are

02:42:55,521 --> 02:42:59,961
two more custom widgets to go true I

02:42:57,440 --> 02:43:01,400
think we won't go to them now but we

02:42:59,961 --> 02:43:03,591
quite self-explanatory we were shared a

02:43:01,400 --> 02:43:05,931
slice of you and then you can look

02:43:03,591 --> 02:43:10,070
through those so I think we will just

02:43:05,931 --> 02:43:11,690
wrap up today if if you could just help

02:43:10,070 --> 02:43:14,061
us with two things I think the first one

02:43:11,690 --> 02:43:15,740
is potato photographer just left the

02:43:14,061 --> 02:43:19,011
room but when he comes back if you can

02:43:15,740 --> 02:43:22,631
take a photo together and then a second

02:43:19,011 --> 02:43:22,631
one is if you can give us some feedback

02:43:26,740 --> 02:44:04,851
if we can give you some feedback I just

02:43:29,450 --> 02:44:17,320
go to this Facebook page just give us a

02:44:04,851 --> 02:44:17,320
minute just okay this is because

02:44:41,100 --> 02:44:49,000
yeah so if you could just go to this

02:44:45,460 --> 02:44:53,320
Facebook page these abilities how much

02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:59,140
like the page and then the there is a

02:44:53,320 --> 02:45:00,580
link to a feedback form that you know we

02:44:59,140 --> 02:45:03,850
really appreciate you could have us fill

02:45:00,580 --> 02:45:05,800
out so that we can know what we can do

02:45:03,850 --> 02:45:09,640
to improve the next time around so it's

02:45:05,800 --> 02:45:13,300
an edible form this one the the healthy

02:45:09,640 --> 02:45:17,670
perform so yeah if you could just have

02:45:13,300 --> 02:45:20,470
us do that before you leave as well and

02:45:17,670 --> 02:45:22,360
then when the photographer comes back we

02:45:20,470 --> 02:45:25,780
can take a picture you can all get to

02:45:22,360 --> 02:45:28,120

02:45:25,780 --> 02:45:33,570
