Title: Ethereum and Javascript - what's the big deal? - JSConf.Asia 2018
Publication date: 2018-02-20
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	Speakers: 
Dave Appleton @appletondave
Raman Shalupau @ksaitor

Ethereum is the wunderkid of the blockchain space. Decentralised Smart Contracts coupled with web3.js mean that you can integrate your distributed app with your front-end to improve your user experience. 

Requirements: A notebook with chrome would be preferable. Good options to install would be parity and/or metamask as well as the usual tools.

Dave is the lead blockchain developer for HelloGold in Malaysia where he attempts to bring a better means of saving to those not well served by the finance industry. Between raising awareness of phishing attacks and scams, he spents his time as a programmer, hardware engineer and lecturer in Singapore and Malaysia. 

Raman is a full-stack JavaScript consultant by day and entrepreneur by night. He’s been working with such companies like Redmart, Nugget, Cinarra, Smove and Load Impact. Currently he’s fascinated with the world of cryptocurrencies and playing with Solidity and Smart Contracts on Ethereum. He’s also a founder of Crypto Jobs List.

okay welcome so we've all seen these

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,630
wonderful polished presentations this is

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,400
not one of those this is going to be one

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,230
of those will probably fall flat on its

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,090
face will crack a few jokes and pretend

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,380
it never happened that kind of thing

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,380
because it's working

00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:29,910
yes okay so here we go let's try that

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,009
one one more time so you will see those

00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,050
wonderful polished presentations that go

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:39,719
as smooth as clockwork this is not going

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:42,239
to be like that so all right you all you

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,910
guys you you work in the real world and

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,399
do real things right and you all have

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:51,930
insane deadlines and stuff like that yes

00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:56,100
take one step into the cryptocurrency

00:00:51,930 --> 00:01:00,570
world and it gets ten times worse which

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:05,100
is why we will wing it at times but we

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:08,340
will we will do what we can to give you

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:14,610
an idea of what is possibly one of the

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:18,270
most exciting areas in software tech but

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,420
exists today and if you disagree with me

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:25,770
fine you're probably a lot saner than I

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,409
am anyway okay so I will introduce Ramon

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,509
hello everyone that's this guy he is

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,180
young good-looking and then there's me

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:37,290
Dave I am ancient and falling apart

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:41,520
Ramon runs a thing called crypto job a

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,140
list which is a site where if you decide

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,640
that you're foolish enough to want to

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,680
get into this kind of technology go

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,000
there find a job and never look

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,670
back I work for a little company in

00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,850
Malaysia between hello gold we were

00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:02,290
started to try to help people in like

00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,130
the countries of this region in

00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:07,720
particular hedge some of their savings

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:12,490
into something which wasn't quite as

00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:14,500
volatile as the currency right now many

00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:17,140
of you are quite young you may not

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,810
remember 1997 the Asian currency crisis

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:23,080
I started the business two weeks before

00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:26,950
it started because I have got an amazing

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,170
sense of timing in Malaysia people

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:32,560
people who found their savings went down

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:35,650
to 50 percent of the value right in

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,000
Indonesia it was a heck of a lot less

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:40,600
than that in Thailand it was a lot worse

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,860
so it so our CEO was was the former

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,780
chief financial officer of the world

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,880
Gold Council he used to run spider gold

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,060
which is the world's largest gold based

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:52,570
ETF and he is trying to bring that same

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,100
concept to ordinary people because also

00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:56,260
in the countries I've named not like

00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,690
Singapore it's very hard for ordinary

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,120
guys to have access to any kind of

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:03,130
decent investments so that's what we

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,780
exist for to allow people to buy gold

00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:09,090
save gold yeah so if the currency tanks

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:18,459
you've still got something of value

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:23,739
right that being said we are we are we

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:27,910
did Raman created a telegram group the

00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:32,110
solidity workshop on telegram if you if

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:34,360
you had telegram you join into that at

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,880
some point we will ask you to send us

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,739
information and we'll send you back some

00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,500
tests either for various networks and

00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,430
things like that so when you get there

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,640
when we get there

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:48,109
into it right yep so enough of this

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,049
sweet-talking let's get into the

00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:53,329
business so here we go

00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:57,019
what we're going to try to do is theorem

00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:59,659
smart contracts from basically zero to

00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:01,250
deployment in approximately three hours

00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:05,629
because we've wasted the first 30

00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:09,040
minutes waffling on yeah okay here we go

00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:13,159
so the roadmap what are they gonna cover

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,019
hopefully right first one first five

00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:19,180
minutes what's the blockchain all about

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:19,180
who knows what block chains are I

00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:25,400
thought so okay cool

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,380
we're smart contract to come in this is

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,270
like where the theorem is really strong

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,970
something called smart contracts if you

00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,970
haven't heard about them you will soon

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,410
then decentralization and a whole other

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,530
technical stuff you'll see it when we

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:46,599
get to it don't worry about it until we

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:46,599
get that right so

00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:55,000
so

00:04:50,980 --> 00:05:00,870
what we expect you to learn what these

00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:03,610
are in blockchains about a very very

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:11,950
slight roughness which is a programming

00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:13,600
language not much really you know during

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:17,110
this without loads of random things

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,370
which will which part in the notes we're

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,520
going to try and point you to some

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,230
resources one of weeks ago the VR

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:27,940
telegram channel you can ask questions

00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:33,720
we will respond why security is

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:35,620
important possibly a lot more so than in

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,550
anything that you've worked on before

00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:45,160
and the biggest name we've got is that

00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:48,550
you get enough to get you interested to

00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:53,480
find out the next step

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:55,490
that's the important bit because for a

00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,470
lot of people right you take that that

00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:02,140
first baby step takes a lot more courage

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:04,340
through the next big leap right oh it's

00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,960
that thing that you keep putting off

00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,240
once you've got an inkling of what you

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,890
can do with it

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,660
yeah you then start thinking well I

00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,340
better allocate allocate a bit more time

00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:17,300
so that's where we're going

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,410
so basics of a blockchain in five

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,720
minutes

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,180
by the strange sense of time if I get it

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,570
wrong don't hold me to it right

00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:30,470
a blockchain is a load of sign of

00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:32,450
transactions stuffed into blocks which

00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:38,120
are signed and linked to the previous

00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:41,470
block so that everybody agrees that is

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,470
that is correct

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:49,010
that's it

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:54,350
is that five-minute no okay sorry okay

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:54,350
so what's the transaction well

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:10,729
there you go that's a transaction from

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,460
me to Rahman I send him a coffee and I'd

00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:14,810
say oh I tell him why I'm doing it

00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,699
because otherwise I'm you might fall

00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:23,330
asleep right fair enough

00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:26,750
I've got coffee okay so assuming that he

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,250
doesn't drink the bloody coffee yeah at

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,870
the end of the day he's got one coffee

00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,440
earth one coffee more I've got one

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:35,660
coffee left and we keep on doing this

00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,070
meeting and everything right and at the

00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,539
end of the day we all know how much

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,419
coffee he reveals he's got long as we

00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:43,070
start at the beginning we probably have

00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,740
to have a transaction make the coffee in

00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:52,130
there somewhere but these are these are

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:56,110
transactions right um so yeah but this

00:07:52,130 --> 00:08:01,539
is like an accounting ledger yes

00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:05,590
so what's the big deal well the big deal

00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:08,830
is that but what the first big deal is

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:12,270
that that sounds actually is signed so

00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,270
do you know what digital signatures are

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:20,360
I see look

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,950
okay let's have someone shout out no no

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,510
there we go so you learn all these new

00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,130
signatures are you know our hash

00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,990
functions are though don't you because

00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:30,380
you never store passwords in the claim

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:33,500
in the plane you store an md5 hash or or

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:36,950
a char whatever hash or ever yes yeah

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:40,160
yes good right so if I take a hash of

00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,830
that piece of data assuming I've got a

00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,340
good hash function nobody can miss with

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:49,520
the data right so now I've got something

00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,930
that's foolproof right except for the

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,540
fact that if you wanted to change the

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:56,600
data you change the hash as well so that

00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,370
still is it was still reliable yes so it

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:04,370
still doesn't work so the next thing you

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:06,710
do is okay so but otherwise if you

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,390
couldn't mess with the hash the Hat

00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:10,280
would prove the validity of the data

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,550
right because you can recompute the hash

00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:20,840
on the data the data is valid yes

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:22,430
right um so yeah because I I give you

00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,560
the piece of data and the hash you

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:25,400
recompute the how to do for to match yes

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,270
wonderful

00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:33,200
right so the second part is we encrypt

00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:35,900
the hash with the sender's private key

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,910
do you know what encryption is kinda

00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,650
right you know what public key private

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,400
key is it's the thing behind all the SS

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,720
ssh technology and that sort of stuff

00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,020
it's allowing the complicated

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,880
mathematics i take a piece of data i do

00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:53,270
a mathematical transformation with it

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:57,380
with one random number from that random

00:09:53,270 --> 00:10:00,440
number i can derive a second number that

00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,080
you can use to decrypt it which I can

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,850
tell anybody has a proper public key or

00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,870
you can encrypt it with a public key and

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:10,930
I can read it with a private key

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:14,230
right so in this case if I encrypt the

00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:17,649
hash with my private key and I'd let you

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:19,930
know what my public key is I in this

00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,880
case it will be the sender right because

00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:25,019
I've used my address which is my public

00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,550
key so if I say it from my public key

00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,740
and I encrypt it with my private key

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:34,779
anyone can check that transaction is

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:38,620
valid right because my public key is

00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:40,959
part of the message in plain text right

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:45,130
so you can see my public to my public

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,680
key you can decrypt the encrypted hash

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,870
to get the correct hash and you can

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,029
prove that the decrypted hash matches

00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,880
the hash that you would compute for the

00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:58,029
data that's the digital signature there

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,540
is no magic to it and when we talk about

00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:02,709
crypto currencies and all that stuff

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,529
it's the only place that could the

00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:08,140
cryptography takes place anywhere in

00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:08,890
anything but the most advanced

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,529
blockchain

00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:13,449
right so it's all about digital

00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:17,589
signatures if that goes over your head

00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:20,769
read about it a bit otherwise I won't

00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:22,690
have the five minutes but that's the

00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:24,459
very basics right otherwise think of it

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:28,690
as a signature but it means that the

00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:36,450
nobody nobody can forge a transaction

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:39,450
from me and there we go page two

00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:41,310
right we stick em in blocks at least it

00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,589
new blocks well I just assembled them

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:46,310
into some kind of an array type

00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:50,730
structure some kind of a database record

00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:53,010
and I who put that block together for

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:56,100
the link to the previous block that I

00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:57,570
signed the block and if you put one

00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,540
together you do the same thing you sign

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:03,959
the block so we know who did it

00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:07,050
right so that if if you have got this

00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:09,120
block you can go to the previous block

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,139
check the previous block is where they

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,490
go to the previous block and so on this

00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:16,110
there's a little bit more complicated

00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,690
stuff she does actually have to

00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:23,699
re-evaluate the whole block chain right

00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:27,649
but from this and that block you can

00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:27,649
until the entire block chain is valid

00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:35,149
in a manner which everybody agrees upon

00:12:31,629 --> 00:12:37,369
and I'm sure you've heard things about

00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,089
how one blockchain transaction costs

00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:40,339
about person

00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:42,799
costs about as much as it does to heat

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:46,040
the entire United States for a couple of

00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:48,100
hours or something like that right the

00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,299
block the block check the blockchain

00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:54,350
consumers about as much as the state of

00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:57,169
Denmark or something like that um I'm

00:12:54,350 --> 00:13:03,649
gonna skip that right the method for

00:12:57,169 --> 00:13:05,119
having the consensus is let's call it

00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:07,040
magic for a minute because I think it's

00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:11,089
not important for where we coming from

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:14,059
but the technology is there so that the

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:16,639
entire members yeah everybody all the

00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:20,419
nodes on the blockchain agree that the

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,899
same chain is a valid so that if you put

00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:24,859
on one block you put on another block

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:25,910
all right you both try and have

00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:28,040
something to the blockchain

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:31,309
there is a means of arbitration to

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,949
decide which one is valid and then you

00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:38,809
try again to get the next block right so

00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:41,679
now we have a I'm sorry Mike I'm walking

00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:41,679
around I'm making your life difficult

00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:52,579
okay so now we have a means of ensuring

00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:54,980
that our ledger is consistent agreed by

00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:57,019
everybody

00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,980
now once we have a ledger the degree

00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:01,550
buyers won't even know how much

00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:05,329
everybody's got right there blockchain

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:09,050
five minutes what's that yeah yeah

00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:10,459
that's your five minutes cool okay so

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,079
we're the smart contract to come into

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:15,850
this because that's the bit that makes

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:19,910
aetherium worth doing right

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:22,160
because what I've just discussed is kind

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:25,160
of like the technology between bit

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:31,160
behind ripple from Bitcoin and all these

00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:35,779
other things right we're really all that

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:40,910
you are talking about is a ledger system

00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:43,339
that is storing value right bitcoins and

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:47,329
face it's not a real Bitcoin bitcoin is

00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:51,170
out there in me so what's the difference

00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:55,220
ethereal well let's have another look um

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:57,860
I said I'm silly ramen of coffee because

00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,940
otherwise he might fall asleep he

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,310
doesn't drink coffee

00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,690
he's one of these new freedoms I suppose

00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:04,490
most of you this newbie the pro

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,610
Montgomery don't think coffee never

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:14,630
months now so that is a whole load of

00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:16,820
bytes right it's a data field and those

00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,860
among you who have had more fun in

00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:22,040
program who think but hang on it's a

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,019
data field we can do something with that

00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,079
right because that's what you do you

00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:29,750
right yeah I mean an HTML webpage is

00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:31,790
only a piece of data but a web browser

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:38,509
interprets it and does something fancy

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:40,279
right and so on so yeah maybe we could

00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:45,279
do something with that like interpret it

00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:52,399
as byte code that's the thought right

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:55,100
now once we got to that we we started

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,529
aetherium where we said okay if i send a

00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,420
transaction to you or you or you or you

00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:04,000
it's a transaction to one of you people

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:06,230
normal but what happens if I send it to

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,709
address zero that the address that

00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:12,759
nobody can actually own then what it

00:16:09,709 --> 00:16:16,550
does is it takes my it takes that data

00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:18,709
and it stores it and it says and it

00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,630
gives it an address and says anyone can

00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:22,730
send anything they like to this now and

00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:26,209
you have what's called a smart

00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:31,190
contractors although the bytes but if

00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:33,550
theorem has a virtual machine right much

00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,550
like

00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:40,059
which basically is interprets the

00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:42,379
bytecode right so yeah but you know you

00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:45,939
you will use virtual machines you know

00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:48,110
I'm talking about right I mean typical

00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:51,189
interpreter virtual machines out there

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:54,350
will be like microsoft.net framework

00:16:51,189 --> 00:17:01,429
Java compiles down to byte codes we see

00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:03,199
what makes it portable right so um once

00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:06,709
you've done that you have a smart

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:10,699
contract now a smart contract you can

00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:13,339
send things to your smart contract you

00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:17,779
can send instructions to your smart

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:20,569
contract you can send value right so I

00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:24,289
mentioned before the Bitcoin you know

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:26,270
it's just a value right so I send you

00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:28,459
point 1 of a Bitcoin or something like

00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,179
that you can send half a Bitcoin to

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:32,360
someone else

00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:34,840
II thought also of etherium also has is

00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:38,990
own native currency which is either

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:44,649
that's how you send at the value but you

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:47,750
can also send messages in the data so

00:17:44,649 --> 00:17:50,059
the first thing we talked about was me

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,399
putting a contract out there in code

00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:55,190
with which a program encoded in the bike

00:17:52,399 --> 00:18:00,470
in the data the next thing I can also do

00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:03,279
is send parameters send you know like a

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:06,309
rest a rest call where you where you put

00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:09,940
what the contract address would be the

00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:13,429
www dot and then you've got the path

00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,409
which becomes the method name you're

00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:19,580
trying to call in the contract and after

00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:21,500
that you encode the data right so we

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,299
could weaken we can specify which

00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,840
function we want to call and we can send

00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:25,840
it parameter

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:34,270
yeah go go for it um now code on the

00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,770
blockchain can be seen by anybody so

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,530
yeah if you've been happily setting up

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,270
an ojs server you're used to the fact

00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:45,320
that nobody can see your code unless you

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:48,050
publish it on github write code on the

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:52,630
blockchain everything on the blockchain

00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:55,870
name can be seen by anybody

00:18:52,630 --> 00:19:00,050
what if anybody knows what they're doing

00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:02,240
um so if I publish I mean the first step

00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:08,300
is I can publish when I publish a

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:10,940
contract a fantastic little thing called

00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,560
a blocking Stora ether scan would allow

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,000
you to see the creation of the contract

00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:21,890
it's saying it will say this is the code

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,050
which is not that fantastic but I mean

00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,220
that is the source code of a contract I

00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,100
thought remember which one but that's

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,590
the source code of a contract right that

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,790
gets submitted it becomes a contract and

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:38,480
you can send transactions to it and

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:40,100
people who communicate with it oh sorry

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,120
yeah you can verify the source code of

00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:48,590
course because once you put it on the

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:50,930
blockchain ethos can allow you to upload

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,790
the source code which it compiles with

00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:55,310
the same versus the compiler and it

00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,440
makes sure that the output matches the

00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:00,440
code that you sent if it does they

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:06,550
publish the source code so now anyone

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:06,550
can see your source code this is a token

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:14,980
and it's on the blockchain somewhere and

00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:17,140
if you interact with it using a block

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:24,330
Explorer you can see every single

00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:27,690
interaction with that contract there is

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:32,500
no privacy on the hood chain right

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:34,300
unless you build it in so I mean of

00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,390
course you can put the encrypted data on

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:39,250
there which only other people who knows

00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,070
how to unencrypted it will be able to

00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:44,470
get hold of but people can see that you

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:47,800
put it there they can see who put it

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:50,230
there right so these are transactions on

00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:52,210
the blockchain it tells you they've got

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,970
block numbers you've got when they were

00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:57,090
posted who they're from who it was sent

00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,090
to

00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,080
well we don't how am i doing for time

00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:08,490
okay get I still got a few minutes left

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:08,490
yeah good address tactic okay so

00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:21,789
people refer to blockchain environments

00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:26,260
as decentralized crustless you built on

00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:29,120
odious application right everybody has

00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:32,180
to trust you

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,370
right if you do an online banking

00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,810
application they probably has to trust

00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,270
that it works that it's not going to

00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:40,040
steal your funds

00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:42,770
nobody can verify it unless you give

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,360
them access to the source code and since

00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:45,920
they can't see in your source code the C

00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,380
inside of your server they also have to

00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,790
trust that the source code you given

00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:55,760
them is the same source code you've

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:58,370
currently deployed on the blockchain you

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,570
can see exactly what's been deployed you

00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:05,840
can see every single transaction it is

00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:08,540
designed to create systems where people

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:13,700
can interact because they know what they

00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:15,410
are interacting with they know how so I

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,800
can see your source code I can see your

00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:20,900
contract if I want to I can get someone

00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,030
to audit that contract for me to prove

00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,640
that it but it actually does what it

00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,270
says it does and then I can interact

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,090
with it

00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:33,580
of course normally I would trust your

00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:39,260
contract is okay sometimes they're not

00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:43,000
right so what is more to the point where

00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,000
is that contract on the blockchain

00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:50,040
whereabouts geographically because like

00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:52,080
yo you've got yours of an OG a server in

00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,970
an Amazon Center somewhere which will

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,930
they trust they're looking after somehow

00:22:53,970 --> 00:23:01,770
right right we trust that all of the

00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:06,270
services we use will not go down might

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:12,270
get lab yeah well I did something less

00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:14,490
than that anyway so the point is that

00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:16,770
you have central points of failure no

00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:19,800
matter how hard you try you have central

00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:24,120
points of failure right unless you have

00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:26,720
ridiculous amounts of resources if I

00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:31,350
deploy contacts the blockchain it is on

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:34,430
every single node of the Bob train so

00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:39,690
it's on this computer here it's on

00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:44,640
computers in Kansas Indonesia and Mexico

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:47,550
and Hawaiians pick a country yes right

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:52,500
it's all over the places on thousands if

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:56,820
not millions of nodes by now it's

00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:59,370
auditable if you want interact with my

00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:01,350
contract you don't talk to my server

00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,790
anymore you talk talk to a server to a

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,400
server near you you talk to your own

00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:07,800
notebook your notebook communicates all

00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,710
the other ones it says this is what I

00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,710
intend to do and as long as it's it's a

00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:16,970
it's a legal thing to do it will get

00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:16,970
shared amongst all the other nodes

00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:32,250
now there are multiple reasons for doing

00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,140
blockchain I have the Long Island to

00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:36,990
blockchain company know one of them is

00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,220
to make your company sexy for investors

00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:39,660
even though you do nothing to do with

00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:44,040
the blockchain so people throw money at

00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:46,620
you but since we're all technical people

00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:53,940
we walk away from such things of course

00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:57,360
we do it because it's fun so multiple

00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:59,760
actors multiple people involved in it

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:04,679
who do not necessarily want to have to

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,990
thrust each other or who where yeah

00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,460
where it's easy if everything's out

00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:12,840
there so everything could be audited

00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:16,890
without any problems right some

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:20,040
conflicting interests right so it would

00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:22,770
be no yeah there's no point say Zul and

00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,450
me setting up something to take your

00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,059
money and say we would give you

00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:29,420
something in return if someone I best

00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,420
buddies

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,920
so but then if we've got a few other

00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:40,380
people involved so luck in the case of

00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,510
Heather gold with you know obviously

00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:46,770
there's us there's our voting age of

00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:50,460
dealing with the gold we allow you to

00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:53,040
pledge your gold to take loans because

00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,870
also we find that like in Malaysia 75%

00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,600
of all loans get rejected so we say if

00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:00,480
you've managed to save some gold you can

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,960
use it against the luck as collateral

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,690
for a loan right so we've got the loan

00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,820
and for the loan party we've got digital

00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:12,000
wallets that we work with like Cellcom

00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,530
IX er - one of the largest regional

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,170
telecommunication we've got lots of

00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:19,530
people involved in our system now so we

00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:27,180
have multiple actors some proof lifting

00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:30,150
interests right so for us you know if

00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:32,370
you know it's it's good for us to get

00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:34,860
everybody having loads of proved but of

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:37,770
course a on credit want to make sure

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,230
that the people have got enough gold and

00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,340
it can be locked up until they learn to

00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,010
pay it off right so there's a

00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,240
conflicting interest there and of course

00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,410
there have to be some common goals

00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,410
otherwise nobody's going to use it

00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:57,799
so that is my a sensible reason for

00:26:56,330 --> 00:27:00,529
doing it if there's only one person

00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:03,619
involved in it if you are going to be

00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:05,929
saving records for your own personal use

00:27:03,619 --> 00:27:10,639
you can't see how anybody else would be

00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:11,899
interested in it and even if they are

00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:14,889
you could just stick it up in a blog

00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:16,389
post there's no point doing a blog chain

00:27:14,889 --> 00:27:19,070
okay

00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:24,070
if only one person ever interacts with

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:24,070
it it's a database right

00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,519
[Music]

00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:40,119
so now we've got this bytecode and

00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:43,779
nobody-nobody there may be four or five

00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:48,669
people out there who are even further

00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:51,129
off into the land of traces than I am so

00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:53,590
very few people right right you know

00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:57,220
right pure bytecode very few people

00:27:53,590 --> 00:28:00,820
right assembler they all use a language

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:04,779
of these the languages are solidity

00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:07,179
which is inspired by JavaScript serpent

00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:08,739
was something which came from Python

00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:12,070
which they've now getting rid of because

00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:17,190
it was hard to make it secure viper is

00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:19,330
something which is new and unstable lll

00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:21,129
lots of people who got their different

00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,509
names for it low-level language lovely

00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:25,690
the floor anguish I don't know what it

00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:28,330
stands for not many people use it people

00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:30,519
can use assembler the etherium virtual

00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:35,049
machine is a stack machine most people

00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:38,940
use solidity which as I say is inspired

00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:42,850
by JavaScript but you should get you all

00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:45,210
taking a pretty big sigh of relief right

00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:48,399
because you've all got an advantage here

00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:56,760
okay so we're going to talk about

00:28:48,399 --> 00:29:01,850
solidity solidity is used to

00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:06,990
write programs or write contracts

00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:13,470
contracts are a little bit like objects

00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:18,720
as in object inheritance C++ or Java

00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:20,760
type thing right I hope most of us have

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,130
been into other areas

00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:26,030
I believe that JavaScript doesn't have

00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:28,230
objects quite like that does it

00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,390
you'll have to correct me here sorry I

00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:38,309
have done JavaScript a few times over

00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:39,929
the years but my mind has moved on it is

00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:42,179
close enough good right so think of it

00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:44,400
like a class right so it contracts a bit

00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,150
like class it has a constructor we got

00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,120
constructors

00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:50,900
yeah causing your constructor parameters

00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:53,220
you've got functions that do things

00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:56,100
you've got functions that don't do

00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,429
things they just tell you something yeah

00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,750
like yeah what's the price of tea today

00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:04,320
nope you don't actually change anything

00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:07,980
to get the price it to you just right

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:12,510
we have persistent state data which you

00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:15,809
must have right I'm sure if anybody can

00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:18,240
if if I'm saying something and you can

00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:21,090
think of the right word in JavaScript to

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,090
describe it shout it out right so what's

00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:24,910
the state data for a class in in

00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:27,999
JavaScript

00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,999
[Music]

00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:33,120
yeah I said some I have two functions

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,740
someone calls the first box and they

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,660
change something when the second

00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:40,590
function actually can still see that

00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:44,220
change data or do you call that instance

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:46,890
data yeah okay so state state state data

00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:48,600
is instance data in JavaScript right and

00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:52,950
of course you've got local variables and

00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:57,240
things which get thrown away the moment

00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:59,040
you leave the functions we can also talk

00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,690
from one contract to another just like

00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,260
you can have one one object called

00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:06,990
another object bingo so it's a language

00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:09,570
that's not entirely unlike JavaScript

00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:14,310
and if I show you that you say to

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:17,400
yourself this is JavaScript right yeah

00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:21,440
yeah good

00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:24,450
if I talk rubbish you can throw things

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:28,170
if you can't hear me tell me the talker

00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:30,300
Oh like a few minutes Q&A are you guys

00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:32,070
following questions so far there have

00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,620
been a few questions in chat yeah yeah

00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:40,830
let's leave let's leave the caveat page

00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:43,860
shall we telegram it's Kenny go it's

00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:47,460
like t dot me slash selenium workshop

00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:55,970
that's uh let's back it up yeah I go all

00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:55,970
the way but okay yeah there you go okay

00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:06,360
that's coming real soon

00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:11,160
yeah um anybody else got anything before

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:13,590
I know come on come on guys this is not

00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,790
a thing of all classroom isn't it any

00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:16,080
question this probably could not make

00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:18,120
any sense at all

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,720
we will now trying to find exactly where

00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:23,550
I was so where were you were well you

00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,770
guys managed to get to the telegram

00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:27,770
group shall we get a few min one minutes

00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:36,840
okay yeah so we're gonna get into it

00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:39,210
very very now just after like I just

00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:43,500
after this page here right so as you can

00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:48,390
see solidity is exactly like JavaScript

00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:49,770
right except a conscious yeah actually I

00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:53,610
forgot that so you come there should be

00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:56,760
a semicolon there's quite yeah right um

00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:59,400
I didn't test it I nobody test my code I

00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,690
didn't test out very sorry okay except

00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,950
for the fact that

00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:05,929
okay contracts well we know about

00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:10,190
contracts contracts alert classes that's

00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:13,450
their gas that's the fun one when you

00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:18,590
interact with anything on the blockchain

00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:21,340
to change anything on the blockchain you

00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,340
have to pay for it

00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:29,170
because blockchain is stored stored on

00:33:27,309 --> 00:33:31,170
muscle computers across the network

00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:33,940
there are computers making there are

00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:36,520
people out there making sure that a

00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:41,080
network but the blockchain stays

00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:42,910
consistent and they're all doing a lot

00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,450
of work to do that and they get paid for

00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:47,559
it

00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:50,050
so if you want to interact with a conch

00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:53,140
with a contract in such a way that it

00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:56,770
changes anything whether it's just me

00:33:53,140 --> 00:34:00,340
sending ether to somebody or whether it

00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:01,929
is me changing of changing data before

00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,500
something like that

00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:07,570
have to pay for it because it goes into

00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,399
my local no my local node shares it

00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:11,020
across the entire thousands and

00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:13,960
thousands of nodes and they all agree

00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:16,780
and say yep that's vital all they say no

00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,270
you can't do that so you have to pay for

00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,639
it you pay for it in ether and it's

00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:27,129
called gas how much you pay for

00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:32,200
transaction depends upon number one how

00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:35,050
much work is involved some things take

00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:37,869
more computing power than others or more

00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:39,190
storage space so you pay more if you're

00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:41,560
going to use a lot of storage space you

00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:46,619
pay more if you've got like a lot of

00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:48,369
computation and the second thing is an

00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:53,200
incentivization thing where you actually

00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:55,000
decide how much you want to pay per unit

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,760
of gas

00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,560
now you do that because if you're

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,680
putting a transaction out there someone

00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:05,710
has to mine it and the person who mines

00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,690
it gets paid the transaction fees but if

00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:11,080
you're prepared to pay more you can get

00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:13,390
priority right so you pay for every

00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,020
transaction the types are a bit

00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,599
different

00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:21,340
we don't have integers all the most

00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:27,390
common things in a theorem are addresses

00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:31,060
which is 256 bit value and a 256 bit

00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:32,970
unsigned integer yeah I don't believe

00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,770
they even have signed integers do they

00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:40,020
or if they do I've never seen anybody

00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:44,950
using them Eric the chief currency is a

00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:49,150
256 bit unsigned integer how about

00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:52,680
floating points well for floating point

00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:56,320
numbers are usually dealt with as two

00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:59,560
unfitted six bit unsigned integers where

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:03,910
the last 18 decimal points are regarded

00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:05,560
as fractions right they are talking

00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:07,630
about at some point they might have

00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:11,220
fixed point numbers just for fun sorry

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,220
Mike right

00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:19,810
every transaction if it succeeds can

00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:23,230
create and I can interact with events to

00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:25,030
log information that you can see it

00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:26,380
normally if you do something it's the

00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:29,260
only way you can find out what goes on

00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:32,440
you make a log or you can examine the

00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:34,060
state of the contract oh I did mention

00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,960
when you interact with a contract there

00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,630
is the other thing you could do you

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,930
could yes I say if you if you want to

00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:42,370
know the value of something you want to

00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:46,960
do something that does not involve

00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:49,660
changing state you don't need to query

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:55,060
the whole network you can only you can

00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:56,850
query a local node that is free right

00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:59,820
you don't have to pay to make a query

00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:03,040
you only have to pay to change things

00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:04,810
because your node should be in exactly

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:10,090
the same state as everybody else is mode

00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:12,970
so you can query the state a state

00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:18,970
memory like this the persistent memory

00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:21,180
cost money in yes right recursion not

00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:24,230
advisable

00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:26,250
all right we all know that you know all

00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:28,589
programmers have won't have any fun

00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:32,130
start thinking about recursion please

00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:34,230
not in not in solidity this only God is

00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,089
only got a limited stack size to start

00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:39,930
with maybe you can speed up for this

00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:42,119
section of this okay okay this section

00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:43,410
you're quite right yeah so there are a

00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:46,770
whole lot of other things a lot of it's

00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:48,240
about okay the key ones you have to

00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:50,940
specify if your contracts going to

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,520
receive ether the contract the can't

00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:54,839
that you do not specify to receive ether

00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:00,260
there's something says ether to it it

00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:02,279
will be will reject it what else ASCII

00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:04,890
okay this is probably this is probably

00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:06,420
the best one here multiple values you

00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:08,700
can return multiple values can you do

00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,880
that in JavaScript the function returns

00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:16,349
two values oh we got that okay fine it

00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:19,349
is all right and you can throw the last

00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:22,410
very important thing you can at any

00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:25,920
point in the execution of a function the

00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:30,450
function can say if this happens roll

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,279
back roll back the entire transaction so

00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:34,680
it doesn't matter what's happened to how

00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:39,000
how much information has changed up to

00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:42,480
this point if something happens throw it

00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:47,069
all away do not change anything right so

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:50,549
that you do you have a require or assert

00:38:47,069 --> 00:38:54,270
or either do a revert yeah okay let's go

00:38:50,549 --> 00:38:56,579
where are we okay so things required for

00:38:54,270 --> 00:39:00,599
a contract the first line of your

00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:02,910
contract will say that it will specify

00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:06,029
the solidity version you're using it has

00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:08,430
to be above a certain version right the

00:39:06,029 --> 00:39:11,339
latest version so far is four zero point

00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:13,770
four point 19 so if I put that as my top

00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:16,260
line I can't use an older compiler to

00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:20,549
build it you can have includes we know

00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:22,650
about includes right you you specify the

00:39:20,549 --> 00:39:25,230
contract like specifying your class you

00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:26,700
just you you do your state variables we

00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:31,170
have modifiers now modify

00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:34,710
fun modifiers are conditions that are

00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:37,619
required to execute a function so only

00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:41,160
the owner of the contract can execute

00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:45,660
this or you can only execute this if

00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:47,869
it's after January the 26th things like

00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,869
that

00:39:50,640 --> 00:40:04,710
I mean oh sorry about that we should be

00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:06,509
on silent imagine it's on silent well

00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,769
look at well look at the rest I think

00:40:06,509 --> 00:40:13,140
well I think we have most of the things

00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:18,079
in the next few lines right now at this

00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:21,059
point I'm going to take you through

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:22,319
writing a very simple contract or at

00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:26,910
least I'm not going to get you to write

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:32,069
it I'm going to get you to copy it if

00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:36,630
you look at on github gist s-- there is

00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:43,259
a contract called buy gold under golden

00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:49,880
Dave on if you load that way and you go

00:40:43,259 --> 00:40:54,539
to and you you open a browser tab

00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:56,960
another tab preferably to remix etherion

00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:56,960
double

00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:01,360
I shared the link in the if you're in

00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:07,270
chat life is cool

00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:12,760
pretty cute now if you do that you have

00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:15,750
an interactive environment for messing

00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,750
around with contracts and

00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:23,100
it allows you so what I'm suggesting

00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:26,670
that you do is you create a new tab in

00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:29,220
remix you copy the code from the gist

00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:32,480
and stick it in there and then we can

00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,480
all be on the same kind of page

00:41:36,810 --> 00:41:42,490
right so I'm not going to talk about all

00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:45,130
of this all of this contract because I

00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:47,560
actually got to two contracts there one

00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:51,730
talks to the other I'm not going to talk

00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:55,690
about using the second one just the

00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:59,140
first one that you can play with it so

00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:01,810
this the second contract is designed to

00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:08,650
interact with the first round that's all

00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:10,060
I'm going to say that are we the

00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:12,460
information is anything in the thing

00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:22,390
right yeah okay so if we can go to the

00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:26,710
next page then right now what a remix is

00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:29,620
designed to not only work in an

00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:33,460
interactive mode it can also talk to the

00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:36,460
blockchain using something called web 3j

00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:39,240
s which Roman has promised me it's going

00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:39,240
to tell you about later

00:42:39,819 --> 00:42:44,180
but at the moment we're going to work in

00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:47,240
an emulated environment using the

00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:50,869
JavaScript VM so on the settings page

00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:52,970
you will see is its settings page or the

00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:57,920
sorry on the run page you have the

00:42:52,970 --> 00:43:04,930
environment JavaScript VM and you have

00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:04,930
got about 10 different accounts yes

00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:18,450
what sorry oh sorry okay five accounts

00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:22,140
enough to play with anyway right now use

00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:28,950
the JavaScript VM use the first of those

00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:33,870
accounts and take the con take the

00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:38,010
contract exchange rate and click now

00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:41,850
you've got to give it two addresses here

00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:45,840
all right so I think I'm gonna have to

00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:50,070
get out of my present mode a little bit

00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:53,970
the showing how we doing so far guys any

00:43:50,070 --> 00:44:02,280
questions I did his live one who's going

00:43:53,970 --> 00:44:04,650
to get difficult okay yeah so I just you

00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:11,340
do the talking order the doing you try

00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:12,900
to explain what I'm doing I'm cool so we

00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:14,610
were mixing is like interactive

00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,880
environment where you can interact with

00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,880
your

00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:22,240
that's not what people really use in

00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:23,710
like the day-to-day

00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,390
if you're an engineer anymore solidity

00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,830
engineering work but it's like a really

00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:29,440
nice interactive environment where you

00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:33,340
can like really quickly test ideas and

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,800
maybe debug contracts as well so remix

00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:37,800
the theory of network have everyone

00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:41,050
loaded it racing hands who loaded the

00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,520
this editor in their browser right okay

00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:44,170
excellent excellent okay so you got this

00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,060
tiny plus here you could add a new add a

00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:48,580
new term I'm sure you figure that up by

00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:52,120
now you add a new tab you paste the code

00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:55,270
into this term on the right everyone's

00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:57,310
on that everyone entering the companies

00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:59,680
that need just once you've done it you

00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:02,110
may need to compile it by clicking upon

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:05,020
this button in the compile tab to start

00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:10,120
to compile and if all goes well it says

00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:13,380
says okay groovy we've done it anyone

00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:16,740
having them is it not compiled a felon

00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,740
now compiling

00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:24,270
so can you have a look at the guys whose

00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,270
code is your money yeah it's all good

00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:36,830
yeah that's right it's okay right so we

00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:44,510
go to the run tab there are various

00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:46,250
options here injective web 3 or talking

00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:50,540
to a web 3 provide that music you talk

00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:55,690
to a node on your own computer I can do

00:45:50,540 --> 00:46:02,120
my best to zoom right there we go

00:45:55,690 --> 00:46:04,670
however so you have got source we're

00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,200
going to use the JavaScript VM later on

00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:10,130
Rama's going to talk about using meta

00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,570
masked which would be injected web 3 but

00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:15,740
the world will stick with the JavaScript

00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:18,320
VM do you have got five accounts that

00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:20,180
you can use for sending transactions

00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,520
each of them has got a hundred virtual

00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:25,670
ether that you can pay for things with

00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:28,700
right is that it back there

00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:30,830
prescients so we start with we're gonna

00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:35,030
start with the first count them you just

00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:37,280
cleared that one right so we're going to

00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:40,070
create exchange rates

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:43,760
now what under create is says there are

00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:47,060
two addresses which if I was going to

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:50,240
come over here a bit you will see under

00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:54,010
exchange rate it has address gold source

00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,010
address cache source right

00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:59,760
how am I looking that I could look here

00:46:56,850 --> 00:47:02,190
right sorry ignore me right here we go

00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,660
so I need two addresses so what I'm

00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:08,370
going to do is I'm going to be using

00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:12,510
three of my addresses here I'm going to

00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:14,490
set the second address to be my gold

00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:17,970
source my third address to be my cash

00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:21,110
source right because it wants three

00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:23,710
different accounts to interact with it

00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:26,470
now

00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:29,170
it's a bit finicky it what it wants

00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:32,829
addresses and long numbers to be inside

00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:35,950
quotes so why I normally do that is I

00:47:32,829 --> 00:47:38,559
put my quotes in the first I'm thinking

00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:42,910
to put in the third one which is that

00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:46,150
you can just copy the address you can

00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:50,109
paste it in you go back

00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:55,630
you choose your second address you copy

00:47:50,109 --> 00:47:58,829
that you paste that in right so I've got

00:47:55,630 --> 00:48:05,260
two different addresses these of 0 X 1 4

00:47:58,829 --> 00:48:10,569
4 B right okay then I click the Create

00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:12,940
button it can it creates the object for

00:48:10,569 --> 00:48:15,400
me so basically what do you when you hit

00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:19,240
a create button right are you guys there

00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:21,579
no okay so it leads to creates contact

00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:24,790
within a DM within a in-memory

00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:28,059
JavaScript VM that compiles letters into

00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:30,010
bytecode and this thing is what do you

00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:31,420
see in this area is just like interfaces

00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:34,599
that he can interact with with the

00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:36,549
contract is just like a nice UI that fur

00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:39,010
makes provides you with later on we're

00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:40,450
gonna go into like I mean just just like

00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:44,349
some line text and I'm gonna show you

00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:47,530
guys like you know you'll be able to

00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:52,240
build the UI yourself and it's all gonna

00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:55,089
make sense right so you can exam

00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,980
variables the gold source this was the

00:48:55,089 --> 00:49:01,059
address I created it this was the

00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:03,920
address I put in the first one 0 1 4 you

00:49:01,059 --> 00:49:07,980
can see the catch sauce down there

00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,210
hey yeah okay you can see the two two

00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:12,000
variables I put it in the constructor

00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:13,560
the gold sauce and the cash sauce if you

00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,840
just click on these two buttons and it

00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:19,560
reveals the value so the blue buttons

00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:23,040
are either looking at the value of a

00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:26,930
variable or it is calling a constant

00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,930
function that changes nothing

00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:46,609
all variables in solidity are

00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:51,260
initialized to false or zero now

00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:51,260
depending upon what the type is right

00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:56,609
go price in here let's give it let's

00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:59,549
have a look at some of the code for a

00:49:56,609 --> 00:50:01,020
minute we'll go back to this in terms of

00:49:59,549 --> 00:50:05,010
what I was saying the first line tells

00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:09,740
it the tells it that we are contract in

00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:15,619
solidity compile it with 419 or higher

00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:18,630
the second line declares the contract

00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:20,910
you can have inheritance as I've said

00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:25,290
before in which case you say exchange

00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:29,150
rate is something else but if you're

00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:32,490
interested you'll find that out right I

00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:37,579
have got two addresses which are public

00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:37,579
gold source and cash source now

00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:44,200
the important thing about this is that

00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:46,400
all public variables have getters

00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:49,060
created for them

00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:52,640
all right so you can read those values

00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:55,400
so when you're talking from one function

00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,570
to another you never actually interact

00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,430
with the variable you're in turn

00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:05,660
interact with the automatically created

00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:06,770
getter right ah I have got two maps okay

00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:10,480
let me tell you what I'm trying to do

00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:15,170
here after we've launched the contract

00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:17,270
so this is just an example from the kind

00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:19,160
of stuff I do because I played this with

00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:21,470
the stuff I'm familiar with right so

00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:23,630
have a gold buy their gold in Singapore

00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:25,880
from bullion star international they're

00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:29,360
on North Bridge Road there there are a

00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:32,840
decent voting agent rent what we're

00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:35,270
selling in Malaysia so I've got two

00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:38,240
things that affect the price of my gold

00:51:35,270 --> 00:51:41,240
I've got the price I paid in Singapore

00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:43,370
dollars and I've got the exchange rate

00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:45,340
between Singapore dollars and Malaysian

00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:48,550
Ringgit

00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:51,380
we've just opened an office in Thailand

00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:53,060
which in the course of the next few

00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,790
months will be rolling out the product

00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:58,370
into Thailand so now I'm going to need

00:51:55,790 --> 00:52:00,590
to have the exchange rate from of the

00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:05,300
price of gold in Malaysian Ringgit and

00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:07,850
in Thai Baht this is designed to allow

00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:11,530
me to put in the two pieces of

00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:15,110
information from two different sources

00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:16,640
right from the fellow who who's checking

00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:18,560
up the international exchange rates and

00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:24,650
the fellow who is putting in the gold

00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:28,460
prices right so I have gone so the first

00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:30,770
the first two lines gold source of cash

00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:32,870
source these are the people that I'm

00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:36,460
going to authorised put in those

00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:40,730
transactions because I don't want you

00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:44,410
putting in the fact that gold is $1 a

00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:48,140
kilo and they put me buying gold

00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:52,250
right I mean I know I mean that that's

00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:54,050
me and similarly for the person putting

00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:57,140
in the exchange rates we don't want you

00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:58,460
putting in that there are you know that

00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:00,800
one Malaysian Ringgit

00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:02,270
is worth 5,000 Singapore dollars that

00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:06,400
would have the same effect you get cheap

00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:06,400
gold right um

00:53:08,279 --> 00:53:19,119
so okay so I'm gonna have because there

00:53:17,289 --> 00:53:21,700
are multiple currencies I use a mapping

00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:24,999
now a mapping isn't associated array you

00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:28,450
know what they are right so I can use

00:53:24,999 --> 00:53:31,509
like my R for malaysian ringgit to give

00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:33,910
me one value in the array right other

00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:37,059
terms are an associative array and the

00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:40,390
same thing would be cash ready which we

00:53:37,059 --> 00:53:43,589
see I'm simply using to say that that

00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:45,759
value has actually been set and is valid

00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:49,119
because I don't want you trying to do a

00:53:45,759 --> 00:53:51,970
transaction with a currency that hasn't

00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:54,359
been set I could have done structures

00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:54,359
but

00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:03,310
I didn't okay so when we created it we

00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:05,170
had the constructor I passed in gold

00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:06,870
sauce underscore cash sauce underscore

00:54:05,170 --> 00:54:09,640
which I put into those two values

00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:14,770
because I did that you can click on the

00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:17,170
blue buttons and see those values we've

00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:20,890
got a function called set gold price

00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:24,190
which is a public function anybody can

00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:25,990
call it which doesn't sound right

00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:29,710
because I just said only the gold sauce

00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:32,890
can call it right but the second line

00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:34,510
says require message sender equals gold

00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:37,570
is equal to the gold source so if

00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:40,570
anybody else does call it the second

00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:44,470
line will cause that transaction to

00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:47,080
revert meaning it will stop execution

00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:52,110
any changes that you might have made

00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:52,110
which in this case will be unwell

00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:58,700
if you get past that hurdle you set the

00:54:56,240 --> 00:55:01,330
gold price and you set the flag saying

00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:03,740
that that the gold price is now valid

00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:06,020
because I don't want anybody calling the

00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:09,290
contract until both the gold price is

00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:16,240
valid and their currency exchange rate

00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:16,240
is valid for the cash rate

00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:25,900
well the the center has to be the cash

00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:27,490
sauce same thing right the gold person

00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:30,460
can't set the cash price they cash

00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:32,080
exchange rate and I said I set the rate

00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:35,230
which would be for malaysian ringgit

00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:38,830
about three alright so i make entry

00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:42,400
number the entry of my are in there to

00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:46,510
the three and i said cash ready to true

00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:49,860
which means now you can talk you can get

00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:49,860
a malaysian ringing exchange rate

00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:59,490
and then we have the function to get the

00:55:54,180 --> 00:56:03,150
cold gold price now this one's a little

00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:08,720
bit different it says public anybody can

00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:14,010
call it it is view now a view means it

00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:17,130
accesses state variables but it does not

00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:20,580
change anything so it's a constant

00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:22,500
function now a constant function as I

00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:25,440
mentioned earlier you can call it from

00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:27,150
any node in the network you do not need

00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,440
to communicate anything to any other

00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:32,930
node in the network to know that you

00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,930
call it therefore it's a free call

00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:41,849
it's still hot

00:56:38,890 --> 00:56:41,849
these are amazing

00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:50,290
made in Malaysia lovely coffee okay

00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:53,710
right so here if cash ready currency

00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:55,990
return right now what does that actually

00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:57,520
do well it does is is the bit you can't

00:56:55,990 --> 00:57:01,150
see which is the right hand side it

00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:04,780
returns the price and okay flank the

00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:06,070
price is before before you change it

00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:12,540
it's initialized to 0

00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:12,540
the okay flag is initialized to false so

00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:21,010
become so if the cap if you have never

00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:23,200
initialized the exchange rate it just

00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:27,820
returns which means it will return with

00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:30,130
okay being false if the gold is not

00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:36,010
ready it will also return so okay will

00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:40,390
be false otherwise price equals cash

00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:43,050
rates times currency divided by one even

00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:45,400
but how am I talking about in there

00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:47,020
well obviously yet the bit where you

00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:50,740
multiply the cash rate by the currency

00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:53,740
right by the gold price so three

00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:55,960
Malaysian Ringgit times 50 Singapore

00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:58,690
that's right three bring it to the Singh

00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:02,410
dollar times fifty Singh dollars to a

00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:06,310
gram I can give you a hundred and fifty

00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:08,670
bring it to a gram what is the / one

00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:08,670
ether

00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:16,049
no it wasn't a rhetorical question what

00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,049
is the one if they're doing that

00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:24,240
Oh nope nope nope

00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:30,960
anybody know the exchange rate from from

00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:30,960
malaysian ringgit to Singapore dollars

00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:38,120
so I can you shout that one out that

00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:38,120
sounded good three-point what

00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:47,060
two point seventy two point nine eight

00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:48,530
three point zero seven yeah Bobby it

00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:50,900
stays that it's got decimal points in

00:58:48,530 --> 00:58:54,410
there somewhere right what is the price

00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:59,570
of gold one gram of gold is Singapore

00:58:54,410 --> 00:59:01,490
dollars no idea it's put in ayan like it

00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:03,680
used to be about fifty point three to

00:59:01,490 --> 00:59:06,410
seven o'clock we got decimal places in

00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:11,390
there hungry guys how do we represent

00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:14,380
numbers in aetherium because both

00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:16,790
numbers are multiplied by 10 to the 18

00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:19,160
right so if it's 50 dollars the actual

00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:23,360
number there's 50 times 10 to the 18 the

00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:25,220
exchange rate is 3 times 10 to the 18 so

00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,510
if you multiply two numbers both of

00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:29,180
which to the whole number multiplied by

00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:32,630
10 to the 18 you can I have to divide by

00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:36,040
10 to the 18 to normalize it back to a

00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:36,040
number with 18 decimal places

00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:44,630
yes no maybe right because if I put

00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:46,490
hundred to represent one so I want to

00:59:44,630 --> 00:59:49,460
put one point one it's a hundred times a

00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:51,140
hundred which is one with four zeros

00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,700
after it so I have to take off two zeros

00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:55,609
afterwards to make it equal back to

00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:58,220
equal one wouldn't ya bingo so that's

00:59:55,609 --> 01:00:00,849
why I'm dividing by one Aoife and at the

00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:06,400
end of that I say okay equals true so

01:00:00,849 --> 01:00:06,400
that when I return we know it's valid

01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:12,270
does that work for you cool no

01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:20,950
because one ether is one ether is one

01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:23,599
followed by 18 decimal places

01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:25,339
yeah sorry said one ether is or one

01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,680
ether is just like everything else it's

01:00:25,339 --> 01:00:29,089
one with 18 decimal places so it's just

01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:33,950
a convenient way of saying well and

01:00:29,089 --> 01:00:34,310
followed by 18 zeroes okay so there we

01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:35,960
go

01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:40,220
I have a function that gets the gold

01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:44,359
price and if we are incredibly lucky it

01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:46,510
might work it ought to work it worked

01:00:44,359 --> 01:00:48,680
when I was sitting in the car parked

01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:49,819
waiting for Saul to get back to his

01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:50,569
hotel because he'd been off the

01:00:49,819 --> 01:00:56,030
sightseeing

01:00:50,569 --> 01:00:58,700
oh by the way sorry I did I introduced

01:00:56,030 --> 01:01:01,430
stool at the back so is my colleague

01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:04,220
from hello gold now now go look at it

01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:07,670
but can you please all join me and say

01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:11,000
just one thing dissolve happy birthdays

01:01:07,670 --> 01:01:18,020
all thank you

01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:20,450
right okay good right so we've done that

01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:23,599
we've done that ah what's the gold price

01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:26,210
for the type I'll be done type out

01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:27,579
what's the gold price to tie box let's

01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:29,890
have a look

01:01:27,579 --> 01:01:36,630
T

01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:43,560
H B first the quotes get the gold price

01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:45,910
s okay is it because I never said the I

01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,320
never actually upset anything for the

01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:50,860
minute okay

01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:52,390
so let's set some values here and I'm

01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,440
going to be incredibly lazy we're going

01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:56,470
to chip we're going to choose those

01:01:53,440 --> 01:02:00,160
things that I really went up with so the

01:01:56,470 --> 01:02:07,120
gold price is going to be 50 followed by

01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:12,910
18 zeros which I always do is 1 2 3 4 5

01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:14,440
6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 put

01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:16,840
in the quotes because it's a big number

01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:19,330
and for some reason they like big

01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:21,870
numbers in quotes take out all the

01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:21,870
spaces

01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:34,360
yeah last one and what's the gold price

01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:40,030
at the moment gold price is zero set the

01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:41,400
gold price and it says you've got all of

01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:44,490
this all of this

01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:47,200
hang on somewhere on the left-hand side

01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:49,450
look at it in a minute it's it kind of

01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:50,770
it kind of succeeded but you can prove

01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:55,640
it succeeded because you can check the

01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:58,230
gold price right

01:02:55,640 --> 01:03:01,770
till now I've set the gold price in this

01:02:58,230 --> 01:03:03,810
thing and every single nose on the

01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:05,850
ethereal Network if this was a live

01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:15,210
contract would know that the gold price

01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:22,350
is 50 and I could set the exchange rate

01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:30,150
for Malaysian Ringgit as my double quote

01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:36,600
there 2 3 also followed by 18 digits 1 2

01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:40,620
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18

01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:43,890
followed by its quote we call set cash

01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:50,030
rate for Malaysian Ringgit and what did

01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:50,030
it say it said I did something wrong ah

01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:56,460
and the reason it is something wrong was

01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:58,470
I sent it from the wrong from the wrong

01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:00,600
account because up here are the accounts

01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:04,710
I sleep I consent from I need to be

01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:08,700
sending from the cash sauce which is the

01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:11,070
one with four being which is there so it

01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:12,540
says here that the transaction failed if

01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:17,580
I try to send exactly the same

01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:20,700
transaction from that account if I'm

01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:22,370
very lucky you said it succeeded and

01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:24,890
[Music]

01:04:22,370 --> 01:04:29,680
if I ask it for the time-bar price it

01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:32,600
will say failed if I ask it for the

01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:35,930
Malaysian Ringgit price if I am

01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:37,660
incredibly lucky it will tell me the

01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:43,600
price is fifteen

01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:49,730
bring it hundred and fifty bring it

01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:55,070
round of gold right now that is an

01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:59,120
insanely simple example and that would

01:04:55,070 --> 01:05:02,140
be just a very small part of a big hole

01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:02,140
that you put together

01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:07,150
sorry zoom which bit

01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:14,350
the rock this side

01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:14,350
zoomy yeah okay why not

01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:18,349
oh yeah

01:05:20,990 --> 01:05:23,680
come on

01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:29,440
decided that you wanted

01:05:31,099 --> 01:05:35,910
so in the sermon is a possum eyes do you

01:05:34,589 --> 01:05:40,760
think that plus or minus doesn't I think

01:05:35,910 --> 01:05:46,299
no I doubt it that's just it does I

01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:49,499
would do that you have the wrong side

01:05:46,299 --> 01:05:52,029
what I do love you you just making sure

01:05:49,499 --> 01:05:53,499
he knows that it's okay gets do that

01:05:52,029 --> 01:05:55,660
comes back yes

01:05:53,499 --> 01:05:58,359
take that back up and forget it let's

01:05:55,660 --> 01:06:08,319
just do that yeah there you go

01:05:58,359 --> 01:06:16,809
is that okay unfortunately they don't

01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:19,719
make these draggable so we have looks in

01:06:16,809 --> 01:06:20,799
here using some of the principal things

01:06:19,719 --> 01:06:24,039
that are important

01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:25,479
the first one is controlling permissions

01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:28,559
by the address from which the

01:06:25,479 --> 01:06:28,559
transaction is sent

01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:36,770
[Music]

01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:40,900
the second one is the various data types

01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:45,130
including the associative array right is

01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:45,130
basically it's a sparse array

01:06:45,619 --> 01:06:48,799
you've got max you've got max in

01:06:47,329 --> 01:06:50,530
JavaScript how many it's the same thing

01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:55,140
right

01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:55,140
[Music]

01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,000
success

01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:17,460
[Music]

01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:19,560
there are any questions at this point I

01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:23,550
think a few people are still playing

01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:25,619
with it the great thing about this

01:07:23,550 --> 01:07:28,680
environment is it's just like jsfiddle

01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:32,000
you can change something you can you can

01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:32,000
see the results instantly

01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:38,070
one thing that one thing I've noticed is

01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:41,369
a lot of people only make what is

01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:43,440
absolutely necessary public I tend to

01:07:41,369 --> 01:07:46,590
make everything possible public because

01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:50,250
it because you never know when you're

01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:53,250
gonna have to debug something right you

01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:55,040
can always work out what the variable

01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:57,660
should be so there's no point hiding it

01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:00,530
just make it public so that's there and

01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:00,530
you can see it clearly

01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:09,620
all right so how are we doing with that

01:08:06,630 --> 01:08:09,620
is everybody happy

01:08:10,869 --> 01:08:15,500
so what exactly the difference there why

01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:22,009
would anybody you put something as my

01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:23,989
missiles Wow you put functions private

01:08:22,009 --> 01:08:27,380
it's very essential to the function

01:08:23,989 --> 01:08:29,900
private the moment you put something on

01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:33,770
the on the network which holds data

01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:35,810
which is important the holds ether you

01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:39,460
have to have private functions otherwise

01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:39,460
people you get in there and they get

01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:55,250
inside yes in my view is not terribly

01:08:53,989 --> 01:08:59,150
necessary unless you're absolutely

01:08:55,250 --> 01:09:02,029
confident everything works well if you

01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:04,009
are if you know if you've got something

01:09:02,029 --> 01:09:06,380
to fully debug for everything else yeah

01:09:04,009 --> 01:09:07,940
you can set things to private just

01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:09,859
because it makes the interface clearer

01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:11,450
yeah because you can see on the right

01:09:09,859 --> 01:09:13,520
hand side I've got everything listed

01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:16,870
there you don't want it classify rubbish

01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:16,870
with 500 different variables

01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:22,099
okay so are we ready to move on from

01:09:21,239 --> 01:09:24,330
there

01:09:22,099 --> 01:09:29,279
Ramon should be nervous just know it's

01:09:24,330 --> 01:09:30,690
up to him okay it's doing something so

01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,750
do you have any other questions at this

01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:32,750
point

01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:38,230
we do get a special special plane and

01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,230
more

01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:49,799
okay pick toasts obviously at this point

01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:52,290
I've got something we could Mickey Mouse

01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:56,159
right and you say well why would I do it

01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:57,780
on a centralized server the first thing

01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:01,710
is my or my systems Republic in the

01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:03,659
orders of all and I want to have as I

01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:05,489
say the different actors who don't I

01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:07,230
don't need to give them special access

01:10:05,489 --> 01:10:09,210
to a particular server they can all

01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:10,710
interact directly with their own local

01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:15,810
nodes but it gives them gives them

01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:17,969
access to the contracting so the one was

01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:20,820
when you want massive adoption you don't

01:10:17,969 --> 01:10:22,739
want people having client or you can

01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:25,530
have a web client but the web client can

01:10:22,739 --> 01:10:28,530
talk directly to the net without even

01:10:25,530 --> 01:10:33,420
having a back end which is where web 3js

01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:35,429
comes in and that is like with web a

01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:38,940
very brief heads up on it before we

01:10:35,429 --> 01:10:42,480
start web 3j s is a way to do all of

01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:47,310
your interaction including signing of

01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:51,060
transactions inside your browser right

01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:54,869
and the only time it leaves your browser

01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:57,389
is as a science transaction and it goes

01:10:54,869 --> 01:11:02,610
it goes either into your local goes on

01:10:57,389 --> 01:11:04,920
your machine or through an HTTP but it

01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:07,260
just puts the site transaction into the

01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:11,770
transaction right

01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:14,350
now I'm quite sure that you have heard

01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:17,890
like for example about yeah I see it the

01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:19,810
ICO initial coin offerings the ways that

01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:23,320
one of the ways that startups are

01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:26,530
raising huge amounts of money to you

01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:30,340
know to develop products with that is

01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:32,230
done on the blockchain people send ether

01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:34,780
to the contract they get something

01:11:32,230 --> 01:11:36,850
called a token the token is just a value

01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:38,350
in an associative array basically with

01:11:36,850 --> 01:11:40,990
function to allow you to transfer those

01:11:38,350 --> 01:11:43,800
tokens back so you could sell your

01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:43,800
tokens and stuff

01:11:44,679 --> 01:11:49,059
yeah how're you doing Ramon I think it's

01:11:48,039 --> 01:11:50,860
helping people so he doesn't have to

01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:56,650
come up and do the next can contact me

01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:58,840
up okay now here's the fun bit yes can

01:11:56,650 --> 01:12:02,860
you update a couple contract once it has

01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:08,650
been launched from what I've said so far

01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:13,510
what do you think the answer is no kind

01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:15,099
of no you can replace them at least you

01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:18,909
can't replace it you can put in another

01:12:15,099 --> 01:12:21,219
one so if I have this contract with a

01:12:18,909 --> 01:12:24,099
pointer to the contract I'm supposed to

01:12:21,219 --> 01:12:26,709
use so the first contract becomes like

01:12:24,099 --> 01:12:30,130
the portal you can then change the

01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:31,780
second-level contracts I can make it so

01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:34,900
that a contract can be stopped from

01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:37,479
working altogether one of the things up

01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:41,189
there is self-destruct I can actually

01:12:37,479 --> 01:12:44,229
remove a contract from the blockchain

01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:47,760
completely by issuing a self-destruct

01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:50,019
functionally but I cannot change

01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:56,019
anything that has been written onto the

01:12:50,019 --> 01:13:00,219
blockchain which makes the company who

01:12:56,019 --> 01:13:03,849
put name email address and other

01:13:00,219 --> 01:13:06,219
information of their clients onto the

01:13:03,849 --> 01:13:10,119
blockchain as they registered them in

01:13:06,219 --> 01:13:11,889
plain text rather irresponsible because

01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:13,850
that information is going to be there

01:13:11,889 --> 01:13:16,850
forever

01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:20,540
yeah so you can have you can upgrade

01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:22,760
contracts if you build it in but you

01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:26,570
have to design it because the old

01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:30,080
contract will always be there so if you

01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:31,460
were to look for example okay if you

01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:33,560
have a contract where somebody made a

01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:44,620
mistake at sending wrong information to

01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:44,620
it it's always there so

01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:50,140
[Music]

01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:53,260
because I haven't put any beer to me but

01:14:51,130 --> 01:14:55,330
if I had put an event in there you call

01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:57,219
an event it looks like a function but

01:14:55,330 --> 01:15:01,030
it's the instead of saying function says

01:14:57,219 --> 01:15:04,239
events when you call that the only thing

01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:06,790
it does is write a log that gets stored

01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:09,300
with the transaction call if the

01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:13,920
transaction succeeds

01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:13,920
you can have code written in Java

01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:56,820
machine then if you do that is in that

01:15:54,489 --> 01:15:56,820
time

01:17:15,090 --> 01:17:30,489
right information point I'm going to

01:17:25,989 --> 01:17:32,980
leave it because I think if you think

01:17:30,489 --> 01:17:37,119
there's something interesting you might

01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:39,329
stop taking the Jaime as with everything

01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:39,329
else

01:17:39,710 --> 01:17:52,330
right and then she doesn't write

01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:52,330
information this is dango right no yeah

01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:02,300
hey guys Dan support everyone's forming

01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:03,140
having success certain level of success

01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:05,660
failure

01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:12,590
who's compiled everything and everything

01:18:05,660 --> 01:18:14,989
works for them okay okay who's having a

01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:18,650
problems with I think creating a

01:18:14,989 --> 01:18:21,290
contract or setting values always

01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:22,880
confused about they how okay disclaimer

01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:24,230
like everything's here is very confusing

01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:25,160
when I was throwing myself as it was

01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:28,940
like super confusing

01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:29,810
it's okay to be confused so just like

01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:34,090
you know raise your hand and ask

01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:34,090
questions either Oh Krishna are

01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:46,900
I think there was the kind of just need

01:18:43,270 --> 01:18:47,920
to address yeah you just need to

01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:52,960
addresses because the constructor

01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:54,760
functions it takes two addresses you

01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:59,520
want a dress that was able to set these

01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:59,520
cool value than an elevation from you

01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:08,710
okay so the question is what was the

01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:10,570
addresses mean so like what is he room

01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:11,920
will change there are like yeah your

01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:17,890
addresses like the public address the

01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:21,790
tax code it's like a second house or a

01:19:17,890 --> 01:19:27,640
public key and basically you have a

01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:30,610
private key that controls verify that

01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:32,800
you signed this certain transaction a

01:19:30,610 --> 01:19:35,550
certain attraction of watching by

01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:40,840
looking at your public key right so and

01:19:35,550 --> 01:19:42,850
the the address can either mean like a

01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:45,790
private individual basically sort of but

01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:47,290
you can you have a private key to this

01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:49,240
address and you can just find

01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:52,570
transactions like you would a sense of

01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:55,150
if their right to another address or to

01:19:52,570 --> 01:20:01,099
another and context also to have the

01:19:55,150 --> 01:20:04,010
same public practices right one of us

01:20:01,099 --> 01:20:06,500
yeah it's not any kind of superspeeding

01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:09,770
new it's a unique address that responds

01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:12,790
to like a private key so you able to

01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:12,790
train your own private key

01:20:17,409 --> 01:20:23,030
yeah if you lose the private key lose

01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:25,989
access to your to your public key

01:20:23,030 --> 01:20:27,949
biscayne you cannot move your funds

01:20:25,989 --> 01:20:33,949
sorry you had a question you had a

01:20:27,949 --> 01:20:38,540
comments okay confusing not confusing

01:20:33,949 --> 01:20:39,829
what should be explained better yeah

01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:43,340
pair of keys is basically they can

01:20:39,829 --> 01:20:44,900
account when you're in rumors about

01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:46,550
people losing like ton of money on

01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:48,829
Bitcoin or something that actually means

01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:50,989
that this value is filled the air and of

01:20:48,829 --> 01:20:52,699
all chains recording there but it's it's

01:20:50,989 --> 01:20:55,550
you know like it's a streaming it to a

01:20:52,699 --> 01:20:58,070
public that someone lost a private keys

01:20:55,550 --> 01:21:03,139
to so they cannot like move this ether

01:20:58,070 --> 01:21:05,750
or Bitcoin out does it make sense yeah

01:21:03,139 --> 01:21:07,369
sort of like Lisa Connors is a user but

01:21:05,750 --> 01:21:14,500
you can generate the infinite number of

01:21:07,369 --> 01:21:14,500
I think located a number of key pairs

01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:23,380
all right not necessarily that you can

01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:30,640
create an Italian fascism it's just like

01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:32,140
a munching so you so the question is

01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:33,760
like for each contract you generate

01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:37,540
errors so like when you when you publish

01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,890
a contract to a chain whether it's your

01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:43,080
own local Cheney or whether it's

01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:45,310
actually named this area network the

01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:47,920
cactus is being generated for you by the

01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:49,210
by hole denotes I don't remember exactly

01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:50,920
it was supposed to process some quick

01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:54,580
generating this mattress but I think

01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:57,430
it's based on the time and the block

01:21:54,580 --> 01:22:04,930
number and amounts of that block in

01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:08,280
which the contract is being it's unique

01:22:04,930 --> 01:22:10,630
it's saying there is like I'm not a

01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:11,949
cryptographer sciences scientist but

01:22:10,630 --> 01:22:13,840
it's like the probability of collision

01:22:11,949 --> 01:22:15,780
of mattresses is like tending to zero

01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:18,790
like it's pretty impossible

01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:22,300
yeah question of support

01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:23,860
shall we go into technical questions

01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:34,180
yeah I've got a few persons I have

01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:36,540
what's a hat okay question how's it

01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:36,540
coming back

01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:48,640
oh okay like what do you plan to do now

01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:49,240
is they basically ask questions I'm

01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:51,550
gonna run

01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:55,390
that's right now and then I'm gonna do a

01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:57,850
bit more hands-on work and try to link

01:22:55,390 --> 01:23:04,720
it to our experience with JavaScript and

01:22:57,850 --> 01:23:06,880
node that's how good idea okay

01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:09,100
real world of things that people are

01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:11,410
actually doing with something so like

01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:16,480
that's that's gonna somewhat a tricky

01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:18,340
part the most popular thing that

01:23:16,480 --> 01:23:20,560
everyone's crazy about is like icos is

01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:21,970
basically raising a ton of money I'm

01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:26,380
actually a bit bored by that like that

01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:27,850
topic so that's that's one way like you

01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:31,330
see in the talking

01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:34,510
another good use case would be cryptic

01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:41,680
it ease like burning in these cases when

01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:44,230
you have a like multi-party marketplace

01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:45,280
right where participants that in

01:23:44,230 --> 01:23:48,400
marketplace they're not necessarily

01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:51,570
trust the intermediary so for example

01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:51,570
like if you were playing online poker

01:23:56,770 --> 01:24:02,800
so for example if you're playing online

01:23:59,890 --> 01:24:04,750
poker right and I got a poker player but

01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,790
so you playing online poker

01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:09,670
and you kind of you go to this website

01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:11,710
and you're not necessarily like you

01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:13,390
might think like okay this website is

01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:16,000
their business that that probably they

01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:18,310
might have certain business incentive to

01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,050
have their back-end logic playing in

01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:22,510
their favor right so like you you pick

01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:24,180
your cards and you think like okay what

01:24:22,510 --> 01:24:26,620
if they the order of the business

01:24:24,180 --> 01:24:28,840
modified their backing code to have some

01:24:26,620 --> 01:24:31,300
certain like smarten AI that will

01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,370
perform certain logic that there's no

01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:34,960
way or like very low chances of you

01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:37,630
winning right time it doesn't make sense

01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,790
okay and with watching what he can do is

01:24:37,630 --> 01:24:41,880
you can basically have this

01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:44,130
Becca logic II publish it to the network

01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:46,200
and when people interact with with those

01:24:44,130 --> 01:24:47,880
contracts like anyone can review the

01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:49,710
actual source code of what's going on

01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:52,350
behind the scenes and you can exactly

01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:53,670
see like exactly part of it is that you

01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:55,830
actually interact with a real life right

01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:57,330
if you have a one build like a stripe or

01:24:55,830 --> 01:25:02,040
a right to intubation or anything about

01:24:57,330 --> 01:25:05,340
this razor has higher part we've moved

01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:07,050
on with money great so the exciting part

01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:09,960
with with the theorem and will change

01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:17,610
it's like there's no API it's like baked

01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:19,320
in silly yeah

01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:21,630
does it make sense so far so basically

01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:24,690
anyone can go even with ether scan or

01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:27,240
other methods go into contract address

01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:30,660
and see the exact source code of that of

01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:33,930
that contract and you're able to like

01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:35,910
decide for itself whether this code is

01:25:33,930 --> 01:25:37,980
doing something shady or whether it's

01:25:35,910 --> 01:25:40,710
being a legitimate code and just being

01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:43,560
like assigning rewards in a just manner

01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:45,240
to all the participants right so like

01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:48,120
that's just for example if white cryptic

01:25:45,240 --> 01:25:50,490
eighties was like such it um doesn't

01:25:48,120 --> 01:25:52,200
know why it was like a hit but the the

01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:54,690
way words is that you can kind of buy

01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:56,970
and sell those cats and you can be

01:25:54,690 --> 01:25:59,160
assured that like the order of this game

01:25:56,970 --> 01:26:02,460
is not exactly like money bleeding and

01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:03,900
creating duplicates it's the sole story

01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:07,640
the verifiable of all chanting to see

01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:07,640
all transactions apology

01:26:09,139 --> 01:26:18,629
okay that's okay

01:26:12,959 --> 01:26:23,609
what kind of IP then anybody anybody

01:26:18,629 --> 01:26:26,609
anybody can take it very simple you got

01:26:23,609 --> 01:26:29,429
it but once you if it's gonna really go

01:26:26,609 --> 01:26:31,589
you can have offline parts of it but

01:26:29,429 --> 01:26:35,550
anything you put on the blockchain is

01:26:31,589 --> 01:26:38,819
public and okay so you wanted real-world

01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:41,309
cases first one give it give everyone

01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:44,069
okay hello gold we actually had a token

01:26:41,309 --> 01:26:45,959
sale we've made my name pop up as a

01:26:44,069 --> 01:26:48,300
result of that we supported a number of

01:26:45,959 --> 01:26:50,219
people in the community who we felt

01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:51,929
we're doing good work and in the

01:26:50,219 --> 01:26:53,999
etherium community there are a lot of

01:26:51,929 --> 01:26:57,419
people doing good work one of them is

01:26:53,999 --> 01:27:01,079
give it giveth have designed a framework

01:26:57,419 --> 01:27:06,389
for people for charities to raise money

01:27:01,079 --> 01:27:09,059
and for they raise money people

01:27:06,389 --> 01:27:12,119
contribute in the form of ether but they

01:27:09,059 --> 01:27:15,300
have to lock in goes according to

01:27:12,119 --> 01:27:17,909
according to a road map as they achieve

01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:22,919
the goals along those road maps funds

01:27:17,909 --> 01:27:25,800
get released to them the UNHCR I've got

01:27:22,919 --> 01:27:28,439
a private etherium Network which they

01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:33,359
use to channel funds to refugees and

01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:34,829
refugee camps so yeah I mean you know if

01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:37,769
they end up talking to their banks at

01:27:34,829 --> 01:27:40,139
both sites but they they target the

01:27:37,769 --> 01:27:42,809
right person they integrate the

01:27:40,139 --> 01:27:44,909
blockchain technology with iris scanners

01:27:42,809 --> 01:27:48,120
so a refugee in the camp can go

01:27:44,909 --> 01:27:50,610
into designated stores in the camp take

01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:52,980
the goods he wants he scans his iris and

01:27:50,610 --> 01:27:55,290
it registers with the blockchain he has

01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:58,070
received a certain amount of funds to

01:27:55,290 --> 01:27:58,070
pay for those groups

01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:05,550
aetherium yeah but you know most what we

01:28:04,170 --> 01:28:07,980
talk about be the public aetherium

01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:11,130
network JPMorgan has created a version

01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:14,250
of the theorem called quorum which has a

01:28:11,130 --> 01:28:15,989
level of privacy built-in and that they

01:28:14,250 --> 01:28:18,360
are proposing to the enterprise etherium

01:28:15,989 --> 01:28:24,900
alliances one of the technologies for

01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:26,850
interbank record passing fund transfers

01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:29,790
and stuff like that until there is a

01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:31,650
very large very active alliance was

01:28:29,790 --> 01:28:35,550
includes many major banks were

01:28:31,650 --> 01:28:37,830
interested in using etherium as part of

01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:39,360
their structure because obviously you

01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:41,429
know you said to him you get information

01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:44,820
from him and all of that favor yeah

01:28:41,429 --> 01:28:46,739
settlements yet and it multi-source

01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:51,810
people who don't necessarily trust each

01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:54,449
other all protected by private keys yeah

01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:56,489
so if you enter fine and financial the

01:28:54,449 --> 01:28:59,130
other big financial staff banking and

01:28:56,489 --> 01:29:00,210
stuff they are you know like in the past

01:28:59,130 --> 01:29:02,730
they looked at other blockchain

01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:04,430
technology now that theorem seems to be

01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:08,070
the

01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:10,680
good choice cerebellar patient-specific

01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:13,530
so if you're doing a bank we're trading

01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:15,750
on these things it does depend right

01:29:13,530 --> 01:29:17,220
we're nowhere near the right brakes at

01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:21,300
the moment but you have to understand

01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:23,160
aetherium is what four years old and it

01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:26,550
has got some of the brightest minds in

01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:28,260
the business working on it they're there

01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:30,210
they're working on Sharlee and don't

01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:32,790
know what else to do to get the rates up

01:29:30,210 --> 01:29:37,620
I mean do the first target is be able to

01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:41,310
match reason we're nowhere near it but

01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:42,270
how much is it right now it's like it's

01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:47,280
quite as like sometimes you're not

01:29:42,270 --> 01:29:49,320
seventh know but I'm gonna yeah it is

01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:52,500
yeah I still quite is still quite slow I

01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:55,250
mean you know a few thousand today but

01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:55,250
yeah

01:29:55,700 --> 01:30:02,690
I think I'm wrong it's no isn't one of

01:30:00,980 --> 01:30:04,250
those way more than that because I mean

01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:07,070
you can get you can get 300 in the block

01:30:04,250 --> 01:30:09,620
now I seriously can't remember this

01:30:07,070 --> 01:30:18,470
please is always going up draymond Green

01:30:09,620 --> 01:30:28,250
but yeah 700 mm transition cookie okay

01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:31,400
so it's like 1514 800 everybody over a

01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:33,590
thousand certainly yes in its infancy

01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:36,380
but there are lots of technologies being

01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:37,910
evaluated to increase that the first one

01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:40,130
is he was getting rid of getting really

01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:42,740
the proof of what mining which will

01:30:40,130 --> 01:30:45,680
which will speed everything up and then

01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:47,510
sharding various other things i Sakhalin

01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:49,430
i sat in a room with a metallic mushroom

01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:51,050
talking about all of these technologies

01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:53,720
that he anything that he had on the road

01:30:51,050 --> 01:30:57,080
mapping I'm just with one word intent

01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:58,700
yeah mystically right so yeah they're

01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:02,660
you know smart guys are out there

01:30:58,700 --> 01:31:04,280
they're working on it and they have you

01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:04,700
know they have these numbers in their

01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:08,390
sights

01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:11,510
okay are you ready or do you guys want

01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:13,940
to do a tea break or relax for a second

01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:17,510
because we're gonna go intense with a

01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:20,420
lot of more confusing stuff perhaps 15

01:31:17,510 --> 01:31:21,740
minutes break 10 minutes break and we

01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:23,990
can make something go ask more questions

01:31:21,740 --> 01:31:25,460
I want to get a better sense of like of

01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:28,640
the room what are the questions what's

01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:30,380
confusing what's not so yeah please ask

01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:32,150
questions speak out maybe we should like

01:31:30,380 --> 01:31:34,900
to make a few steps back and explain

01:31:32,150 --> 01:31:37,220
some poor things before we go into like

01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:41,180
more harder coordinates

01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:44,630
yeah do 10 minutes and be it's like 15

01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:46,670
15 or mine on the clock like all gonna

01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:51,050
be jumping all over the place and giving

01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:53,090
like examples that lead to right so like

01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:55,340
when people were asking like whether

01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:57,650
contracts can be seen by anyone it's

01:31:55,340 --> 01:32:00,320
like this is like an example of cryptic

01:31:57,650 --> 01:32:01,889
eighties one of their contracts right

01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:05,040
and someone else was asking about

01:32:01,889 --> 01:32:08,420
like whether like what happens when I

01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:10,590
screw up a contract and like how do you

01:32:08,420 --> 01:32:11,850
redeploy it so like the answer is like

01:32:10,590 --> 01:32:13,949
you cannot be employed once you deploy

01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:15,719
the contract it's there forever it's

01:32:13,949 --> 01:32:17,670
gonna have this oh it's sort of there

01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:21,210
forever unless you're self destructive

01:32:17,670 --> 01:32:22,679
which still kind of remain so what's

01:32:21,210 --> 01:32:24,659
more advanced already like you can stuff

01:32:22,679 --> 01:32:26,130
to stock the contract which will make it

01:32:24,659 --> 01:32:29,369
inactive but it's still really kind of

01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:32,610
later you're part of the bull chain so

01:32:29,369 --> 01:32:34,530
someone asked about what happens like

01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:37,500
what to do if you have a complex

01:32:34,530 --> 01:32:40,170
contract and you want to kind of

01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:43,619
minimize the risks of making a bug there

01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:45,270
and you will make up up there and it

01:32:43,619 --> 01:32:47,219
might be varied interests like what

01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:49,560
people do is they will explain a one

01:32:47,219 --> 01:32:51,600
large project into sub contracts and

01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:53,159
likes smaller apps and then deploy them

01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:56,400
independently and they would probably

01:32:53,159 --> 01:32:59,310
have like have a master master contract

01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:03,600
that will link to other smaller

01:32:59,310 --> 01:33:06,210
contracts is that right Dave if you can

01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:07,739
if you can said so here's they also get

01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:09,540
your code or digit this is one of those

01:33:07,739 --> 01:33:11,340
important things if there's any value of

01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:12,600
what you're doing yeah if you're really

01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:14,510
dealing with like real money and like

01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:17,730
for example if the kids are doing with

01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:19,920
just no money here but it's like twenty

01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:22,469
thousand dollars today and like quite a

01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:25,110
lot of tokens but basically you split it

01:33:22,469 --> 01:33:27,780
into smaller contracts and anyone can

01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:29,960
yeah security is very important so if

01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:32,580
you're doing something off like real

01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:34,350
value and dealing with the real money

01:33:32,580 --> 01:33:36,270
and you like advertise it to people and

01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:39,030
you want people to send you there or

01:33:36,270 --> 01:33:40,949
playing with your game or do something

01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:43,860
like make sure your contract is being

01:33:40,949 --> 01:33:46,199
audited by like people who have done it

01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:49,690
before you know what they're doing and

01:33:46,199 --> 01:33:54,030
that make it what is it again

01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:56,460
again and maybe you will be securing

01:33:54,030 --> 01:33:59,770
[Music]

01:33:56,460 --> 01:34:01,000
yeah this is pretty quick I said so like

01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:06,010
for example when we talk about that

01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:07,780
complex our company project very popular

01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:10,030
and people use it to like look at

01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:12,489
transactions and discover what things

01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:13,510
are going on on the blockchain ok Syrian

01:34:12,489 --> 01:34:16,060
watching specifically there is a

01:34:13,510 --> 01:34:19,239
different poaching Explorer or like

01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:23,620
other shades from an era or Bitcoin etc

01:34:19,239 --> 01:34:25,390
and yeah you can basically see all

01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:26,140
transactions that happened to this

01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:27,190
contract

01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:30,940
so like this culture has an address

01:34:27,190 --> 01:34:32,830
right and you can see all the like

01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:35,830
pending transactions that are happening

01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:37,330
right now frog where they usually do it

01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:39,370
if they have if they're sending any

01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:41,199
value so I made you think thing when you

01:34:39,370 --> 01:34:43,330
see that contracts are having that zero

01:34:41,199 --> 01:34:44,770
user sorry there's actually science your

01:34:43,330 --> 01:34:46,660
research it means that probably someone

01:34:44,770 --> 01:34:48,460
is calling a function or but it's having

01:34:46,660 --> 01:34:52,690
a function it's they're not transferring

01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:54,580
the value they just like like maybe

01:34:52,690 --> 01:35:01,750
setting a certain value to it within the

01:34:54,580 --> 01:35:05,260
contract so it can be kind of cryptic

01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:07,720
ease and copy copy basically

01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:10,070
and do you know that someone asked about

01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:10,760
licensing Simon asked about rice and

01:35:10,070 --> 01:35:12,410
said right

01:35:10,760 --> 01:35:15,440
or someone else asked about what happens

01:35:12,410 --> 01:35:18,350
to your property rights okay code right

01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:21,770
so I heard especially than other dude if

01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:22,840
it does like we have work for a serious

01:35:21,770 --> 01:35:25,610
you'd like

01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:27,530
well probably you could license it buddy

01:35:25,610 --> 01:35:29,180
you'll probably impossible to enforce it

01:35:27,530 --> 01:35:31,310
like that it's like your private a

01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:32,780
license but I don't think it's even

01:35:31,310 --> 01:35:36,800
possible to enforce it because it's all

01:35:32,780 --> 01:35:38,360
open in a while if theorem clients

01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:40,670
themselves there were several major

01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:43,600
clients that brought a real nose is like

01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:46,250
death there is a private parts client

01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:50,630
those would mean most of the ones they

01:35:46,250 --> 01:35:55,670
are under GPL license and one of them is

01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:57,290
under less forgiving lessons so yep you

01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:59,710
can call me it's the qualitative it's

01:35:57,290 --> 01:35:59,710
pretty complicated

01:36:04,730 --> 01:36:07,840
okay um

01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:13,080
another thing that we probably did not

01:36:10,500 --> 01:36:14,490
go into detail is I do support to

01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:15,960
understand that there are different

01:36:14,490 --> 01:36:19,020
types of networks right it's like what

01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:20,430
you guys had in women's right I think

01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:23,340
that's cost like a bit of a confusion

01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:25,890
it's so important to understand so we

01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:27,630
have here a link environments at Thomas

01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:31,020
Cooper TM right that means it's like a

01:36:27,630 --> 01:36:33,990
virtual machine of etherium that runs

01:36:31,020 --> 01:36:36,810
within your browser within this

01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:38,400
roommates right and there are other

01:36:36,810 --> 01:36:41,820
networks there is like life etherion

01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:44,790
effort which were like if you go to a

01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:48,930
point market cap quite a market bad

01:36:44,790 --> 01:36:54,630
that's where you will see the value in

01:36:48,930 --> 01:36:56,160
price that's that's kind of value

01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:59,010
derived from make the real effort and

01:36:56,160 --> 01:37:02,790
that's what you see in it does man there

01:36:59,010 --> 01:37:04,890
are like other networks that we're like

01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:08,250
actions do not cost money

01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:12,500
like there is a raphson and they keep

01:37:08,250 --> 01:37:14,640
them off your own node on a real

01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:16,110
ethereal network because actually saved

01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:18,660
a lot of time because they get mind and

01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:22,710
they cost actual real money if you're

01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:28,470
running again the Neo VM it's it's free

01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:33,300
and it's a paradise okay what shall we

01:37:28,470 --> 01:37:35,460
do shall we go and like step by step

01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:38,160
explain this contract a little bit yeah

01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:40,170
race hands up if you want to get more

01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:44,030
understanding of what this means we're

01:37:40,170 --> 01:37:44,030
we're doing here as soon as humans

01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:51,260
the bottom one zone

01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:51,260
okay

01:37:51,640 --> 01:38:05,960
do you guys want to yes and possibly to

01:37:55,400 --> 01:38:07,490
see that what I wanted to do the main

01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:10,550
thing that I was prepared to do is like

01:38:07,490 --> 01:38:16,030
link what you've seen so far

01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:18,140
it relates with more like day-by-day

01:38:16,030 --> 01:38:20,510
coding experience that it would probably

01:38:18,140 --> 01:38:22,570
have expect because you know no one not

01:38:20,510 --> 01:38:26,090
me guys probably coding your JavaScript

01:38:22,570 --> 01:38:30,470
in your job in you know but base 19

01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:35,240
right what do you do is you use you know

01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:37,160
someone sex and they're required a set

01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:39,160
of tools that will help you actually you

01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:41,630
know have a your contracted get and

01:38:39,160 --> 01:38:44,120
compile it and be able to deploy it to

01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:45,250
the test networks to a local network and

01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:48,650
[Music]

01:38:45,250 --> 01:38:50,060
to production network as well right so

01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:52,670
let me go

01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:57,290
someone's asking questions sir no

01:38:52,670 --> 01:38:59,930
missions all right I'll do it it's

01:38:57,290 --> 01:39:01,250
pretty fun traduction around what tools

01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:03,140
are on there outside over two minutes

01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:05,480
and again bringing some like ID where

01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:08,540
you did just I play arrow see me already

01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:09,770
hear me okay excellent where you can

01:39:08,540 --> 01:39:12,680
just play with contracts that like fully

01:39:09,770 --> 01:39:18,380
data really quickly deploy there within

01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:20,330
your local yeah within your browser but

01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:22,310
it's pretty limited so what do you want

01:39:20,330 --> 01:39:27,340
to do is you want to do several things

01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:30,190
first you want to rock a local note

01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:32,960
there is this thing called test our PC

01:39:30,190 --> 01:39:38,720
which is basically a local node that

01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:40,079
will be right on your arrow to this on

01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:44,340
your

01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:49,280
machine you can just do this by npm

01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:49,280
install' test a PC

01:39:58,300 --> 01:40:00,900
No

01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:18,989
okay if they're in the narrow I see this

01:40:15,239 --> 01:40:18,989
button copy paste this and

01:40:20,469 --> 01:40:23,430
worse

01:40:25,750 --> 01:40:32,990
okay so I know you might get confusing

01:40:29,660 --> 01:40:34,160
there are several again there are

01:40:32,990 --> 01:40:36,140
several types of networks right so

01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:38,120
there's the main net where the actual

01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:41,390
real stuff is happening under or you can

01:40:38,120 --> 01:40:44,690
have there's like three public task

01:40:41,390 --> 01:40:46,820
networks and you can run your local

01:40:44,690 --> 01:40:48,110
network which is basically one node that

01:40:46,820 --> 01:40:51,800
is not going to be really connected to

01:40:48,110 --> 01:40:55,180
the Internet and it's really really fast

01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:57,230
right so you leave it to like test your

01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:59,450
contracts really quickly so you can

01:40:57,230 --> 01:41:03,410
install this but I'll going to show you

01:40:59,450 --> 01:41:07,480
a bit more interactive because you know

01:41:03,410 --> 01:41:08,840
if you're on test are these questions

01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:11,770
questions questions

01:41:08,840 --> 01:41:11,770
No

01:41:13,870 --> 01:41:17,140
it's a well

01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:24,630
on Instagram on telegram what about

01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:28,010
can you ask the question or is there a

01:41:24,630 --> 01:41:30,780
question can you also explain

01:41:28,010 --> 01:41:33,329
orchestrating actually can you explain

01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:36,749
if this could be used for this reading

01:41:33,329 --> 01:41:40,010
there actually changes what do you mean

01:41:36,749 --> 01:41:40,010
but which have changes

01:41:42,849 --> 01:41:45,480
right

01:41:50,010 --> 01:41:56,520
if the example that we used can actually

01:41:52,739 --> 01:41:58,650
talk history religion is sort of yet you

01:41:56,520 --> 01:42:01,680
can secure enough if you have enough if

01:41:58,650 --> 01:42:03,570
you have a source of exchange rates that

01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:06,690
everyone in the network every state

01:42:03,570 --> 01:42:09,560
prostitute yeah you can you can

01:42:06,690 --> 01:42:09,560
basically use that

01:42:17,329 --> 01:42:23,570
but in the reason there will be

01:42:20,090 --> 01:42:25,189
reasonable to say that the contract is

01:42:23,570 --> 01:42:27,889
basically like a stateful service they

01:42:25,189 --> 01:42:30,300
don't need to run on any server adjust

01:42:27,889 --> 01:42:36,620
to the blockchain to

01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:38,520
and their questions yeah that's exactly

01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:40,620
that's the fact that every single

01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:42,420
transaction of recording yeah so like

01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:44,400
it's absolutely right except yeah and

01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:56,580
it's everything is public everything's

01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:59,040
recorded everything is you're messing

01:42:56,580 --> 01:43:01,650
around you're near testing things you

01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:02,970
get to a certain point we think heck how

01:43:01,650 --> 01:43:06,090
do I end up with those values

01:43:02,970 --> 01:43:09,500
well um right with a blockchain you can

01:43:06,090 --> 01:43:11,070
replay everything to find out okay so

01:43:09,500 --> 01:43:12,780
everyone installs

01:43:11,070 --> 01:43:14,730
I mean tester PC is one example and

01:43:12,780 --> 01:43:16,680
another one something I'm talking about

01:43:14,730 --> 01:43:19,080
like running a local node this is

01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:22,220
looking to be a preparation for us doing

01:43:19,080 --> 01:43:24,510
a bit more complex stuff another one is

01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:28,770
you can actually if you go to a truffle

01:43:24,510 --> 01:43:30,330
framework we call the base name - this

01:43:28,770 --> 01:43:33,780
is a bit like visual like it's basically

01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:37,170
one thing it runs a tester piece you

01:43:33,780 --> 01:43:38,970
know and just like as some UI you might

01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:40,170
um I know when I use it but it's just

01:43:38,970 --> 01:43:42,360
like I want to use it right now on this

01:43:40,170 --> 01:43:47,430
workshop because it's a bit more visual

01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:48,840
and you can like see what's going on in

01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:50,910
a more entertaining fashion rather than

01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:52,920
just looking at boring logs like this

01:43:50,910 --> 01:43:56,590
because what you see right now is the

01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:59,680
same thing as here so

01:43:56,590 --> 01:43:59,680
[Music]

01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:08,110
so again this is like a test test

01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:10,330
environment that that is just like

01:44:08,110 --> 01:44:13,450
useful intended to use them I use the

01:44:10,330 --> 01:44:16,030
administration so you remember in remix

01:44:13,450 --> 01:44:16,720
when you were asked we should be put in

01:44:16,030 --> 01:44:19,750
accounts right

01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:22,240
those are like test accounts with Conway

01:44:19,750 --> 01:44:25,270
ether in them is just like a for testing

01:44:22,240 --> 01:44:27,370
purposes right unreal Network real if

01:44:25,270 --> 01:44:29,860
your network no one's really gonna give

01:44:27,370 --> 01:44:34,600
you 100 ether for free unless you want

01:44:29,860 --> 01:44:37,510
to pay like okay but on your own one

01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:40,330
node kind of network you can't do

01:44:37,510 --> 01:44:42,490
whatever you want so basically again

01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:44,740
they have all these accounts data set

01:44:42,490 --> 01:44:46,150
mining is happening automatically we

01:44:44,740 --> 01:44:48,280
have blocks right now we have a theorem

01:44:46,150 --> 01:44:50,740
books that are mined transactions your

01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:53,680
transactions and this thing is running

01:44:50,740 --> 01:44:59,530
on your like local server

01:44:53,680 --> 01:45:05,970
RPC server okay so I'm gonna be jumping

01:44:59,530 --> 01:45:08,290
different topics so we covered briefly

01:45:05,970 --> 01:45:09,930
so this is running like everyone's is

01:45:08,290 --> 01:45:13,150
filing this their own got access to

01:45:09,930 --> 01:45:15,400
ganache right everyone still dead I hope

01:45:13,150 --> 01:45:20,550
it's right now so it's pretty useful

01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:23,290
when you're developing another thing is

01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:25,980
like one thing that we didn't mention is

01:45:23,290 --> 01:45:25,980
meet a mask

01:45:26,469 --> 01:45:31,690
Madame s very important piece of

01:45:28,699 --> 01:45:36,550
software it's actually a home plug in

01:45:31,690 --> 01:45:41,300
huh what is this Oh Minnie Mouse Mateo

01:45:36,550 --> 01:45:44,030
so what this thing does is basically I

01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:45,559
think there are several theorem in the

01:45:44,030 --> 01:45:48,530
old browsers out there one of them is

01:45:45,559 --> 01:45:51,739
brave there is a mint mask I think there

01:45:48,530 --> 01:45:54,260
was my farewell that they have a chrome

01:45:51,739 --> 01:45:58,340
chrome session as well so when you

01:45:54,260 --> 01:46:03,679
install it it creates this extension and

01:45:58,340 --> 01:46:05,860
it kind of serves as like you able to

01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:08,809
sign some sections on different networks

01:46:05,860 --> 01:46:11,059
with this extension so for example if I

01:46:08,809 --> 01:46:15,409
go to you theory of maintenance so right

01:46:11,059 --> 01:46:15,800
now I have a certain I don't have any

01:46:15,409 --> 01:46:18,380
either

01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:21,170
I think money grows in annual discipline

01:46:18,380 --> 01:46:23,420
so for mine so I have some this is like

01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:34,749
actual ether only mean that if I want to

01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:37,900
send to someone and there are different

01:46:34,749 --> 01:46:40,309
everyone's a star we can ask right okay

01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:44,869
yeah okay so there's actually actionable

01:46:40,309 --> 01:46:47,960
thing if you have a national Tehran is a

01:46:44,869 --> 01:46:50,300
stolen and if you have a statistical

01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:56,480
you're actually able to connect to your

01:46:50,300 --> 01:47:01,199
local local test RBC environment

01:46:56,480 --> 01:47:03,860
and I have how many sir

01:47:01,199 --> 01:47:03,860
so

01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:10,750
so okay service here's a good example

01:47:07,710 --> 01:47:15,900
that mean actually sends some user phone

01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:15,900
what visit into this account

01:47:24,739 --> 01:47:39,770
how come to me this microphone fixed it

01:47:29,239 --> 01:47:48,260
all wants to okay

01:47:39,770 --> 01:47:49,610
so fantastic wonderful okay so if it's

01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:52,040
confusing raise your hands and ask

01:47:49,610 --> 01:47:55,910
questions so just getting ready an

01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:58,580
example you know it's having so I'm

01:47:55,910 --> 01:48:02,960
gonna use have already imported a you

01:47:58,580 --> 01:48:04,690
can ask and I want to send some you

01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:07,690
Pharaoh from for this account to

01:48:04,690 --> 01:48:07,690
discount

01:48:08,300 --> 01:48:14,429
send the men of our recipient a mammoth

01:48:11,999 --> 01:48:16,109
that's antenna 30 next so this is

01:48:14,429 --> 01:48:17,639
actually a signing process you will you

01:48:16,109 --> 01:48:19,499
forget me doing if you're in development

01:48:17,639 --> 01:48:21,269
going to see in this quite a lot if you

01:48:19,499 --> 01:48:23,309
were interacting real chain that's going

01:48:21,269 --> 01:48:24,570
you can see this quite a lot so you can

01:48:23,309 --> 01:48:26,699
see like this summer it was actually

01:48:24,570 --> 01:48:28,289
this is like final and irreversible but

01:48:26,699 --> 01:48:31,559
we were on private network we just

01:48:28,289 --> 01:48:38,099
connected to to this to be nice and you

01:48:31,559 --> 01:48:39,869
guys admit protection fail I think it go

01:48:38,099 --> 01:48:42,139
because hitting this didn't I do not

01:48:39,869 --> 01:48:42,139
guess

01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:47,760
you see in a dress

01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:50,930
next

01:48:50,940 --> 01:48:53,870
gas price

01:48:53,979 --> 01:49:02,189
I suppose Dino gasps sitting it

01:48:59,409 --> 01:49:02,189
anything

01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:07,770
right now

01:49:04,979 --> 01:49:16,980
oh yeah that one

01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:21,200
yeah what a fight

01:49:16,980 --> 01:49:21,200
no no no it's running on

01:49:27,290 --> 01:49:32,230
I was about to give a nice example

01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:36,380
No

01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:44,870
[Music]

01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:44,870
in this polimedia

01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:50,840
why this day

01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:53,110
the Emerald does not have the correct

01:49:50,840 --> 01:49:53,110
nonce

01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:05,850
you know why might not be working

01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:08,050
well you connection sir I love cold

01:50:05,850 --> 01:50:10,650
another user to look from though you

01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:10,650
didn't know you could

01:50:13,409 --> 01:50:15,800
No

01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:23,770
by 7:00

01:50:26,170 --> 01:50:31,050
the only problem is getting an option

01:50:32,019 --> 01:50:37,960
he's gonna take it

01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:37,960
attraction

01:50:43,030 --> 01:50:46,289
amount of

01:50:53,630 --> 01:50:56,739
[Music]

01:50:57,429 --> 01:50:59,850
the youngest

01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:13,930
anyway I'm sending over

01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:21,010
incoming okay Oh actually I thought it

01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:22,810
was a mean rhasta now I have some ether

01:51:21,010 --> 01:51:24,670
okay I changed to another gentleman

01:51:22,810 --> 01:51:28,060
effort which is like the public public

01:51:24,670 --> 01:51:31,210
test test network called Roxanne and I

01:51:28,060 --> 01:51:36,500
can send some ether okay this one

01:51:31,210 --> 01:51:39,340
different is Easter

01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:39,340
yes

01:51:40,230 --> 01:51:48,960
Oh Spence Ahmed's success okay that's

01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:53,580
good spending at least

01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:56,220
so okay I mean maybe it was confusing

01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:59,070
that I'm using Ralston just like one of

01:51:56,220 --> 01:52:01,540
the tech networks out there it's out

01:51:59,070 --> 01:52:02,780
there to test you can actually get like

01:52:01,540 --> 01:52:06,300
[Music]

01:52:02,780 --> 01:52:08,580
ether is not worth anything really but

01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:11,700
you can just let me example of me

01:52:08,580 --> 01:52:14,090
spending some value between two

01:52:11,700 --> 01:52:17,070
addresses from one address to another

01:52:14,090 --> 01:52:22,800
that is like signed by me to mess on the

01:52:17,070 --> 01:52:25,560
alternate on the adults okay so okay we

01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:28,500
have a ganache installed we have Newton

01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:29,970
s pistol I hope there is kind of more of

01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:32,190
us you guys understanding something

01:52:29,970 --> 01:52:33,660
already too low at certain point there

01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:39,590
and I don't think that I wanted to use

01:52:33,660 --> 01:52:39,590
it to is I started trouble so truffle is

01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:46,749
is the framework that does all the

01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:49,489
containers where it's not around

01:52:46,749 --> 01:52:51,050
chuckle does all the compilation and

01:52:49,489 --> 01:52:56,719
like managing and testing contracts for

01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:58,239
you you're honest everyone's good runs

01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:01,870
good I want to see you guys have

01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:08,020
questions promise I don't

01:53:01,870 --> 01:53:09,850
good now next one in Boston um okay with

01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:15,090
Whittier winter run ganache you don't

01:53:09,850 --> 01:53:18,220
see like test RPC server you copy this

01:53:15,090 --> 01:53:22,060
you open me to mask I need to customer

01:53:18,220 --> 01:53:24,610
be see you at RPC URL and don't forget

01:53:22,060 --> 01:53:26,560
that one two seven zero zero one is

01:53:24,610 --> 01:53:27,850
different from localhost if you're

01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:31,210
running into this issue that's probably

01:53:27,850 --> 01:53:33,660
like it's the only network as compact as

01:53:31,210 --> 01:53:33,660
we're different

01:53:37,500 --> 01:53:42,750
but I had this or Italian stickers

01:53:49,090 --> 01:53:52,050
okay everyone see this

01:53:53,920 --> 01:54:02,790
success is interested in you too busy

01:54:01,989 --> 01:54:05,430
cemetery

01:54:02,790 --> 01:54:06,570
ha well you're running can I assure you

01:54:05,430 --> 01:54:10,470
running like the tester if you see

01:54:06,570 --> 01:54:13,590
something huh yeah see you will see it

01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:15,120
right here you need to you need to

01:54:13,590 --> 01:54:18,480
launch it and you will see which board

01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:20,040
is it running on but I think you call

01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:25,110
those different telegrams people will

01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:28,740
get confused are you guys succeeding in

01:54:25,110 --> 01:54:30,630
this arrow succeeding in this home you

01:54:28,740 --> 01:54:33,240
will get Christmas wishes everyone's

01:54:30,630 --> 01:54:37,130
running problems who is confused got a

01:54:33,240 --> 01:54:37,130
problem or something yes

01:54:37,200 --> 01:54:40,200
so

01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:47,900
oh okay so you know things like you need

01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:51,470
to import account like if you just

01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:53,890
connected a private key and you can go

01:54:51,470 --> 01:54:59,240
in to get out this is the key thing

01:54:53,890 --> 01:55:00,830
Chucky's so this you're breaking sorry

01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:04,280
there was this confusion like you didn't

01:55:00,830 --> 01:55:06,980
you like way to just store a veto mask

01:55:04,280 --> 01:55:08,960
you don't have any you don't have any

01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:10,880
accounts like this I have a talk right

01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:12,710
what are you doing is you do like import

01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:15,440
account and you have an option either JS

01:55:12,710 --> 01:55:18,320
file Oh private key and you can go to

01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:19,520
ganache you do show keys you know what

01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:21,530
have a key

01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:24,980
and then you copy that key and paste it

01:55:21,530 --> 01:55:27,740
in and Colombian account something if I

01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:29,420
connected back to my environment I'm a

01:55:27,740 --> 01:55:31,570
zero it immediately shows that have

01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:34,900
hungry either

01:55:31,570 --> 01:55:34,900
doesn't make sense

01:55:35,439 --> 01:55:39,320
guys in the back are you guys how are

01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:42,559
you like everything's player questions

01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:44,329
okay something's up thumbs down okay

01:55:42,559 --> 01:55:46,869
I'll get no no no someone's having a

01:55:44,329 --> 01:55:49,289
problem what could it be otherwise

01:55:46,869 --> 01:55:51,920
yeah

01:55:49,289 --> 01:55:51,920
yeah

01:55:53,709 --> 01:56:00,389
no no like this okay

01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:20,800
so this is right

01:56:25,960 --> 01:56:30,930
you have to say that

01:56:31,130 --> 01:56:37,320
make sure yeah I know there's like very

01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:39,420
important the security thing guys make

01:56:37,320 --> 01:56:40,410
sure like if you you're gonna have a

01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:44,160
crate right now I look like

01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:46,140
private-public eat pears and the ones

01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:48,330
that are trying to scream like do not

01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:49,680
ever use them in production because if

01:56:48,330 --> 01:56:51,720
you use them into production and someone

01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:55,430
says you really for there it's gonna be

01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:57,680
stolen work like be careful with that

01:56:55,430 --> 01:57:00,850
[Music]

01:56:57,680 --> 01:57:03,959
I'll get there yes

01:57:00,850 --> 01:57:03,959
[Music]

01:57:07,340 --> 01:57:11,740
how do you don't get out you just go to

01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:11,740
Daisy

01:57:13,550 --> 01:57:17,140
in your office if you see

01:57:18,440 --> 01:57:21,010
and

01:57:23,670 --> 01:57:28,780
hello I've got a lot of you guys went to

01:57:25,870 --> 01:57:33,010
Nika nosh hub is go to ganache the

01:57:28,780 --> 01:57:35,140
truffle for style-conscious yeah we just

01:57:33,010 --> 01:57:38,130
don't those yeah where I'm with this

01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:38,130
okay

01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:49,020
yeah and over there is more about gas

01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:49,020
and

01:57:51,050 --> 01:57:58,940
you know more about us and best price

01:57:53,600 --> 01:58:01,820
right so so Oh

01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:04,310
all transactions if you're setting a

01:58:01,820 --> 01:58:06,500
certain stage value in your contract or

01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:11,300
chain they cause gas gas is like of

01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:12,560
arrival that costs either also also in

01:58:11,300 --> 01:58:15,139
support to understand that like ether is

01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:16,610
not the lowest denomination of value on

01:58:15,139 --> 01:58:20,480
if you remember chain like the lowest -

01:58:16,610 --> 01:58:26,690
away and gas it's like it has a variety

01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:29,139
of way so gas price like one gas was the

01:58:26,690 --> 01:58:31,520
unit average there is no gas station

01:58:29,139 --> 01:58:33,560
website that actual toes here like they

01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:36,710
forgot price on your ribbon area network

01:58:33,560 --> 01:58:43,869
and usually like one gas costs I think

01:58:36,710 --> 01:58:43,869
five ways of s Davis different gas price

01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:55,590
you go in I think of it come on yes yeah

01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:57,450
so these are the gases like a varietal

01:58:55,590 --> 01:59:00,420
thing in your local environment you can

01:58:57,450 --> 01:59:03,420
set like gas price to to whatever

01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:06,120
arbitrary number you can set but in real

01:59:03,420 --> 01:59:08,510
production network you just go to the

01:59:06,120 --> 01:59:11,730
you know Google and it will tell you the

01:59:08,510 --> 01:59:14,490
real time gas price and the reason why

01:59:11,730 --> 01:59:17,700
gas price is important if you if you use

01:59:14,490 --> 01:59:19,590
like Mickey Mouse see here when I was

01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:25,220
sending introduction what is signing is

01:59:19,590 --> 01:59:25,220
reflection right okay good

01:59:36,600 --> 01:59:40,200
you said a gas price how much weight but

01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:43,620
this is like only intestine we're living

01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:45,420
and estimate you can run out of gas well

01:59:43,620 --> 01:59:47,400
it's a kid intersection like the looks

01:59:45,420 --> 01:59:49,290
of action it's not gonna go through it's

01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:51,239
gonna get reverted and your gas gonna

01:59:49,290 --> 01:59:55,140
get then it's not gonna get burnt but is

01:59:51,239 --> 01:59:55,680
just gonna get converted as well okay so

01:59:55,140 --> 01:59:57,239
far

01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:58,830
Helene should we get further questions

01:59:57,239 --> 02:00:04,380
questions questions intro speaker

01:59:58,830 --> 02:00:06,810
Irma's 30 things if you go to official

02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:17,850
website you also have a competition

02:00:06,810 --> 02:00:21,120
about how much is one way okay so so we

02:00:17,850 --> 02:00:29,160
get maintenance that back we played

02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:33,930
around with with rivets and chocolate is

02:00:29,160 --> 02:00:35,370
like the real deal it's like what what

02:00:33,930 --> 02:00:37,170
you will actually be like Kim committee

02:00:35,370 --> 02:00:41,360
excited say right just just for the

02:00:37,170 --> 02:00:41,360
reference to resin on the framework bark

02:00:45,489 --> 02:00:51,739
that's another alternative but I'm not

02:00:49,280 --> 02:00:56,270
gonna go into it but it has sexy stuff

02:00:51,739 --> 02:01:05,270
with IDF s a ton of other things

02:00:56,270 --> 02:01:06,710
yeah but build a round with a bar it's

02:01:05,270 --> 02:01:08,960
so basically what if what I'm talking

02:01:06,710 --> 02:01:12,980
about right now I'm showing you the mark

02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:14,869
and truffled those are like they're

02:01:12,980 --> 02:01:17,360
building JavaScript but those they're

02:01:14,869 --> 02:01:19,670
the frameworks so kind of like a you

02:01:17,360 --> 02:01:21,349
know like you know like rails in Ruby on

02:01:19,670 --> 02:01:23,599
Rails thing it's like that environment

02:01:21,349 --> 02:01:25,909
and the set of tools that abstract

02:01:23,599 --> 02:01:28,789
common things for you they basically

02:01:25,909 --> 02:01:30,860
glue testing environment they glue mocha

02:01:28,789 --> 02:01:32,960
to your tests so you can actually test

02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:36,199
your solidity contracts in JavaScript

02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:39,170
policy right and you can just run a few

02:01:36,199 --> 02:01:40,880
functioning your console like I don't

02:01:39,170 --> 02:01:45,909
know like let me give an example of some

02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:50,599
other like things that I have I can do

02:01:45,909 --> 02:01:53,360
truffle test and it's gonna deploy I'm

02:01:50,599 --> 02:01:55,809
jumping forward a lot it's failed no

02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:55,809
actually

02:02:02,489 --> 02:02:08,280
yeah so Sammy didn't expert person so

02:02:06,810 --> 02:02:08,940
those are the framework something for

02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:11,760
your homework

02:02:08,940 --> 02:02:15,500
daddy can explore them we can look into

02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:19,110
trouble right now and again it's like a

02:02:15,500 --> 02:02:21,780
set of tools to help you test the boy

02:02:19,110 --> 02:02:33,510
keep track of contracts when you come at

02:02:21,780 --> 02:02:39,980
them and you professional yeah so I hope

02:02:33,510 --> 02:02:39,980
by now everyone's got trouble it's all

02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:49,160
ok bye Cody thing's not gonna work came

02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:49,160
from me now about that were confused

02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:55,670
[Music]

02:02:51,940 --> 02:03:03,230
- I didn't ask - did that question that

02:02:55,670 --> 02:03:04,340
Oxford how good it was this did that get

02:03:03,230 --> 02:03:07,760
Oxford is that clear now

02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:12,610
I got no on the small opening I assume

02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:12,610
science gate sounds yesterday's good

02:03:20,530 --> 02:03:23,530
ha

02:03:28,090 --> 02:03:33,240
yeah good question I wish

02:03:38,750 --> 02:03:44,710
like how do I achieve all I'm gonna take

02:03:42,530 --> 02:03:44,710
forever

02:04:00,690 --> 02:04:05,350
do you guys want to do like a contract

02:04:03,490 --> 02:04:17,620
from scratch the principle or they want

02:04:05,350 --> 02:04:27,310
to continue as with already a different

02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:30,210
button can be okay I will try to do a

02:04:27,310 --> 02:04:30,210
contract from scratch

02:04:31,710 --> 02:04:38,940
so the okay he just made some great a

02:04:35,620 --> 02:04:38,940
new directory

02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:45,719
jazz conf

02:04:49,550 --> 02:04:52,630
just get ya

02:04:56,320 --> 02:05:02,639
no one can see my career and I'm doing

02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:02,639
trouble in it

02:05:09,280 --> 02:05:13,140
ooh oh

02:05:13,590 --> 02:05:16,640
[Music]

02:05:20,490 --> 02:05:26,990
truffle in it so I got down why is this

02:05:27,650 --> 02:05:35,730
my spring for some reasons so the weird

02:05:33,660 --> 02:05:37,020
thing about truffle I'm not sure why

02:05:35,730 --> 02:05:39,150
they haven't fixed it when he did

02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:40,260
trouble in it it creates any project in

02:05:39,150 --> 02:05:41,730
your current directory it does not

02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:43,410
create a new directory so you need to

02:05:41,730 --> 02:05:45,900
create a directory first but just on a

02:05:43,410 --> 02:05:50,130
salinity CD into that directory ad pad

02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:52,230
and only there do you top that I have no

02:05:50,130 --> 02:05:59,820
business I missing something because it

02:05:52,230 --> 02:06:05,570
doesn't mean okay okay basis someone

02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:05,570
help I Drive a hairdresser

02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:16,530
and then neighbors gonna copy out

02:06:11,970 --> 02:06:19,830
shoes yeah okay cool so just grate the

02:06:16,530 --> 02:06:21,780
chocolate at what it did you can see

02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:23,700
here anything cool you can see a few

02:06:21,780 --> 02:06:27,630
things contracts migrations test topic

02:06:23,700 --> 02:06:31,020
on take a couple GS right and if you

02:06:27,630 --> 02:06:35,300
allow me I'll just use some line Alexa

02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:35,300
will so playing we say you cancel

02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:43,880
contracts tests no tests

02:06:47,830 --> 02:06:52,050
Michael is it safe for me to play with

02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:52,050
the resolution

02:07:02,379 --> 02:07:05,249
and the church

02:07:10,379 --> 02:07:14,579
okay so what do you ready run total in

02:07:12,959 --> 02:07:16,499
it it will create a basic structural

02:07:14,579 --> 02:07:20,039
Raven contracts is where he actually

02:07:16,499 --> 02:07:24,570
keep your submitted projects migrations

02:07:20,039 --> 02:07:27,599
is where you it's like that stick files

02:07:24,570 --> 02:07:29,639
that deploy your contract to the network

02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:32,419
might be local network it might be a

02:07:29,639 --> 02:07:35,369
public network it might be test network

02:07:32,419 --> 02:07:36,659
so they are pretty important and because

02:07:35,369 --> 02:07:44,719
you probably are just going to be

02:07:36,659 --> 02:07:44,719
evolving over time it's important to I

02:07:44,899 --> 02:07:54,320
think it's dinner it's like cold in the

02:07:48,119 --> 02:07:58,649
dark but I'm gonna be losing this game

02:07:54,320 --> 02:08:00,149
so um okay I will try to like beta fold

02:07:58,649 --> 02:08:02,669
increase like this migration contract

02:08:00,149 --> 02:08:07,349
which I kinda like should I use it

02:08:02,669 --> 02:08:10,199
how embarrassing which helps you keep

02:08:07,349 --> 02:08:13,820
track of your memories on the actual

02:08:10,199 --> 02:08:13,820
team that's doing

02:08:16,739 --> 02:08:25,429
I change it to keep work you know if you

02:08:21,719 --> 02:08:25,429
notice quite a bit in their cookies

02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:37,880
you don't still have a problem okay

02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:49,180
I hope it's time overly or is it overly

02:08:47,440 --> 02:08:52,780
complex but what about what's the

02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:54,910
contract that I would try to write all

02:08:52,780 --> 02:08:56,470
this write a game how much time it could

02:08:54,910 --> 02:08:58,900
become an hour will probably be

02:08:56,470 --> 02:09:01,360
sufficient as well it's a game where

02:08:58,900 --> 02:09:05,380
cycle multiplayer game where everyone

02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:09,960
can vote on a number between one two

02:09:05,380 --> 02:09:13,240
hundred and whoever gets it closes to

02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:16,180
like 30 percent of an average value wins

02:09:13,240 --> 02:09:19,090
after either right does it make sense so

02:09:16,180 --> 02:09:22,360
it's a beauty contest so everybody have

02:09:19,090 --> 02:09:25,870
to guess what heroine house will pick

02:09:22,360 --> 02:09:32,950
rate is their brain so err Lulu's from 0

02:09:25,870 --> 02:09:34,750
to 100 and and whoever yes and number of

02:09:32,950 --> 02:09:37,830
basis to the food is personal to the

02:09:34,750 --> 02:09:37,830
average wins

02:09:53,060 --> 02:09:57,940
okay so a great contract solidity

02:10:12,459 --> 02:10:17,760
Oh get his first okay

02:10:19,530 --> 02:10:23,389
well great has a configuration just in

02:10:21,030 --> 02:10:23,389
case like

02:10:51,769 --> 02:10:58,290
okay so we have to to migrations

02:10:55,530 --> 02:10:59,760
we want to be doing tests for now I mean

02:10:58,290 --> 02:11:01,290
it's it's really pretty good to do them

02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:04,380
I probably should show them somehow to

02:11:01,290 --> 02:11:06,240
you but I know this and I'm going to be

02:11:04,380 --> 02:11:07,440
focusing on another contract that I have

02:11:06,240 --> 02:11:09,330
an admission so I'm gonna cheating a

02:11:07,440 --> 02:11:12,350
little bit but help it over pretty easy

02:11:09,330 --> 02:11:12,350
to follow for this

02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:16,060
come again

02:11:18,890 --> 02:11:24,279
[Music]

02:11:30,180 --> 02:11:42,840
like is it any better a bit more

02:11:37,190 --> 02:11:44,460
demanding sir is that any better I'll

02:11:42,840 --> 02:11:45,810
send you my country you know my my

02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:49,970
probably address you can send you some

02:11:45,810 --> 02:11:49,970
user site Emily why do you 31-point

02:11:57,320 --> 02:12:04,670
video content we gonna do

02:12:01,310 --> 02:12:04,670
trends gonna help

02:12:07,739 --> 02:12:14,330
it's not gonna it's falling okay like

02:12:12,180 --> 02:12:14,330
this

02:12:14,440 --> 02:12:17,070
okay

02:12:19,369 --> 02:12:22,179
so

02:12:38,889 --> 02:12:42,449
and our race public force

02:12:46,150 --> 02:12:48,900
what is this

02:12:56,199 --> 02:12:59,610
okay so

02:13:05,159 --> 02:13:08,159
usable

02:13:10,810 --> 02:13:19,190
and you Oh sir

02:13:16,190 --> 02:13:19,190
Oh

02:13:21,489 --> 02:13:24,600
oh right

02:13:31,060 --> 02:13:37,290
good idea I'll probably fail me there

02:13:34,660 --> 02:13:37,290
was doing or not

02:13:41,240 --> 02:13:44,540
[Music]

02:13:52,160 --> 02:13:55,700
Chris Martin

02:14:01,219 --> 02:14:05,690
it's hard enough to go to this base

02:14:02,659 --> 02:14:08,240
right so

02:14:05,690 --> 02:14:11,110
well basically we'll have a main

02:14:08,240 --> 02:14:11,110
function like vote

02:14:15,010 --> 02:14:17,699
actually

02:14:26,510 --> 02:14:32,690
okay hello thinking oh dang a bit

02:14:29,220 --> 02:14:32,690
getting into a bit more complex

02:14:40,580 --> 02:14:44,800
Michael did you turn off an AC exiting

02:14:45,360 --> 02:14:53,250
okay um I think I'm getting signals like

02:14:50,730 --> 02:14:57,050
some doesn't think it's that simple it's

02:14:53,250 --> 02:14:57,050
awful that I can show you guys

02:15:14,610 --> 02:15:17,610
hmm

02:15:28,680 --> 02:15:34,290
okay so I'm trying that's right if I

02:15:32,820 --> 02:15:37,890
feel a little baby so what are you doing

02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:39,950
okay so we becoming an owner the person

02:15:37,890 --> 02:15:42,780
who created the contract in just in case

02:15:39,950 --> 02:15:45,300
the security measure that you do in case

02:15:42,780 --> 02:15:47,880
there are some value to contract and you

02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:49,650
want to like just someone just rather

02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:51,230
unattractive alligator's head back to

02:15:49,650 --> 02:15:54,900
the owner

02:15:51,230 --> 02:15:58,560
voting is basically will like let people

02:15:54,900 --> 02:16:02,810
who at different accounts would and will

02:15:58,560 --> 02:16:02,810
need a function that will like appendage

02:17:12,050 --> 02:17:16,819
there is this tech convention used over

02:17:14,269 --> 02:17:21,670
the underscore portal when arguments

02:17:16,819 --> 02:17:24,380
just like easy to distinguish and

02:17:21,670 --> 02:17:27,910
because you can load up on us we'll make

02:17:24,380 --> 02:17:27,910
emails so much

02:17:31,100 --> 02:17:38,120
Oh interesting thing like compared to

02:17:35,590 --> 02:17:41,810
canister in I think Joe escape you just

02:17:38,120 --> 02:17:44,210
like to make varietal declaration it's

02:17:41,810 --> 02:17:46,160
going to be undefined insulating

02:17:44,210 --> 02:17:49,130
everything is zeroed out

02:17:46,160 --> 02:17:52,580
so like the value of some is is zero

02:17:49,130 --> 02:17:54,500
it's different here by default the same

02:17:52,580 --> 02:17:57,950
thing with if you have like a called the

02:17:54,500 --> 02:18:03,230
corner and his value opener will be zero

02:17:57,950 --> 02:18:04,410
who's going to be zero zero address okay

02:18:03,230 --> 02:18:08,280
[Music]

02:18:04,410 --> 02:18:11,580
come again paper o people of use that

02:18:08,280 --> 02:18:17,580
the function can receive pumps okay

02:18:11,580 --> 02:18:20,490
that's pretty important public means

02:18:17,580 --> 02:18:21,929
that I'm not sure they were actually

02:18:20,490 --> 02:18:25,560
gonna get in today people part but

02:18:21,929 --> 02:18:26,940
basically what are you able to do is for

02:18:25,560 --> 02:18:29,550
example if there were like money bolt

02:18:26,940 --> 02:18:33,270
right and I could have another like

02:18:29,550 --> 02:18:37,580
mapping of address value right I

02:18:33,270 --> 02:18:43,410
couldn't I could do something like this

02:18:37,580 --> 02:18:49,850
message value somewhere that's right

02:18:43,410 --> 02:18:49,850
that will add add more sorry I'm nervous

02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:59,300
doesn't make sense so this is going to

02:18:57,260 --> 02:19:01,429
be a hexadecimal number off like for

02:18:59,300 --> 02:19:03,889
example if if this participant of the

02:19:01,429 --> 02:19:08,530
narcotic sentence calls this function

02:19:03,889 --> 02:19:11,359
with an argument and with either value

02:19:08,530 --> 02:19:14,240
this contracts got an executed some

02:19:11,359 --> 02:19:16,460
logical set this internal Spade as

02:19:14,240 --> 02:19:20,780
valium and they sign into the address of

02:19:16,460 --> 02:19:25,429
the center that will also add more value

02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:31,569
into the into the balances for that for

02:19:25,429 --> 02:19:31,569
that Walter worth and we continue yeah

02:19:33,919 --> 02:19:36,039
and

02:19:54,290 --> 02:19:58,600
so we'll make sure that voters can order

02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:58,600
the most

02:20:13,430 --> 02:20:18,080
will will disregard the values for now I

02:20:15,830 --> 02:20:21,550
just want to get a single spot so no one

02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:21,550
gets confused sir I don't get these

02:20:24,140 --> 02:20:27,260
[Music]

02:20:28,091 --> 02:20:30,990
have you

02:20:32,800 --> 02:20:41,410
what does it mean to hear how old she

02:20:37,010 --> 02:20:41,410
has come 92

02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:48,589
yeah oh yeah

02:20:46,640 --> 02:20:51,169
okay so another important concept in

02:20:48,589 --> 02:20:52,520
insulated is like you know in in

02:20:51,169 --> 02:20:54,020
JavaScript or is inconsolable

02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:57,409
it's literally there is like no

02:20:54,020 --> 02:21:00,770
console.log there is this concept called

02:20:57,409 --> 02:21:02,600
event and you have to make dafair the

02:21:00,770 --> 02:21:07,970
brain and they can return the coma

02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:10,159
specific data so I can do

02:21:07,970 --> 02:21:12,699
and again those dogs are visible by

02:21:10,159 --> 02:21:12,699
everyone

02:21:19,251 --> 02:21:26,450
deductions certain transaction whatever

02:21:31,390 --> 02:21:37,479
Annelle logs here

02:21:34,370 --> 02:21:37,479
[Music]

02:21:59,529 --> 02:22:06,670
how I did it any comments or shy

02:22:04,660 --> 02:22:10,390
okay

02:22:06,670 --> 02:22:13,590
but the first gots transactions

02:22:10,390 --> 02:22:13,590
returning something

02:22:24,730 --> 02:22:27,360
what

02:22:29,430 --> 02:22:33,650
towards get UI and some

02:22:37,851 --> 02:22:41,360
I mean I understand this conniving

02:22:39,860 --> 02:22:43,330
variation of the previous game but I

02:22:41,360 --> 02:22:51,230
hope it's more or less concise other

02:22:43,330 --> 02:22:53,410
questions cast my code usage what is

02:22:51,230 --> 02:22:53,410
that

02:23:07,260 --> 02:23:12,080
sorry I don't know it tell me

02:23:27,700 --> 02:23:33,330
looking we can just check whether any

02:23:30,700 --> 02:23:33,330
comparisons

02:23:36,101 --> 02:23:40,841
and you feel it

02:23:39,011 --> 02:23:50,230
maybe I can copy/paste that real quickly

02:23:40,841 --> 02:23:51,910
where was that a thing okay there were

02:23:50,230 --> 02:23:55,080
sounds like that or something I have no

02:23:51,910 --> 02:23:55,080
anyone with questionnaires

02:23:58,020 --> 02:24:03,460
I'm sure I can't I just gonna need

02:24:00,189 --> 02:24:05,979
something like my comfort zone tank yeah

02:24:03,460 --> 02:24:08,680
it's already pretty bad it's like I want

02:24:05,979 --> 02:24:09,910
to like avoid confusion like it's pretty

02:24:08,680 --> 02:24:12,670
bad that you guys in confused it's gonna

02:24:09,910 --> 02:24:15,910
be even worse about you don't know what

02:24:12,670 --> 02:24:21,420
that I don't know what that piece are

02:24:15,910 --> 02:24:21,420
french fries stay here so

02:24:25,479 --> 02:24:29,080
and with a pair of leg they just paid to

02:24:27,340 --> 02:24:31,810
the actual cycles they use or you

02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:32,860
couldn't process with the people

02:24:31,810 --> 02:24:41,950
function so that means that this

02:24:32,860 --> 02:24:44,790
function can receive either yes yes so

02:24:41,950 --> 02:24:48,820
first of eight it's like if you're

02:24:44,790 --> 02:24:56,080
playing if you're buying something or

02:24:48,820 --> 02:24:58,420
you're really betting on something you

02:24:56,080 --> 02:25:03,850
can make actually have it over rival

02:24:58,420 --> 02:25:12,330
that is like sets the price if they if

02:25:03,850 --> 02:25:12,330
this can actually just like you ain't

02:25:14,530 --> 02:25:23,680
no I'm not gonna use that you're in

02:25:17,650 --> 02:25:25,030
price and it's like yeah yeah I mean I I

02:25:23,680 --> 02:25:26,320
find it's pretty excited we go but if

02:25:25,030 --> 02:25:29,260
you dig if you do that in like you know

02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:31,150
in if you if you receive payments with

02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:34,150
stripe or anything else like you have to

02:25:31,150 --> 02:25:37,240
do enough like an authorization like you

02:25:34,150 --> 02:25:39,070
know callbacks keys back and forth

02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:41,730
between strata server and surety just

02:25:39,070 --> 02:25:41,730
everything was bad

02:25:47,219 --> 02:25:53,970
where's my expect cynical

02:25:50,060 --> 02:25:56,990
[Music]

02:25:53,970 --> 02:25:56,990
unexpected Smith

02:25:58,831 --> 02:26:13,730
Oh after after all right thank you

02:26:09,301 --> 02:26:16,381
III don't see pixels and setting goals

02:26:13,730 --> 02:26:18,301
okay more of a success so that means

02:26:16,381 --> 02:26:19,261
that a contract compiled okay and they

02:26:18,301 --> 02:26:21,541
just think they may be a conference

02:26:19,261 --> 02:26:24,541
compiled they get built and you get them

02:26:21,541 --> 02:26:27,121
in in this case in this in this bill

02:26:24,541 --> 02:26:28,320
directory and it's a constant important

02:26:27,121 --> 02:26:30,031
part but I'm gonna make it jumping

02:26:28,320 --> 02:26:33,001
things so then we cover quite a bit of

02:26:30,031 --> 02:26:36,181
ground when contracts compile they

02:26:33,001 --> 02:26:38,461
create this like Jason ABI advance and

02:26:36,181 --> 02:26:40,980
they are pretty important so because

02:26:38,461 --> 02:26:43,051
they basically contain your quite a bit

02:26:40,980 --> 02:26:46,801
of information about it code they

02:26:43,051 --> 02:26:47,911
contain all the interfaces about you

02:26:46,801 --> 02:26:52,371
know all the functions so first up I

02:26:47,911 --> 02:26:56,161
have a disability and it's gonna have

02:26:52,371 --> 02:26:58,711
come on somewhere okay here we go it's

02:26:56,161 --> 02:27:04,431
gonna have some information about the

02:26:58,711 --> 02:27:05,940
actually be is a compound so long

02:27:04,431 --> 02:27:15,601
ABI

02:27:05,940 --> 02:27:16,531
thank you so into okay so in ABI this

02:27:15,601 --> 02:27:21,091
actually kind of provides information

02:27:16,531 --> 02:27:22,440
about your contract and function and you

02:27:21,091 --> 02:27:24,961
can see that the name of the function is

02:27:22,440 --> 02:27:27,291
vote a certain office that we just

02:27:24,961 --> 02:27:27,291
declare

02:27:27,860 --> 02:27:38,630
so we have a type of input type of

02:27:39,110 --> 02:27:42,480
outputs

02:27:40,290 --> 02:27:45,030
whether it's painful it's available and

02:27:42,480 --> 02:27:47,160
so like the video of this thing it's not

02:27:45,030 --> 02:27:49,530
really beautiful an interesting thing

02:27:47,160 --> 02:27:51,360
about this is like function when you

02:27:49,530 --> 02:27:52,800
when you build it deploy a contract you

02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:55,500
were gonna receive this and also is

02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:57,300
gonna contain somewhere like the actual

02:27:55,500 --> 02:28:00,420
address where it's being deployed if it

02:27:57,300 --> 02:28:04,790
is deployed this one is just composite

02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:09,260
and deployed and you can build like e UI

02:28:04,790 --> 02:28:12,690
based autonomic UI based on the API

02:28:09,260 --> 02:28:18,960
array so it in fact when you when you

02:28:12,690 --> 02:28:23,700
look at when you looked at or yeah at

02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:25,170
the one we've been joined with example

02:28:23,700 --> 02:28:30,750
with a change rates when you saw

02:28:25,170 --> 02:28:33,300
contract here that like the they output

02:28:30,750 --> 02:28:40,220
like the way you I was generated is

02:28:33,300 --> 02:28:42,710
because thanks to that ABI G so far

02:28:40,220 --> 02:28:45,080
so he's just basically generated based

02:28:42,710 --> 02:28:55,460
on on this and we will need this later

02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:56,840
if we'll good guess if you guys so what

02:28:55,460 --> 02:28:58,970
happens I get will you come and

02:28:56,840 --> 02:29:01,069
developed much yeah I know it's pretty

02:28:58,970 --> 02:29:02,479
I'm Tina pretty boring right now have

02:29:01,069 --> 02:29:03,979
think is really happening that much but

02:29:02,479 --> 02:29:13,970
I just want to cover like different

02:29:03,979 --> 02:29:16,069
stamps and stages the migration yeah

02:29:13,970 --> 02:29:19,160
it's pretty common it's nothing to the

02:29:16,069 --> 02:29:20,950
completion sorry for jumping things it's

02:29:19,160 --> 02:29:24,880
just like a lot of different things

02:29:20,950 --> 02:29:24,880
submitted cards if possible together

02:29:28,390 --> 02:29:34,640
so basically when I went to compile when

02:29:31,160 --> 02:29:35,710
I when I did a total compiled it

02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:37,790
basically went through the code

02:29:35,710 --> 02:29:42,189
investigating there were any like really

02:29:37,790 --> 02:29:45,770
bad errors in it there are some warnings

02:29:42,189 --> 02:29:47,660
and it generated what a combination

02:29:45,770 --> 02:29:52,000
actually does is make generates a total

02:29:47,660 --> 02:29:54,780
bytecode which you can see somewhere AVI

02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,780
I mean

02:29:59,561 --> 02:30:03,101
yeah I have a goat on a bike oh so this

02:30:01,450 --> 02:30:09,521
is actually was being deployed on the

02:30:03,101 --> 02:30:11,170
Honda rider local network or yeah that's

02:30:09,521 --> 02:30:13,630
all the numbers that we saw earlier and

02:30:11,170 --> 02:30:16,480
so I know this is pretty low level stuff

02:30:13,630 --> 02:30:18,490
but it is pretty more than that sexually

02:30:16,480 --> 02:30:20,530
I'm gonna I used to be st. John's for

02:30:18,490 --> 02:30:23,891
twenty years and I never actually don't

02:30:20,530 --> 02:30:25,630
like when in depth it off like you know

02:30:23,891 --> 02:30:29,620
combination stuffing I was actually

02:30:25,630 --> 02:30:30,761
excited so I know we haven't done much

02:30:29,620 --> 02:30:32,920
yet but I just want to go through all

02:30:30,761 --> 02:30:35,710
the steps and let's just publish this

02:30:32,920 --> 02:30:38,980
contract with truffle to your hopefully

02:30:35,710 --> 02:30:40,840
running test leprosy in mind actually

02:30:38,980 --> 02:30:44,460
just like you I don't talk about that

02:30:40,840 --> 02:30:44,460
service here promise that's pretty

02:30:48,450 --> 02:30:53,189
so another thing slightly confusing

02:30:50,970 --> 02:30:54,900
thing about truffle it has to and funk -

02:30:53,189 --> 02:30:57,320
I do

02:30:54,900 --> 02:30:57,320
Topol help

02:30:58,470 --> 02:31:05,280
it has truffle migrate and truffle

02:31:01,439 --> 02:31:21,570
deployed it's the same thing I used to

02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:23,460
be so before I hit troubled employee so

02:31:21,570 --> 02:31:28,020
we have this one track the help everyone

02:31:23,460 --> 02:31:30,630
has it all and I have a sort of my

02:31:28,020 --> 02:31:33,470
gracious at some kind of a migration

02:31:30,630 --> 02:31:37,439
which basically takes the beautiful

02:31:33,470 --> 02:31:39,150
country and the flora deployment there

02:31:37,439 --> 02:31:40,950
was like way more that you could do here

02:31:39,150 --> 02:31:45,330
a can i sat like for example with

02:31:40,950 --> 02:31:50,729
example that Dave gave Obama changed you

02:31:45,330 --> 02:31:52,860
can make add additional parameters for

02:31:50,729 --> 02:31:56,070
would be shooted political track I found

02:31:52,860 --> 02:31:59,070
out a little just give a decent if I do

02:31:56,070 --> 02:32:02,990
chocolate deploy oh I think it's gonna

02:31:59,070 --> 02:32:02,990
fail I know

02:32:07,990 --> 02:32:13,580
okay no never specified not important

02:32:10,460 --> 02:32:17,301
truffle content okay here you actually

02:32:13,580 --> 02:32:22,330
specify how truffle like to each Network

02:32:17,301 --> 02:32:22,330
people connected with doing deployment

02:32:36,610 --> 02:32:39,420
okay Oh

02:32:43,609 --> 02:32:50,930
it should be crazy boy I'll let the

02:32:46,399 --> 02:32:53,630
removal so if this config file I think

02:32:50,930 --> 02:32:55,790
connects operating this thing so I keep

02:32:53,630 --> 02:32:57,460
it simple and not use any one because

02:32:55,790 --> 02:33:01,640
they're all confused already

02:32:57,460 --> 02:33:03,500
okay so cup chocolate yes right I wasn't

02:33:01,640 --> 02:33:09,080
in there one or has it any confused

02:33:03,500 --> 02:33:12,310
spaces yes problem this thing okay I'll

02:33:09,080 --> 02:33:13,670
soon so I got a few guys know why

02:33:12,310 --> 02:33:17,420
okay okay

02:33:13,670 --> 02:33:17,990
I heard you okay fear Oh someone deleted

02:33:17,420 --> 02:33:22,510
our thing okay

02:33:17,990 --> 02:33:22,510
is it good oh sure okay cool

02:33:28,510 --> 02:33:34,779
okay so basically what this thing does

02:33:31,260 --> 02:33:36,310
it because we're running tests are we

02:33:34,779 --> 02:33:39,970
seeing a freaking garage so we had this

02:33:36,310 --> 02:33:42,069
server that runs and accessibility

02:33:39,970 --> 02:33:45,149
support the services server and in

02:33:42,069 --> 02:33:48,899
trouble we'll be connecting to this

02:33:45,149 --> 02:33:48,899
environment any network

02:33:52,149 --> 02:34:00,460
oh nice success exciting are you guys

02:33:56,260 --> 02:34:02,380
excited okay

02:34:00,460 --> 02:34:05,340
exciting thing okay you can actually see

02:34:02,380 --> 02:34:10,260
stuff happen what just happened is

02:34:05,340 --> 02:34:15,039
trouble went out and performed this

02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:17,310
performed this to migrations it deployed

02:34:15,039 --> 02:34:20,050
the default migration of contract

02:34:17,310 --> 02:34:21,729
ignoring Finnell and the contract that

02:34:20,050 --> 02:34:23,380
we just wrote it's like super simple

02:34:21,729 --> 02:34:26,680
this dummy contract that doesn't do much

02:34:23,380 --> 02:34:27,880
at all but basically deployed and it's

02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:32,140
kind of important for you guys to get

02:34:27,880 --> 02:34:34,329
started we can see some output here this

02:34:32,140 --> 02:34:37,899
is actually the code like the public

02:34:34,329 --> 02:34:40,449
address of that person is there in our

02:34:37,899 --> 02:34:41,859
local in your local test every cent of

02:34:40,449 --> 02:34:46,600
work I know you can see some changes

02:34:41,859 --> 02:34:48,159
that happened in test RPC itself and you

02:34:46,600 --> 02:34:51,220
know I'm using inrush again because it's

02:34:48,159 --> 02:34:53,140
like UI so it's less confusing that just

02:34:51,220 --> 02:34:57,789
like running with the same piece of code

02:34:53,140 --> 02:35:01,029
in income online so what just happened

02:34:57,789 --> 02:35:02,439
because tester pcs pretty fast it's like

02:35:01,029 --> 02:35:03,939
one cuz I should probably right now we

02:35:02,439 --> 02:35:05,829
usually it's like wonderful sources I

02:35:03,939 --> 02:35:08,770
should go block and we can see like

02:35:05,829 --> 02:35:10,720
contract creation contact call this this

02:35:08,770 --> 02:35:16,439
is amendment immigrations contract and

02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:16,439
this is the actual the actual

02:35:19,860 --> 02:35:25,110
the actual contract that we that we just

02:35:22,051 --> 02:35:32,400
developed in each context so this is

02:35:25,110 --> 02:35:35,431
that okay okay follow me any questions

02:35:32,400 --> 02:35:43,740
so far everyone's excited we deployed a

02:35:35,431 --> 02:35:46,620
real contract a contract which one you

02:35:43,740 --> 02:35:48,841
want to mention that I'm not sure what's

02:35:46,620 --> 02:35:50,580
what's the goal is gonna date date huh

02:35:48,841 --> 02:35:54,271
becomes you know why it's like me

02:35:50,580 --> 02:35:57,120
Creator person that is being so Mike I

02:35:54,271 --> 02:36:06,061
just avoid contact and then it says show

02:35:57,120 --> 02:36:08,940
me make so yeah it's not a complication

02:36:06,061 --> 02:36:12,080
I should say that's the hash of that's

02:36:08,940 --> 02:36:20,400
the hash of the transaction as a cinema

02:36:12,080 --> 02:36:22,230
this equation I think maybe having

02:36:20,400 --> 02:36:24,540
trouble paying immigrations early

02:36:22,230 --> 02:36:29,511
truffle police or excuse

02:36:24,540 --> 02:36:32,011
oh it sends some they first created

02:36:29,511 --> 02:36:34,591
migrations contract is the trouble thing

02:36:32,011 --> 02:36:39,511
it's uh big confusing equated in this

02:36:34,591 --> 02:36:43,320
migrations this migrations contracted

02:36:39,511 --> 02:36:45,570
and it sends stateless of a to that

02:36:43,320 --> 02:36:46,330
migrations contract that we performed

02:36:45,570 --> 02:36:49,061
yet

02:36:46,330 --> 02:36:53,801
but it was important for business so

02:36:49,061 --> 02:36:56,860
this is the actual contract that we just

02:36:53,801 --> 02:37:06,040
deployed this dispute thing and so okay

02:36:56,860 --> 02:37:10,001
and experiment if we go into like beauty

02:37:06,040 --> 02:37:13,751
contests EDIF Oh Jason front the vehicle

02:37:10,001 --> 02:37:15,881
here is pretty much maybe the same so if

02:37:13,751 --> 02:37:18,011
I they talk of business that's that's

02:37:15,881 --> 02:37:20,620
the bytecode so it's exactly the same

02:37:18,011 --> 02:37:23,620
and somewhere here will be the address

02:37:20,620 --> 02:37:25,480
so this is the thing contract enemies

02:37:23,620 --> 02:37:28,001
should this revision configure this and

02:37:25,480 --> 02:37:30,101
you can see it here as well so it's the

02:37:28,001 --> 02:37:31,450
same is the same thing I just off you or

02:37:30,101 --> 02:37:33,761
the contract that you just deployed when

02:37:31,450 --> 02:37:34,660
you open a Columbia and this is the

02:37:33,761 --> 02:37:41,830
address that you're going to use

02:37:34,660 --> 02:37:44,351
incorrectly this contract okay and okay

02:37:41,830 --> 02:37:46,530
but show you next is this is a spear so

02:37:44,351 --> 02:37:46,530
far

02:37:49,620 --> 02:38:00,040
why do we do it this way okay so the

02:37:56,170 --> 02:38:03,160
migrations contract keeps track of the

02:38:00,040 --> 02:38:06,280
critters migrations that he dumped like

02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:19,540
you in-depth explanation will be

02:38:06,280 --> 02:38:22,000
provided by you can even use multiple

02:38:19,540 --> 02:38:27,240
contracts in one and you can actually do

02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:31,270
I think then and you know do miracles

02:38:27,240 --> 02:38:34,859
here it was a second contract and

02:38:31,270 --> 02:38:39,910
passing like so they contracted address

02:38:34,859 --> 02:38:46,060
and you can actually took the sale and

02:38:39,910 --> 02:38:52,380
coin yeah so like you basically can do I

02:38:46,060 --> 02:38:55,930
don't know stuff like deploy deploy

02:38:52,380 --> 02:38:58,810
migrations I don't know it's like a nice

02:38:55,930 --> 02:39:02,610
let's not even migrations ABC whatever

02:38:58,810 --> 02:39:07,670
just abstract ABCABC one

02:39:02,610 --> 02:39:07,670
and you can make them interdependent

02:39:10,650 --> 02:39:17,120
yeah like even if this contract depends

02:39:12,931 --> 02:39:17,120
on the other contract you can

02:39:22,160 --> 02:39:25,490
you could do something like this if like

02:39:24,351 --> 02:39:28,160
to remember you guys someone asked about

02:39:25,490 --> 02:39:30,710
like whether like what happens if the

02:39:28,160 --> 02:39:32,420
Cody was strong and that's personally

02:39:30,710 --> 02:39:36,170
initiating a contract and what is it

02:39:32,420 --> 02:39:38,120
another one and sort of how you did and

02:39:36,170 --> 02:39:39,891
if you can't get way more complex

02:39:38,120 --> 02:39:44,330
workers but I'm just like I'm trying to

02:39:39,891 --> 02:39:50,680
keep it simple questions questions

02:39:44,330 --> 02:39:50,680
questions questions yes gentlemen Laura

02:39:52,840 --> 02:40:00,260
yeah question I think it's like we're

02:39:56,390 --> 02:40:02,990
moving a few steps forward so shall we

02:40:00,260 --> 02:40:05,330
go into this right away shall we go to

02:40:02,990 --> 02:40:07,310
this thing make a very good question I

02:40:05,330 --> 02:40:10,370
said I think that's probably one of the

02:40:07,310 --> 02:40:13,910
best one of the things which everybody

02:40:10,370 --> 02:40:17,060
here has a direct application yeah okay

02:40:13,910 --> 02:40:18,800
so okay I wanted to do a few things here

02:40:17,060 --> 02:40:20,210
but I think that's a very good question

02:40:18,800 --> 02:40:24,140
because we were running outside and

02:40:20,210 --> 02:40:25,910
people ran out of patience so the quick

02:40:24,140 --> 02:40:30,520
answer is there is this thing called web

02:40:25,910 --> 02:40:33,170
three nice applause who's written in J's

02:40:30,520 --> 02:40:37,100
yeah and that the mask is a web three

02:40:33,170 --> 02:40:39,830
provider right so in your video code in

02:40:37,100 --> 02:40:42,380
your web application basically you will

02:40:39,830 --> 02:40:49,090
have a you'll be interacting with this

02:40:42,380 --> 02:40:52,010
rival like web three viral this is oh

02:40:49,090 --> 02:40:55,220
 again I'll show you something like

02:40:52,010 --> 02:40:59,870
JavaScript I decided to see how

02:40:55,220 --> 02:41:02,800
struggling somebody activity I'm the

02:40:59,870 --> 02:41:02,800
only person excited

02:41:03,060 --> 02:41:07,780
okay so okay this is some JavaScript

02:41:05,350 --> 02:41:11,380
code finally break I'm just jumping many

02:41:07,780 --> 02:41:14,370
steps I hope it's a little more okay so

02:41:11,380 --> 02:41:18,220
basically the rustling some magic here

02:41:14,370 --> 02:41:20,200
web three is this library that you go

02:41:18,220 --> 02:41:21,370
two or three there's amazing people form

02:41:20,200 --> 02:41:23,290
a foundation

02:41:21,370 --> 02:41:25,840
sadly none of them of this conference

02:41:23,290 --> 02:41:28,740
maybe next time they were in Singapore

02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:28,740
there Wow

02:41:28,860 --> 02:41:34,210
[Music]

02:41:30,600 --> 02:41:37,450
so this like take a library that

02:41:34,210 --> 02:41:40,000
provides you connects your code your

02:41:37,450 --> 02:41:43,479
JavaScript code in a browser to to

02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:48,010
whatever net from the name connected to

02:41:43,479 --> 02:41:54,430
image - okay I also did not yet okay so

02:41:48,010 --> 02:41:58,310
I give a few ideas 2014 give a few fun

02:41:54,430 --> 02:42:03,770
okay let me--just they try to summon

02:41:58,310 --> 02:42:05,149
stuff here okay how to interact back to

02:42:03,770 --> 02:42:07,340
the question how to interact with your

02:42:05,149 --> 02:42:12,050
contract that you deployed so we have

02:42:07,340 --> 02:42:17,240
this very thing and the important bit

02:42:12,050 --> 02:42:18,890
you need to use like a few things you oh

02:42:17,240 --> 02:42:21,620
you didn't make any uninstall they're

02:42:18,890 --> 02:42:26,450
free agent you have installed travel

02:42:21,620 --> 02:42:28,550
contract right and then from your

02:42:26,450 --> 02:42:29,899
deployed so this is actually a bit more

02:42:28,550 --> 02:42:32,450
I feel like the matura

02:42:29,899 --> 02:42:36,740
who does the same thing it has like this

02:42:32,450 --> 02:42:37,070
my beauty contest contract okay thank

02:42:36,740 --> 02:42:43,970
you sir

02:42:37,070 --> 02:42:51,170
I guess sir fantastic okay so remember

02:42:43,970 --> 02:42:53,420
when we did deployment we got this we

02:42:51,170 --> 02:42:56,060
got this contrasting data file

02:42:53,420 --> 02:42:59,290
so this is the one that you also get in

02:42:56,060 --> 02:43:02,300
keeping your front end project

02:42:59,290 --> 02:43:06,800
repository and you will actually require

02:43:02,300 --> 02:43:10,490
it your in your front end code right and

02:43:06,800 --> 02:43:13,100
then it's you use your project start

02:43:10,490 --> 02:43:14,910
your new contract like peach imagine

02:43:13,100 --> 02:43:16,620
tour

02:43:14,910 --> 02:43:21,750
deploy instance and then he basically

02:43:16,620 --> 02:43:25,860
can interact with like vote and I can do

02:43:21,750 --> 02:43:28,439
boat one from from one of the from the

02:43:25,860 --> 02:43:30,090
main account it's that more like I know

02:43:28,439 --> 02:43:31,800
I'm skipping some stuff but that does

02:43:30,090 --> 02:43:33,540
that like more or less clear you're

02:43:31,800 --> 02:43:36,600
getting like if you it's a piece of

02:43:33,540 --> 02:43:39,600
story yeah okay okay

02:43:36,600 --> 02:43:48,780
so that counts are coming from remember

02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:52,050
when we were sitting up mask so well -

02:43:48,780 --> 02:43:55,670
but I did sort of you're being one of

02:43:52,050 --> 02:43:55,670
the first

02:44:05,591 --> 02:44:11,620
if you're using Meza mosque as your

02:44:08,530 --> 02:44:14,740
worth three provider in other words it

02:44:11,620 --> 02:44:19,150
injects you a connection to the network

02:44:14,740 --> 02:44:23,410
you can use the you end up using the

02:44:19,150 --> 02:44:25,570
accounts in metal mask anytime you want

02:44:23,410 --> 02:44:28,211
to submit a transaction however Mesa

02:44:25,570 --> 02:44:29,921
Mass will pop up ask you to cite the

02:44:28,211 --> 02:44:32,591
transaction so nothing happens without

02:44:29,921 --> 02:44:34,841
you saying so right if you're running

02:44:32,591 --> 02:44:37,631
parity of the parity know that the bank

02:44:34,841 --> 02:44:40,001
and use the parity signer in exactly the

02:44:37,631 --> 02:44:41,410
same way so the parity sign that will

02:44:40,001 --> 02:44:49,511
come up and ask you to sign the

02:44:41,410 --> 02:44:52,570
transaction yeah so okay so like here's

02:44:49,511 --> 02:44:53,771
here's an example so okay sorry you

02:44:52,570 --> 02:44:55,631
script the case but it's yeah I think

02:44:53,771 --> 02:44:57,641
they did not pretty good job so cheers

02:44:55,631 --> 02:45:00,730
to them so principal I a monkey needs

02:44:57,641 --> 02:45:02,740
mouth spray and I am connected to ear

02:45:00,730 --> 02:45:07,181
off syntax password

02:45:02,740 --> 02:45:09,761
what meeting us does oh yeah it's cool

02:45:07,181 --> 02:45:18,370
it's code okay so injects this like web

02:45:09,761 --> 02:45:21,271
three huge success web three three

02:45:18,370 --> 02:45:24,601
library and you can do ton of

02:45:21,271 --> 02:45:27,070
interesting stuff here using media mask

02:45:24,601 --> 02:45:30,011
sorry this is a trick right

02:45:27,070 --> 02:45:33,011
and this thing they're like a huge new

02:45:30,011 --> 02:45:36,221
conditioner out it and you interact with

02:45:33,011 --> 02:45:37,751
it to do one of two like scientific

02:45:36,221 --> 02:45:41,711
collections like using this library you

02:45:37,751 --> 02:45:44,141
can like get your ether balance in your

02:45:41,711 --> 02:45:45,450
in your account you can send

02:45:44,141 --> 02:45:47,740
transactions you can call functions

02:45:45,450 --> 02:45:50,431
that's like Oh gateway this yeah that

02:45:47,740 --> 02:45:54,610
gave a drug to to motion develop a

02:45:50,431 --> 02:45:55,271
solidity so you're gonna be interacting

02:45:54,610 --> 02:45:57,400
a lot with it

02:45:55,271 --> 02:46:02,200
right does that answer question Wallace

02:45:57,400 --> 02:46:08,470
right so K an example with with Brooklyn

02:46:02,200 --> 02:46:11,439
so so right now I'm connected to two

02:46:08,470 --> 02:46:16,120
across the network and like me to mask

02:46:11,439 --> 02:46:18,640
their code is you know calling about 3GS

02:46:16,120 --> 02:46:20,800
and it figures out that it's a long

02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:23,229
effort and you can connect to for

02:46:20,800 --> 02:46:26,229
example to be in Africa is like oh right

02:46:23,229 --> 02:46:29,080
you're on production Network and like

02:46:26,229 --> 02:46:32,140
that's me that that's me sign in right

02:46:29,080 --> 02:46:34,060
and for example time you can also

02:46:32,140 --> 02:46:36,220
station I first make insurance you might

02:46:34,060 --> 02:46:40,660
have different cuts on a component was

02:46:36,220 --> 02:46:42,970
like whatever and a key okay and it kind

02:46:40,660 --> 02:46:46,830
of authorizes me there but it sees that

02:46:42,970 --> 02:46:50,200
I don't have any I don't have any keys

02:46:46,830 --> 02:46:55,220
because I don't have any keys Allah on

02:46:50,200 --> 02:46:58,420
this discount it's like a

02:46:55,220 --> 02:46:58,420
it's nothing

02:47:04,330 --> 02:47:09,280
it's just like a county that has no know

02:47:06,850 --> 02:47:13,180
if I'd be first officially like my what

02:47:09,280 --> 02:47:14,890
I'm like cool accounts it will like me

02:47:13,180 --> 02:47:17,470
to mask will listen to changes some f3

02:47:14,890 --> 02:47:21,430
and will actually pull information from

02:47:17,470 --> 02:47:23,560
ball chain that are that was specific to

02:47:21,430 --> 02:47:25,930
this and does it make sense more or less

02:47:23,560 --> 02:47:28,120
is that acceptable shall we go in depth

02:47:25,930 --> 02:47:37,350
on something arrows fear I can see your

02:47:28,120 --> 02:47:37,350
faces okay

02:47:38,160 --> 02:47:45,640
yes so I jumped question like topics

02:47:43,330 --> 02:47:51,180
what would you guys into something shiny

02:47:45,640 --> 02:47:51,180
more questions shall we make it my

02:47:57,899 --> 02:48:03,010
contract has its own private like fun

02:48:00,939 --> 02:48:05,020
yeah contract has its own balance in

02:48:03,010 --> 02:48:06,760
storage the right of course there

02:48:05,020 --> 02:48:11,859
exception but he can he can refuse you

02:48:06,760 --> 02:48:12,460
money if it's a function fails exception

02:48:11,859 --> 02:48:16,090
yeah

02:48:12,460 --> 02:48:20,010
okay so contracts are addresses just

02:48:16,090 --> 02:48:22,800
like any other address in that you could

02:48:20,010 --> 02:48:26,409
accept that

02:48:22,800 --> 02:48:28,960
contracts will only accept ether if you

02:48:26,409 --> 02:48:31,090
explicitly allow them to accept either

02:48:28,960 --> 02:48:36,399
so you saw the function the word payable

02:48:31,090 --> 02:48:39,699
of that you never own the private keys

02:48:36,399 --> 02:48:43,810
to a contract closer right you never own

02:48:39,699 --> 02:48:45,939
the private keys to a contract so if

02:48:43,810 --> 02:48:48,489
you've got either inside the contract

02:48:45,939 --> 02:48:51,790
you have to have code in the contract to

02:48:48,489 --> 02:48:56,350
send it out right in the contract in

02:48:51,790 --> 02:48:57,609
this contract there is no method but in

02:48:56,350 --> 02:49:01,029
the one you put up earlier there was no

02:48:57,609 --> 02:49:02,350
method to withdraw that ether so all

02:49:01,029 --> 02:49:03,850
that will happen is people will put

02:49:02,350 --> 02:49:05,560
either into the contract and you can

02:49:03,850 --> 02:49:07,689
never get it out again which is

02:49:05,560 --> 02:49:09,909
dangerous which is you don't have that's

02:49:07,689 --> 02:49:11,199
called trap to you yes like and no it's

02:49:09,909 --> 02:49:13,390
the same thing as like lost keys so

02:49:11,199 --> 02:49:16,149
you're not bar - you can't code you can

02:49:13,390 --> 02:49:17,890
allow it to transfer you can have

02:49:16,149 --> 02:49:20,580
focuses in there to transfer see exactly

02:49:17,890 --> 02:49:20,580
help drive sales

02:49:24,461 --> 02:49:28,281
yeah indeed certainly yeah you're gonna

02:49:26,931 --> 02:49:30,291
have like something like this message

02:49:28,281 --> 02:49:32,331
sender transfer and the number of value

02:49:30,291 --> 02:49:33,801
you're like if I call this function okay

02:49:32,331 --> 02:49:41,931
let's say I'm like just like super

02:49:33,801 --> 02:49:43,881
simple super silly yeah just the girl

02:49:41,931 --> 02:50:00,650
who pays the stranger like please

02:49:43,881 --> 02:50:02,241
whoever's gonna call this function how

02:50:00,650 --> 02:50:07,671
do you get how do you put either into

02:50:02,241 --> 02:50:12,591
into it okay so you tell you you've got

02:50:07,671 --> 02:50:14,421
your website written so like normally

02:50:12,591 --> 02:50:16,671
you have a plugin for PayPal or

02:50:14,421 --> 02:50:19,610
something like that right a bug in for

02:50:16,671 --> 02:50:22,221
aetherium so your plugin for etherium

02:50:19,610 --> 02:50:27,261
would normally be web through expected

02:50:22,221 --> 02:50:29,811
web 3 enables our web front-end I'm

02:50:27,261 --> 02:50:31,821
talking in your JavaScript on the site

02:50:29,811 --> 02:50:34,940
so you build a plugin that uses

02:50:31,821 --> 02:50:38,091
JavaScript which using web 3 enables ya

02:50:34,940 --> 02:50:40,281
so in order to use it just like cryptic

02:50:38,091 --> 02:50:42,650
is it would say you have to have a web 3

02:50:40,281 --> 02:50:44,620
provider or most meta mask is one of the

02:50:42,650 --> 02:50:48,580
one of the most common yeah right

02:50:44,620 --> 02:50:51,521
right so then when you get there it will

02:50:48,580 --> 02:50:53,500
know what your meta basket counties yeah

02:50:51,521 --> 02:50:57,670
automatic you'll say okay this is your

02:50:53,500 --> 02:50:59,620
account this is your balance and then I

02:50:57,670 --> 02:51:01,930
want to buy five so it calculates how

02:50:59,620 --> 02:51:07,540
much you have to pay and when you click

02:51:01,930 --> 02:51:10,780
buy it will send the by transaction to

02:51:07,540 --> 02:51:12,880
meta mask to sign and you'll see it

02:51:10,780 --> 02:51:15,580
coming up in metamath saying I want to

02:51:12,880 --> 02:51:19,180
send five ether to this address or three

02:51:15,580 --> 02:51:22,450
ether to this address and you signing in

02:51:19,180 --> 02:51:24,130
meta mas so that's your security so you

02:51:22,450 --> 02:51:26,880
actually have to proceed let me do like

02:51:24,130 --> 02:51:29,320
a super Shamus buggabugga John says

02:51:26,880 --> 02:51:37,120
mythologize if you guys are going to be

02:51:29,320 --> 02:51:38,860
very good thank you I want to do like a

02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:40,570
while ago I went to do like super simple

02:51:38,860 --> 02:51:44,170
the Nate button right this is just like

02:51:40,570 --> 02:51:47,021
spike any jQuery code but it's very easy

02:51:44,170 --> 02:52:01,480
to understand let me even like dump it

02:51:47,021 --> 02:52:07,710
down so what was gonna happen I have

02:52:01,480 --> 02:52:10,950
this so basically women when it click

02:52:07,710 --> 02:52:14,050
where's my donate with man that spray

02:52:10,950 --> 02:52:17,170
this thing goes in and I can make enter

02:52:14,050 --> 02:52:20,140
one after that if I said okay I hit okay

02:52:17,170 --> 02:52:22,390
mini mask comes in and I'm in a real

02:52:20,140 --> 02:52:24,370
network right now and I just entered

02:52:22,390 --> 02:52:26,740
that I want to send one ether to myself

02:52:24,370 --> 02:52:29,860
right to to to whatever address it

02:52:26,740 --> 02:52:39,700
provided a frankly I don't have

02:52:29,860 --> 02:52:41,950
sufficient funds and then he tried to do

02:52:39,700 --> 02:52:45,851
actually finally use a local network so

02:52:41,950 --> 02:52:52,021
here how ton of phones how fantastic a

02:52:45,851 --> 02:52:52,021
motive actually rescues a roster

02:52:57,910 --> 02:53:12,340
I think this is a conventional thought

02:52:59,470 --> 02:53:13,720
consider bringing these oh yeah okay let

02:53:12,340 --> 02:53:17,260
me just make this really clear

02:53:13,720 --> 02:53:24,370
oh come on connect okay they're also

02:53:17,260 --> 02:53:25,300
network so if I a couple money here okay

02:53:24,370 --> 02:53:27,851
I have some plunger

02:53:25,300 --> 02:53:28,420
the name wound in mask enter one click

02:53:27,851 --> 02:53:30,641
okay

02:53:28,420 --> 02:53:32,380
signing with mini mask M'Lynn Austin

02:53:30,641 --> 02:53:35,800
Network you sending one either to this

02:53:32,380 --> 02:53:38,351
account from these account how the funds

02:53:35,800 --> 02:53:43,190
okay all safe and secure they submit and

02:53:38,351 --> 02:53:48,480
a transaction hopefully goes through

02:53:43,190 --> 02:53:48,480
[Music]

02:53:52,379 --> 02:53:56,970
yeah okay see the physician spending

02:53:54,300 --> 02:53:59,520
right just now I confirmed them and take

02:53:56,970 --> 02:54:02,369
myself on a test Network which is that

02:53:59,520 --> 02:54:04,439
much but it's and the way it's being

02:54:02,369 --> 02:54:06,510
accomplished it's like super single so

02:54:04,439 --> 02:54:09,419
when three is coming like you don't have

02:54:06,510 --> 02:54:11,749
two important in your content it's just

02:54:09,419 --> 02:54:14,550
being injected but they need a mask

02:54:11,749 --> 02:54:17,249
chrome session so like basically if I

02:54:14,550 --> 02:54:18,749
don't have made a mask installed it's

02:54:17,249 --> 02:54:21,149
gonna do nothing so it's the right now

02:54:18,749 --> 02:54:24,449
what I've done it's it's not even going

02:54:21,149 --> 02:54:28,459
to show the the name if I open this up

02:54:24,449 --> 02:54:28,459
in in encoding ability

02:54:33,221 --> 02:54:37,900
yes just doesn't show everything because

02:54:35,471 --> 02:54:42,671
there was no momentum mascara signings

02:54:37,900 --> 02:54:46,150
button so and when I'm going to click

02:54:42,671 --> 02:54:48,280
the button its hits loading you get the

02:54:46,150 --> 02:54:50,950
amount from prompt and then I convert

02:54:48,280 --> 02:54:53,740
this amount to two way from you third

02:54:50,950 --> 02:54:56,141
and I sent to this account right so this

02:54:53,740 --> 02:54:57,841
is the they can where I want to send

02:54:56,141 --> 02:55:01,601
money so this like that was super simple

02:54:57,841 --> 02:55:03,761
thing this is the account that we see

02:55:01,601 --> 02:55:06,250
the money this is a transaction and

02:55:03,761 --> 02:55:09,551
receiving from this address this best

02:55:06,250 --> 02:55:12,131
single questions so you're asking about

02:55:09,551 --> 02:55:14,710
providers the only one that worked that

02:55:12,131 --> 02:55:16,931
actually sorry okay the only provider

02:55:14,710 --> 02:55:19,960
that actually the two providers that I

02:55:16,931 --> 02:55:23,950
know of but work with accounts encrypted

02:55:19,960 --> 02:55:28,210
in them are parity which is a lot more

02:55:23,950 --> 02:55:31,210
or meta mask where meta masks USP is

02:55:28,210 --> 02:55:34,440
basically the that they protect your

02:55:31,210 --> 02:55:36,431
keys and they inject web 3 into pages

02:55:34,440 --> 02:55:39,580
apart from that all you can ever do is

02:55:36,431 --> 02:55:43,690
send ether however it is also possible

02:55:39,580 --> 02:55:46,020
to write applications with web 3j s

02:55:43,690 --> 02:55:50,699
where you handle the keys yourself

02:55:46,020 --> 02:55:53,549
so one of the most popular sites in

02:55:50,699 --> 02:55:59,129
etherium is my ether wallet now my the

02:55:53,549 --> 02:56:04,470
wallet is completely JavaScript web 3j s

02:55:59,129 --> 02:56:07,259
but they but you can use private key you

02:56:04,470 --> 02:56:09,299
can use adjacent wallets which they will

02:56:07,259 --> 02:56:11,069
link which they will then use the

02:56:09,299 --> 02:56:14,279
appropriate functions to do the signing

02:56:11,069 --> 02:56:16,140
with there or you can use something like

02:56:14,279 --> 02:56:18,659
this which is a hardware wallet which is

02:56:16,140 --> 02:56:19,949
if you have any either worth keeping you

02:56:18,659 --> 02:56:22,919
should consider getting a hardware

02:56:19,949 --> 02:56:24,600
wallet and then they communicate with

02:56:22,919 --> 02:56:26,879
this using the relevant API to

02:56:24,600 --> 02:56:29,970
communicate this and in these devices

02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:33,180
your keys never leave the wallet right

02:56:29,970 --> 02:56:34,649
the transaction goes in what goes in

02:56:33,180 --> 02:56:38,339
through the serial cable it comes out

02:56:34,649 --> 02:56:40,829
signed again so though there are plenty

02:56:38,339 --> 02:56:45,239
of things with worth you know using web

02:56:40,829 --> 02:56:48,539
3GS some of them do not need to use and

02:56:45,239 --> 02:56:50,609
they sell you know to use another app to

02:56:48,539 --> 02:56:53,609
contain the keys you can get the keys in

02:56:50,609 --> 02:56:55,289
another way and of course it another

02:56:53,609 --> 02:56:56,459
thing you can do with web 3j s if

02:56:55,289 --> 02:56:57,720
there's something going on you can just

02:56:56,459 --> 02:56:58,919
write things that monitor them they

02:56:57,720 --> 02:57:02,009
don't need to always to send

02:56:58,919 --> 02:57:04,890
transactions so you know what's the

02:57:02,009 --> 02:57:07,289
state of a sale contract and you just

02:57:04,890 --> 02:57:10,080
just extract the numbers then you don't

02:57:07,289 --> 02:57:17,520
need any signing at all

02:57:10,080 --> 02:57:19,670
yes okay there was a I think we were

02:57:17,520 --> 02:57:23,460
like officially we are ending up to five

02:57:19,670 --> 02:57:27,479
but we're happy to stay here as long as

02:57:23,460 --> 02:57:31,800
you guys want and we can do more to an a

02:57:27,479 --> 02:57:35,450
and maybe code warranty guys one's gonna

02:57:31,800 --> 02:57:41,920
answer a few questions right in

02:57:35,450 --> 02:57:41,920
[Music]

02:57:42,590 --> 02:57:48,649
hmm t-shirts with questions yeah

02:57:56,450 --> 02:58:02,430
yeah I'd like that I'm just making a

02:57:59,280 --> 02:58:05,311
super dummy like state no code just

02:58:02,430 --> 02:58:08,130
administrate how simple it can be to

02:58:05,311 --> 02:58:11,101
just like receive or send pumps so

02:58:08,130 --> 02:58:13,860
basically this is like so official I do

02:58:11,101 --> 02:58:19,260
you specify to your destination address

02:58:13,860 --> 02:58:21,720
first of your store your you have a

02:58:19,260 --> 02:58:23,910
story he'll be more wallet and you

02:58:21,720 --> 02:58:26,430
specify those two and then you specify

02:58:23,910 --> 02:58:28,021
the value a few product and when this

02:58:26,430 --> 02:58:32,190
function is being executed the one that

02:58:28,021 --> 02:58:36,180
I sent in connections okay in in a

02:58:32,190 --> 02:58:37,590
browser the again the mizzenmast

02:58:36,180 --> 02:58:38,820
confirmation get up a lot and when

02:58:37,590 --> 02:58:41,940
people click buy that means that

02:58:38,820 --> 02:58:43,860
production is being signed and you get

02:58:41,940 --> 02:58:46,050
the user and you get like there's

02:58:43,860 --> 02:58:48,960
transaction verification sort of

02:58:46,050 --> 02:58:50,521
information thing that you can make

02:58:48,960 --> 02:58:52,620
everyone can see it never has access to

02:58:50,521 --> 02:58:54,000
and you can see that it actually happens

02:58:52,620 --> 02:58:57,480
so you can get actually to the

02:58:54,000 --> 02:58:59,730
transaction you can make explore it you

02:58:57,480 --> 02:59:01,590
can play around with my destination to

02:58:59,730 --> 02:59:06,061
add rows you can see what happened here

02:59:01,590 --> 02:59:07,710
you can go to to to my site and might

02:59:06,061 --> 02:59:10,050
play around but there's actually make

02:59:07,710 --> 02:59:13,800
you feel look at another food I made it

02:59:10,050 --> 02:59:16,070
like super dummy simple so you just cuz

02:59:13,800 --> 02:59:16,070
he did

02:59:17,280 --> 02:59:22,860
at some time there was a having a

02:59:19,940 --> 02:59:25,430
meeting code seriously even wanna

02:59:22,860 --> 02:59:25,430
cookies that

02:59:27,500 --> 02:59:30,610
[Music]

02:59:46,931 --> 02:59:53,131
come again I say you're to paint the

02:59:50,980 --> 02:59:53,131
ceiling

02:59:56,220 --> 03:00:01,370
that'd be a transaction for his money

02:59:59,700 --> 03:00:04,390
let's get that ring woman

03:00:01,370 --> 03:00:04,390
but we agree with

03:00:06,890 --> 03:00:13,080
everybody run yeah you can do that buddy

03:00:11,510 --> 03:00:16,190
bowl kind of doesn't

03:00:13,080 --> 03:00:16,190
[Music]

03:00:19,670 --> 03:00:24,470
yeah you can do that and like I think

03:00:21,920 --> 03:00:25,850
there are other volcanion projects

03:00:24,470 --> 03:00:27,560
someone on facial management budget a

03:00:25,850 --> 03:00:32,500
pretty well-known you can use it with

03:00:27,560 --> 03:00:34,970
them and they specific sign for banks

03:00:32,500 --> 03:00:37,460
yes this is a measure that Kiko Bank

03:00:34,970 --> 03:00:40,700
nature specific design for thank you

03:00:37,460 --> 03:00:45,460
fish with higher throughput their weight

03:00:40,700 --> 03:00:45,460
faster than etherium they might be some

03:00:51,610 --> 03:00:54,610
questions

03:01:02,551 --> 03:01:08,341
yeah so actually yeah that's a very good

03:01:04,620 --> 03:01:10,830
that's a very good thing so the cool

03:01:08,341 --> 03:01:13,530
like really really cool thing about like

03:01:10,830 --> 03:01:18,421
this went through provider what's my new

03:01:13,530 --> 03:01:19,921
eyes messed up so what do you can do you

03:01:18,421 --> 03:01:21,540
can actually make remember you had this

03:01:19,921 --> 03:01:25,610
like spectra I don't know you can

03:01:21,540 --> 03:01:25,610
actually used or web 3 provider and

03:01:26,900 --> 03:01:35,190
injecting back 3 so now now remix is

03:01:31,771 --> 03:01:39,751
connected to whatever network my mutant

03:01:35,190 --> 03:01:43,551
mask is connected okay so if my medium

03:01:39,751 --> 03:01:47,211
ass is connected to my local Takanashi

03:01:43,551 --> 03:01:51,990
environment it'll basically be

03:01:47,211 --> 03:01:54,841
interacting with ganache okay and so the

03:01:51,990 --> 03:02:03,530
people thing what I can do is let me

03:01:54,841 --> 03:02:03,530
connect it to directly thank you

03:02:05,290 --> 03:02:16,170
okay and I can do some magic where's my

03:02:13,330 --> 03:02:16,170
super complex

03:02:16,479 --> 03:02:19,380
you know it's not that

03:02:19,920 --> 03:02:28,030
okay so we have this remember we deploy

03:02:21,990 --> 03:02:30,840
the contract over there I can okay

03:02:28,030 --> 03:02:30,840
come on

03:02:36,450 --> 03:02:40,761
did I spell it right probably didn't

03:02:38,341 --> 03:02:40,761
know

03:02:42,650 --> 03:02:46,750
I have no medium spelling is not my

03:02:44,511 --> 03:02:46,750
forte

03:02:48,061 --> 03:02:53,490
hold on I need me to keep it exactly the

03:02:50,160 --> 03:02:55,170
same so what I can do is I call me paste

03:02:53,490 --> 03:02:57,480
in my code and remember that we deployed

03:02:55,170 --> 03:03:00,511
this contract and was sitting at this

03:02:57,480 --> 03:03:04,351
address I can actually load it at this

03:03:00,511 --> 03:03:06,601
address and it will compile again this

03:03:04,351 --> 03:03:10,021
thing in the memory and provide some

03:03:06,601 --> 03:03:14,101
lovely interfaces okay so I can

03:03:10,021 --> 03:03:16,410
basically from remix I can interact with

03:03:14,101 --> 03:03:18,870
my contracts that are on my local

03:03:16,410 --> 03:03:20,641
machine basically I'm interacting with a

03:03:18,870 --> 03:03:23,040
contract that is here and I can call

03:03:20,641 --> 03:03:25,230
it's it's factions and if I call they

03:03:23,040 --> 03:03:27,271
get an owner it will get the owner of

03:03:25,230 --> 03:03:30,090
the contract which was said to this when

03:03:27,271 --> 03:03:34,380
I was deploying it if I get me nothing's

03:03:30,090 --> 03:03:37,860
gonna happen if I vote there's gonna be

03:03:34,380 --> 03:03:40,230
a vote but because we were because I'm

03:03:37,860 --> 03:03:44,820
not there was no function to retrieve

03:03:40,230 --> 03:03:45,511
the load but it buddies but it happened

03:03:44,820 --> 03:03:47,641
I knew it

03:03:45,511 --> 03:03:49,740
and everyone can see that it's okay

03:03:47,641 --> 03:03:53,101
there is even an event happened like

03:03:49,740 --> 03:03:54,690
voted remember we had this wall string

03:03:53,101 --> 03:03:58,101
so this has been most winning that's

03:03:54,690 --> 03:03:58,101
event log screen

03:03:58,790 --> 03:04:01,790
okay

03:04:04,630 --> 03:04:07,560
okay sorry

03:04:13,670 --> 03:04:19,710
okay so okay so Mysore walnut I know

03:04:18,870 --> 03:04:23,550
this isn't easy

03:04:19,710 --> 03:04:25,260
no but it gives it up no no no it's my

03:04:23,550 --> 03:04:29,760
wallet pick up a contract pick up the

03:04:25,260 --> 03:04:31,220
API the cony crayon whether that's going

03:04:29,760 --> 03:04:35,270
to be interacting with your content

03:04:31,220 --> 03:04:35,270
right okay

03:04:42,320 --> 03:04:49,811
don't say okay coming in noise so

03:04:48,230 --> 03:04:53,570
basically again

03:04:49,811 --> 03:04:56,601
what do you are you following me when

03:04:53,570 --> 03:05:02,961
you compile and deploy the contract you

03:04:56,601 --> 03:05:05,980
receive this JSON object right you need

03:05:02,961 --> 03:05:09,561
to require it as part of your front-end

03:05:05,980 --> 03:05:10,881
absence like your JavaScript app you're

03:05:09,561 --> 03:05:13,431
required and you have to help a few

03:05:10,881 --> 03:05:15,261
other things like TOEFL contract web 3

03:05:13,431 --> 03:05:18,771
which is like a sniper through private

03:05:15,261 --> 03:05:22,391
so no likely that kind of provides us

03:05:18,771 --> 03:05:27,980
like equate with the booking and then

03:05:22,391 --> 03:05:33,591
you set like a cure provider which is

03:05:27,980 --> 03:05:35,181
basically assigning assigning and like

03:05:33,591 --> 03:05:37,161
giving access to a contract to the

03:05:35,181 --> 03:05:39,440
approach environment as nice or around

03:05:37,161 --> 03:05:42,171
the country it's like a wraparound

03:05:39,440 --> 03:05:44,181
contract right and then when you use

03:05:42,171 --> 03:05:47,301
your contracting that it's just like

03:05:44,181 --> 03:05:48,681
your contract deployed and then you have

03:05:47,301 --> 03:05:53,801
an instance and many cold actual

03:05:48,681 --> 03:05:53,801
functions and more or less

03:05:58,570 --> 03:06:03,960
if you're doing the function like if

03:06:01,690 --> 03:06:07,240
you're calling the function that is

03:06:03,960 --> 03:06:11,740
changing a stage in your contract yes it

03:06:07,240 --> 03:06:14,141
will cause it will trigger this makes

03:06:11,740 --> 03:06:20,920
mask signage pop-up window where you can

03:06:14,141 --> 03:06:25,450
accept or reject to read data you do not

03:06:20,920 --> 03:06:27,551
need to you don't need to sign and you

03:06:25,450 --> 03:06:30,070
are nuanced the problem when you read

03:06:27,551 --> 03:06:32,740
data the read coal is actually having

03:06:30,070 --> 03:06:37,660
only on one on one note and it doesn't

03:06:32,740 --> 03:06:42,070
cost any even right if you're having

03:06:37,660 --> 03:06:44,620
certain function like vote because it

03:06:42,070 --> 03:06:46,960
changes the this is these are these

03:06:44,620 --> 03:06:52,630
stage where I always write if you change

03:06:46,960 --> 03:06:54,641
any of this you will have to spend gas

03:06:52,630 --> 03:06:56,200
I'm changing them if you are reading

03:06:54,641 --> 03:06:58,480
them if you have like how about

03:06:56,200 --> 03:07:02,650
functionally okay get my looked it's

03:06:58,480 --> 03:07:04,450
just like bonus retrieves the go vote it

03:07:02,650 --> 03:07:06,990
cause your meter and it doesn't require

03:07:04,450 --> 03:07:06,990
any side

03:07:08,439 --> 03:07:13,239
come again oh yeah

03:07:14,929 --> 03:07:21,699
ha ha you can't today those weenie

03:07:22,419 --> 03:07:29,409
you really like you connected to the

03:07:25,640 --> 03:07:29,409
noon and there are millions of thousands

03:07:31,479 --> 03:07:36,939
that you can bring down one load it's

03:07:35,299 --> 03:07:40,069
not a problem

03:07:36,939 --> 03:07:47,029
well yeah but the but the network

03:07:40,069 --> 03:07:48,169
doesn't go down true you're more like

03:07:47,029 --> 03:07:58,619
it's bringing machine down the new

03:07:48,169 --> 03:08:02,719
orders there's pay for the website yes

03:07:58,619 --> 03:08:02,719
to run the load yes

03:08:04,139 --> 03:08:09,389
most most people do it to keep to keep

03:08:06,239 --> 03:08:10,469
the environment alive because it's in

03:08:09,389 --> 03:08:13,469
their interest to keep the environment

03:08:10,469 --> 03:08:16,109
alive it's not a significant awake make

03:08:13,469 --> 03:08:23,100
for say you know ways if you're just

03:08:16,109 --> 03:08:24,659
weaning if the specific node you can

03:08:23,100 --> 03:08:26,999
meet again you can bring the node down

03:08:24,659 --> 03:08:30,049
but you'll never in the never pound we

03:08:26,999 --> 03:08:30,049
can connect to any other node

03:08:37,390 --> 03:08:41,840
yeah most of what goes on is submitting

03:08:40,039 --> 03:08:43,550
transactions yeah right now when you

03:08:41,840 --> 03:08:45,199
submit transactions they cost you money

03:08:43,550 --> 03:08:47,630
and you ain't gonna ddos by spending

03:08:45,199 --> 03:08:49,819
money yeah that's the whole that's the

03:08:47,630 --> 03:08:52,039
the whole crux about gas in the first

03:08:49,819 --> 03:08:54,020
place and the other thing about gas is

03:08:52,039 --> 03:08:56,029
because you have the gas limit yet it

03:08:54,020 --> 03:08:59,680
stops you having like infinite loops and

03:08:56,029 --> 03:08:59,680
things like that you've run out of gas

03:09:05,409 --> 03:09:10,010
yeah but they'll recurring it on

03:09:07,250 --> 03:09:11,539
different notes yeah you end up querying

03:09:10,010 --> 03:09:14,210
it on the one which is closest to you

03:09:11,539 --> 03:09:16,430
most of the time yeah it's if everybody

03:09:14,210 --> 03:09:19,760
is going to a single webpage which is

03:09:16,430 --> 03:09:21,199
talking to a single provider then you've

03:09:19,760 --> 03:09:24,189
got a centralization which wasn't what

03:09:21,199 --> 03:09:24,189
you're after in the first place

03:09:25,061 --> 03:09:27,660
yeah

03:09:33,710 --> 03:09:42,560
so come out with okay if you're paying

03:09:37,090 --> 03:09:49,640
such a okay now comes the bit which I

03:09:42,560 --> 03:09:53,569
avoided talking about so running a node

03:09:49,640 --> 03:09:55,310
is not that expensive I mean I'd rather

03:09:53,569 --> 03:09:58,910
know most of the time on my back but

03:09:55,310 --> 03:10:01,010
when I turn it on the only time it kept

03:09:58,910 --> 03:10:02,810
already time it cost me before there I

03:10:01,010 --> 03:10:06,340
did it on mobile I used up all of my

03:10:02,810 --> 03:10:06,340
mobile italics in one night

03:10:07,311 --> 03:10:14,240
mining is something different the whole

03:10:11,240 --> 03:10:15,351
concept of mining like we're still using

03:10:14,240 --> 03:10:17,630
the same concepts that we'll put in

03:10:15,351 --> 03:10:23,690
place by the Bitcoin is called proof of

03:10:17,630 --> 03:10:26,570
work and the aim is to make sure that no

03:10:23,690 --> 03:10:29,110
one miner no matter how powerful his

03:10:26,570 --> 03:10:31,610
machine mines all the transactions

03:10:29,110 --> 03:10:32,780
because if you mind all the transactions

03:10:31,610 --> 03:10:37,910
you can rewrite and rewrite the

03:10:32,780 --> 03:10:40,360
blockchain nobody would know so in order

03:10:37,910 --> 03:10:43,280
to do that then there is an artificial

03:10:40,360 --> 03:10:48,021
contest was in place for proof of work

03:10:43,280 --> 03:10:53,870
and what that says is that in order to

03:10:48,021 --> 03:10:56,650
submit a block you need to make make the

03:10:53,870 --> 03:10:56,650
block hash

03:10:56,779 --> 03:11:03,890
meet an artificial what's the word

03:11:01,069 --> 03:11:05,750
conditional the other so for example we

03:11:03,890 --> 03:11:07,220
could say at the moment the numerical

03:11:05,750 --> 03:11:11,149
value of the block hash has to be less

03:11:07,220 --> 03:11:13,640
than 1,500 or something like that now

03:11:11,149 --> 03:11:14,810
obviously if you just randomly select

03:11:13,640 --> 03:11:16,279
blocks that's very unlikely to be true

03:11:14,810 --> 03:11:17,569
so you're gonna have to reorganize you

03:11:16,279 --> 03:11:19,399
can have to change nonce is you gonna

03:11:17,569 --> 03:11:21,609
have to keep on trying until you have a

03:11:19,399 --> 03:11:24,859
block that meets those conditions and

03:11:21,609 --> 03:11:26,540
there aren't that but in all as a reward

03:11:24,859 --> 03:11:28,430
for that you get the certain amount of

03:11:26,540 --> 03:11:30,890
ether which at the moment is three ether

03:11:28,430 --> 03:11:33,950
for the block plus all of the

03:11:30,890 --> 03:11:36,770
transaction fees right now the

03:11:33,950 --> 03:11:39,380
transaction fee that you pay is the gas

03:11:36,770 --> 03:11:44,569
you use multiplied by the price you

03:11:39,380 --> 03:11:47,239
offered for the gas right so also coming

03:11:44,569 --> 03:11:49,010
into it if I as a minor want to mine a

03:11:47,239 --> 03:11:50,479
block I will choose the ones which offer

03:11:49,010 --> 03:11:52,840
me the highest gas prices they'll make

03:11:50,479 --> 03:11:55,460
the most notes out of that block right

03:11:52,840 --> 03:11:58,130
so the miners get paid that's where your

03:11:55,460 --> 03:12:00,479
transaction fees go to the miners to

03:11:58,130 --> 03:12:04,109
keep the system fair

03:12:00,479 --> 03:12:34,199
now they're up there working on

03:12:04,109 --> 03:12:36,959
something which is because because it's

03:12:34,199 --> 03:12:38,969
a difficult thing to win but it relies

03:12:36,959 --> 03:12:42,299
as much on chance as it does on

03:12:38,969 --> 03:12:44,129
computing power it tends to get

03:12:42,299 --> 03:12:46,609
generally distributed amongst different

03:12:44,129 --> 03:12:49,020
miners right

03:12:46,609 --> 03:12:51,180
does that find them up sweet transaction

03:12:49,020 --> 03:12:54,989
of these ago

03:12:51,180 --> 03:12:57,449
the functions are they evaluated once by

03:12:54,989 --> 03:12:59,970
the minor and then results of the

03:12:57,449 --> 03:13:02,430
function of the new state is that part

03:12:59,970 --> 03:13:02,970
of the block or like the function needs

03:13:02,430 --> 03:13:06,659
to be valued

03:13:02,970 --> 03:13:10,560
every time the computing - okay you did

03:13:06,659 --> 03:13:14,970
you submit a transaction which changes

03:13:10,560 --> 03:13:18,810
the state of a contract the minor will

03:13:14,970 --> 03:13:20,550
prove that that is valid he'll either

03:13:18,810 --> 03:13:22,649
prove it succeeds or fails but whatever

03:13:20,550 --> 03:13:27,749
happens he will include it in the block

03:13:22,649 --> 03:13:29,189
right every node on the network well at

03:13:27,749 --> 03:13:32,840
the moment they include it in the block

03:13:29,189 --> 03:13:38,909
they will compute the state of the

03:13:32,840 --> 03:13:41,130
etherium machine I mean does it cost the

03:13:38,909 --> 03:13:43,560
miner more if you have a function that's

03:13:41,130 --> 03:13:45,060
very expensive versus a function that's

03:13:43,560 --> 03:13:49,489
cheap because what you said is like more

03:13:45,060 --> 03:13:54,180
yeah I mean okay every block has got a

03:13:49,489 --> 03:13:56,999
gas limit right so you can either have a

03:13:54,180 --> 03:13:59,970
few really expensive transactions or a

03:13:56,999 --> 03:14:02,850
lot of really cheap transactions

03:13:59,970 --> 03:14:05,700
right because you know the whole point

03:14:02,850 --> 03:14:09,210
about the gas property or the gas price

03:14:05,700 --> 03:14:11,220
of a transaction is that yeah if you've

03:14:09,210 --> 03:14:15,390
got a repeated loop which takes a lot of

03:14:11,220 --> 03:14:18,180
computing power then that will cost more

03:14:15,390 --> 03:14:20,609
than just a simple piece of code if

03:14:18,180 --> 03:14:23,399
you've got something which uses a lot of

03:14:20,609 --> 03:14:26,220
state variables that is more expensive

03:14:23,399 --> 03:14:28,770
than using local memory because it's

03:14:26,220 --> 03:14:30,660
more companies yep the computation of

03:14:28,770 --> 03:14:34,800
moving information after state variables

03:14:30,660 --> 03:14:36,600
that actually higher so the gas the gas

03:14:34,800 --> 03:14:39,690
limit you have to provide is actually

03:14:36,600 --> 03:14:42,510
based upon how much work has to be done

03:14:39,690 --> 03:14:45,061
so to compute a block the miners also

03:14:42,510 --> 03:14:46,561
computing these hashes right yeah shout

03:14:45,061 --> 03:14:49,641
256 in Bitcoin

03:14:46,561 --> 03:14:53,190
it's called catch up to five six years

03:14:49,641 --> 03:15:00,360
it's like this close to a three so so I

03:14:53,190 --> 03:15:02,580
mean yeah so how does the cost of doing

03:15:00,360 --> 03:15:03,990
that compared with the cost of computing

03:15:02,580 --> 03:15:05,880
your function even if it has a loop that

03:15:03,990 --> 03:15:07,230
runs to a thousand inside it like your

03:15:05,880 --> 03:15:09,271
contract might have a function that runs

03:15:07,230 --> 03:15:11,130
to a thousand but that's still really

03:15:09,271 --> 03:15:14,160
cheap in the scheme of things for the

03:15:11,130 --> 03:15:17,221
minor compared to you know computing a

03:15:14,160 --> 03:15:19,800
check to 56 like a billion um really

03:15:17,221 --> 03:15:24,030
cheap as in walk I have you seen later

03:15:19,800 --> 03:15:25,891
CD time well the point is I mean now we

03:15:24,030 --> 03:15:27,660
get to economics promote most miners it

03:15:25,891 --> 03:15:31,800
still they still economical to do so

03:15:27,660 --> 03:15:36,061
otherwise it wouldn't be mining I mean I

03:15:31,800 --> 03:15:38,280
mean I I have a mind from the year and a

03:15:36,061 --> 03:15:40,771
half but I mean I was making money out

03:15:38,280 --> 03:15:42,601
of it obviously other people are people

03:15:40,771 --> 03:15:45,090
are looking reducing the costs there's

03:15:42,601 --> 03:15:47,700
one project called hydro miner where

03:15:45,090 --> 03:15:51,181
they're where they take industrial

03:15:47,700 --> 03:15:52,771
containers full of miners they pop them

03:15:51,181 --> 03:15:54,240
right next to hydroelectric dams in

03:15:52,771 --> 03:15:58,141
Austria and they buy wholesale

03:15:54,240 --> 03:16:00,290
electricity from the dam it you know

03:15:58,141 --> 03:16:03,000
this far more economical logically

03:16:00,290 --> 03:16:04,440
viable for the simple reason that then

03:16:03,000 --> 03:16:07,311
you know they're not going anything to

03:16:04,440 --> 03:16:07,311
get the electricity

03:16:07,689 --> 03:16:11,540
but I mean yes I mean that's why we're

03:16:10,340 --> 03:16:15,200
trying to get away we're trying to get

03:16:11,540 --> 03:16:17,300
away from proof of work on a theory it

03:16:15,200 --> 03:16:20,660
should be sometime in the next year

03:16:17,300 --> 03:16:23,630
hopefully that there are one or two

03:16:20,660 --> 03:16:26,930
networks out there the acutal network

03:16:23,630 --> 03:16:28,580
uses cruise state which means you're not

03:16:26,930 --> 03:16:30,830
doing as many computations I don't think

03:16:28,580 --> 03:16:32,780
graphic cars to do it in fact on cues

03:16:30,830 --> 03:16:34,580
and they say you can actually do you can

03:16:32,780 --> 03:16:37,070
actually do mining using a Raspberry Pi

03:16:34,580 --> 03:16:39,580
if you want to as effectively as a

03:16:37,070 --> 03:16:39,580
mainframe

03:16:42,090 --> 03:16:47,039
questions of our

03:16:44,229 --> 03:16:47,039
the folk

03:16:48,720 --> 03:16:52,811
and it doesn't it doesn't have it

03:16:51,130 --> 03:16:55,930
doesn't have any impact on the

03:16:52,811 --> 03:16:59,290
blockchain this Jeffs is just it makes

03:16:55,930 --> 03:17:00,670
it generates a lot of heat it uses a lot

03:16:59,290 --> 03:17:02,940
of power and contributes to global

03:17:00,670 --> 03:17:02,940
warming

03:17:07,440 --> 03:17:16,380
yeah I really don't go into into that

03:17:13,570 --> 03:17:16,380
I'm afraid it's

03:17:20,730 --> 03:17:26,270
are you doing ramen yeah okay

03:17:24,020 --> 03:17:29,351
yeah we're we're over time but it on

03:17:26,270 --> 03:17:32,681
happy overnight

03:17:29,351 --> 03:17:35,490
we are more questions do more coding do

03:17:32,681 --> 03:17:35,490
whatever you guys want

03:17:44,979 --> 03:17:54,520
never trust anything okay rose security

03:17:50,449 --> 03:18:03,020
Rose it in in working with on both

03:17:54,520 --> 03:18:07,189
changing with any values changes in the

03:18:03,020 --> 03:18:08,899
crashing comments contact if anything's

03:18:07,189 --> 03:18:13,159
got a server side it means someone to

03:18:08,899 --> 03:18:17,239
steal your kids right when you create a

03:18:13,159 --> 03:18:21,140
mess emotion wallet it gives you is it

03:18:17,239 --> 03:18:22,579
twelve twelve words Yannick yeah it

03:18:21,140 --> 03:18:24,170
gives you a monitor in the Manik twelve

03:18:22,579 --> 03:18:27,050
words just like the ones you see at the

03:18:24,170 --> 03:18:30,979
top there using those my formula called

03:18:27,050 --> 03:18:35,260
VIP thirty-nine you can regenerate the

03:18:30,979 --> 03:18:37,909
private key public key pair when you get

03:18:35,260 --> 03:18:40,220
so meta math tells them you're supposed

03:18:37,909 --> 03:18:43,291
to write them down and don't be like the

03:18:40,220 --> 03:18:46,141
clever person who stored it in

03:18:43,291 --> 03:18:48,451
Ethan and what equal Evernote I mean

03:18:46,141 --> 03:18:49,801
anything however no got hacked and so

03:18:48,451 --> 03:18:52,261
she lost up her heels she lost her

03:18:49,801 --> 03:18:54,570
private keys she loves all that so yeah

03:18:52,261 --> 03:18:56,190
but some magic here like for something

03:18:54,570 --> 03:18:59,661
if I use the same you money you know you

03:18:56,190 --> 03:19:03,700
this is a popular muonic do not use it

03:18:59,661 --> 03:19:07,380
your fans right here Rodney money why

03:19:03,700 --> 03:19:09,770
[Music]

03:19:07,380 --> 03:19:15,310
because they extract like

03:19:09,770 --> 03:19:15,310
maybe there's an extra life he's not

03:19:16,311 --> 03:19:20,771
where's a female condition 8 years over

03:19:22,801 --> 03:19:32,961
it's a root key so I used this 12:12

03:19:28,620 --> 03:19:32,961
works thank you sir

03:19:33,700 --> 03:19:38,840
[Music]

03:19:36,460 --> 03:19:40,521
but you got paste that if you go and

03:19:38,840 --> 03:19:42,790
paste it here they give you answers I'm

03:19:40,521 --> 03:19:42,790
clean

03:19:49,189 --> 03:19:52,330
I'll be 15

03:19:52,500 --> 03:19:57,810
so basically in theory should be

03:19:54,600 --> 03:20:00,600
creating with the same yes well he bears

03:19:57,810 --> 03:20:02,641
I say I'm right now which which I took

03:20:00,600 --> 03:20:05,820
unconnected

03:20:02,641 --> 03:20:09,591
oh it doesn't matter that doesn't matter

03:20:05,820 --> 03:20:09,591
it's just like a bunch of bad taste

03:20:15,760 --> 03:20:19,050
losing one important

03:20:25,409 --> 03:20:28,819
that is the derivation problem

03:20:34,390 --> 03:20:40,670
but given the VIP 39 function it doesn't

03:20:38,660 --> 03:20:42,890
get though that phrase does not give you

03:20:40,670 --> 03:20:46,311
one address it gives you a sequence of

03:20:42,890 --> 03:20:48,860
addresses right so meta mask has it I

03:20:46,311 --> 03:20:51,830
say do not store it on a computer

03:20:48,860 --> 03:20:53,840
write it down take a photograph of it

03:20:51,830 --> 03:20:56,120
with a real camera develop the film

03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:57,830
yourself and put it in a safe whatever

03:20:56,120 --> 03:20:59,750
you want to do but it certainly does

03:20:57,830 --> 03:21:02,960
story and Evernote or something which

03:20:59,750 --> 03:21:06,940
could be hacked you have these wallets

03:21:02,960 --> 03:21:06,940
that I showed you before which should be

03:21:07,140 --> 03:21:12,659
this is a legend a no this is us the

03:21:10,800 --> 03:21:15,419
same thing your software can talk to it

03:21:12,659 --> 03:21:17,249
through USB cable this does the signing

03:21:15,419 --> 03:21:19,859
your little buttons on here when you

03:21:17,249 --> 03:21:21,329
first initialize it in an initializer

03:21:19,859 --> 03:21:24,510
into a random state it gives you a

03:21:21,329 --> 03:21:28,140
24-bit phrase you write it down you

03:21:24,510 --> 03:21:30,149
don't write and if you do that you might

03:21:28,140 --> 03:21:32,189
also want to think about some way that

03:21:30,149 --> 03:21:36,119
you can distribute it to a few relatives

03:21:32,189 --> 03:21:38,510
if you pop off wife and family can be

03:21:36,119 --> 03:21:43,979
looked after

03:21:38,510 --> 03:21:48,029
right security is very important right

03:21:43,979 --> 03:21:50,300
so that that now brings us so Mike your

03:21:48,029 --> 03:21:53,039
wallets should never have a back-end

03:21:50,300 --> 03:21:56,640
most of the phishing attacks that take

03:21:53,039 --> 03:21:59,520
place are fake site they are fakes of

03:21:56,640 --> 03:22:01,199
sites like money for wallet where they

03:21:59,520 --> 03:22:04,100
put a back-end on it they ask you to

03:22:01,199 --> 03:22:06,300
upload the JSON file put in the password

03:22:04,100 --> 03:22:07,829
which is exactly what message to ask

03:22:06,300 --> 03:22:09,890
money so what it does with money Thor

03:22:07,829 --> 03:22:13,379
what it does everything in the browser

03:22:09,890 --> 03:22:14,939
the moment they've got a back-end they

03:22:13,379 --> 03:22:17,399
got your file they've got they've got

03:22:14,939 --> 03:22:20,270
your password the next thing you know is

03:22:17,399 --> 03:22:20,270
you've lost order easy

03:22:29,100 --> 03:22:31,579
yes

03:22:33,100 --> 03:22:38,329
today Aaron like requiring this API file

03:22:36,560 --> 03:22:40,159
and tracking a bit further

03:22:38,329 --> 03:22:42,289
I have one little tuning I still have

03:22:40,159 --> 03:22:45,229
one with two t-shirts but I have XXL and

03:22:42,289 --> 03:22:47,210
an exit on the XXL in Excel if you've

03:22:45,229 --> 03:22:54,279
got any big thing that hit you like a

03:22:47,210 --> 03:22:54,279
t-shirt can see me okay

03:22:58,430 --> 03:23:02,210
thank you guys for coming hope it was

03:23:00,350 --> 03:23:04,340
not really confusing if it was confusing

03:23:02,210 --> 03:23:05,569
feel free to continue asking questions

03:23:04,340 --> 03:23:09,409
in a chat

03:23:05,569 --> 03:23:13,039
pick your patients and follow up ton of

03:23:09,409 --> 03:23:13,609
resources online live event yet made a

03:23:13,039 --> 03:23:20,109
photo together
