In this workshop, we will cover the basics of SVG - especially SVG paths and the cubic bezier curve command - as well as an introduction to D3.js's selection, data-binding, and enter-update-exit patterns. The culmination of the workshop will be to create a set of flowers out of movie data, a simpler version of the film flowers here.
