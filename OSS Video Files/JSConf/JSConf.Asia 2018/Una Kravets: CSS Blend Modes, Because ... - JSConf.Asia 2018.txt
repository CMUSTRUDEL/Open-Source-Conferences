Publication date: 2018-02-13
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	CSS Blend modes are underutilized and can be used for a variety of things from improving image performance to creating scalable styling. This talk goes over some case studies where blend modes can make a big impact, talks about browser support, and also discusses workaround for including blend modes where they aren't supported.
Tour the wide world of CSS Blend modes and learn why you may want to introduce them in your own web-based projects today!

00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,720
thank you that the intro was awesome

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,330
like I can't see up here with all these

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,240
things fired up I'm just mind blown so

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,439
hi I'm here to talk to you about CSS

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,420
what a great way to kick off a

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:36,149
JavaScript conference right thank you

00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:39,600
so what a beautiful place

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:42,629
we are in right I was so excited to come

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,210
here and if you google Singapore you get

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:48,090
beautiful rainbow skies and images like

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:51,930
this so here's my expectation of

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:58,350
Singapore and then here's a video from

00:00:51,930 --> 00:01:00,239
my room at the hotel that's ok this is

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,609
life it happens I'm so happy to be here

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,379
still as you heard my name is Yuna you

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,799
can find me at you know on Twitter

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,210
github code pen all the things so if

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,549
you're interested in this topic if you

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,680
interested in filters blend modes a web

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,380
image performance I write about those

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,869
things online at you know I am that's my

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:24,270
blog I also co-host a podcast called

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:26,400
tools day so you can check out tools day

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,549
it's bi-weekly this year where we talk

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,439
more about JavaScript things as well

00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:33,150
so as you heard I have a brand new job I

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,350
started with like three weeks ago and

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,450
they let me come here so I was like

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,790
thank you bustle but basically I'm doing

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,579
a lot of creative product development

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:44,939
and I'm super stoked to be there so

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,280
blend modes because I really wanted to

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,200
give this talk because I feel like there

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,600
is an elephant in the room when I talk

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,869
about blend modes so really this talk is

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,340
like a love letter to a specific company

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,649
that is actually sponsoring the next

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,219
break this talk is called blend modes

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,970
because but really it's called edge

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:10,869
should implement blend modes because

00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:12,580
so blend modes are something that people

00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:14,200
have been talking about for a long time

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,000
now they're not even new they're not

00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,020
even like the hot new thing like CSS

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,240
critter variables

00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:22,630
they've existed for years and this has

00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:27,550
been a ticket open on the edge user

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:30,970
voice website since August 2014 and it's

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,340
still on the backlog meanwhile every

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,990
other browser every single browser has

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,300
been planted blend modes three years ago

00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,190
like this isn't new it's just something

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,500
that's kind of waiting to happen

00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:51,310
I don't know why this is this is how I

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:53,320
feel anyway so here I'm going to talk to

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,180
you about blend modes how to use them

00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,310
and we're gonna start with some notes

00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,020
and caveats about blend modes then I'm

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,280
gonna get into how blend modes work I'm

00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,050
going to rush through this because

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,760
there's a lot of content that I want to

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,220
share with you and then we're gonna talk

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,560
about the utility of blend modes so how

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,940
you can really get the most out of them

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,770
and here is where I'm going to talk

00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,209
about simplicity how they can help with

00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,380
simplicity how they can help with

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,880
uniformity consistency and performance

00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,230
so we're gonna talk about all these

00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,910
things throughout this talk and then

00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,800
also touch on creativity we're all

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,890
showcase some cool things created with

00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,959
blend modes so first some caveats and

00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,900
things to note this is the current

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,880
browser support matrix full support on

00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,950
most browsers Safari has partial support

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,510
so they don't support some of the blend

00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,980
modes it's really important that you do

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,720
browser tests if you're implementing

00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,180
these and also to implement them in a

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,430
progressively enhanced way and as you

00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,800
can see ie an edge don't really house

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,060
the barn just sayin so there's two

00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,500
different types of black nodes there's

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,510
mixed blend mode where you can mix

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,550
different elements together on the page

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,350
and there's also background blend mode

00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,880
so background blend mode allows you to

00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,070
mix elements that have multiple

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,380
backgrounds into the other backgrounds

00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,600
so there are polyfills for background

00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,130
blend mode that use canvas to do this

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,959
kind of mixing but I feel pretty

00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:10,090
strongly that you shouldn't really need

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,590
to use polyfills when using blend modes

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,810
they should just be something that you

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,030
use for progressive enhancement so two

00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,810
different ways to use them also I want

00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:19,180
to say that there's

00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,980
interpolation when you use variables so

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,010
if I hover over this image I'm applying

00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:26,020
this multiply blend mode on top of this

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,030
image of Singapore but you don't see any

00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,070
change you can't interpolate because

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,230
there are no keyframe values that the

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,480
CSS can apply to make those changes it's

00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,210
just a switch it's binary on or off but

00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,430
you can combine blend modes with any

00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,190
other CSS properties including filters

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:44,350
and filters do interpolate so you can

00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,169
sort of get this sort of blurring in

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,169
effect if you apply with filters so it's

00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:51,220
still kind of a little bit of a hack but

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:54,490
this is something to note it's a little

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,820
caveat so okay let's talk about blend

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:58,120
modes

00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:00,760
what are they blend modes are any way to

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,090
combine or mix pixels with each other

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,520
through a series of algorithms and those

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,900
also vary based on the blend mode there

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,750
are a lot of different blend modes out

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,490
there specifically in CSS we have a few

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,130
different blend mode groups you have the

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,780
darken group these all darken based on

00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,139
the active layer on top the background

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,810
layer

00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:22,300
there's the Lightning group there is the

00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,030
contrast group there's an inversion

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,100
group and finally a component group of

00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,840
blend modes we're going to talk about

00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,479
some of these with our beautiful model

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:34,870
here I'm sorry I didn't ask Thomas I

00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:36,610
just threw this in there forgive me the

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,400
most popular blend mode that you'll see

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,740
is multiply what multiply does is it

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,030
acts as a projector if you're looking at

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,530
a projector and you have these two

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,419
layers on top of each other you're

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,000
taking the luminosity so the dark and

00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:49,990
light values of the active layer and

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,030
multiplying them with the layer behind

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:55,419
it so here we just have a hot pink layer

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:57,520
on top of the images so we also have

00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:00,220
something called screen and 3m is the

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,870
exact opposite of multiply so with

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:03,610
screen you're taking an inverse and the

00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,310
way to take inversion when you're

00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,590
looking at these pixel level component

00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:10,810
changes we are going to subtract that

00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:12,789
value from one so you take the inverse

00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,960
of the active layer times the inverse of

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:15,039
the background layer and then you invert

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,950
all of that so you're kind of

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,479
multiplying the light values have you

00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:25,690
all ever seen these amazing creatures

00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:27,620
octopus and cuttlefish are so cool I saw

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,600
this video on Twitter the other day and

00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,850
like blew my mind they have

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,530
photoreceptive cells in there like

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:37,220
bodies in their skin that they can

00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:39,590
expand or contract to camouflage with

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,660
the environment around them the seafloor

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,889
around them it's just mind-blowing to

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:47,750
watch this so I was really inspired by

00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:50,870
this this little guy right here

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,699
it's so cute so I wanted to kind of

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,310
inject it into our talk as well we have

00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:57,680
our little octopus and so what do we

00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,199
want to use here if we want to blend

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,910
this octopus into the background behind

00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:05,030
it then we probably want to use

00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:07,550
something like multiply right because

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,169
that way it just completely blends also

00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,150
one thing I want to note is you can open

00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:13,190
dev tools and just get a list of blend

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,690
modes and start playing that way so if

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,010
we want to see like screen this would be

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,720
the exact opposite of what we want

00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,580
because we want to make sure that light

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,590
fades behind it whenever you have white

00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,630
and you multiply it it disappears but

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:27,530
when you have black and you screen that

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:29,120
that will disappear so next I want to

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,070
talk about to bun modes called darken

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,660
and lighten these are similar to

00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,310
multiply and screen but they work a

00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,370
little bit differently because they work

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:42,440
on the RGB values so in this case we

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:44,690
have RGB 10 250 darkened by RGB 150 100

00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,220
150 now when you darken these values

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:48,740
what you're looking for is the darker

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,630
value between any of those channels any

00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,240
of those color channels so if you

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,789
compare 10 and 150 which one's darker

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,270
like you think about it RGB 0 0 0 is

00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:01,760
black so 10 is darker than 150 it's a

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:04,070
lower value on that spectrum and then if

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:06,680
we compare 200 and 100 you get 100 if

00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,020
you compare 15 150 you get 50 so you

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,530
create these new tones these new values

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,400
out of these colors that you're blending

00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:15,860
same thing with lighting we're looking

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,680
for the higher value to get the lighter

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,750
color and this also works slightly

00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,060
differently than the blend modes of

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,180
screen and multiply so if I want to do a

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:29,020
mix blend mode of screen here and then I

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:33,349
want to apply a mix blend mode of

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,800
lighten you can see here that you see

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:36,749
more of the gray shades with

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,459
and you see some of that color value

00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:40,169
fading out with the screen because of

00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:43,979
how differently those colors are being

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:45,829
generated when you mix them together so

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,209
the next two are difference and

00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:49,709
exclusion so with difference in

00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:52,230
exclusion they're looking for similar

00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:54,269
pixel values and with difference if

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,220
those values are the exact same shade

00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:58,679
the exact same color then they will turn

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,420
black so we've got some like orange on

00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:03,569
this shirt so that turns completely

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,069
black if I remove this then you can see

00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:07,860
that it's a shirt with black on orange

00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:10,079
on it and then with inversion what your

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,720
with exclusion sorry you're gonna have

00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:16,079
those similar values turn to 50% great

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,119
so it's much more muted now you can also

00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:20,519
do this with our octopus but you'll see

00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:22,649
that every single pixel value will be

00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,749
completely the opposite color of what we

00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:27,089
want it to be if we want it to blend he

00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:29,429
is now like bright red stands out not a

00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:30,410
good look for our friend here not what

00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:32,699
he's going for

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:34,379
but you can use these in really

00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:36,989
interesting ways a little while ago I

00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:38,790
created a site called Diffie defeat me

00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:41,279
where you can just take two different

00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,980
websites and get visual regression

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,329
instant and diffic so you can see visual

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,610
regressions on two different pages you

00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:50,069
can look locally versus your production

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:55,230
site your staging we can compare like

00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:58,019
the what was 2018 Jas comp Asia com

00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:02,009
that's the seer site so we can compare

00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:04,259
that to maybe like 2016 site if I have

00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:06,990
internet and it's kind of like see

00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:09,629
visual disk because this works on video

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:11,610
it works on iframes it works on anything

00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:13,439
it doesn't just work on images so you

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,350
could visually see the diffs between the

00:10:13,439 --> 00:10:18,749
two years and it's just with a single

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,689
line of code with your difference blend

00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:25,139
mode so the last section that I want to

00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:26,970
highlight is the component blend modes

00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:28,259
and these are interesting because you

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,059
can really understand like how this

00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:31,649
color system works when you look at

00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:34,470
these blend modes so you have hue

00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:36,600
saturation luminosity the luminosity is

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,009
the light and dark value that it kind of

00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,899
looks like a cone the lightest on top

00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:42,809
the darkest of the bottom the saturation

00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:45,720
is what you get when you're coming from

00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:48,100
a 50% gray and mixing that with a fully

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,620
saturated value of that hue component

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,529
and the hue is what the value is around

00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,990
the color spectrum in this diagram so

00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:57,550
here again we have the hot pink what

00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,350
happens when you mix the hue value is

00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,290
you get sort of like a faded pink

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,779
overlay on Thomas over here if we're

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,430
using saturation because that pink is a

00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,589
lot more vibrant you're keeping all

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,329
those values from the shirt from the

00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:12,310
skin from the books behind him and

00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:13,569
you're just increasing the saturation if

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,550
I wanted to make this even more

00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:17,259
saturated I can make this like yellow or

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,370
something and then you really get the

00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:20,949
saturation but you're just getting that

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,870
that value from it luminosity is just

00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:25,899
the light and dark value because yellow

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,300
is so light we're seeing this look

00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:30,040
really faded and muted out and then

00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:32,199
color is interesting because it actually

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,949
combines multiple blend modes it

00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:38,230
combines the hue and the saturation and

00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:39,790
just mixes the luminosity behind it so

00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,410
this image can be black and white it can

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,300
be color and you would never know it

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:47,889
doesn't really matter what it is because

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:49,209
you're mixing it there so I really enjoy

00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:50,529
using blend modes what makes me enjoy

00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,300
them and even more is when you can

00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:53,980
combine them with multiple colors on a

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,139
single plane and you can do that with

00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,970
CSS gradients so here's just an example

00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:59,980
of a linear gradient with an overlay

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,660
applied to it you can really start to

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,370
get creative here and start playing like

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,079
if you use exclusion it starts to start

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,560
looking really interesting we can use

00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:09,939
color and then I do want to note that

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,680
when I say progressive enhancement there

00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:13,600
are ways to do this with blend modes

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,220
right now if your browser doesn't

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,630
support blend modes it's going to look

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,250
like this and that's not a great user

00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,839
experience you want to make sure that

00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,269
your user is still seeing something

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,699
still seeing the image so instead of

00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:26,620
applying blend modes on top you can then

00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:28,300
apply the blend mode behind the image

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,189
and use what we just learned about how

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,680
these blend modes work to get the same

00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:34,779
effect here I'm blending the luminosity

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,649
so just the dark and light values of

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:40,329
Thomas to the blend mode behind it so

00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:43,180
users will still see the image they just

00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:45,310
won't see it with this effect on top so

00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:46,779
that brings me to uniformity when you

00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,730
kind of get this all down we start

00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:51,759
playing with it you can recreate any

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,230
type of effect just by using CSS this is

00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,449
a project that I made a little while ago

00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,160
called CSS Graham where we created a lot

00:12:55,449 --> 00:13:00,610
of the Instagram filters by just using

00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,310
CSS filters and blend modes so you can

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:03,290
get anywhere

00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:04,940
from point A to point B by using this in

00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,529
a really creative way and then applying

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,560
that throughout your entire product

00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:11,330
because CSS Cascades there are a few

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,220
other ones out there there's CSS Co

00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,050
which is the vsco cam filters and

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,380
there's also color filter which was

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:20,510
inspired by the Spotify effects from

00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,900
2015 these duotone effects which we will

00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,830
talk about a little bit later so

00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,720
simplicity is another thing that blend

00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:29,150
modes really give you and something that

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,339
blend modes really shine at doing I was

00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:33,890
browsing the web recently and I saw this

00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:36,080
being shared around this reverse knock

00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,120
out text effect it was being shared on

00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,820
Twitter so what you need to do for this

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,490
is you need to use an extra-wide SVG you

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,550
need to hide extra parts overflow:hidden

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,440
and you need to use an SVG mask this

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,300
feels like a little bit of overkill for

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,550
me you have to have JavaScript in here

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:54,920
you have to have your CSS you it's it's

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:59,089
pretty heavy-handed when all you really

00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,770
need is a single blend mode in CSS so

00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:02,900
here you get the same effect you have

00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,640
your black background with white text

00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,010
and you plot your multiply blend mode

00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,330
and you get knockout text and if you

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,880
want to get that little arrow thing

00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,589
that's just a little CSS triangle which

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,360
you create with borders they can apply

00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:16,040
on the end so you don't need these

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,900
additional dependencies you can just do

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,339
it in CSS with a couple of lines of code

00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:23,600
and that's why I think it's so magical

00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:26,210
so here's a little pro tip about filters

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,240
because this also came up recently if

00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:31,370
you have a SVG that you're applying as a

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,230
background so I have this image of an

00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:35,980
octopus apply its background you can't

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,720
edit the color of this SVG by using fill

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,400
you can't really edit it if you want to

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,890
have multiple colors either if you want

00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,230
to have this dynamic range so what you

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:46,910
do is you can use filters for this so

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,470
filters are pretty well supported

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,300
actually what you can do isn't it just

00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,810
like the brightness I can make this like

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:56,240
darker if I wanted to I could adjust the

00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:59,120
contrast I could increase that to two

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,380
and then the next thing that people will

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,790
mention is well what about the color if

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,390
you can't change it from black and white

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:08,990
to a color if you wanted to but you can

00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:10,640
because we have the sepia filter so we

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,650
can apply the sepia filter and then on

00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,670
top of that we can apply a hue rotation

00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,470
so I can apply a hero tation to like six

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,300
degrees and now I have a green octopus

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,370
and from here I can use saturate and

00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,290
saturate it too so I have like a bright

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:23,850
green octopus so there's a lot of things

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,860
that you can do by just getting created

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,360
with filters that you don't need to go

00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,660
into code change the way that you're

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,280
creating these UIs and just use these to

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,350
apply different effects and because it

00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:36,780
is a CSS filter they are animatable

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,910
they're interactive you can do anything

00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:40,950
you want with hover States etc for a

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,840
user so it's just like a good thing to

00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,400
know

00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,560
so speaking of filters I want to quickly

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,330
talk about SVG filter effects because

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,610
this is really where you have a lot of

00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:52,530
control when you're editing your images

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,000
and it's because with SVG filter effects

00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,160
it's really the only place that you can

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,810
control the individual channels the red

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,540
channel blue tail green channel alpha

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:02,310
channel by applying a single filter onto

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,080
an image with CSS blend modes and

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,810
filters they're sort of shortcuts that

00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,660
have derived from SVG filter effect so

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:11,940
you don't get all this control but this

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,220
is also among the main of simplicity so

00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,800
when I'm creating SVG filter effects I

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,780
like to use the FE color matrix because

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,270
it really lets you individually select

00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,350
your channel transformations and if you

00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,880
kind of understand what's going on here

00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:26,610
you can see the differences that you're

00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,500
making so it looks like this basically

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,510
you have your red green blue alpha

00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,870
channels and then multiplier Channel and

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,400
it defaults starts as you have one red

00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,900
value on the red Channel you have one

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,160
green value on the green Channel one

00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,500
blue value on blue Channel and your

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,440
alpha channel is one if you want to

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,720
create a transformation you can apply

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,000
different values on these an important

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,630
thing to note is that the scale is 255

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,460
in RGB land is 1 in this color matrix

00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,290
transform land so that's kind of how it

00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:56,820
equates if I wanted to do something like

00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,010
remove all the red and blue and just

00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,570
have a green colorized image it looks

00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,850
like this bottom image here where you

00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,730
just keep the green channels value and

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,200
you set a 0 on red and blue so it looks

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:10,050
like this is sort of the effect that we

00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,720
get if we wanted to do that by applying

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,370
these color matrix changes we can do

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,840
that we just have to have an SVG on the

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,270
page and then we have to apply the

00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,800
filter you can do that in CSS but you

00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,960
don't need to have all of this

00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,449
complexity applying additional SVG is

00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:27,010
when we could do a similar thing in

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:29,200
CSS with blend modes without having to

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,000
create a filter transformation and

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,590
include that in the page so here we're

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,779
colorizing we're using the mixed blend

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:39,070
mode of color and we're just picking our

00:17:34,779 --> 00:17:41,049
color RGB 0 255 0 so I want to note one

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,789
thing that consistency browsers are

00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:44,289
still not consistent about how they're

00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:47,350
applying their color transformations

00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:49,840
so here's Chrome you can see that these

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,610
two look as they do when we compare that

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,049
to Safari I don't know if you can see it

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,730
up here but the chrome one you don't

00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:57,039
like to get this very well I'm Chrome a

00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,380
little bit darker Safari is more muted

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,120
than these two values but the blend mode

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,240
stays pretty much identical it stays the

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,710
same when we look at Firefox it doesn't

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,110
even support these sort of filter

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,149
transformations but it supports blend

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,460
modes it's a little bit more faded out

00:18:10,149 --> 00:18:14,200
there's a little more bright on that

00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,510
blend mode and then when we can go to

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,539
edge it doesn't really support any of it

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:21,190
but this is a reminder about why you

00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:23,260
need to progressively enhance your blend

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,120
modes and we can change this around to

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,950
again apply that layer on top of the

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,289
color so the other way around so with

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,730
edge either way you're going to get some

00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:33,100
image if you do it this way

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,140
so blend modes are a tiny tiny bit more

00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,460
consistent when you're applying those as

00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,799
your color transformations on your

00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,450
images so if you want to play with

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,039
filter effects there's a really great

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,899
resource that I want to share with you

00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,059
where you can actually just change the

00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:48,610
values and see what that does to your

00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:51,309
image this is the URL for it cast kicked

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,659
out cannabidiol SVG color - filter just

00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:54,940
maybe take a picture really quick it's a

00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:56,610
really cool resource that you can use to

00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,020
really understand how those were working

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:01,539
so from here I want to talk about the

00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:04,000
duotone effect that has become massively

00:19:01,539 --> 00:19:05,919
popular I've seen this increasingly on

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,470
the web and it's a way to really unify

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,500
your images on your application on your

00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:14,169
website so we wanted to do this with SVG

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,149
filters what we need to do is apply a

00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:18,220
positive value and a negative value for

00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:19,360
your highlight in your shadow so if you

00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,010
wanted to have a red highlight and a

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,020
blue shadow those are absolute values of

00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,760
one a negative one we can do that you

00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,140
can do it on any individual channel so

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,169
you can do on the red channel green

00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,299
Channel or blue channel so with blend

00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:34,030
modes you can kind of get a similar sort

00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:35,919
of effect with some colors but it's a

00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,900
lot less complex you don't have to make

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,880
all the math

00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,830
you can just set the colors it looks

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,810
like this what we're doing is we're

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,850
applying a darkened blend mode on the

00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:46,920
highlight and are applying a lightened

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,990
blend mode on the shadow and we're just

00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,270
layering those on top of each other so

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,510
in the middle here you see this sort of

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:56,130
boxed color duotone effect layer now

00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,510
with the shadow whatever color you pick

00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,430
if it's a lighter shadow you're gonna

00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,500
get rid of more of the details because

00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:05,070
your lightening the shadow with that

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:07,230
value so you can take a few disparate

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:09,510
images these I just found the web and

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,880
apply a blend mode and really unifies

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:13,830
them so it really increases the quality

00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,930
of photography and it makes your site

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:17,970
your page or application feel more

00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,720
uniform you can use this with a single

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,930
line of code

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,060
so with CSS variables

00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:27,120
I love variables who hears you CSS

00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,860
variables not enough of you they're

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,720
they're great they're true variables

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,820
that live in your route and they just

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,620
they just work so like if I wanted to

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,480
change the shadow to red and the

00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,220
highlight to yellow these are truly

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,250
dynamic variables that is just changing

00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,380
the style in the browser no longer the

00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,660
SAS variables that you have to compose

00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,460
into actual colors first these these

00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:49,110
live in your browser so I love those if

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,180
you haven't tried them yet check them

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:53,220
out they're great you can use javascript

00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,710
to change CSS variables and it's super

00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,140
dynamic I love it um anyway let's talk

00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:00,390
about performance so who here agrees

00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,920
before it's important all of you yeah

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:05,820
all of you there are four talks of

00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:07,170
performance at this conference so let's

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,610
talk about image performance that's

00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:11,490
something that blend modes and filters

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:14,130
can help us out with as well you also

00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:15,510
don't need fancy image editing programs

00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,580
that's an important thing to note when

00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,440
you're using blend modes filters editing

00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,750
programs in the browser you can just do

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,940
it with your free program here so to

00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:26,100
apply this transformation I just opened

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,590
up my preview app and I removed the

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,540
color now when you remove the color cast

00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:33,510
of an image you can get a pretty big

00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,820
size savings of that image so here is

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:39,030
the example here we're saving 62

00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,400
kilobytes or 22% of the image size and

00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:44,460
this one we're saving 21% of the image

00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,230
size here we're saving 189 kilobytes so

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,710
because image is bigger it's a bigger

00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,539
payload

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,149
that were taking away from the user and

00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:54,450
this is 20 percent so on average you get

00:21:51,149 --> 00:21:55,710
like a 17 to 23 percent image savings I

00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:58,020
found by doing this kind of

00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,659
transformation the black and white

00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:02,850
doesn't have to be boring again there's

00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:04,740
a ton of we can do by applying filters

00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,690
and blend modes to our backlight images

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,279
to give them those effects that we're

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:10,860
kind of applying to colored images

00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:14,039
anyway here's here's that same exact

00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:16,169
example where these colors are black and

00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:18,630
white with the exact same transformation

00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:19,919
applied they look almost identical so

00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,960
this is probably even close to what you

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,289
want meanwhile you're saving image size

00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:29,640
for your users by not sending 20% bigger

00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:30,990
images to them so kind of on that front

00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,049
I did want to mention this it's about

00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:36,480
filters not blend modes this something

00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:39,480
that I recently was doing some research

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,029
on with filters they like to call the

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:43,950
contrast swap technique so essentially

00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:46,320
what you're doing is you're removing the

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,490
contrast of an image on your own you can

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,010
do this in Photoshop to get a linear

00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:52,200
transformation of that contrast and then

00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:54,179
reapplying it in a browser with CSS

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,279
filters so here we're using contrast of

00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,649
two you're doubling that contrast of

00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:01,140
yourself manually removed in Photoshop

00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:03,059
so this is also a JPEGs do they go this

00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,710
compression algorithm but you can take

00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,750
it a step further by doing it manually

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:08,580
yourself in the browser and getting an

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:12,240
effect where you're also saving around

00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:14,730
20% of an image savings for your image

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,669
that you're sending your users so here's

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:20,399
an example that I just could have put

00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:24,000
together where I was testing out these

00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:26,309
image savings and in here I did also

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,260
apply a single filter like a single

00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:30,720
transformation to all the images and you

00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:32,039
can see that here so that's what the

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,899
color looks like that's the image looks

00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:35,549
like initially and then I just apply the

00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:37,620
filter back to it and it's a pretty

00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:40,169
similar effect to what I would get at a

00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:43,460
much smaller size so you can use filters

00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:45,690
and blend modes for performance as well

00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,210
if you're wondering well what about

00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:50,700
paint doesn't that take a lot longer to

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:53,490
then edit your images isn't that more

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,710
work load on the browser when I profile

00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:59,250
this at a six times CPU slow down I

00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:01,680
found that the longest paint time

00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:05,130
Oh point two seven microseconds so point

00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,420
zero zero zero to seven seconds browsers

00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,100
are pretty good this I wouldn't really

00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:09,990
be too worried about that unless you

00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,250
have like a page of like a thousand

00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:14,760
images trying to apply this

00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,870
transformation at a time so back to your

00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,570
regularly scheduled blend mode

00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:20,190
programming back to blend modes this is

00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,330
me enjoying the beautiful fifteen

00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,000
minutes of sunshine

00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:26,520
I hadn't Singapore but it doesn't really

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,280
accurately reflect my trip so let's add

00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:32,400
some rain with blend modes you can

00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,590
dynamically just on the screen do this

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,230
kind of thing apply some filters apply a

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,460
blur filter screen this onto my image to

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:41,760
get a much more accurate representation

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,410
of my trip here it also Ran's me of

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,450
those like cinema graphs where we have

00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,250
an image and one part of the image is

00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:48,810
moving while the rest day is still this

00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,640
is kind of like a layer is moving and

00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:52,140
it's it's much more performant to see so

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,290
here's a much more peaceful example

00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,960
where we can add some snow a nice

00:24:55,290 --> 00:25:01,560
portrait so I try to recreate this as a

00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,390
gif and it just is so janky you don't

00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:06,180
get the same kind of experience and also

00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:08,520
if you look at the image size of this

00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:10,200
video blended on top of this image it's

00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,030
big like don't get me wrong this isn't a

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,560
movie like this can be optimized but

00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:16,890
just to show you how that compares to a

00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,480
gif it's like that change you don't want

00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,160
to use gifts don't use gifts people use

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,800
them use videos if you're using gifts

00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,760
send them like Auto playing videos if

00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,220
you have to do that

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,510
don't use gifts but you can again use

00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:29,250
blend modes if you want to kind of

00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,990
effect live near browser you don't have

00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,580
to edit after effects like you don't

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,350
have to open any video editing programs

00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,360
you can just play in a medium that we're

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:41,280
all familiar with that we all use every

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:42,990
day so that brings me to creativity and

00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,970
this is the section in which I want to

00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,290
highlight the work of some other people

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,720
that I found that I thought was really

00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:51,780
cool on the web and this is by Jamie

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,780
Coulter who uses blend modes as well as

00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:56,670
video to create this inkblot modal it

00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:59,040
kind of like comes out on the screen in

00:25:56,670 --> 00:26:01,140
a very beautiful way you can do this now

00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,670
on your browser by combining these sorts

00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,790
of things applying blend modes to a

00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:07,560
video this is a great example of

00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,060
visualization by Archer Kournikova and

00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,220
if you remember how we learned about the

00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,140
difference blend mode this visualization

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:14,210
is made possible

00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:16,400
because of the difference blend mode you

00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:19,040
have animation here and all of the

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,630
interaction between those lines as they

00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,160
blend on top of each other you get that

00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:25,450
knocked-out effect it's really

00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,830
mesmerizing I really like this one and

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:29,600
then finally a deadly story did an

00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,520
example of e-commerce with blend modes

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,320
so this I thought was great like here

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,740
you could change the color of the suit

00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:39,620
by just clicking and changing it as a

00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,600
layer on top of this image so you know

00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,220
what people have to do in the past is

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,620
you get the designer that opens up this

00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:48,590
image they have to edit every single

00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:50,330
color themselves and then apply it and

00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:52,910
then send the user every single color

00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,410
option and again it's just being edited

00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,730
in Photoshop but you get a mask and you

00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,920
create it and it's not like the actual

00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,990
color you'd get when you go shopping but

00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,690
now you can skip that step and you can

00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:05,510
just apply a blend mode to an image and

00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:08,300
do it in the browser it's not sending

00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:12,140
your user as much data from images and

00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:13,760
it's a lot faster I want to note that

00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,560
this is something that I have seen

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,440
increasingly our websites are all

00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:20,090
starting to look the same and I wanted

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,680
to say like stop getting inspiration for

00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:23,000
websites from other websites there's so

00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,760
much more out there to get inspiration

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,770
from from nature from architecture from

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,960
art and with blend modes with these

00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:32,000
browser capabilities we're now able to

00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,180
start experimenting a lot more adding

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,860
for a lot more creativity in our work

00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:39,830
and I want to see more of that in the

00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:41,390
web and also I want to notice this just

00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:44,300
because it's the norm doesn't mean it's

00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:47,240
the best solution so like that example I

00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,920
showed with the knockout text that might

00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,480
be what people are using now people

00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,030
think like we have to use clipping and

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,680
we have to use SVG and there's a lot of

00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,730
different features there there are

00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,740
solutions that we haven't even

00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:02,810
discovered yet because maybe not all

00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:04,070
browsers support them yet edge so

00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,840
there's a lot out there that I'm really

00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:09,530
excited to see people discover as they

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:12,050
start to use this more so in conclusion

00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:15,310
you should use blend modes because of

00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:18,230
simplicity uniformity consistency

00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:20,660
performance creativity and finally

00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:22,700
empathy I didn't really touch on this

00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,410
during my talk too much but blend modes

00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:26,360
are a way to have a

00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:29,870
common ground to speak to your designers

00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,040
from these are ways that the this is a

00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:33,260
language I understand this is something

00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,610
that you can really correlate and when

00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,290
you improve your relationship with

00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:37,700
designers and with other people that you

00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,280
work with other teammates

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,440
that's when ideas really grow you're not

00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,200
going to create these new ideas by

00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,720
working in a silo and by a silo I mean a

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,010
skill set silo as well there are things

00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,390
that you you don't know about because

00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,530
it's not your background or somebody

00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,850
else might not know about when you work

00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:55,220
together when you have a common language

00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,930
from which to speak that's when things

00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,820
can really grow and blossom and create

00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:02,000
these things that make the web a better

00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:05,780
place that pushed the web forward so

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,910
let's make blend modes happen what you

00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,490
can do is go to WP dev user voice

00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:12,080
command upvote them and the next break

00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,940
is sponsored by Microsoft so what a

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,140
better time to do it then on their time

00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:20,510
go up vote and finally use blend modes

00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,340
this is from Greg Whitworth who works on

00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,770
edge he says personally I recommend

00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,630
using it on production sites in a

00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:28,490
progressively enhanced manner because

00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,350
they do watch web usage so the more

00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:32,270
people use them the more use cases that

00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:33,860
we come up with as a community the more

00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,140
we'll start seeing a more creative

00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,990
beautiful web that's easier simpler more

00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,180
performant for our users thank you so

00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:48,709
much

00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:48,709
