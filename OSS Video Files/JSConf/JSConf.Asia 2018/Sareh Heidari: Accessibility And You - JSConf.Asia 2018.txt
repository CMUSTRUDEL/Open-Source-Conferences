Title: Sareh Heidari: Accessibility And You - JSConf.Asia 2018
Publication date: 2018-02-11
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	It's 2018 and websites are increasingly becoming the primary way to access services. Brilliant! But what about the impact of inaccessible sites on users? 
In this talk, we'll go through practical steps to consider accessibility when building products - whether you're the sole dev on a project or part of a larger organisation. I'll share my experience at BBC News, as an accessibility champion: how we carry out accessibility research, reviews & tests.

Sareh is a web developer at BBC News, in London. She's interested in web accessibility, performance and all the various things that improve a user's experience of interacting with websites.

00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:22,080
hi hi I'm sorry hey dari nice to see you

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,960
all I work at BBC News as a web

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,960
developer in London and it's my first

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,300
time in Singapore it's a real pleasure

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,420
to be here thank you thank you for guys

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,430
from my team on the screen is a photo of

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,860
me exploring the day before this

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,450
conference in Singapore and my son fact

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,010
is that I absolutely love the weather

00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,760
here everyone here seems to think I'm

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,590
weird for that but it's awesome even the

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,750
rain I love that you have warm brain

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:54,270
here I don't understand it but it's

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:57,629
awesome yes so in London I work on the

00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:00,809
BBC News webpages so they are for

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:03,090
curated content to help people discover

00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:05,100
content so what that means in practice

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,170
is that I work on pages like this so

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:12,600
this is the screenshot from today of the

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:14,189
BBC News website so on the front page in

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,380
addition to these we do like all sorts

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:18,360
of other kind of creations and things of

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,490
like collections of articles and content

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:26,850
like that so that's about me what are we

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,850
going to talk about today so the talk is

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,290
called accessibility in you first I will

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,020
talk about myself because that's kind of

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:38,100
fun I will talk about a little bit about

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:42,000
a few little stories about how I got an

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,939
interest in accessibility then I'll talk

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,479
about why do BBC News and a couple of

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:51,360
examples of the work we do there and

00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:53,520
most importantly I think is getting you

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,590
all started so if you haven't started at

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,090
all so well what was great about this

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,329
conference is that earlier on on the

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,950
first day we had awesome talks showing

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,420
you screen readers and and things like

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,369
that so you probably all have a little

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,910
bit familiarity tips so hopefully I go

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:11,459
into other aspects of accessibility and

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,590
how you can get started if you haven't

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:18,780
already

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:22,409
so so let's get started so let me go

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,510
back a few years before I ever became a

00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:29,790
web developer or had anything cruelly to

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:33,930
do with with tech as a job I was at

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,700
university in London I didn't really

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,340
think about obsessively at all to be

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:43,109
honest like I'm able-bodied don't have a

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:45,480
disability and my only current

00:02:43,109 --> 00:02:48,120
understanding was physical accessibility

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,950
like this so this is a photo of the

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,920
entrance to one of the university

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,690
buildings on on the front side of the

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,430
photo you've got some steps and on the

00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,440
other side you've got a ramp to enter

00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,790
the building I was like okay cool they

00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,959
saw about things so people would

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:05,840
wheelchairs can get in the building

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:08,010
great right so that's all good right

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,450
whilst I was setting there friend of

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:15,959
mine had a chronic illness then needed

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:19,199
to be able to use a wheelchair and so

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,790
they had gots user and were able to get

00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,160
up like a powered wheelchair electrical

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,190
just to be able to never get round which

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,489
is cool they were able to do that and

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,370
some of the lectures that they're in and

00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:35,359
buildings are in were able to have the

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:38,760
ramps and they were able to enter one

00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:43,530
the first month after that I think they

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,419
were gonna go to the Students Union and

00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,190
this is where if you don't know what

00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,480
super teen is like I mean they also have

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,480
like coffee shops and things but they

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,819
also have like the offices of like the

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,530
welfare offices for students and people

00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,019
who can give advice to students they

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,829
need help so like you know you need to

00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:04,440
be accessing them and the building had

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:07,650
lift so this is the lift which is

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,030
awesome but it is probably you can't see

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,040
from the photo and maybe you can it's

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,870
really narrow you can probably walk in

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,690
there but and the wheelchair doesn't

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,880
can't can't enter they can enter so it's

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,370
like someone's thought about one aspect

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,989
but not reason about how they've gone to

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,720
the expense of building this whole lift

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:25,230
and like

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,540
organizing the whole building to make it

00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,880
work for with a left not really thought

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:32,590
about like you know who I did all or

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,660
some things like that so it's not quite

00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:39,760
as useful and in addition to that so

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,760
that's one building there were lectures

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,420
that were up on like the top floor and

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,160
like rickety staircases that had to be

00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,740
like rearranged and things because they

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,250
hadn't considered that one of the

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,530
students might might need a special

00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,060
access this and this was I thought it

00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,620
was pretty frustrating I stood my friend

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,690
was my friend was pretty frustrated as a

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,750
little bit as well the fact that they

00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:07,810
have to go to each individual lecturer

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,850
to ask them to read to change over sink

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:14,169
to rewrite or in the rooms and all of

00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:16,210
that and this is like like seeing them

00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:20,500
do that just make me realize just how

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:22,510
many how many barriers there are even

00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,850
even from an institution that professes

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:28,120
to be open and accessible and in terms

00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:31,930
of wanting to have such a range of and a

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,990
wide variety of students and dive and

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:39,760
talks about the diversity of its student

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:42,430
body so that was like my first like

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,590
major kind of thinking like there's

00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,690
things need to be improved in the world

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:50,410
things things like even places people

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,330
that that care about will say that they

00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:57,700
care about accessibility really need to

00:05:52,330 --> 00:06:00,160
need to do a lot better now I'm going to

00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:04,240
talk about something that might seem

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,770
completely unrelated family tech support

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,360
so hands up if you have ever had to be

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:13,390
her family text the tech support for any

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,880
family member come on come on there's

00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:20,580
more of you than that yes yes okay very

00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:22,630
much everyone here yes me too I

00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,340
constantly whenever I call family

00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,440
members they're like oh by the way how

00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:30,030
do I update this thing yeah

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:33,729
yes so this is a photo of Carriger city

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:34,610
close to Tehran capsule over Iran where

00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:38,509
my family's from

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:44,000
and yes we've got mountains would snow -

00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:45,740
it's not just deserts and so I visit my

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,979
grandparents and extended family there

00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:54,229
and every year or so and when I do that

00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:57,889
and usually I get asked like oh can you

00:06:54,229 --> 00:07:00,650
fix something which is cool so first

00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:02,780
thing so about a few years ago or five

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,030
years ago my granddad was like right

00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:06,650
I've heard like everyone has email I

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,419
want an email account I want to be able

00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,789
to email you I was like that's cool hey

00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:13,310
awesome I will set you up with a gmail

00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:15,889
account because I have Gmail and pretty

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:19,819
much everyone has Gmail why not

00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:23,930
and we did and then I used you know like

00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:26,330
every day up until that moment I didn't

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,639
realize there was anything wrong with it

00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:31,159
that's all because I was using it it

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,199
like allowed me to have everything that

00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,849
I want like so many emails so many

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,930
attachments all all of the things that I

00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:41,599
needed weather except one I had to

00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:44,120
explain how to do things to my granddad

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:50,139
and I realize just how many steps there

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:53,479
are so so if you haven't used you email

00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:57,919
this is a screenshot of of like what the

00:07:53,479 --> 00:08:02,210
web interface on desktop there is Bert

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:04,669
read compose button in the top

00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,469
I don't realize like the fact that it's

00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:08,150
system PO I hadn't noticed that about it

00:08:06,469 --> 00:08:09,979
since compose I'm not like new message

00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,900
so compose when you put like in Google

00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:14,210
Translate it comes up like composing

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,650
music and so it doesn't translate very

00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,750
well so it's like why I don't call it

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:19,099
new message it's kind of like and it's

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,500
just like little things the little

00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,819
language that people use in a user

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,379
interface it's like things that I

00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:26,839
haven't really paid attention to before

00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:29,719
I just like I learn what it did and just

00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:32,570
ignored what it said and I like had to

00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:35,089
explain why what composition means in

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:38,690
this context which is really bizarre and

00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:40,899
have yeah okay so that's fine that's

00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:44,130
what I mean so that's what the butter is

00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:46,199
yeah so that's it selected

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,029
and then I was like work a woman my

00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:51,149
daughter and I was like okay cool so now

00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:52,589
how do I email a specific person how do

00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:56,370
I email you to have around

00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:58,829
like my own my aunts and things and I

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,690
was like cool I'll save all of the

00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:03,540
everyone's like email addresses in the

00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:03,990
contact list I use like super that's

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,920
great

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:09,509
I asked me how do I find them it's like

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,399
well sure you just go on this and then

00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:15,120
you click that it's like but why do I

00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,380
click the thing that says Gmail and then

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,209
behind it there's a thing that says

00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,680
contacts and then behind that I click a

00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:21,300
forum and then I fill out a form and

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,509
then it will took a mute like why are

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:29,399
the five steps I was like I don't know

00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:31,560
like I just got used to it it's like

00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,759
that's how I just did things I just do

00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,529
that and it'll to commute said it just

00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,779
like for me it just said but when a when

00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:38,399
I had to explain it it's like multiple

00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:40,769
stuffs like that's a lot of steps but

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,199
something that basically every person

00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:46,740
does regularly with email right you send

00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:52,199
emails to people in your contacts yeah

00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:55,199
and and so I'm like my grandma's like he

00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:57,420
like clever he does lay laws and

00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:58,949
contracts and stuff but in these indie

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,569
sailing hehe he's buying with like

00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:02,490
things and lots of steps but sometimes

00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:04,680
if he doesn't view things like regularly

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,589
like he doesn't need to check his email

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,240
like five times a day to be honest so if

00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:11,880
doesn't do mercury then he forgets

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,540
well the like the million steps are to

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:18,810
do the thing and so I ended up doing

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:21,899
oops what I ended up doing is writing

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:23,509
out so I had to write it out like in

00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:26,370
Farsi so that's the language over

00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:28,199
including little title really badly

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,759
drawn like icons of like what the

00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:31,550
buttons do and like what would have to

00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,290
do the same in and things and I really

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:41,850
really like okay this is a user

00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:44,160
interface with like okay built that had

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,839
been built and people built it for their

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,569
own use cases and not really realized to

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,939
all the different steps there and it

00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:52,319
really made me think and maybe not

00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:57,180
necessarily at that moment but just like

00:10:52,319 --> 00:11:00,150
thinking afterwards a lot about what

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:02,730
interface accessibility means so it's

00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:05,640
not like my granddad couldn't use the

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,589
the Gmail web and basically he could

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,270
it's not like he was prevented from

00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:11,360
using it didn't necessarily I mean he

00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:15,480
has bad Isis I had to wear his glasses

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:19,440
it's not like he couldn't access the the

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,740
website the service he could it was just

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,450
that by setting up the interface like

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,950
that it just made it a chore it made it

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,960
so difficult it's I mean it made it a

00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,700
pain and an annoyance so you have to go

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:34,350
through that and so that made me think

00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:35,760
about about how accessibility can be

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,250
more than just given people with

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,470
disabilities access to a service it can

00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:42,440
be ease of use as well it can be making

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,300
people's lives just like more enjoyable

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,339
by making a use of tech an enjoyable

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,290
experience and not just like a painful

00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,839
list of things memorized to have to go

00:11:49,290 --> 00:12:02,100
through so yes so that was like another

00:11:51,839 --> 00:12:06,630
little aspects of of things I and like

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:11,520
fast food a bit too

00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:13,380
so my first left web development role by

00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,410
this point I had done a coding boot camp

00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:20,310
because I knew I really wanted to do web

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,839
development but didn't really have the

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,250
specific skill scale to get a job so I

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,400
did one of those for three months and

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,589
when those intense plans and I realized

00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:31,050
that yeah I would like to work at a

00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:32,730
place that cares about best practices I

00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,370
could learn best practices for things

00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:36,839
and cares about accessibility and things

00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:42,920
like that and I was really really lucky

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:46,230
to and now the BBC News were hiring and

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,779
if you are not aware BBC News as part of

00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:52,410
like BBC and BBC British Broadcasting

00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:56,459
Corporation is is partly favored and

00:12:52,410 --> 00:13:00,420
partly funded by the UK taxpayers like

00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:03,150
the TV licence and so it has a public

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:06,260
service room and so it has like a like a

00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:10,180
legal obligation to to edge

00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:13,580
and inform and and also be accessible to

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:17,540
as much of the population UK as possible

00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,220
which is pretty cool and so that's why I

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,530
kind of like was really excited to be

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,470
able to work there and I remember

00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:26,900
raising it in the interview and they

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:29,570
like to mention it and they they also

00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,040
really like the fact that that that I

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,750
cared about accessibility as well and I

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,320
thought that was a pretty pretty good

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:41,090
indicator of things okay so that was

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:46,130
that so now I'm going to go on to a bit

00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:47,390
more about how things how we look at

00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:50,210
things when we talk about accessibility

00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:54,290
at BBC and BBC News in particular which

00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:56,510
is where I work so let's look at a high

00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,930
level of what types of disabilities we

00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:03,110
think about most people like might be

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:05,990
more aware of like vision impairment so

00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:10,510
blindness or partially sighted people so

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:14,660
who can't and view the screen very well

00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:17,570
or at all so you screen readers and

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,100
other assistive technologies also you

00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,920
have people who are hard of hearing so

00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,990
it might not be able to listen to the

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,120
audio and videos and so we require for

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:30,430
example captions on video content and

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:35,660
and transcripts of audio content that

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:39,620
people cognitive disabilities so so this

00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:47,900
includes people with dyslexia or so who

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:57,230
have autism and then also people with

00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:59,420
motor skills and impairments and so what

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:05,000
what I liked is the hearing the whole

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:06,500
range of understanding the well

00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,310
obviously this isn't like an exhaustive

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:13,370
list but different groups of people with

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:15,380
various disabilities and understanding

00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,110
the different needs was something that

00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,680
we learn

00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:23,070
initially so now I'm going to talk about

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,660
how that actually okay so that's like

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,190
maybe you some of the audience but I'm

00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,470
going to talk about an actual case the B

00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:31,620
and I'm something that is currently

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:36,660
being worked on at BBC so BBC wreath is

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:40,170
a new font font family recently built by

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:42,149
the design teams heard the BBC so here

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:48,720
on the screen is an example of the of

00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:50,880
the serif and what I liked was reading

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,070
what the aims so okay so the aims are

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,779
distinctiveness so basically what they

00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,779
wanted to do the design teams wanted to

00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:59,130
make it a pages look distinctively BBC

00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:00,570
so you look at them and you read the

00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:03,570
content and it's like it feels like

00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:05,550
different to other sites okay that's

00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:07,410
very designee it doesn't really make

00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:09,420
sense to me but okay that's something

00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:11,250
that kind of goes over my head but okay

00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:13,350
I can understand the fat like this

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,779
there's also money saving argument

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:18,149
because Helvetica costs a lot to license

00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:19,769
to pay for the license so they're like

00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:23,490
you know if we do something in house

00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:24,930
then it's we own the license through it

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,420
so we don't need to like pay tons of

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:29,610
money for it but one of the three cool

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,130
I'm cool aims which I quite liked was

00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:35,040
that it was a legibility so to ensure

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:37,230
that this font font family is more

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,060
legible than the existing ones that we

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:44,160
use okay so to make sure that happened

00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:46,350
once they had a like an iteration of the

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:50,209
font that they quite liked the user

00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:52,380
research team light they they actually

00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:59,640
designed tonight they conducted user

00:16:52,380 --> 00:17:01,079
research so 36 participants yeah 18 of

00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:04,589
them with cognitive disabilities

00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:10,199
including dyslexia autism and ADHD to

00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:13,169
look at to do in lab viewing of websites

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:16,620
with the previous font so the vertical

00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:18,390
one and the new one BBC series and seek

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,770
your feedback on what the differences

00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,880
were and whether I thought it was more

00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:26,190
legible or less legible or all of that

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,280
and this is one particular

00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:31,380
participants the sponsor wreaths the new

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,000
font is clearer to read more spacing so

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,250
the words don't blur it takes me less

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,100
time to work out whether it's a plq I

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:40,260
look for tails tails on the P's and Q's

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:42,090
letters to see which way around it is so

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,310
the previous fonts mate made it more

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:48,900
difficult and BB series made it much

00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:52,950
much more easy so what does this mean is

00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:55,470
that yes so even the design teams are

00:17:52,950 --> 00:18:01,140
thinking about how to make this more

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:04,710
legible and how to consider people with

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:07,590
a range of needs what's even better

00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:10,020
about this is that if it if it is more

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,520
legible to people with dyslexia say it

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,490
becomes more legible for pretty much

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:19,290
everyone else as well which is pretty

00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:21,660
cool so so that's one so BBC recently

00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:25,320
found that's one aspect another thing is

00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:27,240
the becoming one thing that I found out

00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,790
pretty much immediately when I joined

00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,340
was that we have accessibility champions

00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:35,450
which sounds pretty like awesome right

00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,450
who doesn't want to be a champion

00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:43,140
basically anybody can be a champion and

00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,390
you don't need any like accessibility

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,010
expertise to solve with you don't need

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,770
that just need a willingness to learn

00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:53,330
which is cool started off a few years

00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:56,240
ago and now there are over like 150

00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,980
developers designers and testers across

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,310
26 teams across the BBC service in sport

00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:03,810
and music and and news and iPlayer and

00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:07,590
all sorts of different products there

00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:10,140
and also internal products that facing

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:15,630
other developers and other journalists

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:17,400
and things as well and so that's a lot

00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,170
of people and what what as a part of

00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,450
that is that you get

00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,920
we've got like the slack to slack team

00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:25,170
so there's a sports supportive online

00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,580
community it's he so if you have any

00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,530
questions you like I don't know what to

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,960
do here you can you can just ask

00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:33,980
somebody there and there is that support

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,980
which is pretty cool

00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:38,610
one thing that I loved about is that

00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,380
initially first thing I liked pretty

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,299
much on my first month I was like I want

00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,649
to be one of these so I want to learn

00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:46,080
more about accessibility

00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:48,269
I want to be an excessively champion and

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,750
then the first thing is called what's

00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:53,370
called tosh.0 which is like which is

00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,720
quite cool because it's like it's like

00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:56,100
it's zero it feels like there's a low

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,960
barrier to entry right it's not even

00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,039
tasked when it's like zero so it's like

00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,809
it's almost like you have a zero

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,970
knowledge it's fine

00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:04,470
so I really like I wanted to share this

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,149
because I think it's a great way if you

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,769
haven't really done much like it's this

00:20:06,149 --> 00:20:10,919
ability testing for how you can get

00:20:07,769 --> 00:20:13,169
started so you can choose a key feature

00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,580
from your product so it might be the

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:17,760
whole page in my view specific new

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:20,250
feature and you pick five standards from

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,080
the guidelines right so I'll talk about

00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,370
the guidelines in a bit this is learn it

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,880
like for example the news front page

00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:29,130
this is a a slice from it so it has a

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,200
local news section which people can type

00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:34,409
in their local area and they search

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:39,240
there and bigger like content that's

00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:41,639
local to them so while their

00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,700
accessibility guidelines BBC has these

00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:46,860
mobile accessibility guidelines they are

00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,679
they take likes the actual like standard

00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,269
body stuff and make it like more

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,880
understandable so it's not in standard

00:20:51,269 --> 00:20:56,970
written speak it's written like

00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,440
understandable language and so there are

00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:00,480
sections that are wrong

00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,309
web accessibility and also iOS and

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,500
Android so you've got you've got the

00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:07,740
verb so you're regardless of what kind

00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:10,860
of mobile device project you're working

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,299
on and and like at the bottom which is

00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,519
really pretty cool you might not be able

00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:16,500
to see it because it's kind of small

00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:19,110
there are examples of how you test

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,820
so like procedures like activate the

00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:23,850
screen reader and fill out the form and

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:27,299
you check that when you have services

00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:29,700
the focus the the focus guide name

00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:31,880
checks that the focus doesn't move on to

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,950
different things that it actually stays

00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,720
stable so it only moves when you

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,580
actually tab all you press ENTER and

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,620
things like that so it has actually like

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,720
skier step-by-step guidelines that you

00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,700
can take so that was tossed area and

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,290
after toss area what we did is that we

00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,360
we wrote down notes oh I wrote down

00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,740
notes of what happened like did I find

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,580
anything were there any bugs did it work

00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,200
as expected

00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,030
did it do something that I didn't know

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,380
whether it was right or wrong but like I

00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,670
don't know it did a thing

00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,370
he's like the good thing or a bad thing

00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:02,230
and then I was able to talk with the

00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,270
head of the team the head of the

00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:07,300
accessibility champions team right and

00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:09,490
they are able to give me advice but what

00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,590
about you well if you don't have like a

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:15,100
whole team of like 150 people which is

00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:17,830
quite a lot to get advice from there are

00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:21,550
other people you can ask there's the web

00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:23,410
ally so a 11y select channel which is

00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:26,080
like over 2,000 people from around the

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:29,250
world like including like experts that

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,850
write likes and some things also like

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:34,060
completely beginners

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:36,640
yes Twitter you there's hashtags I love

00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:38,590
my hash tags and as we've heard like

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,810
yesterday and the day before these

00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,870
abilities here based on Singapore and if

00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:45,370
any of you are based here or in around

00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,840
surrounding like Southeast Asia you

00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:49,000
should definitely drop the message

00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:52,090
because they would like to get in touch

00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:58,660
and do to help you out with auditing

00:22:52,090 --> 00:23:00,160
your pages okay so you've done a toss

00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,320
your you've kind of found maybe about

00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,270
maybe not bug all of that well what do

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,110
you do to take just full review of

00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:10,420
things how do you how do you manage that

00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:15,670
well we've got github repo with all of

00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:17,740
the steps that we take for news so that

00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,660
includes things like information for

00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,010
developers for designers or if you've

00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,770
got business analysts in your team for

00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:25,330
them if you've got a product donor what

00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,530
they need to be thinking of right at the

00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,850
beginning of a product when they're

00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:30,150
talking to stakeholders and and

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:33,400
information gathering things like that

00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:34,810
so it's a detailed but it's also got

00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,670
section those views so like for

00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,560
developers it's got information of like

00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:42,670
before development starts what should

00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,870
you do like tortured tortured signers

00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:46,510
about things before things have been

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,440
said of certain things like that and

00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,650
then it's got things throughout

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,200
development what should you do

00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:57,070
so there are also different levels of

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,960
things so on the first day it talks

00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:01,180
about limiting I said like 'hey--

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,570
assailant there is if you use and then

00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:06,100
just round talking about like other

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:09,940
premix so we use react on the server

00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:13,780
side and so we use like JSX and yes lint

00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:16,600
like accessibility lint so basically

00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:18,850
what that does is that if you forget to

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,860
put an alt text attribute to explain

00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,750
what images it like warns you one your

00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,580
when you're writing on things so you you

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,530
find out about errors just as you're

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,380
writing so just like you would find out

00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:31,150
about mists miss closing bracket as

00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,590
you're typing and you need to fix her it

00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,630
tells you like right up front so it

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,700
doesn't become like it doesn't build up

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:38,920
to have like a million errors and you

00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,340
just fix as you go along which is pretty

00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,290
cool

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,820
there are lots of browser dev tools

00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:45,910
there's like if you open up Chrome

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:47,650
you've got an accessibility tab you can

00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,300
do an accessibility to order gives you

00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,340
like a score of 100

00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,500
she's just give me or like a that gives

00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:56,110
you hints in terms of what you should be

00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,730
looking at this there are online pages

00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,679
until so you can basically put the URL

00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,660
if it's already live if your products

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,070
already live you can put a URL into

00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,290
there and it can give you give you a

00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:09,160
review there there's manual testing with

00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:10,450
devices so you I'm pretty sure if you're

00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,160
all web developers you've got a mobile

00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:15,390
phone or a laptop of our device there

00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:18,610
open up there and and and you can use

00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:20,820
pretty much all iOS and Android and and

00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:23,020
Macs and everything they have in Bell

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,179
screen readers you can test out there

00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,100
and if you're not sure about how to do

00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:30,550
that on this URL there are like

00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:34,720
instructions about how to how to step

00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:36,490
through that and get started okay so

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,960
that's kind of what you do when you like

00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:39,400
if you're kind of by yourself you're not

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,500
really sure like and you want to get

00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,770
started and things like this but what do

00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:48,309
you do if you're in a larger team so

00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:49,990
this is a few techniques yes so this is

00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:51,160
kind of like when you've got when you've

00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,530
convinced your manager this is a good

00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,850
thing but you can do this on the sly

00:25:53,530 --> 00:26:00,310
which is

00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:02,560
get in so accessibility swarms and it's

00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,640
not as terrifying as it sounds it's

00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,350
really quite fun

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,630
it's basically so this is the photo of

00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:10,750
like a fearless the developers in our

00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:12,970
team singing abuse with all the devices

00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:17,470
out on the table so like a laptops

00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:19,180
accessibility laptops phones the

00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,760
developer who's like you're taking the

00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:24,310
selfie was using Dragon Dictate so a

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,840
software that you can talk to at it and

00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,250
it take navigates you through the

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,720
through the page so you don't need to

00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,510
like use the keyboard or a mouse at all

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,350
you could just talk talk and and and

00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:38,050
browse the web which is pretty cool yes

00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:40,240
so you can do that and the reason why

00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:43,330
this is really fun it really changed the

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,700
way like we look to accessibility

00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:47,470
reviewing products is that it became a

00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:49,120
fun activity it didn't become like a

00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:51,010
chore that you just like cut it like

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,930
tick off with we could merge a code it

00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:55,660
became like you like look forward to

00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:57,190
like the two hours in the afternoon that

00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:58,630
you had had packed in your calendar

00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,890
because like yeah you get to like you

00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,900
get to like try other thing and you get

00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:05,530
to laugh and you get to like make fun of

00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:07,510
somebody like using trying to teach the

00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:11,080
dictation software and it can understand

00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:13,030
this accent and it's really great yeah

00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,590
but it's cool because it's like it's

00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,970
it's a lot of fun and it can make

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:17,410
something that I think a lot of people

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:22,410
think there's quite tedious into a

00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:22,410
really enjoyable activity and it's work

00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,610
these are devices that we have if you've

00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:30,280
got budget then you can probably get a

00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:32,650
whole lot about the device like yes

00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:35,950
if you don't just using what you have is

00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:39,940
fine we have a device metrics that we

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:42,010
use so we actually look at what what

00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:43,900
devices are most commonly used in the UK

00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:45,640
what what assistive tech has miss

00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:49,270
colonies in UK because that's why I call

00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:50,710
me an audience there and and prioritize

00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,390
them so we've got like a priority one

00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,440
level and a priority to level and things

00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,750
like that so you can go into a lot more

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,490
detail rather than if you've got that

00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:00,560
the stats for there

00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:03,530
and then if you've got a little bit more

00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:07,810
budget you can do user research so this

00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:11,120
photo is of a user research laboratory

00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:13,790
so in London it's got a one-way mirror

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,350
which is the coolest thing it was like

00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:18,170
so we're so we're sitting on one side of

00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:19,490
the one-way mirror and the participants

00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:22,130
of the user research are thinking and

00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:24,170
the other where the somebody like asking

00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,700
questions and things why not

00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:28,520
ask more questions more like guiding

00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:32,450
them and telling them what what let's

00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:36,910
use that and the great thing is that as

00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:39,950
a result that we get really positive

00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:41,330
feedback for everybody so like Nora

00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,160
senior designer so French now

00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,920
understands the payment that assistive

00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:49,430
tech users of assistive tech can go to

00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,380
to access content so so that's great

00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,930
because the thing is is that we want to

00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:55,610
like not only is they use the research

00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,380
good for us to find out what bugs we

00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,660
have in our software but it's also

00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:03,740
really really great so that we can get

00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:05,480
more people within our organization to

00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,670
really understand why it's an issue and

00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:12,230
like get on board and feel more be more

00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:16,160
be an active advocates for caring about

00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:17,840
accessibility to takaka as a developer I

00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:23,000
found it really eye-opening experience

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:25,540
and viewing the user research and wanted

00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:28,520
to apply it to everyday practice and

00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:30,410
finally Allison was the assistant editor

00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:32,270
so on the stakeholder side of things so

00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,860
he invited people from from about who

00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,830
her on the stakeholders as well as like

00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,150
in the product team and she thought it

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:40,430
was really interesting to see what

00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:44,600
particular problems they face and this

00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:45,800
is like invaluable because then next

00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,720
time and we're talking about why

00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,190
something we had to like redo a feature

00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,250
and things because of accessibility they

00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:53,900
understand why and they like acknowledge

00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:57,020
the fact that that is like that is a

00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:59,570
totally valid reason why like you know

00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:01,190
the feature is delayed to get get we

00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,980
delay launching and things and this is

00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:07,970
like amazing to get everybody on all

00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:09,590
sides of the organization involved and

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:13,429
understanding and positive about

00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:15,140
accessibility yeah like over half of us

00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:18,320
does like this the first time they're

00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:21,350
using tech and pretty much everyone said

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:25,610
that their level of awareness had like

00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:29,179
improved drastically so that was a bit

00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:31,190
of a whirlwind tour talking about yeah

00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:33,020
well I think accessibility is important

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:35,720
what we're kind of doing that BBC and

00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:38,630
just brief overviews about what you can

00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,730
do to get started for free I'll share

00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:43,970
the links later and feel free to ask me

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:45,290
questions thank you very much and yes

00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:51,460
thank you very much

00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:51,460
