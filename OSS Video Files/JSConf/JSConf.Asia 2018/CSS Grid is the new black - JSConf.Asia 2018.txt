Do you cringe when you have to design and build layouts on the web? Do you get frustrated when things never go where you want them to on your page?
Creating custom layouts is not a trivial task, no matter what your sales rep or account manager says. Fortunately, browsers now support a plethora of CSS properties that make building creative layouts much less painful than before.
This workshop will cover a range of techniques for building cutting-edge web layouts with fallbacks for older browsers as well. It will be a practical workshop with code examples you can refer to for your future projects.

Hui Jing is a self-taught designer and developer with an inordinate love for CSS. Reducing lines of code in her web projects makes her extremely happy. She used to play basketball full-time and launched her web career during downtime between training sessions.
