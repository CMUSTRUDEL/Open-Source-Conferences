	Speaker: Chen Hui Jing @hj_chen

Do you cringe when you have to design and build layouts on the web? Do you get frustrated when things never go where you want them to on your page?
Creating custom layouts is not a trivial task, no matter what your sales rep or account manager says. Fortunately, browsers now support a plethora of CSS properties that make building creative layouts much less painful than before.
This workshop will cover a range of techniques for building cutting-edge web layouts with fallbacks for older browsers as well. It will be a practical workshop with code examples you can refer to for your future projects.

Hui Jing is a self-taught designer and developer with an inordinate love for CSS. Reducing lines of code in her web projects makes her extremely happy. She used to play basketball full-time and launched her web career during downtime between training sessions.

so welcome to the most any Holli CSS

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,550
will show you a lot in your life how

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:17,570
many people have actually used CSS grid

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:23,519
before soft but you've heard of CSS grid

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:25,439
flexbox have used before okay so how do

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,890
you feel when you're use flexbox right

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,140
is it very confusing to move from like

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,880
floats to flexbox was it was it very

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:39,480
confusing that's good because flexbox

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,969
and grid are similar not the same

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,660
because they are used for different

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:50,039
purposes but if you are familiar with

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,640
fluxbox grid shouldn't be that hard to

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,440
understand

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,870
so this lecture has gonna assume that

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,329
you have a reasonably good grasp of CSS

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,730
and how to have no specificity the

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,960
Cascade so all that I'm not gonna cover

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,750
I'm just going to assume you already

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,270
know this if you happen to be a bit more

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,670
obvious on the CSS front the pace might

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,799
be a little fast but you can ask the

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,509
nice before wearing the blue t-shirts

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,799
for help I suppose so actually at the

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,470
end of the day right there's no one

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,210
right way to do layout so there will be

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,890
cases where it's you would still wanna

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,970
use floats there be cases where you

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:35,070
still want to use even the oldest the

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:37,560
like other inline block or even

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,290
position:absolute they will always be

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,899
use cases for those so don't don't

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,640
assume they know now that they see I'm

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,680
ask you CSS good for everything know

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,600
there's contact is everything you really

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,970
need to examine the use case that

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,799
applies to you so I just want you to

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,450
keep keep this in mind so you don't

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,790
think of CSS good as a replacement for

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:01,140
anything it's an addition to what you

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:04,280
already know right so if your could

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,600
never get to this do you'll get no Wi-Fi

00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,239
causes shangri-la is very fast no

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,429
password needed so everybody has Wi-Fi

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,579
right

00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:15,500
okay so yeah can you navigate to hear

00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:18,439
you know there's a bunch of starter

00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,180
files that I prepared so like if you

00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:22,220
want to write on marker that's great but

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,500
in these data files the maca is written

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:28,670
for you so most of the the koi beer I

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:32,470
think just yes and if you have any

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:39,170
trouble downloading just let me know

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:40,599
the can skincare see these are horrible

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,970

you watch

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,160
there's a cool tattoo

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,259
[Music]

00:06:54,190 --> 00:07:02,379
unless we went to adjust the resolution

00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:02,379
for 769 yeah

00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:23,240
uh okay um in the while he's doing on

00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:27,100
this right the URL is built only anyhow

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,100
D - B then you press down

00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:41,600
we know on size

00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,320
maybe I do

00:07:52,350 --> 00:08:01,470
okay and then there will be a download

00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,470
button so if school meets gourami

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:13,920
that's like here hopefully this will

00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,920
download a zip file

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:30,830
does he work question mark sorry okay

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,670
moving on okay I'll be talking for about

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,080
that minutes first

00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,730
so if y'all still haven't downloaded

00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,350
like goofy got hollow down on it and

00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:41,900
just listen to me in a background okay

00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,340
so does everybody have ninety actually I

00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,850
just realized that even if you don't

00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:49,340
have nightly Firefox is fine so

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:52,910
everybody has a copy of Firefox right so

00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:55,910
ideally you you run all the code and

00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:58,700
whatever using Firefox there's a reason

00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:02,360
for this specifically the Firefox dev

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:04,370
tools will have a great inspector that

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,680
none of the other browsers have so I

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,810
will demonstrate this data but so just

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,630
make sure you have a copy of Firefox it

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,980
doesn't necessarily have to be nightly

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,870
anymore but it'd be nice if it's not

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,170
only cuz um there'll be more features in

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:20,390
the nightly Edition any text editor will

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,010
do there's no NPM nose I don't know

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,950
nothing so the starter files you just

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,530
load it into your into your browser be

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:29,060
fine you just have to keep refreshing

00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,800
paper-and-pencil in from you for reason

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,690
we'll explain as I go to the examples

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,720
like at the back

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:41,390
so before I start right it's a bit of a

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:45,370
story time has anybody work in an agency

00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:48,710
before advertising agency

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:51,860
nobody really oh you have good life man

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:55,490
let me explain I used to well you know

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:58,370
advertising agency and in agency as my

00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,920
first two jobs so a lot of times

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,680
especially in Singapore specifically

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,840
right

00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,730
we are not that digital yet agencies in

00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,470
general so a lot of the times the

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,570
designers usually come from print

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,280
backgrounds and it's great a lot they're

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,190
really rare talent you see those really

00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,410
nice banner ads or things that assign of

00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,780
the lorries the very very nice design

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,520
ones as I just came from that table

00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:24,140
background a really good at Photoshop

00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,210
really good illustrator that sort of

00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,190
thing but one thing about this all

00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:30,020
designs is that they all static right

00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,649
there's already translate very well on

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,910
the web and when the agencies trying

00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:36,490
move towards digital because it's like

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:39,730
the ending nudua they would get clients

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:41,259
they would say okay i need a website or

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,029
whatever and you know

00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:45,160
oh that's does this think on response if

00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:47,439
it sounds good we want that so okay fine

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:49,119
and the designers were not familiar with

00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:52,209
the web in general they would like oh

00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:54,160
the responsive means I give you one big

00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:57,670
one and one little one right so they'll

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,920
give you a large so-called desktop

00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,529
design and it'll give you a mobile

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:06,339
design and you realize that you can't

00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:09,160
actually respond safai them because the

00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:10,779
elements or the place that they they

00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,089
don't understand that in order to make

00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:16,329
something concorde responsive right the

00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:19,149
Mokka actually matters cause a static

00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:21,309
medium like Photoshop or sketch or even

00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:23,230
just drawing on pencil and paper you

00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:24,519
manipulate it directly see it means I

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,449
can oh if I was on the other levees on

00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,459
the Left I'm saying right it's on the

00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:29,050
right but but when it comes to web

00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:33,059
design it doesn't work that way and

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:35,559
there's this this mental model that they

00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:37,540
before anybody explain to then the DVD

00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:41,220
get so you get into a lot of arguments

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,480
then I this cannot be built like

00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,309
actually no it's a really very nice

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:50,170
design it just was very hard to be on

00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:52,209
the web so I feel that this lack of

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,639
understanding of how the browser was the

00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:56,559
root of our problems so what I want to

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,679
do is I'm gonna just explain as briefly

00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:01,569
as I can how a browser vendors elements

00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,059
on the page if you already know this

00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:05,399
then I don't know go browse Facebook or

00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:08,730
something

00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:11,740
so these graphics you see right here by

00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:13,269
this lady called linklok she works at

00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,490
Mozilla and she does something called

00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:17,860
code cartoons and she manages to explain

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,779
a lot of computer science concepts not

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,959
just for browsers but computer science

00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:25,209
concepts using cartoons it's very great

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,649
so eventually I'm gonna share these

00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:28,540
lights and or you can see them they're

00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:31,089
not cut off a little share you but

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:35,230
you're just going like see her stuff is

00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:38,290
really very very accessible so what a

00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,269
browser rendering engine does is right

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,860
because HTML and CSS

00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:44,949
even though some people might disagree

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,160
actually human readable code like humans

00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:48,529
can be HTM

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,089
GSS but your browser cannot your browser

00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:51,829
cannot read all these letters and

00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:53,930
numbers you they have to read bytecode

00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:57,800
right so what the browser does is it

00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:59,300
will pass the HTML CSS into something

00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,009
the browser can understand then the

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:09,079
browser will then turn them into pixels

00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:12,139
on the screen so when the browser first

00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:16,959
receives HTML and CSS files right they

00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:19,670
will sort of pass each of these pegs

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,279
into objects that the browser can

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,319
understand so at this point in the

00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,629
rendering process the Dom knows about

00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:28,490
how the page is structured and all the

00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:30,379
parent-child relationships but it just

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,470
doesn't know how these elements should

00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:35,420
look like so that's the first step so

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:39,259
after that it gets to the style the

00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:41,689
style portion of the world where by the

00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:43,490
browser or then figure out you know

00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:44,959
after everything is passed the browser

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:51,740
figure out how the elements will look

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:54,560
like based on the CSS and at this point

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,899
the layout engine was off we try to

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,790
figure out the dimensions which is the

00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:02,709
sizing for each other elements and where

00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:06,410
exactly on the page they need to go so

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:08,509
this is this is if you think about it

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,689
right when the browser first receives

00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:13,670
the HTML it actually doesn't know the

00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:15,319
size of other it doesn't know other site

00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,880
sizing or all the elements it just knows

00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:18,889
that they are there so I think that's

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,300
the that's the part where non-technical

00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:22,160
people don't understand it because they

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,870
think that ok I am in design it to be

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,470
designed it should be decided actually

00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:29,990
no there's a process for the browser to

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:32,779
calculate how these things actually

00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:35,329
should be so after that there are two

00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:37,399
more processors you get to the pin where

00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:40,309
the browser will pin the different

00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:43,490
boxers on the screen and this can occur

00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:45,920
on multiple layers so it's a bit like

00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:46,730
animation where you where if you draw

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,800
and you flip things

00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,069
so all these the painting happens in

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,639
different boxes and sometimes it can be

00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:57,470
overlapped it can be multi layers so you

00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,910
can actually change from performance

00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,660
standpoint you can actually change one

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,670
layer with

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,020
without having to repin things on the

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:05,510
other layer so things like z-index

00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,850
sometimes this happens

00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,980
and finally lastly there's a combo Z and

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,570
render step so all these different

00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,490
layers there were paint but they'll be

00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,170
render into one image before render on

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,610
the screen so before you actually see

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,250
something in your browser it goes

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,120
through a lot of steps is just

00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:23,450
reasonably fast and you can't really

00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,520
tell there's a reason why whenever you

00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,840
do animation we always say oh there are

00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,100
certain things that you can animate and

00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,170
certain things you should have any mean

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,200
because if you animate the layer

00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:35,570
properties like the top bottom left

00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,460
right right you are affecting it at the

00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,340
third step so you are forcing the

00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,990
browser to go back to the third step

00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:45,020
recalculate everybody's layout we pane

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:47,930
we composite but if you use properties

00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:50,990
like CSS transforms and opacity it only

00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:53,060
hits the last step so that's why it's

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:56,090
more performant if you only enemy

00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,580
transforms and opacity because you don't

00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,650
read trigger the whole layout pain step

00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,230
so this is just from a performance

00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:06,530
standpoint so this X basically how a

00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:09,290
browser works just isn't good to know

00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:10,910
information eventually it might come in

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,400
handy on you I just taught you ten

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:19,400
minutes of facts unrelated to your life

00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:22,220
but so I want to explain now is that web

00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,760
layouts have changed a bit over the

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,970
years

00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:27,320
when you started no layout and then

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,720
there was no CSS at the time so people

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,760
use tables cause they're creative now

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,680
and CSS came about people started to use

00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,400
boots because that was only thing you

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,480
could use to soft lay things out on the

00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,760
pitch okay

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,590
adjust things on the pitch but flows

00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:46,730
actually one meant for layouts floats

00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:49,670
were men for to make your text flow

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,860
around the flow around your image that

00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,450
is the purpose of its that is still the

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,700
purpose of float but we just managed to

00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,740
heck flow to to make it do layouts

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,320
they're sort of so hot that is so hard

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:02,210
to use floats to make proper full page

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,410
layouts that's why when you try to make

00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,570
a full page layout with floats in your

00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:06,740
own mind cut the columns will never be

00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,450
the same height that sort of thing

00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,170
because floats themselves were never

00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,850
meant for it

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,190
so eventually people start using

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:14,810
frameworks because somebody

00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:17,780
took up the pain of writing all the

00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:18,740
correct passes and applying order hex so

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,420
we have frameworks like bootstrap

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,800
foundation most popular and everybody

00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,840
okay I'll just let booster and do all

00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,430
our work and my everybody's website just

00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:31,250
started a lot like bootstrap which is

00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:33,950
honestly kind of boring so with CSS grid

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,020
we now actually have a proper way to do

00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,330
layout we have a proper way to control

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,040
where everything goes on the web and

00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,840
that's why CSS good a lot of people are

00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,080
very excited about it because it's it's

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,090
really a we finally have a proper way to

00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,640
do things you know that we've been doing

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:52,010
things anyhow Lee for the past 20 years

00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,500
and and now we actually have a proper

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:57,430
good way to do layer so there's gonna be

00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:59,360
some basic terminology that I will be

00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,830
talking about throughout this workshop

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:08,860
so let's just get everybody on the same

00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:12,230
page for for grid the lines we refer to

00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:14,270
each of me so I can tell where to put

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,980
things based on the grid lines so grid

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,230
lines actually number are going to a bit

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,880
more detail later but so these lines are

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,880
grid lines and you can refer to them

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,370
using their numerical index you can also

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,490
name lines I will cover that later but

00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:31,700
some gridlines refer to the x and y

00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:33,560
coordinates of the of your grid so each

00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:36,680
individual track that's where your

00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,750
stings sit so horizontal or vertically

00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:42,470
each single column or row is called a

00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:46,160
great track each individual you know bit

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:50,260
is called grid cell collection of grid

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:54,320
cells becomes a good area and one really

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:56,630
how it lets out rip with this convenient

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,060
addition to CSS that we never had before

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,280
is the ability to define a great gap

00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,470
because if you have use flexbox and

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,180
you've made a layer or flex box and

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,010
you've tried to like oh let's we can't

00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:10,130
have everything that next to each other

00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:13,100
will introduce some margin between it

00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:14,660
just is a very complicated and never

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,080
seen some people use like oh you must

00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,400
negative the padding human- the margin

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,760
on the parent and don't know pending

00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:25,430
what nonsense but now with grid you can

00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,900
just say great get 1m thanks and then

00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:31,720
everything will just magically

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:35,240
have even one angry so this is a really

00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,860
good addition I feel like if you didn't

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,750
want to use anything else I think we get

00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:42,290
is enough for you to convert to using

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:45,050
CSS so that I mentioned earlier flexbox

00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:47,300
and green very similar concept so it's

00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:50,270
based on a container chart relationship

00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,370
whereby you have a parent wrapper around

00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:56,000
all the items that you want align on the

00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:57,680
grid so there's always a parent there's

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,140
always a set of properties you apply on

00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:01,670
the parent and then they are a

00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:04,430
difference of properties your planner

00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:07,250
chart so a lot of the properties

00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:13,510
actually for grid go on to the parent

00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:17,060
for flexbox you still in order to create

00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:17,720
grips with flexbox you still hit the

00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,750
child

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:25,100
so they'll be you'll be clearer when you

00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:27,230
get to the actual code but this sentence

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,380
actually sums it up very well in that

00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:32,360
great works from the container in in in

00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,130
the sense that you need to have a big

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,530
picture view of how your layout is gonna

00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:39,920
look like from the beginning if you are

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:42,470
using grid on the other layer actually

00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,270
work on the item meaning I have to set a

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,860
width on the item it could be a

00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,720
percentage it could be a fixed width but

00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,270
you have to sort control the size of the

00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,710
items and so cross your fingers and hope

00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,440
that the browser renders all them

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,420
correctly in the correct place so we're

00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,870
gonna think about the right it's like

00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:02,540
for grid you saw think landscaping you

00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:04,910
saw a plan out like okay my my oak tree

00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,530
is gonna be here my Bougainville us I'm

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,930
gonna be here and in my okay

00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:11,510
it's at a corner you can plan that using

00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:13,160
grid with Nia it's all I just throw the

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,770
seats around and hope that they grow in

00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:19,190
the correct places so I think that's why

00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,990
green is so much more so much more

00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,510
useful for layouts as opposed to the

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:29,830
other methods you are more control so if

00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:34,280
everybody could just can you not your

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:36,680
the index.html from in the base folder

00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,790
in your browser I'm gonna attempt to do

00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,060
this

00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:46,760
and I obviously now practice this so

00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:52,340
this is gonna be very helpful much my

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:55,550
pressure so uh-oh

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:59,660
Oh No why is my spouse already day my

00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:01,250
god it will not look like this it what

00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:11,720
eventually look like this but not now

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:16,400
Joe so if you also ideally you should

00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,660
already have like CSS a CSS file that is

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,500
already linked so you can just type

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:24,770
inside and the classes if so very nice

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:25,640
careful that this if you want to type

00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:29,660
from scratch

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:32,690
go ahead like not stopping you so it

00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,950
should be just like an unlaid up so why

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:37,510
I wanted to demonstrate in this

00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:39,920
beginning but is the fact that for

00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:43,190
inline if you want to create a trick

00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:47,330
Club grid using inline block your Styles

00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:50,720
all go on to the item right so you have

00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:54,620
to define the width of your item so it's

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:59,000
very blur but I use cup 100% divided by

00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:00,530
3 to get 3 columns you won't try it's

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,400
fine actually you don't can skip this

00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:06,590
section float exactly the same also have

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,820
to apply a whiff on to each item

00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:13,340
calculation is also a step for flexbox

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,260
code is slightly different because you

00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:18,020
know you have to apply flex to the

00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,570
parent but for the actual 3 column

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:25,760
alignment you still have to set your

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:28,010
Flex basis to a 3 column set so if you

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,130
think about it right lay inline block

00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:33,080
float flash all these these columns

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:35,360
right the grid doesn't exist ok

00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,910
the only reason looks like a great is

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,040
because we force the items to line up in

00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:43,790
this way there's actually no grid the

00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:46,010
grid is imaginary but when it gets those

00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,230
when you come when it comes to CSS grid

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,380
right the great actually real and grid

00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:52,270
is the only layer technique that

00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:54,520
just a relationship between rows and

00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:56,080
columns this is a key difference between

00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,210
green and flexbox

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,220
because blacks was actually only works

00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:02,500
on a single dimension meaning you can

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:06,550
set the Flex direction to row or to

00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:09,040
column and it will display but in a

00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:11,110
single dimension so if it's raw right it

00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,090
will later one after another but when

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,740
you wrap it around right there is no

00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,080
relationship between the rows and the

00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,420
columns so to get them to line up that's

00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,430
why you're forced to apply a with two

00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,860
inch flex item you're forcing them to

00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:25,810
line up but by default the browser

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:29,170
actually doesn't really know that okay

00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:31,330
if I have a three column grid right my

00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:33,520
fifth item is actually supposed to be

00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,260
directly below my second item no the

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,960
browser doesn't know this we actually

00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,670
solve trick the browser into displaying

00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,410
in this way by setting or with but for

00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:47,170
great you actually can do that because

00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:48,730
the grid is real so I'm gonna cover the

00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,130
properties on a great container first

00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,780
because if you're gonna design using

00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,880
grid that's the first step you have to

00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:57,850
define your grip first the big picture

00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:04,270
view right so in order to define a grid

00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:06,640
this will be the code from here onwards

00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:09,190
so I'm going to introduce three

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,310
properties in this example we have grid

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:16,030
template column width template rows and

00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:21,700
grid template columns and rows have s no

00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:24,640
s Noah okay so it's actually quite

00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:28,620
straightforward to define a grid and the

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:31,150
synth this isn't what did he do to my

00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:34,500
horrid boy I can't see anything

00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,500
can sear on a burner

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:49,650
PMD uh okay now mine let me just okay I

00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:56,920
don't know why you I at be session is

00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:57,760
the most poorly run session in the whole

00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,710

this kind of people pay to see you and I

00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:39,109
will occasionally style

00:36:55,090 --> 00:37:18,740
okay okay

00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:28,310
Oh swell oh it's girl oh yeah oh wow hey

00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:35,720
Chloe hi HDC whoa no it's all wah hey

00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:36,770
thanks for the sorry effect guys okay if

00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,720
you're hanging out with me - longer

00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:40,790
because monk yes me you don't guarantee

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:46,730
so yeah think about it

00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:51,190
oh yeah well I get I want 4k Moneta it

00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:55,780
works yeah it's the best

00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:55,780
okay okay

00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:14,690
okay so if you are now using at the

00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:16,700
first example right so I mentioned the

00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:22,580
properties you want to use a grid

00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:24,110
template row columns with an S so for

00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:26,090
the benefit of this example let's just

00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:28,870
do a fixed layout first because you know

00:38:26,090 --> 00:39:06,200
easier to understand

00:38:28,870 --> 00:39:09,770
probably oh yeah okay anytime in Oh fun

00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:13,910
fact if you are using sublime text like

00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:17,420
me the latest follow css3 plugin I go to

00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:19,150
compare but if you don't have just take

00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:22,940
my hand Oh milady

00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:30,170
so what great templates row also you

00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:36,040
first have to display grid sure I said

00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:36,040
the ball can can great okay save refresh

00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:54,119
well this might not work properly I'm

00:39:42,030 --> 00:40:01,079
past that guys okay rose life coding is

00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:02,790
the worst idea on the planet so you

00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:05,099
should get something like this and

00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:07,170
you're gonna have to follow the values I

00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:11,010
use also your can like use your own

00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:14,609
values because I mean yeah why why why B

00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:16,619
why 150 I have no answer so use whatever

00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:18,480
you want you want to use em if you don't

00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:19,770
want it to be spend so I can I start

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,109
playing around with it it's alright okay

00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:24,109
you want it and even then okay no uneven

00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:29,579
things like that so is I showed you

00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:32,490
that's that's the first that's how you

00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:34,920
actually start getting angry so if you

00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:37,260
look at the code right yes it's a big

00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,480
video so if you have three values it's

00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:41,760
three columns if you have you know four

00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,040
values it's four columns is is actually

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,950
why I like about using CSS green is

00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:49,290
because it's actually visual inside your

00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:51,780
code and later they'll be a few a few

00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:54,240
more properties that are that continue

00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,579
this trend of visual noise but okay

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,200
let's do need my favorite then supplies

00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:01,200
dies doesn't even know about it yet so

00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:06,060
your jammies and arrow but once you get

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,579
right so you don't really you don't have

00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:11,579
to calculate my jeans or nonsense but

00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:14,010
the only thing is that for now it's

00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:16,079
Universal so you see I cannot say oh I

00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:18,660
want this big gap to be one end is on

00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,450
the b2 am NOT yeah I think is coming

00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:26,250
soon that you can define you may be able

00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:30,829
to define the column Greek gap but for

00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,829
now cannot for now it's just overall gap

00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:37,170
yeah for now it's Austin for now for now

00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,530
event I think it's going to be updated

00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:43,470
soon so there is the most basic grid

00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:46,500
that you have okay moving on what do I

00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:47,950
plan so you can also name grid lines

00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,190
because if you are

00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:53,140
but very early on right I said that

00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:55,990
under the terminology okay so now this

00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:57,579
is the reason why for everybody to go

00:41:55,990 --> 00:42:00,280
and install a new browser if you don't

00:41:57,579 --> 00:42:03,940
already use Firefox so if you open the

00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:09,059
dev tools for Firefox Firefox has layout

00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:09,059
panel nobody else has it and you can see

00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:16,000
it will show you every single element on

00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:18,130
your page that users display agree so

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,470
and the let's - because in the bottom I

00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:22,930
have one Mona but let's say if you

00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:24,910
happen to define it green C or C or 8

00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,500
Greece and it allows you to change the

00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:28,359
color so you don't get yourself confused

00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,130
so I say don't I Papa cause the default

00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:33,849
value is Papa right then you can change

00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:36,880
a color and then yeah so when you turn

00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:39,069
it on you can see you can see the Greek

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,819
gaps you can see the line number so I

00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:44,650
was I thought that only nightly had this

00:42:42,819 --> 00:42:46,720
but I was told that even the normal

00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:48,609
version has this great display settings

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,140
whereby I can toggle on line number

00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:52,210
actually I don't know why you want any

00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,220
of course I always keep it on and you

00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:56,680
can also toggle line area names which I

00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,750
will cover later one thing that the

00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:01,630
pharmacy la team is working on is to

00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:05,920
actually figure out a UI a proper UI to

00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:08,799
display line names but right now you

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,470
can't really see line names so the use

00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:13,720
case for having grid named grid lines is

00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:15,609
that this is a reasonably simple grid

00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,799
like oh it's just three columns and two

00:43:15,609 --> 00:43:20,109
rows and my number only goes up to four

00:43:17,799 --> 00:43:22,390
right so imagine if you had quite a

00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:25,420
complicated agree that maybe goes up to

00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:26,920
like oh I want 20 columns so and if I

00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,599
want to position something in the middle

00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:31,780
I'm like oh that you're not going to

00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:34,210
count each of the each of the columns to

00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,339
get to the lines so what you can do grid

00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:40,630
allows you to name lines so the syntax

00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:42,790
is square bracket so you can say it is

00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:46,450
an to tie the thing on this one name

00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:48,280
okay at first time please think of more

00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:50,740
intelligent names than me obviously my

00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:56,079
IQ is in double like single digits right

00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:58,270
now and you there's no limit to how many

00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:01,280
names you can name your lines so for

00:43:58,270 --> 00:44:05,660
example why does this make sense because

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:07,880
I can like do this so both apple and

00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:10,100
empanadas that technically refer to the

00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,530
same line so you make your code a bit

00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:15,910
more make sense

00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:22,640
ish give me a foot that starts with C

00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:27,160
cranberry you got my fruit man okay long

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:27,160
cucumber cucum a lot fun

00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:37,390
it is a ridiculous example okay you you

00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,980
want to be able to see this on their

00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:42,280
toes because not there eventually

00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:45,700
Firefox is gonna push update whether you

00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:48,190
actually can display the the named lines

00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:50,440
is just from a UI perspective it's a bit

00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:53,079
tricky because if you have funny people

00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,880
like me who name give like five names

00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:56,589
and all the names are very long or call

00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,329
hippopotamus there's very hard to

00:44:56,589 --> 00:45:00,099
display nicely so I think they're just

00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:02,430
thinking about that for now so what we

00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:05,589
can do after we've named great lines is

00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:08,140
when you place your item I will cover

00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:11,500
this in more detail later when I cover

00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:13,240
properties on the great item but usually

00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:16,240
you would go with you would define

00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:21,660
exactly where I want I want item F to be

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:25,299
here like I will refer to it as like 3/4

00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:30,130
so it's like start and end position so

00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:32,530
instead of 3/4 I can say cucumber stack

00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:35,829
cucumber and that's the purpose of named

00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:37,900
lines so you can you keep this in mind

00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:39,900
pass will use it a bit later keep in

00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:43,809
mind that you can name your grid lines

00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:47,380
okay so let's move on oh this is an

00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:52,990
example okay let's just play with this

00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:55,380
example no we're showing this my

00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:55,380
goodness

00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:11,590
no not this one not this one any money

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,630
great too so if you are not in the

00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:21,130
layout panel you can actually highlight

00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:24,310
the grid and if you can see when you

00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:27,220
zoom as you can see this week or 14 you

00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:28,840
can click here turn on so you don't have

00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,580
to go to the layout panel you can do it

00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,880
from here you just click this war for

00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:40,360
icon yeah so they all turn on this so

00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:42,910
you can see so if I change this to gamma

00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:44,500
and then my items see just stretch the

00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:45,840
whole line so I don't have to use

00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:49,360
numbers I can use names the

00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:53,290
demonstration moving on so other than

00:46:49,360 --> 00:47:00,480
naming the grid lines I can name green

00:46:53,290 --> 00:47:00,480
areas so I gosh turn this off so

00:47:00,749 --> 00:47:09,329
right in this example I have four

00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:12,630
columns and two rows let me turn this

00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:12,630
thickness up

00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,390
great

00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:33,859
okay come on so you can see I have four

00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,859
well my numbers

00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:44,170
four columns three rows so what you can

00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,600
do there's this one more property called

00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:50,140
grid template areas so what you can do

00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:53,620
is you can name your grid so the syntax

00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:56,770
is your syntax is supposed to mirror

00:47:53,620 --> 00:48:01,330
your columns and rows so you can see

00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:04,300
it's four columns and 3 rows as well and

00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:06,510
if I want to have I don't want anything

00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:09,100
to be in that particular cell is a

00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:11,980
notation so for this particular example

00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:13,510
I have three items so what you do after

00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,250
you name your green areas is that you

00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:17,410
can assign these areas to your grid

00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:20,470
items so I've preached items for this

00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:22,210
example if you follow in your exercise

00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:25,260
code your selector is different so you

00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:30,220
you your noticeable inspect or something

00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:33,040
so you can saw a sign each item to its

00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:36,880
specific area so the benefit of using

00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:40,300
this is that I if I want to change the

00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,220
layout maybe if I'm doing a responsive

00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:44,170
design and I want to change the layer at

00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:48,870
a different point I don't actually have

00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:53,380
to go to each great item and write a new

00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:56,500
assign a new area for it at a different

00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:59,500
video query you can just directly change

00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:02,800
the grid template areas and you can see

00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:05,110
okay now it takes up for all I want B to

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,870
be longer okay I can do this I want C to

00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:11,590
pick up I can do this so you actually

00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:14,200
only need to apply the change to you can

00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:16,570
just directly change your grid at each

00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:19,510
different breakpoint for in terms I

00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:21,610
think this is most applicable we are

00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:23,560
doing responsive design one of the first

00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:26,470
example we'll be covering later or make

00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:30,400
use of this property but I find it quite

00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:32,260
useful for when I'm building dashboards

00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,510
or web applications because somehow

00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:39,820
there's my day job now this is quite

00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:41,740
useful because I can sort of assign all

00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:43,360
my gray items and then I don't have to

00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:45,270
think about my gray items I can just

00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,700
think about the grid so this I feel that

00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:51,710
this makes the green areas property very

00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:55,230
useful so that's that moving

00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:58,289
okay so the great specification is very

00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:59,849
long okay now I'm gonna stand up has

00:49:58,289 --> 00:50:03,960
anybody actually read the great

00:49:59,849 --> 00:50:05,190
specification before ah very good so

00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,619
you'll just have to trust me when I say

00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:08,460
that the great specification is like I

00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:11,700
don't know honey

00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:13,470
if you print it is a 100 pages I don't

00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:15,900
know that but it's a lot of paper but

00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:17,910
what it does introduce is this new unit

00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,950
called the F are unique and it

00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:21,990
represents a fraction of the free space

00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:24,480
in the great container so this does not

00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:29,430
look good on the slide so it looks good

00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:43,670
on the code so moving on name area skip

00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:53,190
F R 1.30 okay Oh tree huh okay so for

00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:56,250
what we can do is template columns to

00:50:53,190 --> 00:51:01,559
see in action let's say 1 F R and then

00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:06,890
the last two we make a fix now and you

00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:06,890
don't actually have to define rows

00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,900
one dimension if you need to so I'm

00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,530
gonna be lazy

00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:19,280
I just declare that it the I just

00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:20,900
spelled something wrongly so yeah forgot

00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,610
the most important property everything

00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:28,130
only was you've got this maybe notice

00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:37,160
very nothing works my bed okay

00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:38,750
let me take this take it out okay is

00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:44,470
this cosmo i zoom

00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:48,800
I was oom I about zoom horn I give it

00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:51,100
okay so why did right I have three I've

00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,960
three items I put them in three columns

00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:58,010
my last two columns are fixed there are

00:51:53,960 --> 00:52:00,860
300 pixels first column is 1fr so you

00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:03,410
just takes up all the remaining free

00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:05,990
space after the browser gives okay item

00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:07,580
B an item C you each are 300 pixels the

00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,980
rest of the space I thought it can take

00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:12,320
everything so that's how that's that's

00:52:09,980 --> 00:52:16,220
the basic premise of it so huh it's a

00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:18,890
ratio so I say I decide to make the

00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:24,740
second one to Fr then we can see what

00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:27,020
happens is that now I don't see will

00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:29,420
always be 200 pixels because you know

00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:31,460
fixed but now the remaining space free

00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:36,370
space will be distributed in a one to

00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:36,370
two ratio for item B n I don't see

00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:41,750
and people want know why developers have

00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:46,490
to resize browser thousand times a day

00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:48,109
these are to see effect right so so it

00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:51,619
really useful for responsive design

00:52:48,109 --> 00:52:53,300
because you can solve your letting the

00:52:51,619 --> 00:52:55,160
browser do the calculations for you

00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,869
you're letting the browser design having

00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,570
an item should be because at the end of

00:52:56,869 --> 00:53:01,940
the day you won't know you won't know

00:52:59,570 --> 00:53:03,740
like what is the size of the screen that

00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:06,710
your user is using anyway it could be

00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:08,990
like very nice TV or it could be my my

00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:11,359
very very tiny phone so why would you

00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:13,910
want to specify a fixed width and then

00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:16,040
you know you you end up breaking some at

00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:18,230
some point if you use flexible units

00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,030
like these even like even percentages is

00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:23,390
a flexible you need write itself

00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:28,150
let's the browser do the calculations FR

00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:30,140
is is is useful because it's more

00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:32,330
predictable than percentages percentages

00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,849
is quite tricky actually because it's

00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:36,410
always a percentage of something and I

00:53:34,849 --> 00:53:39,109
guess for with it's fine but every time

00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:41,440
it comes to high just like 100 percent

00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:43,520
high never works guys just don't do it

00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,560
but you know you have a number of

00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:47,210
flexible units our disposal now we have

00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:49,520
percentages we also have viewport units

00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:51,920
I might talk a bit about it later but

00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:54,050
essentially I think that we should be

00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,160
moving towards using more flexible units

00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:57,050
because we're just seeing the

00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,450
calculation so the browser obviously

00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:02,869
calculate better than you right so

00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:04,910
that's the FR you need I should go back

00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:05,619
to my slice the structure is in the

00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:08,180
slots

00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:08,750
okay so there are nice things that you

00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:10,910
can do

00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:13,640
you'll notice this repeat function which

00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:16,010
I got to about very soon but um so for

00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:18,410
that let's explain this code right in

00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:22,280
this it says grid template columns

00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:24,619
repeat tree but is 3 2 so if you can see

00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:28,580
right the these these pictures are in

00:54:24,619 --> 00:54:30,410
the ratio of 3 is to 2 so then you end

00:54:28,580 --> 00:54:32,210
up with something like this why because

00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:34,250
it's a fraction of the free space

00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:35,630
available so when I resize the browser

00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:38,390
to the fit amount of free space

00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:41,089
available changes and so the browser

00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:44,810
will surrender all my elements according

00:54:41,089 --> 00:54:48,380
to the ratio so so you can get a fluid

00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:50,670
design this way so if you notice right

00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:52,500
I used repeat 3

00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:54,450
and the pattern repeated itself three

00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:58,410
times so that's the premise of the

00:54:54,450 --> 00:55:01,080
repeat function which will be covered

00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:02,220
later so nevermind we move on to the min

00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:04,830
max function first

00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:06,630
so min max function adding is really

00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:08,490
nice because we've never been able to do

00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:12,210
this before we've always only been able

00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:15,180
to define like a fixed a single value

00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:16,800
for for for sizing so it could be a

00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:18,900
fixed of flexible value but it's always

00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,150
the one value but now you can actually

00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:24,000
define a range you can tell the browser

00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:25,950
I want my my item to be between this

00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,990
length and that length which we never

00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:31,800
been able to do before and it is really

00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:34,950
I think a very useful feature also when

00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:41,880
it comes to responsive design so moving

00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:49,200
on let's do this I am lazy so I'm gonna

00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:52,770
copy you can type if you want to we're

00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:56,750
sorry the next one very low sorry next

00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:56,750
no guys shiny soft all order

00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:06,340
okay so if you can see now right

00:56:03,609 --> 00:56:09,010
in this example very similar the first

00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:12,609
example is just I said the first column

00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:13,119
to me next 200 pixels 1fo so what does

00:56:12,609 --> 00:56:17,200
this mean

00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:19,510
this means that the minimum width of the

00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:24,010
first column is 200 pixels it will not

00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:26,260
go less than 200 pixels but if it's more

00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:29,290
than 200 meters there just a cup all the

00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:33,790
free space available so start reciting a

00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:35,349
brother folks see because once it hears

00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:37,630
200 right it's not gonna show you any

00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:38,560
more so about like then everybody

00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:41,280
becomes fixated

00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:45,010
so like 200 300 300 so I have overflow

00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:47,260
because I forced it to be a hundred but

00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:48,510
if I have a lot of space you just keep

00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,890
going

00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:53,890
so that's essentially what the min max

00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:55,540
function does so kiddies in mind that

00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:58,180
you know you cannot define a range of

00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:01,900
values and you can you can do you can

00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:05,490
cap it so essentially it's a bit similar

00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:08,920
if you you wrote a mean with care but

00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:12,250
when you use it together within your

00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,990
within your column so if you use a mean

00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:17,170
we've right you can only kept the whiff

00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:18,580
of your item this means we've used in

00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:20,680
this context is actually the width of

00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:22,300
the column so all the other items inside

00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:25,359
that column get affect them like this as

00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:26,560
well in case you are wondering like why

00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:32,320
do we need this where we are mean we've

00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:34,180
next we fry so next function is the

00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:37,270
repeat function which I use just now is

00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:39,609
to specify a large number of columns or

00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:41,290
rows that follow a similar pattern so

00:57:39,609 --> 00:57:44,020
it's not necessarily that I can only

00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:45,580
only need like I say repeat for 75

00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:47,470
pixels that I can only have like one

00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:49,450
column repeated 4 times actually a

00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:51,220
pattern so let's say maybe you have a

00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:54,970
pattern of three columns you're like oh

00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:56,950
I want to repeat this wonderful 2fr 300

00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:58,810
these three column pattern I want to

00:57:56,950 --> 00:58:00,910
repeat it multiple times and I really

00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:02,500
don't want to type it multiple times you

00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:05,589
can't use the repeat function so the

00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:07,240
first the first argument is the number

00:58:05,589 --> 00:58:10,089
of times you want a repeater and then

00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,589
the pattern so you can use this in this

00:58:10,089 --> 00:58:14,619
example it's repeat

00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:17,259
4:35 20 so you can see is that oh now I

00:58:14,619 --> 00:58:21,729
have eight columns I think that's pretty

00:58:17,259 --> 00:58:23,829
useful okay so everybody probably on the

00:58:21,729 --> 00:58:27,210
side is moving on

00:58:23,829 --> 00:58:29,499
so other than specifying the number of

00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:33,219
the number of times you want to repeat

00:58:29,499 --> 00:58:34,779
again the more step further in letting

00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:38,109
the browser take over your design is

00:58:34,779 --> 00:58:40,599
that again you want only the browser

00:58:38,109 --> 00:58:43,180
will know how how big the screen is

00:58:40,599 --> 00:58:45,969
and your user is viewing it so there are

00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:48,640
keywords that you can put as your

00:58:45,969 --> 00:58:50,289
argument instead of a fixed number like

00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,960
oh three or four these are fixed numbers

00:58:50,289 --> 00:58:56,140
right you can use autofill or Auto fee

00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,809
they are very very similar in that you

00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:02,229
tell the browser that okay this is the

00:58:58,809 --> 00:59:06,999
behavior of my my column or my pattern

00:59:02,229 --> 00:59:09,969
right minimum minimum with 100 maximum

00:59:06,999 --> 00:59:11,499
with go go like whatever free space is

00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:14,380
available and then you tell the browser

00:59:11,499 --> 00:59:16,239
ok browser you generate how many columns

00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:18,489
you think is necessary so in the browser

00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:21,670
the browser plus its own size so in the

00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:24,940
browser is on like this beautiful

00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:27,670
Samsung 4k TV you know that you will

00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:30,759
have to generate more columns than if I

00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:32,680
was viewing this on my phone so this

00:59:30,759 --> 00:59:34,630
example is just show the difference

00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:41,349
between the two key words of autofill

00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:42,369
Auto fee so when it's Auto feel right if

00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:46,239
you look at the amount of free space

00:59:42,369 --> 00:59:50,859
available because now the minimum the

00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:54,940
minimum width is 100 pixels is that the

00:59:50,859 --> 00:59:58,420
the container can contain more than six

00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:00,309
and you saw it will respect that I have

00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:03,079
actually can have two more columns I see

01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:14,209
you again Shirley's

01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:16,969
yeah on your key what she turn it on so

01:00:14,209 --> 01:00:18,589
if you can see right the browser respect

01:00:16,969 --> 01:00:23,959
that you casually fit two more columns

01:00:18,589 --> 01:00:27,049
so that gives it like proper definitions

01:00:23,959 --> 01:00:29,329
by changing to fit home it just collapse

01:00:27,049 --> 01:00:33,079
them it will collapse the empty columns

01:00:29,329 --> 01:00:35,479
so I might use auto feet you just fill

01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:38,029
out other variables but autofill will

01:00:35,479 --> 01:00:44,989
respect empty tracks that's the

01:00:38,029 --> 01:00:51,049
difference so this is the most amazing

01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:54,200
of using this piece of mechanism to

01:00:51,049 --> 01:00:56,900
generate regular grids to me so if

01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:59,180
you're doing like image gallery or you

01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:02,109
know the very popular like pout layouts

01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:04,729
and stuff or like a lot of items right

01:01:02,109 --> 01:01:09,319
it used to be that you had to write a

01:01:04,729 --> 01:01:11,029
lot of media queries cuz that's a quite

01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:12,410
a common design pattern we see like

01:01:11,029 --> 01:01:14,630
maybe e-commerce websites and things

01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:17,359
like that right so my designer would say

01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:19,150
hey I have like six columns can you like

01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:21,709
six five four three two one and I know

01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:23,420
like technically yes technically yes I

01:01:21,709 --> 01:01:24,650
can six five four three two one but I

01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:26,569
would have to write a lot of media

01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:29,809
queries and my market would be very

01:01:26,569 --> 01:01:31,640
convoluted so I used to reject this sort

01:01:29,809 --> 01:01:33,979
of design I say you have to give me

01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,819
proper multiples so like I can accept

01:01:33,979 --> 01:01:37,759
for two one

01:01:34,819 --> 01:01:39,680
okay I said six three one I cannot

01:01:37,759 --> 01:01:41,809
accept five four six five four three two

01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:44,440
one no I used to reject those designs

01:01:41,809 --> 01:01:48,890
all the time because it was too much

01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:50,390
you're still Hecky but two lines I can

01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:52,940
do six five four three two one

01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:57,680
okay five five five four three two one

01:01:52,940 --> 01:02:00,160
because using the autofill keyword so

01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:02,239
the autofill keyword right again I'm

01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:04,579
instructed for this particular example

01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:09,229
right let explain I'm telling the

01:02:04,579 --> 01:02:13,609
browser I want to have a minimum column

01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:15,859
width of 10 MS and you just browser you

01:02:13,609 --> 01:02:16,320
also going calculate like browser go go

01:02:15,859 --> 01:02:18,390
ahead

01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:21,660
how many columns I need so I look at an

01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:24,450
example right and the widest okay I can

01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:27,240
fit I can fit five columns so you will

01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:28,920
you will generate five columns sure but

01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:32,010
if you think about it right if I have

01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:38,100
five columns to fit perfectly it should

01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:41,610
be 50 amps but even if I go larger five

01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:44,610
five columns but not yeah six columns if

01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:47,610
you want using grid you you would have

01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:50,250
this fixed white space let's say your

01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:52,500
container was 55 m/s and each of your

01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:54,600
column is 10 amps there'll be these five

01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:56,820
m0 for white space it is very hard to

01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:59,760
deal with but with the F are unique

01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:02,490
because it if there's more than a

01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,950
minimum tab is 10 M but if it's more

01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:07,650
than 10 M you can grow so whenever we

01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:10,380
distribute these 5 m/s of white space

01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:13,170
equally amongst all 5 columns so we can

01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:15,990
see in the example right it always H to

01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:19,740
H to the parent without me having to do

01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:22,950
additional nas funny Cup then I must cup

01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:24,720
no percent if I by 5 plus how many ends

01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:26,550
for the to take account for a white page

01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:29,220
right no don't need you can just do it

01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:34,940
two lines is very clean and it always

01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:34,940
edge to edge and whenever there's no in

01:03:35,029 --> 01:03:39,869
enough space to fit five columns anymore

01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:41,549
I reduce it to fall as ensuring summer

01:03:39,869 --> 01:03:43,380
okay there's not enough space for four

01:03:41,549 --> 01:03:44,099
let's go to tree I literally can five

01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:47,099
four three two one

01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:48,869
so like yeah I'm to me this is amazing

01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:50,910
do you maybe not so amazing cuz you've

01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:52,349
never will agency before but if you want

01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:54,349
anything before you really appreciate

01:03:52,349 --> 01:04:00,000
these guys just sayin

01:03:54,349 --> 01:04:03,029
so that's useful moving on next

01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:06,119
oh so fast okay then we have properties

01:04:03,029 --> 01:04:10,559
that go onto the green item so the two

01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:12,990
steps for using CSS grid is the i/o is

01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,670
that you first define your grid so you

01:04:12,990 --> 01:04:15,960
think about the design that you want to

01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:18,480
build you plenty already

01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,160
so after you define your grid then you

01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,549
want to start placing items on the grid

01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:25,200
so it's like my favorite analogies is a

01:04:23,549 --> 01:04:26,760
chessboard you define how your

01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,190
chessboard looks and then you place the

01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:31,770
pieces on your chest but depending on

01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:35,819
your design however so the the placement

01:04:31,770 --> 01:04:38,970
properties as I mentioned it's using

01:04:35,819 --> 01:04:42,779
line numbers that's the default so what

01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:45,029
you would do is you would okay this is

01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:51,059
very simple I'm gonna turn on so you can

01:04:45,029 --> 01:04:53,099
see the lines this is so useful if I

01:04:51,059 --> 01:04:56,510
didn't have this right I would mess up

01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:56,510
all my designs guy can't see

01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:10,540
are you I'm happy your own thing oh here

01:05:04,410 --> 01:05:12,720
don't use complicated slides okay so you

01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:15,940
can see for this

01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:18,610
okay see a line numbers so I am placing

01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:25,600
my fruits based on the line number so

01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:29,080
for the Apple right start at 4 4 4 5 2 3

01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:32,140
so that's how I place everything you can

01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:35,350
place your fruits or whatever however

01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:38,910
you want it to go but so you actually

01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:42,700
just tell the browser where you want

01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:45,960
your items to be greet column and greet

01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:48,460
role actually already shorthands the

01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:54,130
long hand syntax is actually great

01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:57,910
column start bit column n so by default

01:05:54,130 --> 01:06:00,670
each great item goes into one cell so if

01:05:57,910 --> 01:06:04,230
I don't do anything my folks are all

01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:08,290
going to obediently take up one cell so

01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:10,210
okay okay I lazy to put classes are

01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:15,100
youth end child but everybody knows the

01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:20,140
ancient one is the first thing so I can

01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:23,470
make it spend multiple great tricks like

01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:26,470
this okay my first what actually diaper

01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:28,240
so you it doesn't have to take out one

01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:29,710
cell because based on what your design

01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:33,790
is you might have you know things that

01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:40,780
are longer or shorter so these values

01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:42,640
right the first value is where you want

01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:45,130
it to start and the last value is where

01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:47,410
money to n so if I don't put anything

01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:49,810
the default is the star so and if I

01:06:47,410 --> 01:06:52,480
don't put any if I don't play and by

01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:54,670
default a cat one cell so that's why the

01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:57,010
code Greek column for and Greek row two

01:06:54,670 --> 01:07:00,880
it works you don't break anything it's

01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:03,070
just you take out one cell spat for for

01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,380
the column count start at two at the row

01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:08,410
count but you are free to soar changed

01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:09,220
it on like change the great areas and

01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:11,830
how you want

01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:13,600
I choose to use the

01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:16,450
column shorthand instead of writing out

01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:20,620
Greek columns that four great column and

01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:22,570
six because I'm lazy so I suggest that

01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:24,610
you do it also so other than using the

01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:26,830
numbers if you remember earlier on we

01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:29,190
talked about named lines so that's where

01:07:26,830 --> 01:07:31,930
you can use your name lines as well oh

01:07:29,190 --> 01:07:33,760
yeah so that's how you that's basically

01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:35,440
how you start placing items on the grid

01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:41,050
and how you start building out the

01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:47,370
design that you have in mind moving on

01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:47,370
oh my card is ready so yeah next

01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,940
so after okay okay this is gonna be

01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,320
interesting

01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:55,780
when I did this right you see I'm at a

01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,640
place that Girl Talk and usually most

01:07:55,780 --> 01:08:01,060
people don't one like you want to be

01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:02,980
able to adjust your hypo like I think

01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:04,480
centering is somehow a popular design

01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:06,700
concept everybody wants everything

01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:09,040
centers I don't know why so what you

01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:12,430
have is you have a number of properties

01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:13,690
that allow you to align things along

01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:20,310
your grid within your green in your

01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:24,790
great item and things like that so going

01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:27,790
aligning grid items so if you use

01:08:24,790 --> 01:08:30,520
flexbox right they would how many people

01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:34,480
can never remember justified us what

01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:37,630
align does what and so this is the this

01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:38,920
is a my own personal trick to remember I

01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:40,810
don't know it works for you by works for

01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,470
me everybody has used Microsoft Word

01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:44,290
before in your life

01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:47,530
right everybody right so you've also

01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:49,630
helped to a justified text in your life

01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:52,540
right you know the Bata I'm quite sure

01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:57,030
is that not on the right-hand side then

01:08:52,540 --> 01:09:00,820
you have the justify left justify Center

01:08:57,030 --> 01:09:04,630
the word justify always shifts your text

01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:06,670
in along the line right so justify you

01:09:04,630 --> 01:09:08,680
just remember edifice along a line and

01:09:06,670 --> 01:09:10,450
the only two options only got justify

01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:12,609
and align so if justify is this

01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:14,370
direction then align massive is

01:09:12,609 --> 01:09:16,810
directional and then you'll never forget

01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:18,750
is formula if it doesn't this those of

01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:21,880
you I don't think on something else so

01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:23,980
for me a justified line quite

01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:25,480
straightforward but we didn't justify

01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,719
our line there are three other words

01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:30,069
there

01:09:25,719 --> 01:09:31,210
condense self and items content you need

01:09:30,069 --> 01:09:36,370
to understand how it works do you

01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:39,690
remember justify content is when your

01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:42,370
grid when your parent container is

01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:45,089
larger than the sum of your items

01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:48,730
usually this will happen if you have

01:09:45,089 --> 01:09:50,500
fixed the fixed column widths

01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:52,120
because if it's flexible you just take

01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,460
out the whole space then this these

01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:56,680
properties don't really apply anymore in

01:09:54,460 --> 01:10:00,070
terms of positioning so let's say for

01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:02,650
example my gris-gris conned a nice 800

01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:06,640
pixels I have three columns by each

01:10:02,650 --> 01:10:08,590
other 200 pixels so in pota mathematical

01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:11,410
speaking if your math is very bad three

01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:13,360
times 200 pixels is 600 pixels if my

01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:16,650
parent is a graphic sauce and my colors

01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:19,540
are 600 pixels I have 200 pixels of

01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:21,610
available space so indeed like if you

01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:23,410
can see this tiny like imagine okay so

01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:27,010
this extra white space you can actually

01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:30,430
adjust the entire your set of columns

01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:33,010
and rows to where you want it within the

01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:36,190
parent so you can like adjust it around

01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:39,550
so justify content and align content is

01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:42,760
to align content within the element now

01:10:39,550 --> 01:10:46,750
for justify self right so if you look at

01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:49,500
the color coding the content within the

01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:53,830
grid cell can also cause some by default

01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:55,239
not necessarily your the content within

01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:57,460
each cell would take out the entire

01:10:55,239 --> 01:10:59,830
space sometimes you have maybe just one

01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:01,449
line and the one line will be like all

01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:04,090
the way at the top like that alright so

01:11:01,449 --> 01:11:06,219
you can actually align where you want

01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:09,969
your content to be within the grid cell

01:11:06,219 --> 01:11:13,330
itself then you use justify self justify

01:11:09,969 --> 01:11:16,960
self is for the great items justify

01:11:13,330 --> 01:11:19,480
content is for the entire collection the

01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:24,670
entire grid so to speak and justify

01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:29,080
items is just telling order is overall

01:11:24,670 --> 01:11:30,940
application to each individual item so

01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:33,610
you can make all your B items align you

01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:36,580
agree items align to the bottom so items

01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:38,960
like everybody all together then self is

01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:41,400
for individual

01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:46,110
or you can just try to memorize these

01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:51,180
paper I don't know so that's what you

01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:54,510
can do so in this example you can see

01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:58,410
how it looks like justify an align

01:11:54,510 --> 01:12:00,210
content can do content distribution as

01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:02,460
well so just now I described is

01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:06,540
positional alignment meaning I can make

01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:09,450
all my columns centers that end but I

01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:12,960
can also distribute migrate items using

01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:18,090
the justify and align content properties

01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:22,340
so for positional two for positional the

01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:25,320
values is starts at time n but to

01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:29,610
distribute properties you have also

01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:33,480
three other properties you have space

01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:36,210
between space between means that all

01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:39,300
your items are yes they are evenly

01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:41,700
distributed but they will they will meet

01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:45,650
the age of your parent so that space

01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:49,910
between we have spaced evenly whereby

01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:49,910
let's highlight the easier to see

01:12:55,139 --> 01:13:09,310
and I'm going to remove the great gap so

01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:13,600
we are space between right it goes to

01:13:09,310 --> 01:13:18,460
the the the the space between each item

01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:20,260
is equal and the H there's no there's no

01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:22,989
space between the edge of the item and

01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:24,969
the edge of the container for even

01:13:22,989 --> 01:13:27,760
nearer everything has an equal amount of

01:13:24,969 --> 01:13:31,960
space around it so you can see the ones

01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:33,900
and this this width is half this

01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:37,060
distance is half of this distance

01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:41,889
because it's evenly the space is evenly

01:13:37,060 --> 01:13:46,960
and then we also have space around space

01:13:41,889 --> 01:13:48,489
around this is a half width of there's a

01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:53,320
handy tip I'll show you later this is

01:13:48,489 --> 01:13:55,360
just confusing the same words so for the

01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:58,449
first three those are the positional

01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:02,560
values for justify content and aligned

01:13:58,449 --> 01:14:05,290
content so stop and and Center will

01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:07,119
shift the whole thing space around so I

01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:08,860
used two different colors for space

01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:11,560
around the mouth space around each

01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:13,840
column is the same so it becomes a

01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:18,550
double space in the middle but for space

01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:20,770
evenly the space is distributed so

01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:22,630
depending on your design what if you

01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:25,650
want to achieve you can use these three

01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:25,650
properties accordingly

01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:31,080
yeah okay so this is for justify an

01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:33,360
alliance elf

01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:36,060
by default the default property is that

01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:38,130
the grid item stretch and take up the

01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:40,260
entire space of the grid item that you

01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:43,530
align so for example in the first

01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:46,800
example in the very very first exercise

01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:48,210
that we did it was 150 pixels and 100

01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,120
pixels so that's the start of mangry

01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:53,280
item if it was the case that means that

01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:55,800
by default the space allocated is

01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:58,650
stretch fill up the host fill up the

01:14:55,800 --> 01:15:00,930
whole area right but I can also align it

01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:04,550
so for this one you can see always the

01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:07,530
moment I set a value of stat Center and

01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:10,680
the amount space given to my grade item

01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:13,230
he was shrink to fit shrink to fit so be

01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:15,990
actually only picks up this much space

01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:18,270
and she only takes on this much space so

01:15:15,990 --> 01:15:20,610
by default is stretched so the moment I

01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:23,340
give it a value you are shrink to fit so

01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:26,490
force V iolite assignee to start so he

01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:28,860
said I put a line cell start so we all

01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:31,890
remember a line is along this axis right

01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:34,050
so studies at the very top for C I gave

01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:36,120
it n so in all the way at the bottom for

01:15:34,050 --> 01:15:37,800
D I gave it Center so it's in the center

01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:40,020
but for all these three they shrunk to

01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:41,640
fit so that's the that's that data

01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:45,930
that's what happens when you use these

01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:48,180
properties for items is just everybody

01:15:45,930 --> 01:15:52,710
all together so if I would if I was

01:15:48,180 --> 01:15:54,890
gonna do something like stop everybody

01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:59,090
everybody justifies to the stat

01:15:54,890 --> 01:16:02,070
everybody justifies to the center so

01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:07,920
items is for universal pattern

01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:14,660
oh so fast demo never okay great and

01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:14,660
your name bring on no need no need great

01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:29,159
so the the first example is in the

01:16:20,429 --> 01:16:31,440
dashboard ah let me try open it so this

01:16:29,159 --> 01:16:36,090
is how it should look if you downloaded

01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:38,099
it like it's just like that some colors

01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:42,599
on it because I was feeling particularly

01:16:38,099 --> 01:16:48,020
colorful when I created this the end

01:16:42,599 --> 01:16:48,020
result should look like this hold on

01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:56,610
is all she wrote on your knees that's

01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:59,700
the end result

01:16:56,610 --> 01:17:01,200
so starting winds are gonna think so I

01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:08,400
think if you look at your starts water

01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:11,600
is perfectly empty yay I know the front

01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,600
part is just resets

01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:19,600
and some colors so the classes set for

01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:24,770
you ready so how do we turn it from

01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:27,440
nothing to that so the mock-up is pretty

01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:32,989
simple just stack stack stack stack

01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:36,650
stack oh we want to define the green

01:17:32,989 --> 01:17:39,080
first so that's actually that's why I

01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:41,980
got pens I'm paper let's just look at

01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,980
the end result

01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:55,630
so on a latch on a large screen right

01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:59,960
how would you can you draw this on paper

01:17:55,630 --> 01:18:02,119
so how many columns will you use how

01:17:59,960 --> 01:18:07,880
many columns we use for you to write

01:18:02,119 --> 01:18:10,610
rosy 3 right so it's actually very

01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:14,539
straightforward cut you you you draw so

01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:16,699
this actually spends 2 2 rows which is

01:18:14,539 --> 01:18:19,190
perfectly acceptable so you it's not

01:18:16,699 --> 01:18:21,800
it's not for 4 is actually for every

01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:23,389
addition you attack them depending on

01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:26,809
your design right you have to count the

01:18:23,389 --> 01:18:32,750
most number of rows and use them so for

01:18:26,809 --> 01:18:37,280
this is actually a 2 by 3 2 by 3 2 by 3

01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:40,909
but then when it's less than when it's

01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:43,730
like after your smaller nail square so

01:18:40,909 --> 01:18:44,420
it's kind of say my portrait ish you

01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:47,239
become like this

01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:49,880
so like these are columns is straight

01:18:47,239 --> 01:18:56,630
for where are you two columns but rows

01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:58,400
becomes 4 so that's the difference and I

01:18:56,630 --> 01:19:03,639
did it when you draw it out they makes

01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:03,639
it easier to planner so what we do is

01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:08,920
that's why there's a media query written

01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:08,920
already

01:19:09,599 --> 01:19:16,349
I want to introduce one but because most

01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:18,599
most people for media queries you would

01:19:16,349 --> 01:19:20,849
use the with one the with Parrish I mean

01:19:18,599 --> 01:19:21,659
with max with that's everybody has soft

01:19:20,849 --> 01:19:24,239
seen before

01:19:21,659 --> 01:19:27,360
has anybody heard of this particular

01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:29,449
media query called min aspect ratio we

01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,449
are

01:19:35,090 --> 01:19:42,060
yeah so this media query I find it quite

01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:47,010
useful as well because how your

01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:49,620
dependent is is a ratio and the syntax

01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:51,690
is it has to be two numbers you cannot

01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:57,840
just reassure one there's a syntax thing

01:19:51,690 --> 01:20:02,130
but you so you you can the ratio is with

01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:03,810
high so let's say landscape would be

01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:05,820
something like oh eight five

01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:08,250
that's a landscape view and then like

01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:10,980
one two so you'll be like one is to two

01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:14,520
so this is the aspect ratio media query

01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:18,020
so for this particular design right the

01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:20,610
moment that it's less than it becomes

01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:23,480
portrait more or less a portrayal I

01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:28,170
wanted to switch and let's get more I

01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:32,719
wanted to be the white one so rather

01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:35,100
than actually defining defining a whiff

01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:39,239
because I'm not sure what's the height

01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:46,490
of my users viewport because sometimes

01:20:39,239 --> 01:20:49,130
it could be that is is really short but

01:20:46,490 --> 01:20:51,200
we've query we don't know the height I

01:20:49,130 --> 01:20:53,150
think this is more useful because for

01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:55,370
something like - but it could be really

01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:57,350
small but as long as this rectangular it

01:20:55,370 --> 01:20:59,090
might still work there something so for

01:20:57,350 --> 01:21:02,240
this particular use case maybe we can

01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:04,400
use mean especially if you can also free

01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:06,830
to use with this is not you know the

01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:08,840
paper shape you can do everyone but for

01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:13,400
this example I choose to use the mean

01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:16,700
aspect ratio media query so that the

01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:20,780
let's get in the portrait a layer is

01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:24,770
different so for this one because it's a

01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:26,330
mean aspect ratio so this can't go the

01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:28,880
cover this works for landscape mode and

01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:32,240
then the code the default code can be

01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:35,510
portrait mode so I cannot remember my

01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:40,240
marker hold on okay so we can just

01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:42,620
define display grid on the body face

01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:46,970
then we just now we already mentioned

01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:49,900
that we wanted it to be two columns and

01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:49,900
two rows

01:21:55,530 --> 01:22:02,590
okay so depending on you

01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:06,550
so then I'm not gonna leave me how you

01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:11,920
want to size your column me being lazy I

01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:17,640
just make it equal with as four rows

01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:24,430
right I'm going to introduce a new value

01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:27,420
called mean content I will explain mean

01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:27,420
condemn very soon

01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:39,330
wait let me switch back

01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:49,530
okay okay

01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,530
before after

01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:11,910
so another keyword value there green

01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:16,440
that green introduce us is mean content

01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:18,690
and max content so it just means the

01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:22,230
minimum content width and the maximum

01:23:18,690 --> 01:23:25,490
content with let me mess around and see

01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:25,490
you I can get a good example

01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:36,830
main contenders means

01:23:43,829 --> 01:23:54,280
so for inline animals right so a line of

01:23:51,789 --> 01:23:56,710
text is an inline element the mean

01:23:54,280 --> 01:24:01,329
content is actually the length of the

01:23:56,710 --> 01:24:05,320
longest word so for my first column and

01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:09,280
the longest word is dashboard so you

01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:15,909
will shrink to fit until dashboard if I

01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:18,940
do next container this line is the

01:24:15,909 --> 01:24:20,889
longest miss Donna left left right BA

01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:23,500
because I obviously am NOT very creative

01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:28,320
you will you will take the maximum

01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:28,320
content to size the column

01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:37,870
so you want anything know what's

01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:41,920
happening okay yeah so these values are

01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:44,980
useful when you are dealing with text

01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:46,630
content I feel you can think about let's

01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:48,460
say there's a particular line that you

01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:51,100
just don't you one you don't want it to

01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:54,520
wrap but you want that column to always

01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:58,690
be able to contain that line you can use

01:24:54,520 --> 01:25:01,390
content so for example I want up down

01:24:58,690 --> 01:25:04,240
down left right left right BA to just be

01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:06,940
a single line if a prime is content you

01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:08,590
are the entire that would be the biggest

01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:10,900
so you would think that you're taking

01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:13,300
that length if everybody else is okay

01:25:10,900 --> 01:25:15,940
I'll go extra space but I always fit

01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:17,680
this just nicely so conversely for me in

01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:20,170
content you go for the smaller the

01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:22,420
longest would so everybody else just

01:25:20,170 --> 01:25:24,430
read and follow so - but because I

01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:29,710
cannot break the one dashboard so what

01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:31,930
right I can do what I can I can break it

01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:34,900
I cannot break the word itself I cannot

01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:37,180
make it like - Bob Ireland de Brignac

01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:39,070
cannot the browser will don't do that so

01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:40,480
your take the longest would so that's

01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:43,390
the difference between me in content and

01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:47,820
next content so if you think about it

01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:50,820
from a high perspective it also works

01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:50,820
hazzah

01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:55,810
okay everybody go drink tea Carmelita

01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:20,090
the twenty minutes can be an easy 20

01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:28,430
minutes I can cover a bud see on the

01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:33,980
floor trying to put me on the rostrum

01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:38,810
guys okay hi everybody I bet right so

01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:42,890
when we left off when we when we left

01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:44,690
off we just started finding the grid so

01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:47,270
I did he write most of the time when I'm

01:26:44,690 --> 01:26:51,100
doing great I will almost always have it

01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:51,100
on have this on because

01:27:22,250 --> 01:27:28,860
so when we just define the grid right

01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:32,849
now it's very basic it's just a grid

01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:34,739
I have two columns that are both 1fr

01:27:32,849 --> 01:27:39,389
each so what this means is that it will

01:27:34,739 --> 01:27:42,690
always be half half of whatever right

01:27:39,389 --> 01:27:45,809
and so the dimension the mean content

01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:50,579
next content property so it always it

01:27:45,809 --> 01:27:58,110
also works for rows so if you if you if

01:27:50,579 --> 01:28:06,349
you notice the this is a H h1 I think I

01:27:58,110 --> 01:28:06,349
put it as h1 remember can tell can tell

01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:12,960
okay it's an h1 so by default the

01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:17,010
browser Pro makes it to M the one the

01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:20,280
bottom is just a normal browser default

01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:23,849
so when I put mean content you wash ring

01:28:20,280 --> 01:28:26,820
to fit so I don't have to really think

01:28:23,849 --> 01:28:31,320
about how to size the higher my columns

01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:33,960
I chose to just you know browser you

01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:36,420
just go and fit the minimum height of my

01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:43,500
text and and leave it so that's why I

01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:46,340
chose to go with mean content and mean

01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:51,090
content for the the bottom column as OCC

01:28:46,340 --> 01:28:53,400
it would take the biggest one and each

01:28:51,090 --> 01:28:56,610
one is being obviously bigger than a P

01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:58,110
so you will have to follow that right so

01:28:56,610 --> 01:29:00,119
you always fit so you won't get things

01:28:58,110 --> 01:29:03,690
overflowing so that's the reason why I

01:29:00,119 --> 01:29:05,429
put put these values but then as you

01:29:03,690 --> 01:29:08,309
resize this right and cuz this is a

01:29:05,429 --> 01:29:12,570
wonderfully white beautiful TV which I

01:29:08,309 --> 01:29:14,579
want to steal home this doesn't this is

01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:17,369
going a bit too much great a bit too

01:29:14,579 --> 01:29:19,829
much for my liking so what can we do for

01:29:17,369 --> 01:29:23,340
this I'm thinking like not about my mind

01:29:19,829 --> 01:29:29,010
thinking maybe we should cap to kept the

01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:30,929
the growth so we can make use of the why

01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:32,540
don't we just make use of the min min

01:29:30,929 --> 01:29:38,740
max

01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:41,540
function and I give it a minimum and

01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:44,150
maximum because you don't necessarily

01:29:41,540 --> 01:29:47,600
have to use one FRS the maximum if you

01:29:44,150 --> 01:29:50,180
don't want to so I just want to give it

01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:52,820
a range of growing and shrinking so I

01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:55,130
chose these arbitrary values and you can

01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:59,080
choose your own arbitrary values if you

01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:59,080
want to but the point here is that you

01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:10,610
were just growing shrink is everybody

01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:13,910
familiar with viewport units like do all

01:30:10,610 --> 01:30:16,310
you know a VW is everybody knows right

01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:19,750
so again I chose this arbitrarily

01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:23,480
because I like 45 viewport units

01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:25,220
probably ok as it grows cuz I don't need

01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:28,340
to be fixed I want it to be kind of

01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:30,320
flexible but not too flexible so ok

01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:34,640
everything is a bit too much right let's

01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:37,940
go with quite the tee and see how it

01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:39,740
looks this is a big reason why I don't

01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:41,150
do things like coiner because I like to

01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:46,820
call in a like and I can see my

01:30:41,150 --> 01:30:51,130
differences okay so puppy iron every

01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:55,730
fresh 13 oxen better actually

01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:57,110
okay let's go ahead okay but like 20

01:30:55,730 --> 01:31:01,610
doesn't know right now it's cause my egg

01:30:57,110 --> 01:31:02,630
got cut through the bottom actually I

01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:05,650
can also mean container

01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:05,650
let's try mean condon

01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:15,980
oh no no no no wrong wrong value max

01:31:10,520 --> 01:31:18,020
content and refresh hey okay these don't

01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:20,530
let you know it I can leave you this I

01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:20,530
can leave me this

01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:29,330
okay let's try Mexican Bella welcome to

01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:31,780
the most anyhow new work show you'll

01:31:29,330 --> 01:31:31,780
ever be

01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:40,820
so one thing you will realize is that

01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:43,160
this one Fri is a lot of free space why

01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:45,050
is it not taking up the full length so

01:31:43,160 --> 01:31:49,310
an atom like Lester inspecting this

01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:52,190
problem this problem irrational like I

01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:53,990
said right doing height do it percentage

01:31:52,190 --> 01:31:57,320
a song so it's not not a fun one because

01:31:53,990 --> 01:32:00,380
if you know t-shirt it is taking all of

01:31:57,320 --> 01:32:05,900
his peers but my element only only with

01:32:00,380 --> 01:32:08,860
just three hundred so we should at this

01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:08,860
here

01:32:13,789 --> 01:32:20,369
and height 100% bought the only works

01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:22,889
because I already added it into HTML if

01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:26,099
you I think if you'd be done I'm not

01:32:22,889 --> 01:32:27,989
sure I know I try again yeah if you

01:32:26,099 --> 01:32:35,119
didn't edit OHP alright

01:32:27,989 --> 01:32:38,729
hi $100 1 so then that's the quote of

01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:42,200
using percentages so let's say if we

01:32:38,729 --> 01:32:46,190
really don't want to do this right

01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:50,930
I can use instead of percentages you

01:32:46,190 --> 01:32:53,470
just use viewport units so you will just

01:32:50,930 --> 01:32:56,330
take up the higher the viewport

01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:58,800
the thing about viewport units is a bit

01:32:56,330 --> 01:33:01,960
tricky to man

01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:04,739
hi always so it's not relative to a

01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:07,630
container it's always relative to the

01:33:04,739 --> 01:33:09,550
the the the height and width of your

01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:11,830
window so it might be a bit trickier to

01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:14,470
manage if it's nested within many

01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:16,810
components you might end up the the

01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:18,970
sizing might be a bit odd so they still

01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:22,660
use cases for percentages and they still

01:33:18,970 --> 01:33:25,690
use cases for viewports so I have done

01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:27,940
design ways of viewport based but I had

01:33:25,690 --> 01:33:32,260
to do the calculations outside by hand

01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:36,160
meaning okay this is 50 my container is

01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:37,900
50 VW and I want it to be like 20% then

01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:40,120
I had the calculations I'll do the next

01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:42,130
by hand outside you can do that if you

01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:44,230
want to fully viewport you needed I'll

01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:47,350
show you a demo of a completely viewport

01:33:44,230 --> 01:33:49,270
you need a deal or nets outside but for

01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:54,310
now that later for now so we have this

01:33:49,270 --> 01:33:57,220
we set up on you max content so the the

01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:59,050
layer the grid is okay ready so now we

01:33:57,220 --> 01:34:02,410
just need to place the items correctly

01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:06,030
what was my end result you know I have a

01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:06,030
slide for this come on

01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:12,210
okay

01:34:13,630 --> 01:34:29,360
we boss - poor statistics we statistics

01:34:23,690 --> 01:34:32,420
on the top score and the bottom okay so

01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:35,719
for this particular use case right this

01:34:32,420 --> 01:34:45,889
is the one where I won't use green

01:34:35,719 --> 01:34:56,300
template areas so what we can do is the

01:34:45,889 --> 01:35:01,840
reference so the title right on top the

01:34:56,300 --> 01:35:01,840
second column we have step 3

01:35:02,559 --> 01:35:19,099
let's call it stats aha cause I lazy the

01:35:10,219 --> 01:35:25,849
syntax is us each each row is coated the

01:35:19,099 --> 01:35:28,750
next one is score then steps again and

01:35:25,849 --> 01:35:28,750
then

01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:35,520
was these car my god a coin and you

01:35:34,890 --> 01:35:41,130
caught anything

01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:46,680
that's funny bought and then we can call

01:35:41,130 --> 01:35:48,150
this don't know I quite controls but and

01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:50,010
again you can name it anything you want

01:35:48,150 --> 01:35:54,210
okay go ahead and use like cucumber

01:35:50,010 --> 01:35:55,470
however so if you came even though I

01:35:54,210 --> 01:35:58,200
mentioned on your right knees

01:35:55,470 --> 01:36:01,140
corresponds to this will correspond oh

01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:04,310
hi looks literally so in a second right

01:36:01,140 --> 01:36:08,310
my steps what they cut the I have four

01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:15,290
we are one - Oh something wrong with I'm

01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:15,290
missing one row I mean one more one more

01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:24,090
ok it one more row because I want the

01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:26,700
score to be to be the finger scores well

01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:29,400
so actually it's four four rows for us

01:36:26,700 --> 01:36:31,890
so because it's four also title for sure

01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:34,380
score second row steps we'll spend both

01:36:31,890 --> 01:36:36,120
rows but excited own space on the third

01:36:34,380 --> 01:36:38,850
roll controls the guy own space on the

01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:41,550
fourth row and both Bowen control was

01:36:38,850 --> 01:36:45,210
spend two columns so the high looks it

01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:46,830
corresponds to this so happy this so

01:36:45,210 --> 01:36:50,580
after we've assigned a good template

01:36:46,830 --> 01:36:55,530
area right we assign each any month you

01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:58,350
put it into its own area using good area

01:36:55,530 --> 01:37:01,590
so good area singular not plural no s

01:36:58,350 --> 01:37:03,810
great template areas yes Brewer got s so

01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:05,540
you have to solve like take note of this

01:37:03,810 --> 01:37:08,670
impacts and if it doesn't work right

01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:12,690
maybe is a spelling problem for great

01:37:08,670 --> 01:37:15,720
area right no cuts just the raw whatever

01:37:12,690 --> 01:37:19,750
string input here you can try we quotes

01:37:15,720 --> 01:37:28,000
Kosovo so

01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:31,420
type type and so I think ideally right

01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,170
you would like to put your your your

01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:34,900
reattempt

01:37:32,170 --> 01:37:36,370
areas right um don't make the spelling

01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:37,960
don't complicate that cause odds are you

01:37:36,370 --> 01:37:40,450
might miss type something and then

01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:42,550
you'll be very confused why the job so

01:37:40,450 --> 01:37:44,500
don't don't spell things like necessary

01:37:42,550 --> 01:37:46,480
or you know what a funny was that

01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:48,870
everybody gets wrong right just a

01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,870
protein

01:38:01,699 --> 01:38:09,949
okay how he works so she wrote you fun

01:38:05,540 --> 01:38:17,090
from just now refresh whoo yay

01:38:09,949 --> 01:38:21,670
y'all get this okay turn around get you

01:38:17,090 --> 01:38:21,670
it is anybody didn't get this

01:38:25,179 --> 01:38:30,860
no response yes any problem no problem

01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:34,969
no problem

01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:36,679
great so the nice part about the dev

01:38:34,969 --> 01:38:39,110
tools is that you can actually see your

01:38:36,679 --> 01:38:40,760
names you can toggle it on and off that

01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:43,160
is very immediate it's blocking your

01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:44,900
watch I can turn it off but I think very

01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:46,790
helpful to have it so you can know if

01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:48,290
you assign your area to the correct

01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:51,320
place or not and you can also see if

01:38:48,290 --> 01:38:53,540
like let's say for example right eye

01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:55,429
let's go back to my origin no mistake

01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:56,890
right yeah I take away one this I

01:38:55,429 --> 01:39:03,920
actually not sure happen

01:38:56,890 --> 01:39:06,320
so lets you happen and then you can see

01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:11,210
something wrong ready because it looks

01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:13,390
really weird one thing that I didn't

01:39:11,210 --> 01:39:13,390
mention

01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:20,940
just realize it instead of the does

01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:23,610
button being instead of bot being being

01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:25,380
of the larger area it became the stats

01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:29,370
so you realize that it doesn't

01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:32,130
correspond to 1 to 2 to y allocated the

01:39:29,370 --> 01:39:36,570
thing is the browser is smart enough to

01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:38,640
know that if I actually define four rows

01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:42,480
right you were implicitly generate one

01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:47,100
more row it's just that because I didn't

01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:50,220
I didn't define the size of the row

01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:51,240
correctly the browser just automatically

01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:54,090
define it for me

01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:58,280
but it will not break your layout

01:39:54,090 --> 01:39:58,280
completely you just make it look weird

01:39:58,790 --> 01:40:05,700
anyway let's just make it normal

01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:09,540
so this path is set already so what we

01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:12,600
want to do next is the one it's layout

01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:14,310
that when it's the white layer so let's

01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:19,790
look at how the white layer is supposed

01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:19,790
to write okay there's an email play

01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:27,900
okay nobody's so the layers can change a

01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:31,800
little bit this is the one with the

01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:36,770
three rows and two columns instead so

01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:39,989
what we'll do is we will adjust this to

01:40:36,770 --> 01:40:43,170
remains the same so let's find ownio

01:40:39,989 --> 01:40:50,219
copy over just copy this over inside

01:40:43,170 --> 01:40:56,040
here into your media query okay then we

01:40:50,219 --> 01:41:12,090
can start modifying things so it looks

01:40:56,040 --> 01:41:15,179
like this so I think we can keep the

01:41:12,090 --> 01:41:21,469
columns we just need to change the rules

01:41:15,179 --> 01:41:21,469
so let's take out one row

01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:30,080
so this works but we were VG will

01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:32,540
regional positioning of we're gonna

01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:37,670
place each item change the template

01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:39,980
areas so now we only have three rows so

01:41:37,670 --> 01:41:45,320
now we want tighter up top steps has

01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:48,560
moved steps move to this place the

01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:56,020
bottom one is score now the bot takes up

01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:56,020
two cells here controls maintain safe

01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:14,750
everybody can get nice right can or not

01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:20,250
no problem ah okay okay so the layout

01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:21,630
set so now the issue is alignment so

01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:24,170
we're gonna run through how to align

01:42:21,630 --> 01:42:24,170
things properly

01:42:25,850 --> 01:42:31,139
father we can predict Euler stacks we

01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:34,949
are my word this is supposed to be a

01:42:31,139 --> 01:42:39,480
game okay okay we wanna send bodies we

01:42:34,949 --> 01:42:41,880
understand daddy's tags so of the toy

01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:44,489
hey how you Center this in the center

01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:48,230
we're getting a look at we do a mock at

01:42:44,489 --> 01:42:48,230
home but

01:42:50,620 --> 01:42:55,270
okay so based on the alignment

01:42:52,880 --> 01:43:00,580
properties that we talked about earlier

01:42:55,270 --> 01:43:03,170
how would you Center the house and other

01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:07,810
rubbish text I wrote Dana sent out about

01:43:03,170 --> 01:43:07,810
anybody like what properties who you use

01:43:10,210 --> 01:43:17,180
something or I and I what because they

01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:24,020
are three this there's the turn of the

01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:25,730
icon okay so we had justify content we

01:43:24,020 --> 01:43:29,330
are justify content we have we have

01:43:25,730 --> 01:43:31,239
justify self justified ups so which one

01:43:29,330 --> 01:43:35,570
will we use

01:43:31,239 --> 01:43:37,520
okay so once a content source itself so

01:43:35,570 --> 01:43:41,930
what if you don't know right

01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:46,460
just try and refresh this is how wet

01:43:41,930 --> 01:43:52,420
developers what folks so me will go to

01:43:46,460 --> 01:43:52,420
the bot

01:43:54,899 --> 01:43:59,639
we try we try the vertical and vertical

01:43:58,349 --> 01:44:05,699
axis but aha

01:43:59,639 --> 01:44:08,610
a lie content spoiler this is not even

01:44:05,699 --> 01:44:10,619
but let's just try it anyway nothing

01:44:08,610 --> 01:44:13,079
happens because it's not obviously not

01:44:10,619 --> 01:44:19,619
the correct one so we'll do something

01:44:13,079 --> 01:44:22,289
but not what we want it to yeah so so

01:44:19,619 --> 01:44:24,510
this is the if you if you remember when

01:44:22,289 --> 01:44:28,530
I when I shot I kept saying that once

01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:33,059
you apply a value to the a line sell

01:44:28,530 --> 01:44:36,419
property shrink to fit so in a sense it

01:44:33,059 --> 01:44:39,360
is correct it aligns it to the center

01:44:36,419 --> 01:44:41,909
but that's not necessarily what we want

01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:45,300
because we still won the game bought to

01:44:41,909 --> 01:44:51,749
pick up the entire space right so this

01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:53,639
is this is why text box and grid I meant

01:44:51,749 --> 01:44:56,430
to be used together

01:44:53,639 --> 01:44:58,840
so what week

01:44:56,430 --> 01:45:01,870
we will still want to use the online

01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:04,000
self property just not on its own what

01:45:01,870 --> 01:45:09,190
we want to do is we will make the bot

01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:20,800
green item itself a flex parent so once

01:45:09,190 --> 01:45:23,440
we do this right we can get we can get

01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:24,220
this whilst maintaining the size of the

01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,380
grid item

01:45:24,220 --> 01:45:28,570
so the great item is the agree item

01:45:26,380 --> 01:45:32,530
still users is default value of

01:45:28,570 --> 01:45:34,960
stretching the entire area of the cell

01:45:32,530 --> 01:45:39,340
but then we can align items within it

01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:41,020
when it itself is a flex parent so oh

01:45:39,340 --> 01:45:50,970
you know we just do the standard flex

01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:50,970
things that's rare then we want to chain

01:45:51,210 --> 01:46:03,660
this so we don't use a line items you

01:45:55,150 --> 01:46:03,660
use a line content and then we do

01:46:04,020 --> 01:46:07,020
text-align:center

01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:27,540
then content so then Center okay let's

01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:30,600
talk about this situation when you use

01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:34,080
flex I know this is not powerful critter

01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:38,010
but xbox relevant the alignment

01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:41,910
properties on flex box a little bit

01:46:38,010 --> 01:46:46,020
different from great very similar they

01:46:41,910 --> 01:46:50,699
said in button the behavior different

01:46:46,020 --> 01:46:52,590
because both properties are for

01:46:50,699 --> 01:46:55,140
different things so I in a very

01:46:52,590 --> 01:46:57,929
beginning I mentioned that flex is

01:46:55,140 --> 01:46:59,880
single dimension so in for this

01:46:57,929 --> 01:47:03,110
particular case right

01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:08,880
when I say flex rep you are ready round

01:47:03,110 --> 01:47:14,070
so what a line what a line content does

01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:20,940
is that it will align the lines as a

01:47:14,070 --> 01:47:25,080
unit if I use a line items it's actually

01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:28,110
aligning each sock image unite the Flex

01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:29,790
time because I put weave of these 200

01:47:28,110 --> 01:47:33,870
right so the next one has to wrap down

01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:38,719
so you imagine this a flex line so it

01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:38,719
can looks like I have a slide for this

01:47:40,440 --> 01:47:56,410
good you got a birthday yeah if you

01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:58,750
don't say yeah so how it works is that

01:47:56,410 --> 01:48:01,950
when it wraps down right these purple

01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:04,900
lines are called flex lines

01:48:01,950 --> 01:48:09,550
right-aligned items aligns it along the

01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:12,130
line instead of the whole thing a line

01:48:09,550 --> 01:48:14,380
content will align the whole thing but a

01:48:12,130 --> 01:48:16,720
line items actually aligns along the

01:48:14,380 --> 01:48:19,000
line so if it flex when it flexes you

01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:20,980
take up the entire height so it becomes

01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:23,170
like that this one is very spaced out

01:48:20,980 --> 01:48:25,060
when you use a line items it's actually

01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:30,510
centering or soba is centering along a

01:48:25,060 --> 01:48:30,510
flex line so that's the difference

01:48:34,260 --> 01:48:38,580
so that's very useful for this

01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:40,710
particular case we use content because I

01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:44,370
want the content to be treated as a

01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:47,670
whole and center in a center so that's

01:48:44,370 --> 01:48:54,000
why you use online content so justify

01:48:47,670 --> 01:48:57,510
contentious you're changing stuff

01:48:54,000 --> 01:49:02,640
you will be at the left simply because

01:48:57,510 --> 01:49:04,950
right this text is smaller than the

01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:08,130
width of my entire cell so your shift as

01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:09,690
a whole if I did not put

01:49:08,130 --> 01:49:13,680
text-align:center you would just be a

01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:15,360
left aligned to the left so in this case

01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:17,130
the common center everything right I'm

01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:20,250
just doing when it's centered you just

01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:21,960
move to the center so the

01:49:20,250 --> 01:49:24,989
text-align:center is to allow everything

01:49:21,960 --> 01:49:27,960
to the center because this is correct is

01:49:24,989 --> 01:49:32,900
just that fix at 100% so it doesn't

01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:36,300
shift when I use justify justify content

01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:38,520
so I'm so to Center everything centrally

01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:41,970
right here to send the readings for this

01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:43,650
particular item so that's why it's a

01:49:41,970 --> 01:49:47,700
trick question and that you had to

01:49:43,650 --> 01:49:52,980
actually make this bot green item itself

01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:55,680
a flex parent are you're confused no

01:49:52,980 --> 01:50:00,960
he's right quickly right great thanks

01:49:55,680 --> 01:50:07,340
love you all so for controls how should

01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:07,340
we Center the controls text anybody

01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:15,290
well you're like they're actually son

01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:23,270
not convict it they all just X and I

01:50:15,290 --> 01:50:26,349
sent okay now yeah so so that's that's

01:50:23,270 --> 01:50:26,349
it yes Nestor

01:50:26,739 --> 01:50:34,210
that's how you get the end result so

01:50:30,610 --> 01:50:34,210
alignment is settled

01:50:37,789 --> 01:50:47,960
it sure what properly my phone is broken

01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:51,400
so I'm gonna do this yeah

01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:54,099
so I'm assuming we can get this effect

01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:57,019
not all caught everything aligned nicely

01:50:54,099 --> 01:51:09,320
it's responsive there's the first

01:50:57,019 --> 01:51:11,150
example the next example is this I was

01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:14,360
informed that this was a very

01:51:11,150 --> 01:51:19,010
complicated so we have I don't know one

01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:23,019
hour Reseda ha we see how ok so this

01:51:19,010 --> 01:51:23,019
particular design cars on their knees

01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:41,980
be honest

01:51:32,370 --> 01:51:49,930
let's try to build this k2 so the code

01:51:41,980 --> 01:51:51,790
is in here and the mockery is no markup

01:51:49,930 --> 01:51:54,070
apparently the mark-up fonts and images

01:51:51,790 --> 01:52:05,790
preparing these so if you load it you

01:51:54,070 --> 01:52:05,790
turn your honor hey why do you

01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,790
okay nearly how it looks like without

01:52:15,190 --> 01:52:17,790
any styling

01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:36,490
so

01:52:38,869 --> 01:52:45,800
okay this is the most basic of basic

01:52:41,659 --> 01:52:50,960
nurse so without any styling it looks

01:52:45,800 --> 01:52:53,690
like this so the other day I don't the

01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:55,250
mark-up is the mock-up structure is

01:52:53,690 --> 01:52:57,409
actually important because if you all

01:52:55,250 --> 01:52:59,150
around for the for the accessibility

01:52:57,409 --> 01:53:01,119
tour you'll understand the screen

01:52:59,150 --> 01:53:04,580
readers actually follow the market order

01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:06,889
so you'll want to setup the mock-up in a

01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:09,230
in a in a semantic way in a sense that

01:53:06,889 --> 01:53:13,099
okay my my h1 my title comes first

01:53:09,230 --> 01:53:15,199
and and and I think a good way to check

01:53:13,099 --> 01:53:17,119
how cementing your maka is not have any

01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:20,530
styles to begin with you just write on

01:53:17,119 --> 01:53:20,530
my capsule and you see how it looks like

01:53:21,159 --> 01:53:29,929
so this is quite reasonable I feel from

01:53:24,889 --> 01:53:36,010
a semantic perspective so first things

01:53:29,929 --> 01:53:36,010
first is to get this

01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:44,460
how how you break this down into agree

01:53:40,710 --> 01:53:47,400
how you divide up everything so that's

01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:49,970
what the pen and paper is for with my

01:53:47,400 --> 01:53:49,970
fam paper

01:53:55,980 --> 01:54:04,780
so let's let us try in Britney's now my

01:54:01,380 --> 01:54:07,390
from the results of my planning one two

01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:14,290
three four five six iron out with six

01:54:07,390 --> 01:54:18,460
columns because let me explain this is

01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:21,540
one column this is another column this

01:54:18,460 --> 01:54:28,060
probably needs to be another column and

01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:34,060
then this artist spotlight will be in

01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:38,920
its own column and then this veto is one

01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:44,710
more column so one two three four five

01:54:38,920 --> 01:54:47,530
six these items right can cause we can

01:54:44,710 --> 01:54:49,870
spend multiple columns our item can

01:54:47,530 --> 01:54:52,870
spend multiple columns we want to reduce

01:54:49,870 --> 01:54:54,670
to the smallest how I planned the

01:54:52,870 --> 01:54:55,870
columns and maybe you might you might

01:54:54,670 --> 01:54:58,120
think of it differently I'm just gonna

01:54:55,870 --> 01:55:00,370
share how I plan the columns right in my

01:54:58,120 --> 01:55:03,400
mind is like the smallest component each

01:55:00,370 --> 01:55:05,830
having its own column so when I saw when

01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:07,450
I see this design this is the end design

01:55:05,830 --> 01:55:09,370
that I copied from somebody's driver

01:55:07,450 --> 01:55:12,790
short right when I start to plan the

01:55:09,370 --> 01:55:15,550
columns I would think that go for the

01:55:12,790 --> 01:55:19,210
smallest component so ideally you could

01:55:15,550 --> 01:55:21,430
have this as one column but then is very

01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:22,720
hard it's gonna be hard to align this so

01:55:21,430 --> 01:55:25,030
I would rather have this in its own

01:55:22,720 --> 01:55:27,390
column and this full text can take up

01:55:25,030 --> 01:55:32,200
two Kotkin can can consume two columns

01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:34,420
because this this and this I would like

01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:36,280
them to maintain they are they are with

01:55:34,420 --> 01:55:38,530
I wouldn't want it to break

01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:40,360
I just want it to behave like just I

01:55:38,530 --> 01:55:42,910
give it its own n okay its own space but

01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:46,120
this this is a length of text that I

01:55:42,910 --> 01:55:52,020
feel can grow and shrink so I give this

01:55:46,120 --> 01:55:52,020
one its own column and the meeting

01:55:54,470 --> 01:56:03,080
for this space actually I check if the

01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:03,080
space is on column as well because

01:56:08,579 --> 01:56:14,769
eventually you wonder you don't want

01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:16,690
this you want it to grow but you don't

01:56:14,769 --> 01:56:19,449
know too much you want to maintain a

01:56:16,690 --> 01:56:21,429
space at the wider slang so actually you

01:56:19,449 --> 01:56:23,500
can choose not to give it so this

01:56:21,429 --> 01:56:24,909
pattern this pie is actually optional it

01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:26,949
depends on how you want to call out the

01:56:24,909 --> 01:56:29,440
design because our original design is

01:56:26,949 --> 01:56:31,420
this is full-length they had this very

01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:33,190
nice white space but when you think

01:56:31,420 --> 01:56:35,199
about it when you compress what's the

01:56:33,190 --> 01:56:37,030
first thing that you can compress from a

01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:38,530
design perspective in my mind the first

01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:40,840
thing that should can be compressed is

01:56:38,530 --> 01:56:44,019
this white space because when I don't

01:56:40,840 --> 01:56:46,900
have that much space to work with

01:56:44,019 --> 01:56:49,389
I wouldn't want to immediately string my

01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:50,559
text I want to keep this this length

01:56:49,389 --> 01:56:53,349
because it's quite a nice comfortable

01:56:50,559 --> 01:56:54,730
like as much as possible so what I chose

01:56:53,349 --> 01:56:57,369
to do is I introduced an additional

01:56:54,730 --> 01:56:59,230
column technically not necessary but

01:56:57,369 --> 01:57:02,260
from a design perspective right I give

01:56:59,230 --> 01:57:05,019
it I allow this to be a collapsible

01:57:02,260 --> 01:57:08,199
space so that's why that and I end up

01:57:05,019 --> 01:57:11,289
with six columns so these are enemies

01:57:08,199 --> 01:57:15,369
out I know you can see but it's six

01:57:11,289 --> 01:57:19,989
columns one two three free space

01:57:15,369 --> 01:57:22,900
one two three four five six I was wrong

01:57:19,989 --> 01:57:25,389
bit more actually pop him so five five

01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:27,159
is four text you can see because this

01:57:25,389 --> 01:57:31,449
line is actually in the fifth column so

01:57:27,159 --> 01:57:34,739
this edge e1 is together and this one is

01:57:31,449 --> 01:57:39,130
together so a piece policies on column

01:57:34,739 --> 01:57:41,409
so six columns then four rows right roll

01:57:39,130 --> 01:57:48,900
is a bit more straightforward just four

01:57:41,409 --> 01:57:48,900
so one two three four

01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:53,940
yeah well I did thank you

01:57:55,020 --> 01:58:03,699
so one one for the title two for here

01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:08,520
this one tree is on four so it's six

01:58:03,699 --> 01:58:11,469
columns for us so this is a bit more of

01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:14,170
this this is why you need the pencil in

01:58:11,469 --> 01:58:17,110
paper because if you did if you looked

01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:17,920
at this of the actually the first part I

01:58:17,110 --> 01:58:20,170
didn't come out this

01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:22,989
I took me multiple passes so the first

01:58:20,170 --> 01:58:25,300
part I she only had four I had I had one

01:58:22,989 --> 01:58:28,060
two three four

01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:30,520
I didn't come for this part yet but

01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:32,770
after I thought about here I'm like okay

01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:35,140
the the extra column came in from here

01:58:32,770 --> 01:58:38,260
and then for this one right I realized

01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:39,969
that I would rather give that order is

01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:41,590
on column but if you don't want to give

01:58:39,969 --> 01:58:43,840
to a deck on column you can also do that

01:58:41,590 --> 01:58:46,239
because by writing this column it can

01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:49,750
become one column also depends on how

01:58:46,239 --> 01:58:52,660
you want to shrink things so to me when

01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:55,300
you do when I started designing radios

01:58:52,660 --> 01:58:58,510
or a pen some paper so you can draw and

01:58:55,300 --> 01:59:01,120
redraw so like mention in a very

01:58:58,510 --> 01:59:03,100
beginning designing layers you CSS grid

01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:04,600
you have to have and you have to have

01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:06,730
the big picture view you have to know

01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:10,150
what you want to achieve at the end of

01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:12,179
the design plus up front so it's okay to

01:59:10,150 --> 01:59:14,860
plan on paper first

01:59:12,179 --> 01:59:16,449
once you plan on paper everything else

01:59:14,860 --> 01:59:18,670
becomes much easier because once you

01:59:16,449 --> 01:59:20,800
have this one you have got this this

01:59:18,670 --> 01:59:24,820
final layout down the rest of it is

01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:26,469
actually just tweaking the the the the

01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:30,719
sizes like I did that like we did just

01:59:26,469 --> 01:59:33,850
now so that's how I got my six for

01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:36,880
alignment so let's let's go if the these

01:59:33,850 --> 01:59:38,469
six for thing I don't know if I should

01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:41,860
just pass this around and you can take a

01:59:38,469 --> 01:59:44,590
look I don't know sure any honey if you

01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:50,160
want so that's the that's this that's

01:59:44,590 --> 01:59:50,160
the six voting so let's start doing it

01:59:57,500 --> 02:00:01,520
don't and turn turn turn

02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:09,690
okay uh if you are lazy right the spouse

02:00:07,410 --> 02:00:11,160
like the actual colors and stuff yeah

02:00:09,690 --> 02:00:12,180
you know just go through the finite then

02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:14,310
you just copy and paste

02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:19,770
I about I forgot but you're why I'm

02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:23,630
sorry so just just copy the color since

02:00:19,770 --> 02:00:23,630
that was my bed

02:00:29,260 --> 02:00:33,550
I mean it's not not greedy not as

02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:35,790
non-group unit that I just just got be

02:00:33,550 --> 02:00:35,790
over

02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:56,420
okay everybody okay so this Widow

02:00:52,700 --> 02:01:02,180
Aramark up first so mean is the whole

02:00:56,420 --> 02:01:06,380
thing the base styles I got off with is

02:01:02,180 --> 02:01:10,090
for browsers that don't support grid so

02:01:06,380 --> 02:01:13,940
we we want to solve take care of the

02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:15,740
fallback layout first because the other

02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:18,320
day they they are still going to be

02:01:15,740 --> 02:01:20,180
browsers that don't support grid and we

02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:20,840
don't want the layout to be completely

02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:22,490
broken

02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:24,020
we don't need to be completely plain

02:01:22,490 --> 02:01:28,990
also so you just give a very basic

02:01:24,020 --> 02:01:34,430
styling so why did just now I copy over

02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:36,890
this one is just to cap cap it we don't

02:01:34,430 --> 02:01:41,020
want the lines to go to to white we kept

02:01:36,890 --> 02:01:41,020
it and Center centralize it that's fine

02:01:41,410 --> 02:01:48,680
in order to make your images responsive

02:01:45,590 --> 02:01:50,180
just put this is just an that practice

02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:52,840
max with hundreds and then you want

02:01:50,180 --> 02:01:56,810
overflow okay so this is this is

02:01:52,840 --> 02:02:06,160
reasonably decent I suppose and then

02:01:56,810 --> 02:02:06,160
what we have is we can do let's do the

02:02:13,690 --> 02:02:34,660
okay this is fine pitch one

02:02:41,590 --> 02:02:48,050
you know what let's just cut this short

02:02:45,230 --> 02:02:50,210
if you look at the the final CSS sure

02:02:48,050 --> 02:02:56,150
you copy copy all the way the line 98

02:02:50,210 --> 02:02:59,840
and just pace it over already right so

02:02:56,150 --> 02:03:07,969
you open the open this one go all the

02:02:59,840 --> 02:03:16,550
way down to 98 copy everything I retired

02:03:07,969 --> 02:03:19,010
I cannot D so basically I do I do the

02:03:16,550 --> 02:03:21,369
supports query so y'all just I do here

02:03:19,010 --> 02:03:27,980
halt just replace rebirth everything

02:03:21,369 --> 02:03:30,559
yeah I'm sure already beta but because

02:03:27,980 --> 02:03:31,760
this fight is not in green eyes just a

02:03:30,559 --> 02:03:33,679
fallback so I'm just going to assume

02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:36,790
everybody can do this without GUI is

02:03:33,679 --> 02:03:36,790
fine right

02:03:39,900 --> 02:03:48,010
eleven works it works on on up Remini is

02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:50,440
the most basic one is way you can you

02:03:48,010 --> 02:03:53,770
get you can see the title you can see

02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:56,440
this is kind of decorated but it's quite

02:03:53,770 --> 02:03:57,070
straightforward single column nothing

02:03:56,440 --> 02:03:58,929
special

02:03:57,070 --> 02:04:02,829
then the tour days just kick to the side

02:03:58,929 --> 02:04:06,190
so once we've taken care of the the four

02:04:02,829 --> 02:04:11,020
back then we can start layering on the

02:04:06,190 --> 02:04:13,480
the fancier layout so those as everybody

02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:16,570
seen this particular query before I

02:04:13,480 --> 02:04:19,210
suppose is this new to anybody have you

02:04:16,570 --> 02:04:23,290
never seen a suppose in your life please

02:04:19,210 --> 02:04:25,389
let me know they explain why is great so

02:04:23,290 --> 02:04:25,869
everybody's familiar with media queries

02:04:25,389 --> 02:04:28,989
right

02:04:25,869 --> 02:04:32,290
so in CSS the query syntax usually is

02:04:28,989 --> 02:04:34,630
like an app so at media is media query

02:04:32,290 --> 02:04:39,699
is a conditional so it allows us to have

02:04:34,630 --> 02:04:43,000
if-else statements inside CSS so one of

02:04:39,699 --> 02:04:47,320
the few things where we can have logic

02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:51,969
in the CSS tittle media queries in that

02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:55,420
if the query is true then it applies the

02:04:51,969 --> 02:04:58,659
styles within a block so for at supports

02:04:55,420 --> 02:05:00,699
and supports the the the the term we

02:04:58,659 --> 02:05:03,250
call we call them teacher queries and

02:05:00,699 --> 02:05:05,949
the condition is within the parent

02:05:03,250 --> 02:05:08,260
pieces so inside the parentheses I will

02:05:05,949 --> 02:05:10,449
put the property that I want the browser

02:05:08,260 --> 02:05:12,909
to test for so the browser knows itself

02:05:10,449 --> 02:05:14,889
browser and the browser I know okay I

02:05:12,909 --> 02:05:16,719
support wit or I don't support me I

02:05:14,889 --> 02:05:18,520
support CSS shapes I don't suppose he

02:05:16,719 --> 02:05:20,949
ownership browser knows itself so

02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:23,349
browser when he sees at suppose you were

02:05:20,949 --> 02:05:25,810
you were you will examine the rule

02:05:23,349 --> 02:05:28,210
inside the parentheses and you will

02:05:25,810 --> 02:05:30,699
check oh okay display agree do I support

02:05:28,210 --> 02:05:33,280
and greet or not if I do support grid I

02:05:30,699 --> 02:05:35,409
will apply the styles within a block if

02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:37,150
I don't support the grid and I don't

02:05:35,409 --> 02:05:39,849
support great right I will not

02:05:37,150 --> 02:05:42,369
everything inside the block so this is

02:05:39,849 --> 02:05:45,820
good because whatever you write inside

02:05:42,369 --> 02:05:51,880
grid you will not bleed up so it becomes

02:05:45,820 --> 02:05:52,560
if CSS B is supported then everything

02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:55,440
inside

02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:57,750
applies but if I don't write it totally

02:05:55,440 --> 02:06:00,210
ignores everything altogether so your

02:05:57,750 --> 02:06:01,860
base fall back will never break your

02:06:00,210 --> 02:06:04,560
fall back will always work you're always

02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:06,840
like this even if your browser supports

02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:08,520
doesn't support me even you the style

02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:10,980
inside the grit will not bleed out if

02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:12,150
your browser does not support it that's

02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:14,180
how it works that's why it's called a

02:06:12,150 --> 02:06:17,610
future query so the syntax is pretty

02:06:14,180 --> 02:06:23,850
straightforward is at supports with an S

02:06:17,610 --> 02:06:26,760
s do PP or RT s ok and then inside the

02:06:23,850 --> 02:06:27,960
parentheses your you have to have the

02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:29,910
parentheses if you don't have the

02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:31,830
parentheses you will not work cause the

02:06:29,910 --> 02:06:35,250
browser will pass for the property

02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:37,130
within a parentheses yeah so that's just

02:06:35,250 --> 02:06:40,830
that's how it is that's how it works and

02:06:37,130 --> 02:06:45,540
that's why we use it the media query

02:06:40,830 --> 02:06:47,310
looks a bit complicated so just is a

02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:49,350
it's not a lie it's basically a

02:06:47,310 --> 02:06:50,760
combination so for me there Croatia you

02:06:49,350 --> 02:06:52,260
can change multiple media queries

02:06:50,760 --> 02:06:55,650
together you don't necessarily have to

02:06:52,260 --> 02:06:57,240
only use one and in total they actually

02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:58,950
thirteen properties you can query but

02:06:57,240 --> 02:07:01,290
nobody uses all them so does not

02:06:58,950 --> 02:07:02,970
introduce one less unknown one mene mene

02:07:01,290 --> 02:07:04,740
aspect ratio I think the other things

02:07:02,970 --> 02:07:05,730
that color and and things like that but

02:07:04,740 --> 02:07:07,770
what you can do is that you can use the

02:07:05,730 --> 02:07:10,560
end keyword to like chain like only

02:07:07,770 --> 02:07:14,550
apply if both are true it's like just

02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:16,860
magic thing so you can use and I think

02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:19,230
it is also but I will double check that

02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:23,880
and get back to you but for now I want

02:07:19,230 --> 02:07:25,410
this to apply when these con two

02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:27,570
conditions are met that's why it's there

02:07:25,410 --> 02:07:32,100
and as I wrote it for you so you don't

02:07:27,570 --> 02:07:34,790
have to think about it so let's go and

02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:34,790
see

02:07:35,670 --> 02:07:44,079
when but even though the stars inside

02:07:41,829 --> 02:07:46,389
don't bleed out right you will still

02:07:44,079 --> 02:07:49,119
have to do a little bit of resetting on

02:07:46,389 --> 02:07:51,369
the inside consol for the browsers that

02:07:49,119 --> 02:07:54,280
do support grid there are some things

02:07:51,369 --> 02:07:57,909
that you want to be set that's why if

02:07:54,280 --> 02:07:59,980
you look at is easier to go to next with

02:07:57,909 --> 02:08:03,369
and padding I said to none these are

02:07:59,980 --> 02:08:06,639
resets because for this for bad layout

02:08:03,369 --> 02:08:08,320
right I didn't give it I didn't give it

02:08:06,639 --> 02:08:11,980
a back Swift and I did give it some

02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:15,369
padding but if you notice the this one

02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:18,190
is edge to edge no pending and no max

02:08:15,369 --> 02:08:21,460
width so we want to reset that when when

02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:24,519
we apply great we wanna reset reset okay

02:08:21,460 --> 02:08:26,710
we said so that's why they that's why we

02:08:24,519 --> 02:08:30,849
have the next we've done and padding:0

02:08:26,710 --> 02:08:35,250
is a reset so the next thing we do is we

02:08:30,849 --> 02:08:35,250
apply great so after you reset right

02:08:46,130 --> 02:08:54,139
so a stretcher so this is the the base

02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:59,000
that we work with so then okay let's put

02:08:54,139 --> 02:09:03,110
on the grid so just now we already we

02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:08,270
already explained through why ahead why

02:09:03,110 --> 02:09:09,920
I had six columns and okay this is the

02:09:08,270 --> 02:09:13,969
very complicated part that I will go

02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:16,040
through why I made this decision so to

02:09:13,969 --> 02:09:20,750
make everybody's life easier just copy

02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:22,190
and paste guys it's not weird but no

02:09:20,750 --> 02:09:32,540
worry that's cause we haven't placed the

02:09:22,190 --> 02:09:34,900
properties yet turn on turn on be easier

02:09:32,540 --> 02:09:34,900
to see

02:09:43,030 --> 02:09:53,170
by default if we do not place the

02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:57,500
properties the browser adjust each

02:09:53,170 --> 02:10:00,350
animal each green item will be placed

02:09:57,500 --> 02:10:03,740
inside each grid cell like top to bottom

02:10:00,350 --> 02:10:06,560
left to right so there are fewer okhla

02:10:03,740 --> 02:10:08,180
in order if we didn't specify where we

02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:10,790
want each of our great items to go

02:10:08,180 --> 02:10:12,830
you're just filler in order so that's

02:10:10,790 --> 02:10:15,440
why this is based on my markup so just

02:10:12,830 --> 02:10:20,420
now my market was no hero hospice then I

02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:25,190
have to then carnival was here so on and

02:10:20,420 --> 02:10:31,790
so forth so let's look at each of the

02:10:25,190 --> 02:10:34,030
columns first column to Fr we leave that

02:10:31,790 --> 02:10:34,030
bus

02:10:36,170 --> 02:10:39,400
let me separateness

02:10:44,370 --> 02:10:47,750
six columns right

02:10:48,850 --> 02:10:58,430
who fr is this bit this bit here this I

02:10:55,040 --> 02:11:01,460
said into to Fr the next the second

02:10:58,430 --> 02:11:03,410
column is for my two-a-days so my tour

02:11:01,460 --> 02:11:06,050
dates right like I mentioned I really

02:11:03,410 --> 02:11:09,110
don't want it to shrink I don't need to

02:11:06,050 --> 02:11:11,000
break so I put a Max and Max content

02:11:09,110 --> 02:11:13,010
just to make sure that you always be

02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:15,740
tour dates one-line not tour dates and

02:11:13,010 --> 02:11:19,100
then I put a cap on how much it would

02:11:15,740 --> 02:11:21,410
shrink oh sorry no no no I don't want it

02:11:19,100 --> 02:11:26,090
to grow beyond course - this is a very

02:11:21,410 --> 02:11:28,130
short it's a very short face please so

02:11:26,090 --> 02:11:31,040
no point lady grow and so much white

02:11:28,130 --> 02:11:33,110
space so I kept it once you hit once you

02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:37,040
hit - a day sure I don't go anymore

02:11:33,110 --> 02:11:41,060
but don't shrink so 10 M next content is

02:11:37,040 --> 02:11:45,080
to handle this particular element next

02:11:41,060 --> 02:11:49,400
line is the same constant for this cause

02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:51,860
pen to 2010 Toronto is a bit longer so I

02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:53,750
give you a bit more space 14 M but is

02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:56,210
the same concept next content so plus it

02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:59,480
hits the longest I don't even grow

02:11:56,210 --> 02:12:01,580
anymore so this gives me more space for

02:11:59,480 --> 02:12:05,780
other things so that's why the third

02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:08,870
column is also min max 14 MX content so

02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:14,800
now we have the spacer column the spacer

02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:19,970
column is mimics 1 M + 1 fr so I

02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:24,020
technically could just make it one

02:12:19,970 --> 02:12:27,350
effort and if I didn't have the mean the

02:12:24,020 --> 02:12:30,680
mean value 1 EV I mean if you wishing

02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:32,480
down to 0 but in this particular case I

02:12:30,680 --> 02:12:36,200
I don't want there to be a situation

02:12:32,480 --> 02:12:39,950
where this this but that just my image

02:12:36,200 --> 02:12:41,480
so I chose to maintain a 1 M mean if you

02:12:39,950 --> 02:12:44,180
if you're okay with it

02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:46,820
kissing the site then just use one

02:12:44,180 --> 02:12:48,860
effort that's also fine like explaining

02:12:46,820 --> 02:12:50,930
the logic we have to be behind my design

02:12:48,860 --> 02:12:57,080
decisions so this column is actually for

02:12:50,930 --> 02:12:59,800
my spacer this this and you know explain

02:12:57,080 --> 02:12:59,800
fit content

02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:11,010
okay thick content is same family as a

02:13:07,050 --> 02:13:13,680
mean content and Max content in that the

02:13:11,010 --> 02:13:18,990
official official definition is a very

02:13:13,680 --> 02:13:26,250
long and computed in my own words fit

02:13:18,990 --> 02:13:29,040
content just means that you grow the MS

02:13:26,250 --> 02:13:34,590
min max but with regards to content so

02:13:29,040 --> 02:13:37,770
fit content means you grow to the you

02:13:34,590 --> 02:13:41,910
shrink is mean content then next when I

02:13:37,770 --> 02:13:44,930
am so you perfect content but once it

02:13:41,910 --> 02:13:47,490
hits you will not grow further than 28 M

02:13:44,930 --> 02:13:52,170
but you will you will continue to shrink

02:13:47,490 --> 02:13:54,420
as per if it was min content this does

02:13:52,170 --> 02:13:58,500
not make sense when I say out loud but

02:13:54,420 --> 02:14:05,270
it make sense in my head oh no think of

02:13:58,500 --> 02:14:05,270
it as min Max Auto 28 M

02:14:07,059 --> 02:14:12,280
how can I explain this in English this

02:14:09,489 --> 02:14:16,239
doesn't work okay it will not grow more

02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:19,989
than 2 km right the the the call the

02:14:16,239 --> 02:14:22,210
column with maximum will be 20 am by

02:14:19,989 --> 02:14:25,329
your shrink you will continue to shrink

02:14:22,210 --> 02:14:28,770
as per if the minimum was mean content

02:14:25,329 --> 02:14:32,770
so I think for this right

02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:36,309
longest what maybe for photography it

02:14:32,770 --> 02:14:40,480
will by rushing until photography but

02:14:36,309 --> 02:14:46,030
you will kept at 28 M so that's for

02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:52,659
these specs and lastly is this one this

02:14:46,030 --> 02:14:59,230
is spotlight is cup 2m plus 0.5 v w let

02:14:52,659 --> 02:15:05,730
me clean myself the h2 if I didn't say

02:14:59,230 --> 02:15:12,099
ok here too if you look at the official

02:15:05,730 --> 02:15:18,309
what you copy right my font size is is a

02:15:12,099 --> 02:15:20,739
variable font size so this again is an

02:15:18,309 --> 02:15:23,860
optional thing to do but you can

02:15:20,739 --> 02:15:26,679
actually make your font size have a

02:15:23,860 --> 02:15:29,079
relationship with your viewport width by

02:15:26,679 --> 02:15:34,059
using viewport units as part of your

02:15:29,079 --> 02:15:37,119
font size so this day I don't use a set

02:15:34,059 --> 02:15:40,030
formula I like I bought it to see what

02:15:37,119 --> 02:15:45,119
you want but when you use the cout

02:15:40,030 --> 02:15:47,440
function viewport width is dependent on

02:15:45,119 --> 02:15:50,770
VW dependent on your viewport width

02:15:47,440 --> 02:15:53,500
right so the reason why it's 3 M plus a

02:15:50,770 --> 02:15:57,880
viewport unit is that when because

02:15:53,500 --> 02:16:00,280
viewport width when I shrink it it could

02:15:57,880 --> 02:16:03,610
go potentially it could resolve to a

02:16:00,280 --> 02:16:06,250
value that is very very very small so

02:16:03,610 --> 02:16:08,800
what I want to do is that I will cap it

02:16:06,250 --> 02:16:12,400
at 3 M so once the viewport width value

02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:14,559
it's a very small you don't your text to

02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:18,460
disappear because if your font size is

02:16:14,559 --> 02:16:20,710
like this these are these values right

02:16:18,460 --> 02:16:23,800
and the browser's are a were still busy

02:16:20,710 --> 02:16:26,350
off to pixels okay when the browser does

02:16:23,800 --> 02:16:27,550
auto passing when I say very like the

02:16:26,350 --> 02:16:29,410
first thing I say in the mornings and a

02:16:27,550 --> 02:16:31,870
brother had to pass all the values right

02:16:29,410 --> 02:16:34,510
he will resolve all these like m units

02:16:31,870 --> 02:16:37,030
viewport units percentage right it does

02:16:34,510 --> 02:16:39,849
at the end of it before rendering it

02:16:37,030 --> 02:16:42,010
does pass it resolves to a fixed unit it

02:16:39,849 --> 02:16:44,800
resolves to pixels but all these

02:16:42,010 --> 02:16:47,469
elements the width of the elements the

02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:49,120
the font sizes of the elements they are

02:16:47,469 --> 02:16:52,330
and at the end of the day have to be

02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:53,889
resolved to pixels it's just that the

02:16:52,330 --> 02:16:54,820
calculation is transparent plus the

02:16:53,889 --> 02:16:59,410
browser does its own thing

02:16:54,820 --> 02:17:02,050
so 3m plus if you use only viewport unit

02:16:59,410 --> 02:17:04,840
is possible that you will resolved to

02:17:02,050 --> 02:17:07,479
like maybe zero pixels that's possible

02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:09,820
the calculation so we don't wanna text

02:17:07,479 --> 02:17:12,639
to disappear so we were kept it like you

02:17:09,820 --> 02:17:14,950
were even once the viewport you need

02:17:12,639 --> 02:17:16,990
zero right you're just be 3m that's the

02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:18,519
minimum size you can't so even in my

02:17:16,990 --> 02:17:21,190
viewpoint goes any smaller I'll still

02:17:18,519 --> 02:17:25,139
keep 3m my tax will not disappear so

02:17:21,190 --> 02:17:28,150
it's not fully responsive text it's it's

02:17:25,139 --> 02:17:30,190
responsive text with a cap so that's why

02:17:28,150 --> 02:17:32,200
there are these values again like I

02:17:30,190 --> 02:17:36,940
mentioned I have no set formula

02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:38,950
I bought this too so 3m plus how much or

02:17:36,940 --> 02:17:42,010
you can adjust you can make it to M plus

02:17:38,950 --> 02:17:44,349
8 VW very this is up to you just eyeball

02:17:42,010 --> 02:17:49,889
it I set on this week or no over let

02:17:44,349 --> 02:17:53,229
look nice same for so same for each h2

02:17:49,889 --> 02:17:55,870
you could make this a fixed font size

02:17:53,229 --> 02:17:57,400
that's fine also I wanted it to just do

02:17:55,870 --> 02:18:00,280
a bit of growing and shrinking because I

02:17:57,400 --> 02:18:08,950
felt like it so because I did this one M

02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:14,019
plus 0.5 v W for its font size for the

02:18:08,950 --> 02:18:15,700
column I made it to M plus 0.5 VW so

02:18:14,019 --> 02:18:18,330
that I gave it a bit more space that you

02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:21,190
can ship you have a spacing between

02:18:18,330 --> 02:18:25,479
because if I made it exactly the same as

02:18:21,190 --> 02:18:27,519
the font size there's no space so it's

02:18:25,479 --> 02:18:28,210
basically the font size plus a bit of

02:18:27,519 --> 02:18:30,790
breathing room

02:18:28,210 --> 02:18:32,760
and again this value right is arbitrary

02:18:30,790 --> 02:18:34,389
you can change it whatever you like

02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:36,519
remember this

02:18:34,389 --> 02:18:38,739
is anyhow Lee is based on what you want

02:18:36,519 --> 02:18:41,139
the design to be this is so you're doing

02:18:38,739 --> 02:18:42,880
to follow my values exactly your if your

02:18:41,139 --> 02:18:45,340
door one you can change the spacing you

02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:47,889
can change it however but that's my

02:18:45,340 --> 02:18:49,840
explanation on why this code exists the

02:18:47,889 --> 02:18:53,460
Row three more straightforward so for

02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:56,260
the four rows I want this design to be

02:18:53,460 --> 02:19:02,050
fully in the viewport so there's no

02:18:56,260 --> 02:19:03,969
scrolling and the whole when is the full

02:19:02,050 --> 02:19:07,779
landscape view right no scrolling always

02:19:03,969 --> 02:19:12,130
fit so I chose to use the v/h/s my unit

02:19:07,779 --> 02:19:15,489
so if the math is correct if you add all

02:19:12,130 --> 02:19:17,800
these together is 150 so your OSP so

02:19:15,489 --> 02:19:20,500
this in a sense this is just ratio ratio

02:19:17,800 --> 02:19:24,159
of the viewport unit there's been use

02:19:20,500 --> 02:19:26,469
right now so with the reason why I have

02:19:24,159 --> 02:19:29,559
a mean height query is that when you are

02:19:26,469 --> 02:19:34,029
using viewport height as your units

02:19:29,559 --> 02:19:36,760
right you will know what at all Heights

02:19:34,029 --> 02:19:39,069
because it's relative to the height of

02:19:36,760 --> 02:19:42,580
my own browser window if I did not have

02:19:39,069 --> 02:19:44,979
this you will shrink to it will break

02:19:42,580 --> 02:19:47,739
there will be a point where this layer

02:19:44,979 --> 02:19:49,710
would break so the reason for the mean

02:19:47,739 --> 02:19:53,739
we've created be dense the moment in

02:19:49,710 --> 02:19:56,830
it's less than 27 ms cost 20 surnames is

02:19:53,739 --> 02:19:58,630
where it shrinks and any smaller than

02:19:56,830 --> 02:20:00,819
they write my texts were overflow things

02:19:58,630 --> 02:20:02,890
were already big so I will choose to not

02:20:00,819 --> 02:20:06,609
have this layer anymore this now doesn't

02:20:02,890 --> 02:20:10,840
if my viewport height is shorter than 20

02:20:06,609 --> 02:20:13,779
cm so for myself the designs that I do

02:20:10,840 --> 02:20:16,120
whenever I do this off I want the design

02:20:13,779 --> 02:20:19,300
to take up the full height of the page I

02:20:16,120 --> 02:20:22,659
almost almost always pair it with a with

02:20:19,300 --> 02:20:24,760
a height query otherwise I just don't

02:20:22,659 --> 02:20:27,310
don't use the viewport height you need

02:20:24,760 --> 02:20:29,140
because it's too variable ready yeah so

02:20:27,310 --> 02:20:31,449
that's just a that's just from my

02:20:29,140 --> 02:20:35,739
personal experience so that's how the

02:20:31,449 --> 02:20:37,600
grid came about so now that we have our

02:20:35,739 --> 02:20:39,880
grid right but everything is in the

02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:42,550
wrong place so what we want to do now is

02:20:39,880 --> 02:20:47,040
you want to start placing items ready so

02:20:42,550 --> 02:20:47,040
go back to here

02:20:48,351 --> 02:21:00,830
so again let's let's go here copy a copy

02:20:58,230 --> 02:21:00,830
mi

02:21:02,370 --> 02:21:12,460
so actually these tights all right it

02:21:07,650 --> 02:21:15,370
starts from the it starts from the top

02:21:12,460 --> 02:21:17,440
column because this was to is first to

02:21:15,370 --> 02:21:19,710
second one for tour dates my first one

02:21:17,440 --> 02:21:25,420
is for the image so he starts from the

02:21:19,710 --> 02:21:29,590
the column so the line is as follows 3

02:21:25,420 --> 02:21:32,860
and is 3 to 6 because it spreads this

02:21:29,590 --> 02:21:36,101
was spreads all the way to here so

02:21:32,860 --> 02:21:38,771
that's why that's why I Street to 6 is 1

02:21:36,101 --> 02:21:43,410
to 2 because that the top row so

02:21:38,771 --> 02:21:45,880
basically yeah movie moving over to here

02:21:43,410 --> 02:21:47,530
ok want to move the hell over here we

02:21:45,880 --> 02:21:52,990
remove at this spot like over to the end

02:21:47,530 --> 02:21:57,101
here we want to move remove this down

02:21:52,990 --> 02:22:02,620
here will move toward is over here and I

02:21:57,101 --> 02:22:05,590
move this thing over here so if you

02:22:02,620 --> 02:22:11,050
don't use your brain to think then we

02:22:05,590 --> 02:22:16,120
should just copy now if you notice I use

02:22:11,050 --> 02:22:19,931
this a negative value because the grid

02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:22,540
the index is not only so that's positive

02:22:19,931 --> 02:22:25,540
index and there's also a negative index

02:22:22,540 --> 02:22:27,280
so the use case applies here negative 1

02:22:25,540 --> 02:22:31,360
will always give you the last green line

02:22:27,280 --> 02:22:33,370
so for example this one is a fixed this

02:22:31,360 --> 02:22:37,090
one is a fixed defined great day III

02:22:33,370 --> 02:22:41,290
already say 6 columns so I I can choose

02:22:37,090 --> 02:22:45,400
to put the last number which is 7 but

02:22:41,290 --> 02:22:48,280
let's say you use auto auto fit like the

02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:50,380
browser generator however many columns

02:22:48,280 --> 02:22:51,880
and you don't know what your how many

02:22:50,380 --> 02:22:53,410
columns days you wouldn't know how to

02:22:51,880 --> 02:22:55,840
you wouldn't know what the last number

02:22:53,410 --> 02:22:57,101
is so what the browser vendors decided

02:22:55,840 --> 02:22:59,590
is that will give you a negative index

02:22:57,101 --> 02:23:02,440
so you can always hit the last column if

02:22:59,590 --> 02:23:04,870
by using the negative one so that's this

02:23:02,440 --> 02:23:09,641
that's a use case for the negative index

02:23:04,870 --> 02:23:11,170
so I'm lazy to think I say just one most

02:23:09,641 --> 02:23:14,561
other sites we just use minus one that's

02:23:11,170 --> 02:23:15,759
why is one minus one is the equivalent

02:23:14,561 --> 02:23:20,499
of

02:23:15,759 --> 02:23:23,469
I'm sorry side column I could have each

02:23:20,499 --> 02:23:27,459
seven I could use minus one but that's

02:23:23,469 --> 02:23:29,829
the negative index so for role we move

02:23:27,459 --> 02:23:32,379
it here so this this positioning will

02:23:29,829 --> 02:23:35,049
move h2 to that side

02:23:32,379 --> 02:23:37,839
continue going okay I have a HR any

02:23:35,049 --> 02:23:39,310
month the hey Simon is very limited

02:23:37,839 --> 02:23:42,039
thing but it was this is just for this

02:23:39,310 --> 02:23:44,680
thing it's a decorative anyone so if you

02:23:42,039 --> 02:23:50,739
do any day you can ignore if you want to

02:23:44,680 --> 02:23:55,749
is not technically not important here

02:23:50,739 --> 02:23:58,209
are you can stop so HR if I think if you

02:23:55,749 --> 02:24:00,669
don't do anything to is just one line it

02:23:58,209 --> 02:24:08,919
is one pics or something so you can just

02:24:00,669 --> 02:24:11,020
how it I apply background color and in

02:24:08,919 --> 02:24:13,899
idea we've I just started to look like

02:24:11,020 --> 02:24:15,520
that he is actually not important the

02:24:13,899 --> 02:24:16,989
great scheme of things if you want to

02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:21,579
ignore it just anyway all together it's

02:24:16,989 --> 02:24:23,379
fine and the above is here so like I'm

02:24:21,579 --> 02:24:23,949
talking York I assume we are copying a

02:24:23,379 --> 02:24:28,329
Koki

02:24:23,949 --> 02:24:30,430
so it's just positioning and if you are

02:24:28,329 --> 02:24:33,369
wondering for for this particular layer

02:24:30,430 --> 02:24:36,279
wide I didn't use grid template area

02:24:33,369 --> 02:24:39,969
because grid template area you cannot

02:24:36,279 --> 02:24:42,509
overlap if you want to do over let your

02:24:39,969 --> 02:24:46,329
design for example my image is actually

02:24:42,509 --> 02:24:49,270
from the my image is three columns three

02:24:46,329 --> 02:24:52,060
columns but it has to overlap with my

02:24:49,270 --> 02:24:54,729
title I cannot do that if I use grid

02:24:52,060 --> 02:24:57,430
template areas if I don't have overlay

02:24:54,729 --> 02:24:59,140
in my design I have to specify that the

02:24:57,430 --> 02:25:01,060
color a row numbers that's the only way

02:24:59,140 --> 02:25:03,310
you can get it over so that's why for

02:25:01,060 --> 02:25:07,419
this use case no area no names no names

02:25:03,310 --> 02:25:10,149
no areas you can name the lines of

02:25:07,419 --> 02:25:13,869
course you can but you know I was lazy

02:25:10,149 --> 02:25:17,109
so I just use a numbers so that's an

02:25:13,869 --> 02:25:19,299
explanation of all the the column and

02:25:17,109 --> 02:25:21,939
rows is just to place everything in the

02:25:19,299 --> 02:25:24,530
correct place so I'm gonna do my own

02:25:21,939 --> 02:25:27,870
coping

02:25:24,530 --> 02:25:29,641
charmagne easy your copy raha iodine

02:25:27,870 --> 02:25:35,221
copying I just continue explaining my

02:25:29,641 --> 02:25:38,240
coat so once you have finished copying a

02:25:35,221 --> 02:25:38,240
copy a copy

02:25:46,359 --> 02:25:51,340
they are regret Sonia what is any holy

02:25:48,920 --> 02:25:51,340
workshop

02:26:02,220 --> 02:26:13,890
oh my god the one foot strip Hey okay

02:26:11,550 --> 02:26:16,039
his butcher is real actual software

02:26:13,890 --> 02:26:24,300
blitz drafting so that's good

02:26:16,039 --> 02:26:32,340
not the framework oh my god why is this

02:26:24,300 --> 02:26:36,140
my dry food there oh yeah I don't know

02:26:32,340 --> 02:26:36,140
what these does okay check

02:26:40,171 --> 02:26:45,381
hey Noam it looks like something oh I

02:26:42,900 --> 02:26:45,381
know what misery

02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:15,040
nomads well done yes you're quite fun

02:27:16,960 --> 02:27:33,250
done done right okay

02:27:30,170 --> 02:27:36,970
okay okay if you finish copying other

02:27:33,250 --> 02:27:42,700
placement code know the position already

02:27:36,970 --> 02:27:45,260
everything is in the crepe SEO so let's

02:27:42,700 --> 02:27:47,720
the rest is just tweaking position

02:27:45,260 --> 02:27:50,270
everything is correct so for this one

02:27:47,720 --> 02:27:53,330
here's one right if I don't do anything

02:27:50,270 --> 02:27:57,500
you realize that is either a back so you

02:27:53,330 --> 02:27:59,240
can do is the what the z-index does is

02:27:57,500 --> 02:28:01,760
it brings it back it brings it on top of

02:27:59,240 --> 02:28:03,860
the image so that's why I wonder hitch

02:28:01,760 --> 02:28:10,060
hitch want to be dead that's why I have

02:28:03,860 --> 02:28:13,610
a Z next day we do the front panting

02:28:10,060 --> 02:28:18,439
okay margin bottom initial let's talk

02:28:13,610 --> 02:28:23,689
about this value initial it's I think

02:28:18,439 --> 02:28:26,540
it's from ie I in line on what you can

02:28:23,689 --> 02:28:29,000
use initial what initial does is that

02:28:26,540 --> 02:28:33,500
you will reset so because I had some

02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:39,229
fallback styles right rather than set it

02:28:33,500 --> 02:28:41,000
to a value like zero and not having over

02:28:39,229 --> 02:28:43,430
idea again right you just said it back

02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:45,620
to initial you bid whatever it will be

02:28:43,430 --> 02:28:48,170
as if you didn't apply an image in

02:28:45,620 --> 02:28:50,600
bottom on the air or then I actually I

02:28:48,170 --> 02:28:53,840
quite like using initial for for

02:28:50,600 --> 02:28:56,000
resetting instead of giving actual value

02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:58,649
right

02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:01,260
for any spouse will apply so I think

02:28:58,649 --> 02:29:05,189
that's kena you can choose to put it to

02:29:01,260 --> 02:29:07,140
0 if you want to as well I suppose so

02:29:05,189 --> 02:29:10,620
that's that's why this is there is just

02:29:07,140 --> 02:29:15,510
for to reset for backs down top padding

02:29:10,620 --> 02:29:17,310
to make it look nice okay let's talk

02:29:15,510 --> 02:29:20,520
about this if you show that for my top

02:29:17,310 --> 02:29:23,130
yesterday I will I spend like half are

02:29:20,520 --> 02:29:34,920
we talking about this so this is how I

02:29:23,130 --> 02:29:38,550
mean the texts go do that refresh yeah

02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:41,610
then we can already so that's that again

02:29:38,550 --> 02:29:44,630
this is me so positioning we already set

02:29:41,610 --> 02:29:51,870
another just making it look pretty

02:29:44,630 --> 02:29:54,180
he already put in for about okay let's

02:29:51,870 --> 02:29:58,070
look at about um about right you are

02:29:54,180 --> 02:30:02,700
noticed that it's actually at the top

02:29:58,070 --> 02:30:06,030
but in the in the ideal design is

02:30:02,700 --> 02:30:09,390
actually to the bottom so what we want

02:30:06,030 --> 02:30:11,580
to do is that and this looks nice

02:30:09,390 --> 02:30:15,030
this one we don't need to use the Flex

02:30:11,580 --> 02:30:18,930
trick because this one the background is

02:30:15,030 --> 02:30:21,300
what it's okay if if the grid items

02:30:18,930 --> 02:30:23,550
showing two feet cause you can see from

02:30:21,300 --> 02:30:27,630
a visual standpoint is fine so you can

02:30:23,550 --> 02:30:30,180
just directly do use the align you can

02:30:27,630 --> 02:30:32,990
use the align property so when you

02:30:30,180 --> 02:30:32,990
highlight it right

02:30:34,229 --> 02:30:40,359
you can see that if there was a

02:30:38,109 --> 02:30:42,789
background right you have cut off here

02:30:40,359 --> 02:30:44,619
cause the the degree item area has

02:30:42,789 --> 02:30:46,239
shrunk to fit but from a visual

02:30:44,619 --> 02:30:48,339
standpoint doesn't matter because the

02:30:46,239 --> 02:30:49,929
bad guys dy anyway so this why don't you

02:30:48,339 --> 02:30:51,939
do the display flex ting you can just

02:30:49,929 --> 02:30:54,789
align self to the to the end and then

02:30:51,939 --> 02:30:57,159
just go down petting and just make

02:30:54,789 --> 02:30:59,589
things look pretty it's fine okay so

02:30:57,159 --> 02:31:01,839
this I forgot what this did but I

02:30:59,589 --> 02:31:04,299
remember what this does this is just to

02:31:01,839 --> 02:31:06,099
create this line that's all so if you

02:31:04,299 --> 02:31:08,619
draw this line or you're not using image

02:31:06,099 --> 02:31:11,289
also cane but though his image I like

02:31:08,619 --> 02:31:13,029
you CSS so I just use a pseudo anyone to

02:31:11,289 --> 02:31:17,429
create that line so this is no important

02:31:13,029 --> 02:31:17,429
either moving on email

02:31:23,490 --> 02:31:33,521
location so location is this a great bit

02:31:29,110 --> 02:31:41,470
and so this baby is on top it has

02:31:33,521 --> 02:31:45,100
overlap my image so this is a open this

02:31:41,470 --> 02:31:47,080
is this kind of thing is a trick the

02:31:45,100 --> 02:31:50,260
image is at least the rectangle is just

02:31:47,080 --> 02:31:52,480
we started to sit on top on the bottom

02:31:50,260 --> 02:31:54,190
right corner so how we do that is that

02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:56,470
we put in this these these are

02:31:54,190 --> 02:32:05,600
presentation styles right so see again

02:31:56,470 --> 02:32:08,150
the index to bring on top location

02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:13,910
I also watchful much won't keep nonsense

02:32:08,150 --> 02:32:14,360
oh my god bring it to the top this one

02:32:13,910 --> 02:32:16,070
right

02:32:14,360 --> 02:32:18,350
this one we need to do the Flex trick

02:32:16,070 --> 02:32:20,030
because it's on background color these

02:32:18,350 --> 02:32:21,410
are different background color there's

02:32:20,030 --> 02:32:23,360
life on this too even though is the

02:32:21,410 --> 02:32:25,280
effect is the same right this one you

02:32:23,360 --> 02:32:27,620
don't need to use the flag shake is a

02:32:25,280 --> 02:32:29,750
from visually you can get away with it

02:32:27,620 --> 02:32:31,580
this one visually we cannot get away

02:32:29,750 --> 02:32:34,460
with it that's why for this one we have

02:32:31,580 --> 02:32:36,950
the the Flex trick and that's why you

02:32:34,460 --> 02:32:40,960
apply the alignment properties to the P

02:32:36,950 --> 02:32:44,330
which is here fun fun part about

02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:47,560
centering items if you only have one

02:32:44,330 --> 02:32:50,480
element within your Flex container

02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:52,790
margin Auto will Center it perfectly

02:32:50,480 --> 02:32:55,670
don't have to do any justify nonsense

02:32:52,790 --> 02:32:58,820
crap just put margin Auto and Eva be

02:32:55,670 --> 02:33:03,860
right at the center only applies if

02:32:58,820 --> 02:33:06,080
there is one flag for multiple items you

02:33:03,860 --> 02:33:07,820
imagine Auto it or not you will spread

02:33:06,080 --> 02:33:11,750
things around but if you lay one item

02:33:07,820 --> 02:33:17,150
this works so so that's that's how you

02:33:11,750 --> 02:33:19,790
get it to the center and lastly this

02:33:17,150 --> 02:33:22,640
looks fine for a simple reason because

02:33:19,790 --> 02:33:24,740
we have studied in the fallback stars so

02:33:22,640 --> 02:33:28,580
these last two lines again are resets to

02:33:24,740 --> 02:33:32,590
reset it back to its original value so

02:33:28,580 --> 02:33:36,470
that you are seen sit nicely on my grid

02:33:32,590 --> 02:33:41,960
so that's that's done ready this is how

02:33:36,470 --> 02:33:48,950
you this is how you get the the

02:33:41,960 --> 02:33:51,140
landscape layup so okay check is

02:33:48,950 --> 02:33:51,650
everybody here okay everybody gone this

02:33:51,140 --> 02:33:56,021
right

02:33:51,650 --> 02:33:56,021
no right waiting ball right excellent

02:33:56,170 --> 02:34:02,310
what else do I do

02:33:59,310 --> 02:34:02,310
continue

02:34:04,520 --> 02:34:13,010
what what go up go up

02:34:07,709 --> 02:34:14,550
open stop no change anything

02:34:13,010 --> 02:34:17,249
ain't nothing

02:34:14,550 --> 02:34:20,220
why the extra okay can anything about

02:34:17,249 --> 02:34:25,079
this I'm doing this very long ago is

02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:28,680
this movie it oh okay okay okay

02:34:25,079 --> 02:34:32,819
and actually we are done

02:34:28,680 --> 02:34:35,670
but why explain is this part if you

02:34:32,819 --> 02:34:40,709
didn't choose to do this then is not not

02:34:35,670 --> 02:34:45,840
necessary but I'm gonna open the the

02:34:40,709 --> 02:34:48,149
actual demo she went down really the

02:34:45,840 --> 02:34:50,720
only memory I got I got more examples

02:34:48,149 --> 02:34:50,720
it's fine

02:34:54,870 --> 02:35:01,830
okay so this is the whole thing so you

02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,830
know this this black know this is Bella

02:35:04,290 --> 02:35:13,150
if I didn't do that okay so it's not

02:35:07,811 --> 02:35:16,360
perfect but this part not very nice so

02:35:13,150 --> 02:35:18,760
this is the problem in using Newport

02:35:16,360 --> 02:35:21,851
Heights for your layout so there will be

02:35:18,760 --> 02:35:24,641
a point where it looks funny so that's

02:35:21,851 --> 02:35:26,980
why the query work the curvy soft once

02:35:24,641 --> 02:35:28,050
my deadline hits right I switch it at

02:35:26,980 --> 02:35:31,480
Dorney anymore

02:35:28,050 --> 02:35:33,101
so when it when it goes to this this

02:35:31,480 --> 02:35:35,290
layout right and you turn down you know

02:35:33,101 --> 02:35:37,090
the hinge is not there is a sheet there

02:35:35,290 --> 02:35:42,130
it's just that the opacity or set to

02:35:37,090 --> 02:35:43,721
zero so it's actually just a visual it's

02:35:42,130 --> 02:35:45,641
just for the line this last the last

02:35:43,721 --> 02:35:47,800
query right it's just for that stupid

02:35:45,641 --> 02:35:50,260
line so if the stupid I was not dead a

02:35:47,800 --> 02:35:51,340
query ruining this yeah this is just an

02:35:50,260 --> 02:35:53,880
explanation or a good

02:35:51,340 --> 02:35:53,880
but anyway

02:35:56,250 --> 02:36:02,200
one more thing I want to talk about is

02:35:58,330 --> 02:36:08,260
the fact that the image kind of USA

02:36:02,200 --> 02:36:11,010
changes so the image actually normally

02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:15,700
what you be able to achieve this effect

02:36:11,010 --> 02:36:18,970
when you when you do background size

02:36:15,700 --> 02:36:23,170
background size cover and content you

02:36:18,970 --> 02:36:25,930
you'll be able to sort of change how

02:36:23,170 --> 02:36:28,540
much of the image is displayed so

02:36:25,930 --> 02:36:31,210
there's a new property called objective

02:36:28,540 --> 02:36:37,300
that you would if you copied it over it

02:36:31,210 --> 02:36:38,979
should be here on their copy weight so

02:36:37,300 --> 02:36:41,650
if your image doesn't do it

02:36:38,979 --> 02:36:44,740
where's my object P oh no no you're not

02:36:41,650 --> 02:36:47,640
you're not in the top here Oh Jake fit

02:36:44,740 --> 02:36:50,530
cover what it does is that it makes

02:36:47,640 --> 02:36:52,689
content images meaning the images you

02:36:50,530 --> 02:36:54,939
learn into your website using the IMG

02:36:52,689 --> 02:36:58,240
tag right you can let it behave exactly

02:36:54,939 --> 02:37:00,010
like a background image so it used to be

02:36:58,240 --> 02:37:02,650
whenever we could if you wanted to do

02:37:00,010 --> 02:37:05,830
this as I saw responsive images we had

02:37:02,650 --> 02:37:07,479
to do the we had to apply an image to

02:37:05,830 --> 02:37:09,310
the background background image it and

02:37:07,479 --> 02:37:11,650
then you background size it then you do

02:37:09,310 --> 02:37:14,500
the content cover thing now you can do

02:37:11,650 --> 02:37:16,750
it onto content even just as well with

02:37:14,500 --> 02:37:18,250
the object value and it takes the same

02:37:16,750 --> 02:37:20,350
values you can do cover you can do

02:37:18,250 --> 02:37:24,189
content just like bhangra images so

02:37:20,350 --> 02:37:26,229
object fit the support is quite good

02:37:24,189 --> 02:37:27,070
already just don't think about

02:37:26,229 --> 02:37:28,780
supporting ie

02:37:27,070 --> 02:37:31,090
because nothing new is going going to IE

02:37:28,780 --> 02:37:33,180
anymore people just people just stop

02:37:31,090 --> 02:37:35,410
thinking that you will is now just

02:37:33,180 --> 02:37:37,750
Microsoft is just supporting in the next

02:37:35,410 --> 02:37:40,990
bar as a courtesy to like banks and

02:37:37,750 --> 02:37:44,710
stuff we still have to use it so so for

02:37:40,990 --> 02:37:46,540
in that in Andheri guy right that's a

02:37:44,710 --> 02:37:48,820
that's a good reason why we still use

02:37:46,540 --> 02:37:51,010
the for backs so that if you are not

02:37:48,820 --> 02:37:52,930
using an older browser is still it's not

02:37:51,010 --> 02:37:56,410
broken it's just a bit more plain that's

02:37:52,930 --> 02:37:59,470
fine so that's this this particular demo

02:37:56,410 --> 02:38:04,090
explained if I try to follow the

02:37:59,470 --> 02:38:08,130
structure of my slides okay which I

02:38:04,090 --> 02:38:08,130
don't try this or we can try this

02:38:08,300 --> 02:38:14,790
because this is actually us CSS then

02:38:11,880 --> 02:38:21,930
it's not you can see the you can okay

02:38:14,790 --> 02:38:25,970
you know it's quite okay the SVG is for

02:38:21,930 --> 02:38:30,120
my lattice cause the phone is custom the

02:38:25,970 --> 02:38:32,310
okay had to Flickr CSS animation a my

02:38:30,120 --> 02:38:39,090
but the Greek the Greek the bad guy is

02:38:32,310 --> 02:38:41,790
agree so so each of this is a good so

02:38:39,090 --> 02:38:44,160
okay these are I just thought I on your

02:38:41,790 --> 02:38:46,380
if you want to follow you can follow our

02:38:44,160 --> 02:38:50,430
there's a pen link does everybody have

02:38:46,380 --> 02:38:53,120
the slides or not so I think the link is

02:38:50,430 --> 02:38:53,120
there we are

02:38:59,070 --> 02:39:06,690
okay something ah Ling Ling Ling so here

02:39:03,480 --> 02:39:08,130
you can see the code so you don't I well

02:39:06,690 --> 02:39:10,430
we can talk about it let's just talk

02:39:08,130 --> 02:39:10,430
about it

02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:16,440
I've used this s so that's why there are

02:39:14,370 --> 02:39:19,470
variables here but it's just what colors

02:39:16,440 --> 02:39:22,290
it's no big deal so when I say

02:39:19,470 --> 02:39:26,490
responsive right this is the lister when

02:39:22,290 --> 02:39:33,240
everything is fully viewport so if I

02:39:26,490 --> 02:39:36,540
resize is always going to feel so that's

02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:42,060
one thing but the tricky part about

02:39:36,540 --> 02:39:45,120
using viewport units is that so

02:39:42,060 --> 02:39:48,000
everything has to be calculated on so

02:39:45,120 --> 02:39:56,430
for this particular case right is fine

02:39:48,000 --> 02:40:00,840
but when I applied it to here this is

02:39:56,430 --> 02:40:02,130
not you have to convert everything you

02:40:00,840 --> 02:40:10,560
have to convert everything back to

02:40:02,130 --> 02:40:12,750
excuse me otherwise you just for this so

02:40:10,560 --> 02:40:13,590
here right all the values will add up to

02:40:12,750 --> 02:40:15,780
02:40:13,590 --> 02:40:17,840
okay that's fine but what if you want to

02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:21,530
use it as a component as part of another

02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:24,360
like video as I cannot 100 anymore oh

02:40:21,530 --> 02:40:26,970
that's where you probably want to invest

02:40:24,360 --> 02:40:28,260
in a calculator or if your mental sons

02:40:26,970 --> 02:40:30,300
are really good you have to ratio

02:40:28,260 --> 02:40:33,330
everything you have to ratio everything

02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:35,430
to get it get it to fit into this size

02:40:33,330 --> 02:40:38,870
or you perform for me for this

02:40:35,430 --> 02:40:40,860
particular are changing to a fixed but

02:40:38,870 --> 02:40:43,170
similar is actually quite

02:40:40,860 --> 02:40:46,620
straightforward why why do I have to use

02:40:43,170 --> 02:40:49,130
grid for this is because let's see we

02:40:46,620 --> 02:40:49,130
can find

02:41:00,199 --> 02:41:08,430
well I got I suppose everything oh my

02:41:02,640 --> 02:41:10,590
god so okay the great template Rose is

02:41:08,430 --> 02:41:17,010
straightforward because there's only one

02:41:10,590 --> 02:41:25,380
row the columns are calculated so that's

02:41:17,010 --> 02:41:27,779
how you yeah actually it is Jesus to be

02:41:25,380 --> 02:41:29,489
example because all you do is for I do

02:41:27,779 --> 02:41:31,439
is do this okay let's not look at

02:41:29,489 --> 02:41:34,819
details to be example I'm sorry let's

02:41:31,439 --> 02:41:34,819
forget it is a nicer example

02:41:37,391 --> 02:41:40,931
yeah I agree this

02:41:46,069 --> 02:41:52,470
mm-hmm okay this is why I really like

02:41:50,430 --> 02:41:54,779
the green inspector too because even you

02:41:52,470 --> 02:41:57,449
transform the grid inspect our transform

02:41:54,779 --> 02:41:59,850
with you yeah so if you wanna do funny

02:41:57,449 --> 02:42:01,890
things idea you can see use that you can

02:41:59,850 --> 02:42:08,640
still visualize using the green specter

02:42:01,890 --> 02:42:14,340
Torah so a sauna so for this right each

02:42:08,640 --> 02:42:16,529
of the the origin the the base imagine

02:42:14,340 --> 02:42:18,060
if I if you don't have enough spatial it

02:42:16,529 --> 02:42:19,859
doesn't make sense to go diagonal

02:42:18,060 --> 02:42:22,500
because diagonal actually only looks

02:42:19,859 --> 02:42:25,800
nice if you have a widescreen so that's

02:42:22,500 --> 02:42:28,949
why for this the the transform only

02:42:25,800 --> 02:42:34,170
kicks in when it's diagonal that's fine

02:42:28,949 --> 02:42:36,180
but to tune it out it's grid so this is

02:42:34,170 --> 02:42:39,420
actually the header on one of the css3

02:42:36,180 --> 02:42:41,579
at Aqaba he was an image so because at

02:42:39,420 --> 02:42:43,229
the point in time I was fun employed and

02:42:41,579 --> 02:42:46,350
I had nothing well doing my free time

02:42:43,229 --> 02:42:49,229
and say okay let's make this in CSS so

02:42:46,350 --> 02:42:56,670
what we can do is a design like these

02:42:49,229 --> 02:42:59,040
will work because all this you can use

02:42:56,670 --> 02:43:02,100
other properties you you we mentioned

02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:04,560
before and just play so you can just

02:43:02,100 --> 02:43:04,920
place everything as sm when wherever you

02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:07,579
need it

02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:07,579
and

02:43:10,050 --> 02:43:15,310
when you see this right the first thing

02:43:12,819 --> 02:43:15,850
to do is to design something like this

02:43:15,310 --> 02:43:19,180
right

02:43:15,850 --> 02:43:23,109
you have to plan it you have to although

02:43:19,180 --> 02:43:25,720
what is in the planning so I'm going to

02:43:23,109 --> 02:43:29,109
see if I can find the original image

02:43:25,720 --> 02:43:33,550
then we can talk through the great

02:43:29,109 --> 02:43:35,939
planning process cuz it really any Holly

02:43:33,550 --> 02:43:35,939
workshop

02:43:39,641 --> 02:43:45,351
so when you first scene is the reason

02:43:43,221 --> 02:43:48,591
why I felt that you could be done in CSS

02:43:45,351 --> 02:43:50,570
be is because this these numbers they

02:43:48,591 --> 02:43:56,030
look like they were equally spaced and

02:43:50,570 --> 02:43:58,761
then it's not exactly aligned but these

02:43:56,030 --> 02:44:01,221
are these individual elements that can

02:43:58,761 --> 02:44:04,400
be spaced out along with because the

02:44:01,221 --> 02:44:07,011
critical requests also long it follows a

02:44:04,400 --> 02:44:10,011
grid so based on this premise also okay

02:44:07,011 --> 02:44:14,391
let's try to let's try to start to plan

02:44:10,011 --> 02:44:18,891
this so we know enter code again the

02:44:14,391 --> 02:44:22,061
original the the base grid looks like

02:44:18,891 --> 02:44:22,061
management green

02:44:25,200 --> 02:44:31,350
you migrate and suppose not here nine

02:44:28,080 --> 02:44:33,600
columns so because it's diagonal right

02:44:31,350 --> 02:44:36,330
you clearly on the original you can

02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:38,340
really see the rest but you know you

02:44:36,330 --> 02:44:41,100
probably just put it in with because

02:44:38,340 --> 02:44:45,210
when it's when it's this way you do any

02:44:41,100 --> 02:44:47,700
empty so how much do you got do you went

02:44:45,210 --> 02:44:50,610
out do nine so okay no nine so we do

02:44:47,700 --> 02:44:53,460
nine that s the reason why point nine

02:44:50,610 --> 02:44:58,760
columns because the original design sane

02:44:53,460 --> 02:45:02,580
is so that's nine so for the roads right

02:44:58,760 --> 02:45:07,560
and this is fun because if you don't

02:45:02,580 --> 02:45:09,740
back at the design and close this you

02:45:07,560 --> 02:45:12,630
can see can't see that okay

02:45:09,740 --> 02:45:15,150
how do I want to play me this looks like

02:45:12,630 --> 02:45:16,800
UK actually socks make these three

02:45:15,150 --> 02:45:20,400
elements they seem to be very like

02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:23,280
regular space so again I have a travel

02:45:20,400 --> 02:45:25,500
even with two M so the first tree is to

02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:27,120
M because I knew that if I use the

02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:30,600
alignment properties against off like

02:45:27,120 --> 02:45:34,590
make it an even but the grid itself can

02:45:30,600 --> 02:45:37,439
be can be the same length for the for

02:45:34,590 --> 02:45:40,050
the text itself right I went with a

02:45:37,439 --> 02:45:42,360
min/max well with min Max value because

02:45:40,050 --> 02:45:47,130
I changed the the site to to match my

02:45:42,360 --> 02:45:51,330
phone size and Allah the last to this

02:45:47,130 --> 02:45:55,530
one make it even and the rest this VPP

02:45:51,330 --> 02:45:59,520
is just to make sure that it's a header

02:45:55,530 --> 02:46:01,830
is a header height because of the Diagon

02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:04,470
Alley when you do diagonal is a bit

02:46:01,830 --> 02:46:07,020
tricky because the whole thing flips out

02:46:04,470 --> 02:46:07,920
of the viewport so you actually to do a

02:46:07,020 --> 02:46:10,680
design like this

02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:12,360
you have to imagine if your designer

02:46:10,680 --> 02:46:14,310
gives you a design idea you actually

02:46:12,360 --> 02:46:16,050
have to imagine what happens here a

02:46:14,310 --> 02:46:18,990
dress is gonna arrive in our blank

02:46:16,050 --> 02:46:21,930
spaces so that's that's how I came up

02:46:18,990 --> 02:46:24,080
with these arbitrary values so again if

02:46:21,930 --> 02:46:24,080
I

02:46:25,730 --> 02:46:29,310
this Sakurai

02:46:27,420 --> 02:46:31,830
the only reason I went with two Emmys

02:46:29,310 --> 02:46:34,830
because after Bo trying error he was how

02:46:31,830 --> 02:46:36,330
this sucker over land underneath so for

02:46:34,830 --> 02:46:40,470
this book the ranges are against Allah

02:46:36,330 --> 02:46:42,480
eyeballing you can and you play around

02:46:40,470 --> 02:46:44,040
to change the values of the room but

02:46:42,480 --> 02:46:46,200
once you have set up your green right

02:46:44,040 --> 02:46:48,690
it's really just a matter of placing

02:46:46,200 --> 02:46:50,640
everything in the correct place and then

02:46:48,690 --> 02:46:57,210
you can start styling all these kind of

02:46:50,640 --> 02:47:01,830
funny things for example like things

02:46:57,210 --> 02:47:05,970
like this are pseudo elements this is a

02:47:01,830 --> 02:47:11,580
pseudo element the the blue circle is a

02:47:05,970 --> 02:47:13,410
pseudo any man with a body all all these

02:47:11,580 --> 02:47:19,440
funny decorations are just pseudo

02:47:13,410 --> 02:47:26,150
animals let's go and see so this one is

02:47:19,440 --> 02:47:26,150
the beef is a before and then

02:47:27,350 --> 02:47:32,520
you when you see those elements you can

02:47:30,960 --> 02:47:35,010
do a lot of these decorative effects

02:47:32,520 --> 02:47:40,069
without having to put additional markup

02:47:35,010 --> 02:47:42,450
into your into your into your HTML

02:47:40,069 --> 02:47:47,790
because these are purely generated by

02:47:42,450 --> 02:47:49,410
CSS so it doesn't pollute your HTML

02:47:47,790 --> 02:47:52,290
button you get you can see make it look

02:47:49,410 --> 02:47:55,770
pretty so at the end of the day right

02:47:52,290 --> 02:47:59,550
for we're gonna do all these kind of

02:47:55,770 --> 02:48:03,240
funny things with CSS I think it's worth

02:47:59,550 --> 02:48:05,580
keeping in mind when I I call this a CSS

02:48:03,240 --> 02:48:08,609
grid workshop but I realized that there

02:48:05,580 --> 02:48:11,189
are a lot of properties in addition to

02:48:08,609 --> 02:48:15,359
CSS grid to make the designs work so

02:48:11,189 --> 02:48:18,660
other things like object fit la see you

02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:22,080
know any month things like that right so

02:48:18,660 --> 02:48:25,020
I feel that CSS is a bit different from

02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:27,060
all the other programming languages and

02:48:25,020 --> 02:48:31,770
things like that in that is not more

02:48:27,060 --> 02:48:35,310
doula is is that is the type of is a

02:48:31,770 --> 02:48:37,620
tough language like a language it's a

02:48:35,310 --> 02:48:39,569
language them you need to use many

02:48:37,620 --> 02:48:43,020
things together to get the full effect

02:48:39,569 --> 02:48:46,620
so even though we when we teach things

02:48:43,020 --> 02:48:48,720
we teach them individually as a module

02:48:46,620 --> 02:48:51,540
when you apply it when you apply in your

02:48:48,720 --> 02:48:53,670
work when you apply to to design things

02:48:51,540 --> 02:48:55,680
right you have to keep in mind that is

02:48:53,670 --> 02:48:57,330
how you combine all the different

02:48:55,680 --> 02:49:00,479
properties together to get the end

02:48:57,330 --> 02:49:02,640
result so there are many ways to do this

02:49:00,479 --> 02:49:05,130
you can easily use a background image

02:49:02,640 --> 02:49:07,290
for this yes.can or you can do it with

02:49:05,130 --> 02:49:10,170
CSS you can do is you door elements so

02:49:07,290 --> 02:49:11,609
for CSS right is a bit more flowy and I

02:49:10,170 --> 02:49:14,790
think again that's the reason why I

02:49:11,609 --> 02:49:16,229
think some people the very very strong

02:49:14,790 --> 02:49:18,090
variant programmers for me the guys in

02:49:16,229 --> 02:49:20,280
the next room right probably don't like

02:49:18,090 --> 02:49:22,770
CSS very much because it's a very very

02:49:20,280 --> 02:49:24,660
different way of thinking is it's like

02:49:22,770 --> 02:49:27,870
it's really everything is a global

02:49:24,660 --> 02:49:29,580
variable and I think a lot a lot of pure

02:49:27,870 --> 02:49:31,380
software programmers just think that

02:49:29,580 --> 02:49:34,470
that's a horrible it's a horrible thing

02:49:31,380 --> 02:49:37,410
uh but my my take on it is that CSS is

02:49:34,470 --> 02:49:39,569
not a programming language it is its own

02:49:37,410 --> 02:49:40,400
thing it is a it is a star-shaped

02:49:39,569 --> 02:49:43,550
language that

02:49:40,400 --> 02:49:48,561
requires us to manage this whole global

02:49:43,550 --> 02:49:51,860
variable space and I have no shortcut

02:49:48,561 --> 02:49:54,140
for this other than experience because I

02:49:51,860 --> 02:49:56,330
mention a lot of things I bought like

02:49:54,140 --> 02:49:58,220
even when I went through the the - box

02:49:56,330 --> 02:50:00,800
and everything I had to save and look

02:49:58,220 --> 02:50:02,480
seven look safer no and I don't think

02:50:00,800 --> 02:50:04,340
that's a bad thing according the dice

02:50:02,480 --> 02:50:11,120
part but I really wouldn't wouldn't

02:50:04,340 --> 02:50:15,070
wouldn't do it as a we work when we

02:50:11,120 --> 02:50:17,090
design a CSS yeah what else can I say

02:50:15,070 --> 02:50:19,190
basically as you can see now I'm feeling

02:50:17,090 --> 02:50:23,000
time right cause this is this and the

02:50:19,190 --> 02:50:29,990
past but earlier than I I imagine okay

02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:32,510
fun things we can do is CSS oh yeah okay

02:50:29,990 --> 02:50:38,540
I had this event like 2 days before J's

02:50:32,510 --> 02:50:40,760
calm and we had a banner and let me tell

02:50:38,540 --> 02:50:47,380
a story on the banner let me show ya

02:50:40,760 --> 02:50:50,510
show your benefit me first we must I

02:50:47,380 --> 02:50:51,561
sincerely apologize for any help of this

02:50:50,510 --> 02:50:53,690
project okay

02:50:51,561 --> 02:50:54,980
yeah next I see my nindo saya okay don't

02:50:53,690 --> 02:51:02,250
don't don't sign up he's a better idea

02:50:54,980 --> 02:51:08,341
by deorro No

02:51:02,250 --> 02:51:15,740
my chrome is broken open firefox not me

02:51:08,341 --> 02:51:19,080
okay so for for all the other

02:51:15,740 --> 02:51:23,480
promotional SS Aveda someone asked me I

02:51:19,080 --> 02:51:30,721
need image I will just screenshot this

02:51:23,480 --> 02:51:34,070
because this this is built using CSS the

02:51:30,721 --> 02:51:37,650
story of this is that I wanted to use

02:51:34,070 --> 02:51:40,530
this phone this particular phone is a

02:51:37,650 --> 02:51:44,311
web phone so this is no image I can copy

02:51:40,530 --> 02:51:47,881
and paste it is such a vertex but color

02:51:44,311 --> 02:51:50,610
phones or pot is not it's not supported

02:51:47,881 --> 02:51:54,091
in Chrome is not supported in Safari Inn

02:51:50,610 --> 02:51:57,721
is supported in H so hello

02:51:54,091 --> 02:51:58,980
so only H and Firefox support this so

02:51:57,721 --> 02:52:01,131
what was going to happen

02:51:58,980 --> 02:52:04,351
but color phones is one of those

02:52:01,131 --> 02:52:07,141
properties that falls back well because

02:52:04,351 --> 02:52:09,650
is not as if the phone one load so this

02:52:07,141 --> 02:52:09,650
is Safari

02:52:14,831 --> 02:52:20,030
if you don't support a phone just gonna

02:52:17,271 --> 02:52:24,081
be black so the long story short is that

02:52:20,030 --> 02:52:26,931
all the image editing programs that I

02:52:24,081 --> 02:52:29,391
could have fought did not support color

02:52:26,931 --> 02:52:30,051
phone so I wanted to design my banner

02:52:29,391 --> 02:52:31,610
iver

02:52:30,051 --> 02:52:33,681
I couldn't get a nice California shop

02:52:31,610 --> 02:52:35,570
because he only works in the latest

02:52:33,681 --> 02:52:38,421
latest latest edition of Photoshop and

02:52:35,570 --> 02:52:40,431
as a funemployed bomber radicular for a

02:52:38,421 --> 02:52:43,461
subscription and the pirated version

02:52:40,431 --> 02:52:45,501
also didn't support this so in the end

02:52:43,461 --> 02:52:53,450
after okay let's let's just use the

02:52:45,501 --> 02:52:56,841
browser to design this so this is the

02:52:53,450 --> 02:52:59,780
banner that got printed so how this

02:52:56,841 --> 02:53:01,700
works is that and this is this is a

02:52:59,780 --> 02:53:03,200
trick in case anybody wants to do

02:53:01,700 --> 02:53:05,421
something as ridiculous as this right

02:53:03,200 --> 02:53:08,001
this is a good use case for viewport

02:53:05,421 --> 02:53:13,761
units so how do I get the dimensions

02:53:08,001 --> 02:53:18,681
correctly I'm using a Mac 13-inch from

02:53:13,761 --> 02:53:21,561
2015 so it's 2x density so if I do 100

02:53:18,681 --> 02:53:23,660
VW when I screenshot on the whole thing

02:53:21,561 --> 02:53:27,860
the resolution is about two thousand

02:53:23,660 --> 02:53:31,700
eight hundred eighty and somehow the

02:53:27,860 --> 02:53:34,881
cost of the printer need are a bit

02:53:31,700 --> 02:53:36,771
larger eighteen either I don't know

02:53:34,881 --> 02:53:39,381
three thousand or something and you

02:53:36,771 --> 02:53:42,110
think oh cannot because that's the

02:53:39,381 --> 02:53:48,740
maximum I can go actually know what you

02:53:42,110 --> 02:53:50,931
can do is you can go beyond 100 if you

02:53:48,740 --> 02:53:53,331
go beyond 100 and you catch a screenshot

02:53:50,931 --> 02:53:56,360
right it goes more than that this is a

02:53:53,331 --> 02:53:58,581
this is just an accidental discovery so

02:53:56,360 --> 02:54:00,440
you don't you're not limited 100 that's

02:53:58,581 --> 02:54:02,301
why right now for this particular thing

02:54:00,440 --> 02:54:04,641
right is overflow which is fine because

02:54:02,301 --> 02:54:06,351
it's more than the viewport width and

02:54:04,641 --> 02:54:10,041
more than the viewport height is

02:54:06,351 --> 02:54:12,381
overflows it still works and if I print

02:54:10,041 --> 02:54:14,950
in cos Firefox has this like take

02:54:12,381 --> 02:54:14,950
screenshot

02:54:16,160 --> 02:54:27,870
function okay so that's it bye everybody

02:54:23,130 --> 02:54:30,930
you can go in fully yeah but if you want

02:54:27,870 --> 02:54:33,800
to do badness you can do this trick okay

02:54:30,930 --> 02:54:33,800
