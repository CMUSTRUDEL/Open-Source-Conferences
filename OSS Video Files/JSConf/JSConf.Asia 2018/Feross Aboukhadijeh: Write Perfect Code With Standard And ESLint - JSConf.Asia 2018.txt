Description: 
	In this talk, you'll learn about code linting â€“ how to use Standard and ESLint to catch programmer errors before they cause problems for your users. We'll discuss how to get started with linting, as well as how to improve your setup if you're already linting your code. Feross will also share the secret history of how the Standard linter was created, for the first time ever in a conference talk.

Since graduating from Stanford in 2012, he's worked on PeerCDN and maintains several popular open source projects including WebTorrent and Standard. He's currently working on a new website for Node.js documentation.
