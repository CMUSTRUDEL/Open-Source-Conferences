Title: Shirley Wu & Nadieh Bremer: Datasketch|es - A Year Of Exotic Data Visualizations - JSConf.Asia 2018
Publication date: 2018-02-10
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	Data sketches is a collaboration between Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu, where we choose a topic and visualize it by the end of the month, and write about our process. In this talk, we will share our favorite months of data, sketches, and code: what made them our favorites, the mistakes we made along the way, and how we overcame them. We want to share our lessons learned to highlight that, though many of our visualizations had humble, ugly duckling beginnings, we were able to produce unique and compelling results through many (embarrassing) iterations.

Shirley is a freelance software engineer specializing in data visualization. She combines her love of art, math, and code into colorful, interactive data visualizations. She enjoys finding fun insights in data and weaving them into stories and exploratory tools for the reader to discover. Her work can be found at sxywu.com. 

Nadieh is a graduated Astronomer, turned Data Scientist, turned self-taught Data Visualization Designer. After working for a consultancy & fintech companies where she discovered her passion for the visualization of data, she's now working as a freelancing data visualization designer under the name Visual Cinnamon.

[Music]

00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:17,820
my name is Shirley and I'm Noddy and I

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,650
want to thank you we want to thank you

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,600
so much for being here today we want to

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,060
thank Jess called Asia for having here

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,740
us together back together to talk to you

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,539
about our project data sketches let's

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,540
start from the very beginning naughty

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,590
and I actually met each other online

00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,200
virtually in a private data

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:41,250
visualization / channel in the fall of

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,710
2015 we didn't actually meet each other

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:48,510
in real life until April the following

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,539
year open viscom 2016 in Boston where we

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:55,020
both had the honour of speaking

00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:58,289
separately and in the following three

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,590
days we hit it off really really well so

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:05,460
well that a few months later back home

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:09,240
when a naughty but when naughty put up

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,520
her SVG tutorials from her togs I went

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,530
through them with vigor and I started up

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,520
a conversation with naughty and the

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:19,530
conversation somehow somehow ended up

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,330
with us lamenting the fact that we

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,000
hadn't completed as many data

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,850
visualization projects as we have wanted

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,200
in a previous year and that was when I

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,869
got my idea and I got together all of my

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,240
courage fully expecting to be rejected

00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:40,680
in a snotty do you want to collaborate

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:44,130
with me and happily happily she said yes

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,509
and that's how data sketches started so

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,250
in the following week we figured out

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,960
that we both liked the idea where we

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,320
would create a visualization each month

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,909
around a specific topic and to see how

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,860
two people would create two

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,290
visualizations starting from the same

00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,670
seed this topic and then diverging in

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,310
two different paths based on our own

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,869
interest in history and besides sharing

00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,030
this end result we also want to write

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,590
about the creation process and we split

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,349
this up into the three pillars that we

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,789
find most important data sketching and

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:12,650
coding

00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,480
and initially we thought we could pull

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,480
it off you know with about five to six

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,590
hours a week as usual real life really

00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,860
doesn't care about plans especially

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:24,500
coding plans so since starting in July

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,329
of 2016 we've clocked many many hours

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:28,940
into creating our visualizations each

00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:30,500
month and during this talk we'd like to

00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,329
take you through some of the lessons

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,560
that we learned challenges faced and

00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:37,730
insights that we gathered along the way

00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,420
so let's start from the very beginning

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:42,769
the data gathering process the two

00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:45,739
months sometimes get asked this question

00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:47,030
do you get your data first and then come

00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:51,560
up with the idea for your visualizations

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:54,139
or do you get your idea first and the

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,519
answer for us is always always idea

00:02:54,139 --> 00:03:00,920
first for the month of October I decided

00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:07,250
that I wanted to put emojis on the

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:14,120
former well soon in it should be okay

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:16,629
I decided that I wanted to put emojis on

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,629
their faces

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,830
[Music]

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:32,940
okay oh it's the cat now okay thank you

00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,650
[Music]

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,720
yeah

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,709
so for those two months we decided that

00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:49,269
I wanted to put emojis on former

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:52,420
president mr. Obama and mrs. Obama's

00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:53,489
faces ah there we go now you see their

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,620
faces

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,209
and so for this project I went and

00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,830
gathered all of their late-night talk

00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:03,100
show appearances and their corresponding

00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:06,400
YouTube videos took a screenshot every

00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:09,880
single time that they talked so that I

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:15,450
can put emojis on their faces and

00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:19,840
there's some really fun ones in here but

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,609
this this project started because I was

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,770
trying to figure out what to do with the

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:26,020
data set of all the late night talk

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:28,960
shows and I was talking to my art friend

00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:31,180
Eric and he said to me wouldn't it be

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,610
cool if you could run facial detection

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:36,250
on the video and correlate their

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,470
emotions with what they're saying and I

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:41,550
was like hey Eric you realize I only

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:47,080
have one month to do this and I was like

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:48,820
Eric challenge accepted so I started by

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,800
manually gathering all of the late-night

00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:55,090
talk show appearances of mr. and mrs.

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,890
Obama off of IMDB I use the youtube

00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:00,600
search API to get all the videos from

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:03,640
the corresponding host YouTube channels

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,710
use the new package call youtube-dl to

00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,229
download all of the videos and their

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,890
captions wrote a script to get the

00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:13,990
timestamps from each of those captions

00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:17,080
yeah then took all of those timestamps

00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:18,580
and use flint FM MPEG to take a

00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,729
screenshot for every one of those

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,560
timestamps a full hit each of the

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:27,850
screenshots to Google vision API which

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:30,490
is the super fun API that detects for

00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,020
every picture how many faces there are

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,060
on the screen and where

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:41,020
and whether they're happy mad sad or

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:44,230
wearing a hat and I took the aggregated

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,690
annotate I can get sorry and then I

00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,670
grouped the annotated image data with

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:54,460
the caption data to get the final

00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:57,130
dataset and that I learned quite a fun

00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,950
lesson here and there's two parts to it

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,630
the first being being curious find

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:04,720
something that you're really excited and

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:06,700
interested in and let that excitement

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,940
and curiosity guides you through the

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,890
project and motivate you and second that

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,320
once you've found that topic that you're

00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:16,810
interested in get creative with your

00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,630
data gathering process because there are

00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:21,880
so much data out there and you can get

00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,800
your data set by either manual entry or

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,100
with automated scripts which I have

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:29,440
learned there is a nude or R package out

00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,140
there for practically every single thing

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:36,430
I want to do Under the Sun as long as I

00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,930
play responsibly and legally so once

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,610
you've gathered the data and the next

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,450
big thing is actually preparing the data

00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:46,570
and for August of last year maybe a year

00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:48,190
and a half ago the obvious theme is the

00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:50,790
Olympics especially since we're both big

00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,290
fans and I ended up visualizing all

00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:56,110
5,000 gold medal winners since the very

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,460
first games in 1896 so each of these

00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,250
circles here is a group of similar

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,620
sports such as water sports for ball

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,260
sports and within that each slice or

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,900
feather is its own unique sports such as

00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:11,440
athletics then we have the first version

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:13,180
on the inside going out to 2016 the

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,890
reddish background has their female

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,710
events and the blue background has the

00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:19,540
male events and finally each medal

00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,400
itself is colored according to the

00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,580
continent in which the country lies that

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,730
one so Europe is blue Americas is red

00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,290
Africa is black and so on and you can

00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,110
see for example that in the very first

00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:35,410
editions of the Olympic Games tug of war

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:37,990
was an official Olympic sport too bad

00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:39,610
they took that out so I found the data

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,590
for this piece from two articles

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,600
published by the Guardian for the 2012

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,270
Games in London and after getting a

00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,130
rough shape

00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:48,140
my screen I noticed that some very

00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:51,170
obvious metals were missing from 2012

00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,940
like hockey so suddenly my confidence in

00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:54,260
his dataset dropped drastically even

00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,420
coming from such a respectable source

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,850
and therefore I had to get a sense of

00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,100
the overall accuracy but I didn't want

00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:04,520
to have to manually check 5,000 medals

00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,470
so I found a proxy instead on Wikipedia

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,730
I could find lists that contain the

00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,070
number of events that occurred during

00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,900
each Edition which I then compared to

00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,120
the number of gold medals I had in my

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,010
dataset and if there was a discrepancy

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,320
I would investigate further to figure

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,630
out where and why and that's how I found

00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,940
out that for some of the editions the

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:24,860
horses were also in the dataset which

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,530
made for an interesting read to suddenly

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,370
see princess and and lady mirka as

00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,390
women winning gold in the Olympics

00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,650
eventually I managed to figure out each

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,570
of these discrepancies and made

00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,850
adjustments to my data so get it to the

00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,800
point where I trusted it again so my

00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,150
lesson here was that I really need to

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:43,550
get a feeling of accuracy and

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,920
completeness of my data missing data can

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:47,600
be hard to find I'm wrong data and you

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,610
don't have to check every value but

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,220
think about taking sums and counts and

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,260
averages and comparing this to either

00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:59,300
plain common sense or even better a

00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:01,760
different data source so before data

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,070
sketches I actually used to go directly

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,980
from my data gathering process into my

00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:09,200
code but Noddy convinced me to give

00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:12,980
sketching and ideation and prototyping a

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:16,430
try and I'm so glad that she did for my

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:20,660
very first sketch lesson happened in

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:23,900
September where our topic was travel and

00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:26,600
I took twenty thousand colors 5 primary

00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:29,870
colors from four thousand images grouped

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:33,950
each of the colors by the trip that I

00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:36,670
took the photo and Ag and then arranged

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,770
them by the day that I was taken on and

00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:42,380
this is one of my personal favorites

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:46,340
because I learned a lot about myself

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:48,470
through this project mainly that I had

00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,870
always known that aching photos of

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:53,660
nature so the sky and trees and

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,540
mountains and oceans so it made sense to

00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:57,550
me that I would have a lot of

00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:59,860
blues and greens in this visualization

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,009
but the thing that was really confused

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,170
about was the fact that for some reason

00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:08,440
there were a lot of reds and oranges and

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:11,680
yellows also and I knew for sure that I

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,959
was not waking up for any sunrises so

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,180
when I took a look at the underlying

00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:22,630
photos I found that they were actually

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:25,209
food pictures so this 2014 trip to Tokyo

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:30,550
and Japan you can tell apparently all I

00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:33,190
did was eat but this one to Europe in

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:38,160
2015 this was to Iceland and there were

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:40,420
some absolutely gorgeous waterfalls and

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,850
although this is one of my favorite

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,149
visualizations it didn't actually start

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:48,459
out so well in fact it started out

00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:51,009
disastrously after I had gather all of

00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:53,380
my data my data being all of my photos

00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:55,810
and gotten all of the colors out of them

00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,759
I went straight into the sketching

00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:01,480
without even taking a look at what my

00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:03,490
data looked like and so even though I

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,790
had really great intentions which was

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:10,029
that I wanted to lay out my colors by

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,010
the x-axis being at the time of data I

00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:15,279
took the pictures or where I took the

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:17,589
pictures and the y-axis being the year

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,120
that I took the pictures and given with

00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:21,040
good intention because I wanted to see

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:25,360
if there was a pattern and when or aware

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:28,000
that I was taking my pictures but once I

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:32,250
have put the actual data into the screen

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,019
into my code this is what happened I

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,510
like to lovingly call this piece man

00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:39,579
peeing into a puddle and although I'm

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,620
quite fond of it I knew that it wasn't

00:11:39,579 --> 00:11:46,089
something I can publish as my final date

00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:49,240
of sketches so I looked through the data

00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:51,939
a lot and I went through different

00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,060
iterations really explored it until I

00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:57,300
got to the point that you saw earlier

00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:00,009
and so I really took that to heart in

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,560
September and applied it to the next

00:12:00,009 --> 00:12:04,880
month in October with the Obama

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,980
visualization you saw earlier

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,660
and after I had gathered all of my data

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,209
I had listed out all of my data

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:16,040
attributes I looked through and found my

00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:18,709
min and Max and my extremes and I really

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:22,160
got a sense of my data before I sketched

00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:23,899
out any of my ideas and designs and this

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,060
is one of them as you can see I was

00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:28,069
really happy because there was almost a

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,899
one-to-one translation between my

00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:35,569
sketches and my code and my final code

00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:38,870
so my very first sketch lesson that was

00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:41,480
so important was to always always

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,819
explore the data before starting to

00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,819
sketch let's out the attributes dig into

00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:48,829
the extremes so that I can get a good

00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:52,759
understanding of the data that I'm

00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:54,949
trying to visualize and my sketches are

00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,600
often very simple only focusing on the

00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:58,550
main abstract shape that I want to fit

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,410
my data into you know colors and layout

00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,269
on details these are things I only

00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:04,910
vaguely think about but don't act on

00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:06,949
until I answer data on my screen this I

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,630
find that there's just no you know used

00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:09,949
to spend any time on these things until

00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,019
I figured out that the data actually

00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:14,209
works once I've morphed it into my main

00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:16,189
shape for the Olympics piece for example

00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:17,930
I was actually inspired by the shape of

00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:20,600
a peacock feather placing emphasis and

00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:22,009
the more recent additions but I had no

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,139
idea of that would look all right once I

00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:26,060
finally placed all 5,000 medals together

00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:27,199
so I had to see if a general shape would

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,019
work before moving on

00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:31,730
oh I laid out the feathers and of course

00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,589
it took a few steps before I got that

00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:35,480
right but luckily I saw that eventually

00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:39,290
it did show potential with the actual

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:42,110
data but with networks it's really

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:44,089
tricky to create a sketch that is more

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,579
than just circles connected by a line

00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:48,439
because with networks the best visual

00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:50,709
form is so inherent to the actual

00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:53,329
connections present within the data and

00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:56,000
for the October month when surely dope

00:13:53,329 --> 00:13:57,399
into presidents I went into royalty and

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,540
I've always been intrigued by how

00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,100
intermarriage the Royals really are you

00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,040
know are they old cousins twice removed

00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,680
in some way and luckily I found this

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,240
giant genealogy dataset online that

00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,120
contained the family tree of the

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,589
European royal houses it was from 1992

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,240
so it had to spend the night on

00:14:12,589 --> 00:14:14,899
Wikipedia adding one or two more

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,759
generations

00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:18,230
main line of succession doors are

00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:21,439
already super happy to have this data

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:25,369
available and to show you the the end

00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:26,990
result here we go so the main the

00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:28,999
curatorial leaders are the bigger stars

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,949
and everybody is connected to their

00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:33,379
parents their partner and their children

00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:36,589
and if you hover over a person slowly

00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:38,629
the grits shows how far six degrees of

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,129
separation would reach into this web so

00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:42,439
this one is connected to three current

00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:44,329
Oriole leaders for example but when I

00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:47,569
started out with this data set I had no

00:14:44,329 --> 00:14:49,339
idea what it contained so I just sort of

00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:52,579
placed it on the web using the most

00:14:49,339 --> 00:15:01,879
basic network settings and then this

00:14:52,579 --> 00:15:05,149
happened oops that's too far you can do

00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:06,470
it it's my computer is always not very

00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:07,249
happy when I try and sure this right

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,410
this happened

00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:10,819
it sort of blew up and that was really

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:12,980
helpful they're not showing me anything

00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:15,079
so I thought well maybe I can sort of

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,629
make the gravity a little bit bigger

00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:19,939
but then I got a useless hairball not

00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:21,910
helpful either so I thought well I can I

00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:25,220
can call everybody by year of birth

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:27,170
which still didn't help but luckily in a

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,420
browser you can have gravity depend on a

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,579
variable so I pulled this web apart by

00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,170
year birth as well which was more

00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:35,300
interesting but it was still a rather on

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:37,129
insightful bundle and at this point I'd

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,689
already invested several hours into

00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:40,009
playing with the network settings trying

00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:42,319
different kinds of connections and

00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:43,819
playing with my data and I was really

00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:45,379
ready to just give up and try a

00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:46,850
different angle like how much of the

00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:49,279
Royals spending these days or something

00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,839
but I gave it one last try and that's

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,149
when I decided to focus on the current

00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,069
royal leaders so I placed these in a

00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:56,540
line and then I got the vertical gravity

00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:58,370
depend on which of these royally

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,740
decision was closely related to and

00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:02,929
that's when I finally saw it in sites

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,850
for example at the Queen of Denmark is

00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:06,740
actually very central to this web but

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,949
that the Prince of Monaco line separated

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,899
more than what most 200 years ago and

00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:14,240
only at this point did I start worrying

00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:17,209
about more of the visual design aspects

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,009
of this visualization and networks often

00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:21,470
reminded me of constellations and with

00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:24,319
my astronomy background I have a virus

00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,279
for all things space so I just had to

00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,699
turn it into his

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,410
Knight and I could have never designed

00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:32,779
this visualization beforehand in

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:35,480
Illustrator I had to go hand in hand

00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:38,480
with the actual data and continue to

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,300
sort of to see how the results of my

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,459
actions would look on the actual data to

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:52,519
see if the results were both engaging

00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:58,129
and insightful we've done this loads of

00:16:52,519 --> 00:17:00,949
times so as you might expect actually

00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:02,899
most of our hours are spent on getting

00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:05,000
the data on the screen and then this is

00:17:02,899 --> 00:17:07,189
Samar far perhaps less obvious coding

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,140
lessons so for a very first month the

00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:10,760
topic was movies and it was pretty clear

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,240
to me that I wanted to do something with

00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,250
the Lord of the Rings which is well my

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,539
favorite trilogy and I thought that with

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,280
the popularity of the movies that there

00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:20,929
would be loads of data available but

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,650
that didn't turn out to be true at all

00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:26,870
and but I did manage to find a true gem

00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,669
so somebody had created the data set

00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:31,370
that contained the number of words

00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:34,010
spoken by each character in each scene

00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:37,880
of all three extended editions of the

00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:41,419
lords rings I knew I had to visualize

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:43,130
that data somehow and I wanted to focus

00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:44,870
on the number of words spoken by these

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,210
characters of the fellowship at the

00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:48,110
different locations of the movies but as

00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,780
you may be able to see from the

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,909
screenshot or maybe not there is no

00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,110
location information in it so together

00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:56,600
with the scripts that are available

00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,470
online and my own memory having seen the

00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,299
movies way too often

00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,580
I just manually added location

00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:04,340
information to each of the about 800

00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,890
rows fellowship data so a bit of

00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,399
dedication can go a long way I started

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,840
sketching some ideas and then eventually

00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:13,250
got to this where the members of the

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,679
fellowship would be placed in the center

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,419
and the location spread around them in a

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,740
circle and they would be connected by

00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:20,899
these strings where the width of a

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,399
string on the outside would represent

00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:24,710
the number of words spoken by that

00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:26,539
character at that location but sadly

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:28,190
this chart firm doesn't actually exist

00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:30,559
at least not on any tool that I was

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:33,830
aware of but it reminded me of something

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,690
that did exist and that's called a chord

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,080
diagram so I thought well maybe I can

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,970
swim on

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,059
transform this Court diagram into my

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:44,149
sketch so here's the most basic script

00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:45,799
of all text Court diagram and for me it

00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:48,440
was fundamental to see if I could at

00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:50,990
least get these courts as they're called

00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:53,179
here flowing towards the center which

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:55,549
took less time than anticipated which is

00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:57,590
pretty rare for me encoding but getting

00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:59,059
rid of that space adding in the actual

00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:01,340
earth rings data and some more

00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:03,260
appropriate colors well we have nine

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,120
members of the fellowship so I had to

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,100
make sure that the centers lined up at

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,320
the right vertical location but this was

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,019
just looking way too squished so what

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,940
about if I pull it to a halves apart

00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:15,080
okay that works but now these strings

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,450
they were looking pretty odd especially

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,029
in the top and bottom so I finally

00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:22,279
finally dove into learning how to write

00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:23,990
my own SVG pads because all of our

00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:26,480
visualizations well practically all is

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:28,490
build up out of SPG's and that took

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,010
quite a while there was also quite fun

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:33,200
and that's how I sort of ended up with

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:36,710
this new kind of chart that is mutated

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,330
from d3 score diagram and many people

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,299
have done amazing things that they they

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:43,309
share online and so even if you think

00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:45,080
you are creating something new you don't

00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:47,600
always have to start from scratch you

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,519
know try and pick a thing that most

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,649
closely resembles your idea or design

00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:58,340
and start adjusting that remix what's

00:19:51,649 --> 00:20:00,620
out there already sometimes sometimes we

00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:03,169
dream up things and we sketch out things

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:07,029
that just don't seem to have anything

00:20:03,169 --> 00:20:07,029
out there that we can base the author

00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:12,649
for that same month of movies I did this

00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,980
thing called film flowers where I

00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:17,809
visualized the top blockbuster movies

00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,389
the summer blockbuster movies of the

00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:24,049
last two and a half decades reimagine as

00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:26,240
flowers each of the petals are parental

00:20:24,049 --> 00:20:28,399
guidance ratings each of the colors are

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,529
different genres and a number and the

00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:34,549
size of the petals are their

00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:37,429
corresponding IMDB ratings out of 10 and

00:20:34,549 --> 00:20:40,419
so there's some really really beautiful

00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:42,320
ones in here like The Dark Knight Rises

00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:44,510
inception

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,140
and I personally always loved Harry

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:51,050
Potter but my absolute absolute favorite

00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:55,220
that I love sharing with everybody is

00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:58,040
the 1997 Batman and Robin

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:01,280
because of how teeny and tiny and cute

00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,740
it is so when I fight and first

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,290
published this project I got asked oh

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,540
how hard was it to do how did you do it

00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:11,510
did it take a long time and the answer

00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:14,270
is actually that it's quite easy all you

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:17,210
need is a good understanding of SVG

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:21,650
paths and in particular the cubic Bezier

00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:26,330
curve command so let's take for example

00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:28,100
this cherry blossom so the way that we

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,070
want to draw it is we start out with a

00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,170
petal and for that particular curve the

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,720
way that I like to think about it is we

00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:39,680
start with a point in this case at zero

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:43,010
zero and we draw a straight line to the

00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,050
ending that purple point and then we

00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,150
take the blue and green anchor points

00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:52,460
and we nudge it oh and nudge it apart

00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:57,020
until we get the curve that we want then

00:21:52,460 --> 00:22:00,520
drew two more lines drew of curve on the

00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:03,830
other end and then we have the pedal I

00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:07,880
put in a few more petals rotated at them

00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:12,860
appropriately put any colors and that

00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:15,350
was it quite simple so the code lesson

00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:18,230
here is really really understand your

00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:22,430
tool set in that case in our cases that

00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:26,240
our tool sets are SVG and canvas and d3

00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:29,000
and in particular my favorite is SVG

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,940
paths and the curve command because with

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,490
that under my belt I can truly truly

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:39,110
draw anything on the screen that I want

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:40,400
for some really unique results we also

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:42,530
had a lot of fun playing around with

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,570
math over the past months so here's my

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,880
addition to our collaboration ones with

00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,470
a Google News lab and being a non-native

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,020
English speaker I wanted to focus on

00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,850
translations so what do other languages

00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,630
want to have translated into English by

00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:58,510
using Google Translate from the most

00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:00,430
translated word 4:10 chosen languages to

00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,410
the top 10 for each of these languages

00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,660
and finally the similarities between

00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:07,570
these languages and for this final

00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,400
visualization I actually wanted to look

00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,950
at these these similarities and have

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,720
each of the words the two languages had

00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,420
in common in their top 10 be presented

00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,980
by a line but actually I wanted to have

00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:20,380
all of these visuals to be completely

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,780
build up out of words and letters so

00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:24,190
actually I wanted to replace these lines

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,440
by the words themselves that they

00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:28,810
represented but after I finally coated

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,300
that out I immediately saw it was a big

00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:33,790
mess so I had to compromise and only

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:36,490
place a word on the most central the

00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:38,320
line going toward the central point but

00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:39,580
then it became really important that all

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,170
of these words were placed in the most

00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,180
upright manner possible for readability

00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:45,700
but they gave quite some convoluted

00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:47,920
calculations in terms of the tax paths

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,450
that I had to calculate to place these

00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:51,010
words on and that became glaringly

00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,440
obvious once you click one of these

00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:55,060
outer circles and move the in word which

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,150
is not quite what I think a user would

00:23:55,060 --> 00:24:01,570
expect to happen and that's where math

00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:04,510
and logic solving came to the rescue

00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:06,520
it took a few pages from my notebook but

00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:10,120
eventually I ended up veering out a way

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,880
to implement a solution so now it should

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,800
work more as somebody might expect it to

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,050
and what I'm doing is really more of a

00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,320
hack so once somebody clicks one of

00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:22,270
these other languages I fade out the

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,250
words and then I immediately replace all

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,780
of these lines by their final state but

00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,070
reverse engineer to look like the

00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,950
initial state before slowly

00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,600
transitioning them to the final state so

00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,520
the last in here is really really simple

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,310
it's learn to love math and especially

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,900
in geometry if you don't already because

00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,730
they are usually your best friends in

00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:46,180
finding solutions to these visual

00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:48,220
problems in the December 2016 I

00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,230
published this visualization called an

00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,210
interactive visualization of every line

00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:54,400
in Hampton I don't know and if anybody's

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,620
heard of the musical but as the user

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,630
Scrolls down the screen these dots

00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:01,030
follow them and each of these dots

00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:03,460
represent a series of lines in the

00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:06,640
musical them

00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:10,180
and as they keep scrolling I show them

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,570
the analysis I've done as well as the

00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:16,240
filters that they can play with to

00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:18,760
follow along with my analysis until they

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,210
scroll to the very very end and I give

00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,830
them that same tool where they came for

00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:29,410
themselves filter by any set of

00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:32,050
characters conversations and themes and

00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:37,450
dig into the remaining lines and songs

00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:39,100
to do their own analysis but something

00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,770
really strange happened last September

00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:45,430
which was that I noticed that when I was

00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:47,980
loading up my visualization it was being

00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:51,700
really really slow in fact this is a

00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:53,350
video of the actual experience there it

00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:56,160
was taking in between two to three

00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:58,540
seconds between each repaint it's

00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:00,010
excruciating and I knew that it wasn't

00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,930
anything that I had done because I

00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:04,270
hadn't touched this code in about nine

00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:06,550
months and so I figured that it was

00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:09,400
probably something to do with a browser

00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:11,080
update to canvas and because I knew that

00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,730
that was something that I didn't quite

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,030
understand and hadn't been keeping track

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,420
of

00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:20,470
I turned to obviously Twitter for help

00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:22,840
and the miraculous thing an amazing

00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:25,570
thing is that within a few hours some

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,660
really amazing people including Jake who

00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:31,870
may or may not be in this audience came

00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:34,510
and kind of figured out what was going

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:37,780
on and help me debug both on Chrome and

00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:39,850
Firefox and they helped me deduce that

00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:43,300
what was happening was that because I

00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:45,880
had used canvas to draw those dots

00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:48,310
animating in the background and I had

00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:51,100
done a canvas with the height of 16

00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:56,110
thousand pixels the full height of the

00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:59,410
document scaled it by 2x for 32,000 is

00:26:56,110 --> 00:27:01,380
causing absolutely mayhem on the memory

00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:04,420
and that's what was causing the bug and

00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:07,000
I had originally done this because I

00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:09,250
have wanted the user the reader to have

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,760
the experience of the dots following

00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:15,850
them as they scroll down the screen and

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,659
it took a good week of going through my

00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:18,970
9 month

00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:21,519
code which was absolutely painful but I

00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:24,460
was able to refactor my canvas height

00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:26,289
from 16,000 pixels down to 3,000 pixels

00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,419
while maintaining that same thoughts

00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:31,349
following you effect from really some

00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:35,859
really smooth buttery buttery smooth

00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:39,279
experience and I learned the most

00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:41,799
important lesson that September which

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:45,519
was that up until that point I had

00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:49,179
thought of my tool set as SVG canvas d3

00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:52,239
react whatever I needed to do render the

00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:54,970
actual visualization but up until that

00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:59,289
point I was ignoring my most important

00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:01,059
tool set of all the web itself and I

00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:03,669
have learned that I need to really

00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:07,119
really understand the entirety of my

00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:09,609
tool set in my case being keeping track

00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:13,479
of page performance browser updates and

00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:15,429
what's coming down the pipeline so since

00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:18,070
starting we've realized that we can find

00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:20,019
data in the weirdest of places that data

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,840
preparation can reveal some really weird

00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:24,369
quirks and then data set that sketching

00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:26,830
helps weed out thinking errors but that

00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:29,289
you can also design with code that SVG

00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,609
pants are amazing in math is - but we

00:28:29,289 --> 00:28:34,149
already knew that of course

00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:37,479
and that especially is data visualizer

00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:39,099
is we should not neglect the web or a

00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:41,259
browser as part of our toolkit and not

00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:43,539
instead only be talking about d3 canvas

00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:45,669
and illustrator and these things now

00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,960
when we started we didn't set out to be

00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:49,179
confronted or learn all of these things

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,139
we we just wanted to have fun and in

00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:54,609
that we definitely succeeded so even

00:28:53,139 --> 00:28:56,889
though the years already come and gone

00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:58,419
we still have a month or two to go and

00:28:56,889 --> 00:29:00,309
there's still a few empty spots there

00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:03,070
and that's because even though we were

00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:04,749
having fun at the end we notice that

00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:06,279
we've taken on too much on our plate and

00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:08,440
we decided to take things a little bit

00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:10,479
more slowly so if you want to you can

00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:13,629
still follow us in our final months of

00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:16,720
data munging sketching and coding up our

00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:19,059
ideas into often fun and weird and

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,220
overly elaborate visualizations thank

00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:24,280
you very much for your attention

00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,280
