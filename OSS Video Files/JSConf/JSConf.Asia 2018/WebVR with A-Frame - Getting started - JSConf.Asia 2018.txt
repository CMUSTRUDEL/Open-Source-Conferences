Publication date: 2018-02-20
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	Speaker: Martin Splitt @g33konaut

VR is cool, Web is great - how about WebVR? In this workshop we will be creating a WebVR application using A-Frame. We will explore the WebVR API and the A-Frame library to build a small VR application that works in your browser - even on your phone! 

Requirements: Make sure your laptop is capable of rendering 3D graphics in the browser by visiting https://get.webgl.org - if you see a spinning cube, you're ready. If you have a smartphone that is WebGL capable, bring it too (and have it charged)!

Martin is open source contributor, WebGL tinkerer and web evangelist by heart from Zurich with a decade experience from the trenches of software engineering in multiple fields.
He works as a software engineer at Archilogic in front- and backend. He devotes his time to moving the web forward, fixing problems, building applications and systems and breaking things for fun & profit.
