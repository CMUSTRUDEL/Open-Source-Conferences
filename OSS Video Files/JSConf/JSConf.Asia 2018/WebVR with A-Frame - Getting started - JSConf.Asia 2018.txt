Title: WebVR with A-Frame - Getting started - JSConf.Asia 2018
Publication date: 2018-02-20
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	Speaker: Martin Splitt @g33konaut

VR is cool, Web is great - how about WebVR? In this workshop we will be creating a WebVR application using A-Frame. We will explore the WebVR API and the A-Frame library to build a small VR application that works in your browser - even on your phone! 

Requirements: Make sure your laptop is capable of rendering 3D graphics in the browser by visiting https://get.webgl.org - if you see a spinning cube, you're ready. If you have a smartphone that is WebGL capable, bring it too (and have it charged)!

Martin is open source contributor, WebGL tinkerer and web evangelist by heart from Zurich with a decade experience from the trenches of software engineering in multiple fields.
He works as a software engineer at Archilogic in front- and backend. He devotes his time to moving the web forward, fixing problems, building applications and systems and breaking things for fun & profit.

everybody my name is Martin I'm from

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,200
Switzerland and I love to be here I'm

00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,480
super excited to see you all and it's

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,740
gonna be a great great time there's one

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,059
thing that is not an official

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,549
administrative thing that's something

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,410
that I just care about a lot which is I

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,990
do this workshop for you it's not for me

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,460
right so if you have any questions or if

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,910
there's anything unclear or everything

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,519
not working it is my fault not yours so

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,869
please please please please tell me if

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:29,070
something is unclear or something

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:30,779
doesn't make sense or something doesn't

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,380
work because then we can fix it together

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,180
that's why I'm here for if you wouldn't

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,710
ask questions or like say something

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,969
doesn't work on my computer or something

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,890
like that then you could as well just

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,660
watch a youtube video or something so I

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,820
think the it makes the most sense to

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,260
just you know talk to me when there's

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,760
something wrong that's what I'm here for

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,969
or at least I hope that that's what I'm

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,410
here for robots won't replace me anytime

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:56,699
soon hopefully we have a Wi-Fi if you

00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,640
haven't seen that already there's like a

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:04,439
shangri-la Wi-Fi that should not require

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,900
a password and it should work TM I have

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:10,260
a fallback solution in case things are

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,970
not working but it's gonna be a little

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,340
inconvenient to set that all up so I'd

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,619
rather try let's let's try Wi-Fi if that

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,350
doesn't work then we can still fall back

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:24,299
anytime else like anyone having problems

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:26,220
connecting to the Wi-Fi no good if so

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:27,900
let me know if the Wi-Fi dies for you

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,060
during the workshop let me know as well

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,409
and I'll share the files with you in a

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,329
different way and then we can just you

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,369
know have it all work also if things

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,200
should go horribly wrong I can always

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,060
ask the organizers to help us out

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,939
because they promise they have a

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,079
fallback solution which I definitely

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,810
think they will have because they're

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,619
well organized here which is nice

00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:50,549
regarding the details there's going to

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,710
be lunch at 12:30 it's gonna be

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,649
basically it's it's not as centralized

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,500
as they wanted it to be apparently so we

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,020
have two lunch spots one is two floors

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,060
down on three if you go that direction

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,229
you see like dine on three or something

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,759
like that and if you go around the

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:08,780
corner there's like a buffett restaurant

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,430
it's called the silver shell cafe

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,560
alternatively if you were more a fan of

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,180
sitting at the beachfront

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,849
of beach from the seafront more or less

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,910
you can also go completely down to floor

00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:22,950
one and then go in that direction and

00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,290
that's something that's called barnacles

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,940
by the sea I think that's probably gonna

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,900
be a seafood restaurant so that's not

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:33,209
gonna be where I am being they also have

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,099
a different Wi-Fi ad the barnacles by

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,330
the sea buildings so if you are having

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,190
lunch over there and need a Wi-Fi

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,459
connection and shangri-la should not

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,050
work there's also the jeaious con asia

00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:46,440
network with the beware of the cat's

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,540
password so lunch is gonna be at 12:30

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,400
you have drinks here should you feel

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,900
thirsty then just get up and get a drink

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,150
we're not in a classical classroom

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,190
setting 5:30 p.m.

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,950
so 5:30 in the afternoon there's gonna

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:00,420
be a group photo at the beach the beach

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,069
is pretty large so I'm not exactly sure

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,000
where that's gonna be but I guess we're

00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:05,880
gonna work that one out

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,310
and then 5:45 after the group photo

00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,599
that's gonna be dinner at the beach as

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,040
well yes so toilets are available here

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,090
on this floor as well as on every other

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:22,190
floor so that shouldn't be a problem

00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:22,190
yeah there's like we have been whoops

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:28,530
that we have been promised snacks

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,989
between 10:00 and 11:00 so let's see if

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,730
that's helping but as I said like if you

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:36,120
want some water or some coffee just grab

00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:38,640
one any time the coffee maybe only when

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,859
I'm like having you all figure out

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,930
something because it's kind of is loud

00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:44,790
so it's not like the best thing I can

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,730
talk over it I can be louder than a

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:51,690
coffee machine but I'd rather not have

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:53,910
to be cool so if you have a full-day

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,709
workshop you would be able to leave your

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,200
stuff here but I highly recommend taking

00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,359
your things with you for lunch because

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,829
I'm a not sure whether where the next

00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:04,200
workshop is going to be is like if it's

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:06,810
in the same room I don't know but also

00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,310
it's not guaranteed to like be locked up

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,319
and stuff so just take your things with

00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,359
you during lunch and then bring them

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:20,070
back when you come back cool all right

00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:22,140
so I would say let's start um I know

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,880
that a few people are like doing slides

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,860
and presentations and stuff but I am

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,389
like no we are here for workshop so

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,110
let's do things together

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:34,259
and and I would suggest that we that we

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,509
get going like this so shut the Wi-Fi

00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,819
not die and I really really hope it

00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:41,909
doesn't then you should be able to go to

00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:43,259
the following URL it should be I gonna I

00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:44,009
go to make that large in a second just

00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:50,120
give me a moment

00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:53,599
the a-frame workshop so if you go to

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,150
this URL and I can make that even larger

00:04:53,599 --> 00:05:00,050
no I can't okay fair enough

00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:02,759
Jesus this is annoying ah this is better

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,099
so this wonderful URL should take you to

00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,199
a Gillett what's called a glitch a

00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:09,629
glitch is nothing like magical or fancy

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,189
it's just a way to have like a really

00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:14,009
really easy setup in the browser it's

00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:15,360
basically just serving static files and

00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:16,740
that's like convenient because we don't

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,900
have to set anything up we don't have to

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,279
run any software on your computer you

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:26,330
can just start with what is there anyone

00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:29,009
not having this URL typed in already

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,110
bear in mind I have put taking it from

00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:32,639
my brain so it might actually not lead

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,810
you to where I think it leads you so let

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,339
me let me double check it's the right

00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:40,770
URL yes yes so if okay right that was

00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,830
not the best idea that I had if I go

00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:47,569
here I should see something like this

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:51,020
right so if you click on remix your own

00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:56,339
you should see tintin tintin tintin

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:58,139
tintin tintin yes this now this is not

00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:59,789
very exciting and it's like the standard

00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,449
placeholder thing but the interesting

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:04,979
thing is happening in index.html so we

00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:06,990
want to have a look at index.html

00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,250
probably by the way if you cannot read

00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,589
this let me know and I can make that

00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,270
larger is that readable people in the

00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:15,960
back row give me a thumbs up or thumbs

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,460
down good okay good as I say like this

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,349
is for you not for me if you have

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,089
anything or anything is not making any

00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:23,610
sense then let me know so I basically

00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,469
set you up with some things that I just

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,330
think makes sense like ignore all this

00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:30,089
crap here this is like boilerplate stuff

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,889
in the first couple of rows no one cares

00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:33,719
this is the more interesting things we

00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:35,430
are loading a few libraries let's

00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:37,259
actually comment out the second one and

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,449
the third one for a moment so I'm going

00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,279
to remove these two scripts and that's

00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:44,219
just lower a frame

00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,929
and actually I don't know why this is

00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:47,279
still here let's remove the class hidden

00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:48,899
as well I don't think it does anything

00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,879
but let's remove it just for shits and

00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:53,069
giggles so this is basically like a

00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,889
boring old website so if I put in an h1

00:06:53,069 --> 00:07:02,419
tag and say like hello.js Khan's Asia

00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:04,679
and then an h2 tag like how's it hanging

00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:06,959
and then we click on the little show

00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:09,389
life button a new tab should open with

00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,009
our beautiful website which is like

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,289
probably the best website I've ever done

00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:15,869
and the projector is cutting something

00:07:13,289 --> 00:07:17,579
off I think but okay that's not a

00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:20,189
problem you know it's not that exciting

00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:23,039
so we have just like a normal HTML page

00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:26,129
but because we have this particular

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,899
thing here that's called a scene we have

00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:29,369
some special magical powers actually

00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:34,110
let's not remove that let's go in here

00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:35,999
and if you press ctrl alt I and that's

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,279
control on a MacBook keyboard it's not

00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:42,929
command it's control all I you should

00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:45,809
see this ha curious isn't it does that

00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:52,249
work for everyone does it not work for

00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:52,249
you Oh a that's interesting hmm

00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:59,099
anyone else who's not having this on

00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:03,509
screen yeah it should be ctrl alt I or

00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:05,879
control option I control option I nope

00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:07,979
okay well then let's let's wait with

00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,239
that just like so this this is basically

00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,099
a hint that I want to give you there

00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,839
something going on under the surface and

00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:15,179
we're gonna see what this is in a second

00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,610
let's go back to our HTML so I'm gonna

00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:20,129
remove all this crap for a second and

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:26,879
we're just gonna go in here now what is

00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:28,860
this a scene well for VRA our and just

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,110
generally 3d content on the web we need

00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,059
a way to actually express what we're

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,860
gonna do and there's a few metaphors

00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:37,139
right so for instance if you think about

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,969
it the web site it's not a web page it's

00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:39,930
not actually a page it's not a page in a

00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:42,569
physical book it's not something that

00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:44,610
you can take into your hand so while we

00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:46,740
are using the page abstraction of the

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,899
page metaphor to work with like 2d

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,179
content we are working on a frame

00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,949
decided to work with the scene metaphor

00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:54,590
for 3d continent basically what it is

00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,690
about is so

00:08:54,590 --> 00:09:00,860
would you how will you design or Express

00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:02,270
3d content in a way like how do you talk

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,730
about it and the easiest way to talk

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,830
about it is basically staging a theater

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:09,320
play or staging a movie so we have a

00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,630
scene which is an empty space somewhere

00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,130
so this could be my scene and then we

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,770
have objects like me

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,090
yes I checked in myself today so

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:18,890
basically you have objects that you put

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,900
in and you can move them around and you

00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,780
can make them do things and you can you

00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,370
know combine them like or even like I

00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,350
can move this thing around this is an

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:32,810
object as well or an entity in this case

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:34,220
and I can maybe like rotate it that was

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,760
not the best idea there's a physic

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,500
engineer at play here so yeah I can

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,210
rotate the objects that I have I can

00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,710
well I can't in the real world but I

00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,690
could scale them up I could make them

00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,520
larger or smaller and I can move them

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,230
around in space so this is kind of like

00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,790
the thinking metaphor that we've got and

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,190
there's actually two more things what do

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,990
you also need when you do a movie so I

00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,890
have a scene and I have like actors and

00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:58,910
objects and props and stuff right well

00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:01,310
making a movie is pretty hard when you

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,930
don't have a camera so we have to have a

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,220
camera we have to have a scene and we

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,030
have to have objects that we are going

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,320
to film also if this is a closed room

00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,060
it's not going to look very fancy if

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,380
there's no light so we also need light

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,090
now conveniently here we have some

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,460
lights of the slides shining on me this

00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:19,310
light is shining on me and I'm an object

00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:22,520
on my scene these objects in a CA frame

00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:24,110
are called entities it's just a

00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,020
terminology sometimes other libraries

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:29,000
call them differently very populous also

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,950
to call them meshes

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,170
sometimes they are called objects but

00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:36,740
for the sake of a frame we're calling

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:38,270
them entities so a frame by the way is a

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,490
library from Mozilla like super cool

00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,500
stuff and it's making things much much

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,120
easier than they used to be I can show

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,710
you how it look like before we're doing

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,670
if I'm like we're gonna do some FM and

00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,290
then I'll show you how it looks like

00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,640
when you're not having a frame available

00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,440
and you're gonna see why we're doing it

00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:54,170
in a frame so our a scene is basically

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,620
the exactly this is empty space there's

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,480
nothing in here okay so now how can we

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,850
fill that with something well as I said

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,630
we have to put in entities which are our

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:07,280
objects so let's do that and a frame

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,370
wraps everything in these custom HTML

00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:12,120
elements which is like so

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:15,029
nice so you can say entity and then we

00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,580
have an object in our scene but if you

00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:20,760
like me and would now reload you would

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:23,760
see nothing well that's unfortunate huh

00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,710
and the reason why is that an object

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,330
itself does not does not resemble

00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:30,750
anything it's not visible it's basically

00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,400
just a point in space an invisible point

00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:34,950
in space you don't see anything because

00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,000
it's not looking like anything so what

00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,770
you want to do is you want to add

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,200
something to it that actually makes it

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:43,440
look like something well how can we do

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:45,779
that well a friend does what's called

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,910
the entity component model it's a

00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,560
basically a way of doing things and

00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,230
organizing your code with that game

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,640
engines usually use and so we now have

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,710
to add a component and how do you add a

00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,500
component well conveniently it's just an

00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,000
attribute to our HTML tag so we're gonna

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,100
start with we want to have something

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,900
that looks like something so we probably

00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,279
want to start with geometry because we

00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,020
want to need some you know we're gonna

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,740
need a shape so let's give it a shape

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:15,420
let's say geometry and and these

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:22,560
components can have good morning oh I'm

00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:25,410
sorry was it not oh all right

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,620
you didn't miss out too much yet so take

00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:29,130
a seat we're gonna catch you up real

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,740
quick

00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:33,390
so I was explaining that you want to

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,290
start with the following URL and I'm

00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:39,300
gonna show you the URL real quick and

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:42,420
from there on you gonna go like remix

00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,670
and then you can catch up sorry for that

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,740
we're just gonna put in a moment's time

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:48,540
by the way is anyone not having like

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:53,220
working Wi-Fi on their computer right

00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:55,230
now and not having this working well if

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,520
they enough yet you two excluded because

00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,520
you're literally just setting up

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,389
[Applause]

00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:12,370
yeah the shangri-la Wi-Fi should not

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,699
require a password and seems to be

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,699
working

00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:35,970
all right you're both on the on the

00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:40,960
website you're both having the remix

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:43,510
button there remix remix your own is the

00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:47,250
button that you want to have for this

00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:47,250
holy crap by I'm gonna sing anything

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:59,320
are you caught up as well okay perfect

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,750
wonderful so you click on the remix your

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:05,170
own thing and then you should be oh i'm

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:07,570
not signed in okay I'm okay with that

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,839
got it if I lose it I lose it that's

00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,640
what happens like living on the edge so

00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,680
what we also did is we commented out the

00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,290
last two scripts because we're not gonna

00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:20,260
need them right now and we removed the

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,060
class hidden from the a scene there

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,010
there was a class on here we remove that

00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:28,660
as well because we're gonna be only use

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:30,370
it later on so yeah so as I explained

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,709
everything is an entity but identity

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,480
doesn't look like anything by default so

00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:37,420
we have to add this geometry component

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,029
and it's kind of nice that we don't like

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,470
make up countries because in 3d graphics

00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:42,670
everything is made from triangles so we

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,200
would have to now figure out like all

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,029
the triangles all over the place so

00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,380
instead of doing that what we can do is

00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:49,329
we can use a primitive which is

00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,339
basically built in simple geometries

00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:55,870
that we can use for instance we can say

00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:57,699
primitive box which is going to give us

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,610
all the points and connections between

00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:05,050
the points to form a box

00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:06,279
okay that's lovely and however we're not

00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,360
gonna still not gonna see that by the

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:11,649
way what we are looking at here is

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,779
basically so this is the entity this is

00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:17,140
a component and components can have

00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:18,970
multiple parameters right so one of

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,740
these parameters is which primitive we

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,329
want to pick and it looks a little like

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,310
Jason without the quotes so we could

00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:27,279
also do like I don't know ASD however

00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:30,310
like full bar or something like that we

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,589
can even do like bars and then give it

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:35,079
an array of things now obviously all

00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:36,370
these attributes are not known to the

00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:37,720
component so we're just going to remove

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,449
them I'm just wanted to show you that

00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,980
all these kind of things are possible so

00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:44,050
we start with a primitive box but now

00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:49,320
what color do you think the box will

00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:53,850
have how does it look like any guesses

00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:55,060
okay transparent is one guess I know

00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:59,520
nothing

00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,520
well what's what color is nothing and

00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:06,370
white white is a good choice so

00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:08,740
the thing we don't know because a frame

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:12,640
tries to not you know screw us over so

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,140
it's gonna pick a color at random which

00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,970
is nice like this is actually nice

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,450
because you know it tries to do its

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,950
thing

00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,600
oftentimes it's white but it's not

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:22,030
always white and it's like can be like

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,340
super confusing so to fix that we're

00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,020
just gonna give it a material so this is

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,580
another component right we're following

00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:31,450
the same pattern here it's a component

00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,560
and this one has parameters as well so

00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,530
the first thing I probably want to

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,620
figure out is like what's the color so

00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:40,570
we can make this red and this is nice it

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,520
supports a bunch of actual color names

00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,040
it doesn't support all the CSS colors I

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,270
think but it supports like most of them

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:51,010
so we can use a color name but we can

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:52,870
also say 0x ff0000

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,400
so that works actually no sorry no

00:16:52,870 --> 00:17:00,750
that's actually not them no no no ff0000

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:03,550
like we are used to from HTML and CSS

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:05,339
but I'm gonna stick with red for for the

00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:08,589
sake of simplicity for the moment and

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:13,240
now what happens now let's see let's

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:17,079
reload oh nothing what did we do wrong

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,990
oh my god now now try to get the try to

00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:21,579
get the key command that I did earlier

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,490
on so like click on something somewhere

00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:26,970
here and then go control option I or

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:29,050
control alt I and you should see this

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,410
does that it doesn't still doesn't work

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:34,180
what the heck see this is the fun thing

00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,440
this is I love it when it doesn't work

00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,680
because you know that's what I'm here

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,190
for

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:43,240
yes I'm worth my money than I doesn't do

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:46,750
anything that's like really weird that's

00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:47,960
like a weird thing why is it not doing

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:52,039
this

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:54,610
a frame we should be fine it should be

00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:57,020
lonely frickin thing but it's not

00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:04,789
ha-ah

00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:08,210
this is a fun one no that's okay well

00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:10,370
fair enough but hmm there's no arrows

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:14,899
here so I'm not exactly sure why is that

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:17,330
this is a fun one do you I don't think

00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:19,700
so but we can try it so in that that's

00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:22,370
one of the cases wait anyone else not

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,250
seeing this particular screen there's a

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:28,010
few people all right so I'll I've never

00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:30,049
seen that before so I'm excited to

00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:34,789
figure out what else we can do to get

00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:36,200
this working so I'll really quick so by

00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:37,820
the way this is like if you ever have a

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,700
problem with a frame this is like all

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,929
you want to be yeah this has all the

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,640
information and all the links to

00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:44,990
communities and github issues and stuff

00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,419
so what we're going to do is I'm going

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:49,220
to try to figure out if there's another

00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:50,990
way to get the inspector up and running

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,179
because what we are seeing here these

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:56,390
are like to build in developer tools for

00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:59,750
a frame and they are super handy so I

00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,700
know it says I control all I so I'm not

00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:07,940
I'm not like jump or doing something

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:10,190
ridiculous mm-hmm this is not coming up

00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:15,230
so that's an interesting one let's see

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:16,429
if they have help here somewhere because

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,159
I'm pretty sure there is a way to

00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:21,440
programmatically call this alright time

00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,390
to explore let's let's do something

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,450
it's not something that I've prepared

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,909
but you know this is the stuff I live

00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:33,279
for it's like the adventures let's go on

00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:36,470
an adventure let's get our a scene and

00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:39,060
ask what components ups up okay fair

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:42,020
enough I saw that coming

00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:47,840
[Applause]

00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:51,870
so let's see dart components dot

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:56,190
inspector does this thing have something

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:59,340
that I can work with initialized is

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,990
playing true uh-huh what the hell right

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,730
let me reload this because you're not at

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,140
this point where the inspectors actually

00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:07,560
loaded so let's try this

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:15,600
so without the inspector being loaded it

00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:17,700
has the exact same details here mm-hmm

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,460
that's a weird one okay so it doesn't

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:25,770
seem to be having a method that I could

00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:27,390
call unless it's not sure yeah sure let

00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,280
me let me try something that's what

00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,500
happens when I do this okay nothing

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,900
that's perfect what happens when I do

00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:38,370
this nothing that's perfect what happens

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:43,830
when I do update no okay fair enough

00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:46,760
let's try this one and does it have like

00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:46,760
systems maybe

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:55,299
let's see no does not okay cool so the

00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:57,889
inspector is a component which is nice

00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:59,509
what kind of data does it have it only

00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,730
has a URL so that's not really helpful

00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:04,279
okay cool let's have a look at the

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,440
component in here because it must have

00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:07,850
some sort of myth so this is actually

00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:09,169
not part of the regular workshop but I

00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,369
think we can squeeze this one in because

00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:11,720
it's just going to be interesting to

00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:14,509
have a look at how these things actually

00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,999
work under the hood so let's have a look

00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:18,230
so we do have no those are the widgets

00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:21,259
so that's not gonna help us

00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,529
oh maybe oh this is a react thing isn't

00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:25,840
it

00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:27,859
ah but it has to at some point

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,559
visible aha

00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:33,649
well but that's not I don't think that's

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:36,859
that's helping toggle side part no

00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:39,889
that's not what I want to do mmm-hmm

00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:42,369
okay right I'm not exactly sure so let's

00:21:39,889 --> 00:21:45,879
that's Google this inspect a frame

00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:49,149
inspector without programmatically

00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:49,149
program yeah

00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:57,610
yeah

00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:08,609
aha wait actually I have an idea that's

00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:10,859
it that's a very good one and I think I

00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:13,679
have an idea actually let me give me a

00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:16,549
second view so because a co-worker of

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:21,179
mine did this button that shows it so

00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:23,999
maybe just maybe how does he do the

00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:28,109
button ah look at that

00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:29,639
so basically ahahahaha so instead of so

00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:31,409
the people who have problems with the

00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,849
key combination should probably be able

00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:38,369
to do the following thing and let me

00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:40,199
zoom in yeah so if you do like window

00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:43,409
dot post message inject a frame

00:22:40,199 --> 00:22:46,589
inspectors star that should apparently

00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:51,749
trigger the inspector as well I'm very

00:22:46,589 --> 00:22:54,569
sorry for that little detour window the

00:22:51,749 --> 00:22:56,819
post message to inject a frame inspector

00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:58,469
like this so this is woopsy where the

00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:02,389
hell jay all right here we go this is

00:22:58,469 --> 00:23:02,389
like the line that you want to go for

00:23:05,309 --> 00:23:09,519
so if if that is the workaround you have

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,169
to do because the keyboard key

00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,679
combination doesn't work then that's how

00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:16,239
you so anyone in this work yeah it does

00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:20,799
work so it does everyone have this

00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:22,239
wonderful dev tools open now yes good if

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,070
not let me know because now is the time

00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:25,179
to figure that one out so the nice thing

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,369
about the dev tools is they're like

00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:33,909
super handy and they show something that

00:23:27,369 --> 00:23:35,679
yes you don't write you needed this I

00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:36,509
guess it's that the one you're looking

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,009
for

00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:42,429
does it work for you if you do that in

00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:45,970
the comments of the console you're

00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:47,739
basically like you open the dev tools

00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:51,869
and then in there you should run this

00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:51,869
command and then it should give you the

00:23:52,529 --> 00:23:55,529
works

00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,000
look this thing is called bleeding edge

00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:10,710
because it you cut yourself every now

00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:18,450
and then so this is this is like the

00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:20,610
cuts you get does everyone have the

00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:24,380
inspector now or is there Excel still

00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,380
someone not having the inspector open

00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:46,680
everyone ready okay sweet so now again

00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,090
so these dev tools are building into a

00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,350
fem they're like super nice and they

00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:51,780
show us something that we didn't know

00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:54,240
because a frame is actually nice to us

00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,680
so I said early on if we wanted if we

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,170
want to think about what we're doing in

00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,210
terms of like 3d AR VR content in the

00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:02,520
web we're basically making a movie so we

00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:04,020
have an empty scene and we have a camera

00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,760
and we have a light and then we have

00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:09,660
objects which are called entities in a

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,760
frame now if you notice in our HTML we

00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,510
have only added an entity but we do not

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,160
have any light or any camera right we

00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,930
didn't do that but a frame is so nice

00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,340
and saying like well look if you don't

00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:22,230
have a camera you can't really have a

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,610
movie so people would be like super

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,950
annoyed by the fact that they are not

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:28,050
seeing anything so if you do not have

00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,770
any light or camera we're gonna add that

00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:31,200
for you

00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:34,020
so a frame make sure that we always have

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,780
at least like one light and one camera

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,520
available so what you see here is like

00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:41,640
this thing that looks like a bit weird

00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,350
like a star with a wide thing coming

00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,410
from it that's the camera so basically

00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:49,070
we are standing here and looking in that

00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:52,260
direction and everything within these

00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:53,760
these lines these orange lines is what

00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,740
we actually I'm not exactly sure

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,150
can I turn off the light in front of you

00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,240
because I think it's really hard to see

00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:01,700
isn't it let's see I don't know what's

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,590
gonna happen when I press on this

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:07,380
nothing that's awesome

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,730
nope nope I have no idea oh look at that

00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,100
here we go

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:13,210
magically it did the thing probably

00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,720
running java that's why the delay

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:18,490
to be anyway so you see like everything

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,059
in this box that looks like in this

00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,250
direction

00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:22,539
is visible everything else is outside of

00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:25,149
our field of view and that kind of

00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:27,070
mimics how humans like see we have this

00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:28,840
like field of vision and we're seeing

00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,640
like everything that is around here but

00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,649
if I put something here or under me I'm

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,110
not actually seeing it so what we have

00:26:32,649 --> 00:26:37,179
here is everything unless I give it an

00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:39,549
explicit position is that zero zero zero

00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:42,100
except for the camera which is a 1 meter

00:26:39,549 --> 00:26:44,140
60 in the air and that's because it goes

00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,210
like well okay in this case I have no

00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,710
information how how tall the user is I

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,500
don't know how tall you are until you

00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:52,809
tell me right so I'm assuming an adult

00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,880
is probably like the average adult is

00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:57,039
like one meter 60 so if I put your eyes

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,200
level on one meter 60 it kind of looks

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,090
like natural so it automatically moves

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,299
the camera up to one meter 60 above the

00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:06,070
ground our box is at zero zero zero by

00:27:04,299 --> 00:27:08,169
the way notice that the position that

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,880
something is is always the center of it

00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:12,190
well not always but in this case it is

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,690
in the center so the center point here

00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,980
in this box in the middle of the box is

00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:17,169
at zero zero zero

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:19,659
the box is below us we're not seeing it

00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:22,360
because we're on top of the box and also

00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:24,250
this white thing here that's a light

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,899
that's a light shining from this

00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,850
direction and you can see that it's

00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:29,320
slightly brighter here than here and

00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:33,909
that's because the lights coming from

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:36,100
this direction okay so we're not seeing

00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:38,470
anything right now because we are on top

00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:40,450
of the box but that means that if I use

00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:43,870
and again a frame gives us this for free

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:47,140
if I drag with my mouse I should be well

00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:48,820
why is it not showing okay whatever yeah

00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,640
this is the day oh I'm looking upwards

00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,940
now that was very smart Martin here we

00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,000
go

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:57,309
there it is right below us you can use

00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,500
WASD to actually move around as well

00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:02,110
this is also like a default from a frame

00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,460
so it gives you a reasonable default you

00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:07,419
can move around and then you see like

00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,919
the box here okay cool nice but if I

00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,600
reload I have the same problem

00:28:08,919 --> 00:28:14,200
I'm standing on top of it I'm not seeing

00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:16,570
anything right so so what's nice is in

00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,159
the in this developer tools it's not

00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,380
just like a way to actually look into

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,450
the scene but it also gives us a little

00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,700
bit of power so what happens if I click

00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,139
on the box you see that now that I

00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,070
clicked on the box a few things appear

00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:29,529
first things first as

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,909
like this blue box around the box this

00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:33,340
is called the bounding box and then you

00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:35,049
have like this this bunch of things here

00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,669
right so what happens when I press on

00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:38,500
this oh look at that I can move it

00:28:36,669 --> 00:28:41,259
around surprise surprise what happens if

00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,539
i push this oh I can move it around so

00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:45,820
we basically get a few controls that

00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,870
allow us to move The Box around and if I

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,399
go back to scene

00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:51,309
the box is now at the position where I

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:54,940
put it this is not the only thing that

00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:57,669
we can do so if you look here up here

00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:00,009
you see like there is there's a few

00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:02,080
things up here right now

00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:04,240
in blue is this one and that's because

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,480
we are in the moving mode so we can move

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,779
objects around like this but if we click

00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,820
here we get a different cursor we get

00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:14,769
this like weird lines around the object

00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:17,169
so now what we can do is we can rotate

00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:19,240
it around and you see that the box is

00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:21,220
merely there to show us like where's the

00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,080
where's the maximum distance from the

00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,549
from the middle point of this thing so

00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,919
basically like this is called a bounding

00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:32,019
box because it always surrounds the

00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:34,240
object as tightly as it can right

00:29:32,019 --> 00:29:36,639
let me move zoom out again so here we

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,440
are at this moment right so in the like

00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:43,779
wait you have the inspector open right

00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:47,110
yes so up here in the inspector there

00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:49,090
and I'm zooming in again we have these

00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:53,139
three buttons and it allows you to

00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:56,169
switch to rotation and it also allows

00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:59,289
you to scale so you can also go and if i

00:29:56,169 --> 00:30:02,940
zoom if i zoom out again you now have

00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:10,450
different controls again yes like you

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:12,389
don't get the inspector wait did you

00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:15,070
join us later or something or does this

00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:17,429
ride okay so does the scene look like

00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:20,110
this right now

00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:21,970
do you have removed the class hidden

00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:25,330
from AC because it was like this before

00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:28,000
and I think there's a CSS that actually

00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:30,370
then hides the scene so if you remove

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,070
that you should see the scene again and

00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,539
well now I undid all my changes so I'm

00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,299
just gonna quickly move things again

00:30:34,539 --> 00:30:40,750
like here and then I rotate this a

00:30:37,299 --> 00:30:42,730
little bit and now I can also scale it

00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:47,019
in all directions I can scale it like

00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:49,720
here and here and here or maybe not

00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:52,630
oops uh maybe not like that uh okay that

00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:56,340
was not the smartest plan I had to like

00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:59,889
scale it like weirdly here we go and

00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:01,539
then you have like the scene as you

00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:03,789
presented it so this is a very visual

00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:06,820
way of creating these things and this is

00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:08,289
convenient because it gives you other

00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,529
possibilities as well so first things

00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:13,870
first you can also see the position

00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:17,019
rotation and scale up here so if you in

00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:18,789
the upper right hand corner you have the

00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:21,039
current object that is selected you have

00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:23,289
the information of position rotation and

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,690
scale here as well along the three axes

00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:28,330
I think we haven't talked about the axis

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:29,289
system form for this moment so let's

00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:33,159
actually try that out

00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:34,809
so first axis is the x axis this is how

00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:40,360
far to the left and to the right it is

00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:43,240
in meters so one means it's one meter to

00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:46,330
the left or to the right minus one means

00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:50,200
one meter to the left from the from the

00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:53,409
middle which is like this line here so I

00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,809
can move that around like this or I can

00:31:53,409 --> 00:31:59,649
put it at minus two meters and then it's

00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:01,179
gonna be here I can also just enter the

00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:04,299
scale here and then it's gonna scale

00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:06,190
along the same three axes the rotation

00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:09,549
is sometimes a bit confusing but if you

00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:12,610
think about rotating around an axis you

00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:16,000
can I like or I remember it like this so

00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:19,659
we have the three axes we have the x

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,029
axis like this we have the y axis like

00:32:19,659 --> 00:32:25,539
this and we have the z axis negative

00:32:22,029 --> 00:32:29,110
values go sorry go into the screen

00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:31,570
positive values go towards the screen so

00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:34,629
if you want to think about how rotation

00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:37,659
works and we rotate around an axis if I

00:32:34,629 --> 00:32:39,669
rotate around the y axis so this is my

00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:41,799
axis that I rotate around basically I

00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:44,169
put like a skewer through me and then

00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:46,690
we'll play like that right

00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:51,279
if I rotate around the x-axis what's

00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:52,750
gonna happen correct like this if I

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,169
rotate around the z axis I'm gonna do

00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:56,299
like this weird

00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:58,639
monkey movement so this is how rotation

00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:01,609
works in the three axes and the axes are

00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:06,980
kind of like always the same so they

00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:09,429
follow the object wonderful the rotation

00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:13,929
order as far as I'm aware is yxz

00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:13,929
but I might be wrong it might be X Y Z

00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:22,179
luckily that is normally hidden behind

00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:25,070
the interface so yes okay cool great

00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:26,869
there's also some more stuff down here

00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,759
on the right hand side so what is there

00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:31,840
for instance is the actually I'm gonna

00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:35,029
just generally zoom in the page I think

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,769
what we also have here is like if it's

00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:38,960
visible or not so we can hide this

00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:41,059
object entirely by just clicking on it

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,759
you can also do the same thing here so

00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:45,350
that's like a shortcut you also see all

00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:46,580
the objects in the scene on the left

00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:49,460
hand side but we're gonna look into that

00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,289
in a second but we also see all the

00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,320
components individually listed here so

00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:56,450
this this box this entity here has like

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,210
a box geometry so like there's a

00:33:56,450 --> 00:34:03,009
geometry with a primitive box nice and

00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:06,889
it has a material that has a color of

00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:08,690
red nice so basically all these

00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:11,030
informations all the components are

00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,710
always going to be listed here so what

00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:14,690
we can do is we can also change things

00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:17,720
in here which is like super nice so for

00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:19,490
instance like a box is nice and fine and

00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,770
I'm probably gonna reset like the the

00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:24,799
orientation and the scale and I'm gonna

00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:26,329
put it at like zero zero minus two so I

00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:28,220
put it minus two meters

00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:30,829
sorry yeah two meters into the screen so

00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:32,809
that it's like in front of me actually

00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:35,569
let's put that into code how do we do

00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:38,210
that again position is a special kind of

00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:40,069
component but it's a component and it

00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:41,629
takes a position in X Y Z so they say

00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:43,639
like nothing to the no meters to the

00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:46,609
left or to the right no me just to up or

00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:49,220
down and minus two meters so like minus

00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:51,470
two meters out of the screen or two

00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:52,970
meters into the screen the box by

00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:54,770
default is one meter by one meter so

00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:56,659
it's gonna be well in the screen right

00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:58,490
now so if we reload we see like down

00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:00,619
here and the fact that we have to look

00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:03,290
down on it is because we are one meter

00:35:00,619 --> 00:35:06,230
60 high right our eyes are not on the

00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,770
ground so you could also if you want to

00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:09,510
let's let's do that let's

00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:11,810
looks a bit more boring but let's do

00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:16,170
that we couldn't put it on one meter 60

00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:18,120
y X Adam Y and then we have it like on a

00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:20,190
level so this box is now on a level

00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,020
wonderful but what we can do when we

00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:26,400
select the box and go into the geometry

00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:29,130
component we can change the primitive so

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:33,870
for instance we can use a cylinder or we

00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:36,060
can use a dodecahedron whatever we can

00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:37,800
use pretty much everything that 3GS

00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:41,700
comes with and there's a bunch of them a

00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:43,680
sphere a torus yeah let's have a donut a

00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,410
torus not which is like the least useful

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:51,420
thing ever but it looks kind of fancy so

00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:53,880
here we go yeah it's the pretzel of 3d

00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:58,860
or the pile of poo depends a little bit

00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:00,840
on the perspective so we can do that and

00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:04,460
we can do that for all the components so

00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:07,200
big a CV we can change like the the

00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:09,390
parameters here which for the tourists

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,580
are not very intuitive for the material

00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:13,140
it's a little easier so I can for

00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:15,420
instance click on the color in the

00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:19,200
material component and say I don't like

00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:26,000
red I want this to be bluish like this

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:28,740
and maybe I want this to be I don't know

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,080
like super shiny so let's set that to

00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:37,110
like one and then you get like the super

00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:40,620
shiny torus not in blue or maybe you

00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:43,560
want the wireframe you know optics so

00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:47,270
now this looks more likely I don't know

00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:52,020
90s things that you would see on screen

00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:54,270
nice that's pretty good so you can

00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:55,920
basically control everything in here but

00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:58,050
now the problem is if I reload I lose

00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,670
all that right and I don't want to type

00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:02,070
everything out that I change down here

00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,660
so that's like super annoying so I have

00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,390
a bunch of possibilities to make that

00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,950
easier for me one possibility is I can

00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,600
just copy the attributes of one

00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:12,060
individual component if I only made

00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,650
changes to one of them but I didn't I

00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,090
actually changed the entire component

00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,790
like where it's positioned and

00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:19,110
everything I can change that like this

00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:21,570
maybe I want to move it over here and

00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:23,820
then there's this button over here

00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:26,430
that allows me to either download the

00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,600
thing as an as a file or just copy it to

00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:31,620
clipboard and that's what I'm gonna do

00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:34,830
and copy this to clipboard and if I now

00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:36,840
go back into my code and say okay I want

00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,360
to put this in here then you see like it

00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,460
puts all the things it's quite a bit but

00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,560
it's it puts all the things into our

00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,530
code I'm gonna make this a little more

00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,330
readable by putting these below each

00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:51,150
other so that it's nicer to actually

00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:52,740
read this but this is nice because I no

00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:55,830
longer have to like remember these

00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:58,440
values I can just copy this around and

00:37:55,830 --> 00:38:00,090
let's say if I if I change just the

00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,220
material because I don't want this to be

00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:06,210
a wireframe anymore I can open the

00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:09,470
inspector again click on the object go

00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:13,260
to material and say wireframe no and

00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:15,000
then go back up and say copy a trip

00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:18,090
notes that was the wrong one copy

00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,410
attributes and put just the attributes

00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,510
in here so basically I couldn't go like

00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:25,680
no I don't want this I want

00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:27,270
oops ah the problem with this is

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,040
basically like copies he had an entire

00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:37,200
thing which is a bit of a bug but ok

00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:39,420
let's let's not get into that yes that

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,610
yeah exactly like copying everything is

00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,320
usually not the best idea because it has

00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:45,210
exactly this problem because under the

00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:47,370
hood so this is an interesting thing for

00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:51,180
performance reasons under the hood job a

00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:52,710
frame uses objects in the attributes so

00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,600
it overrides the set up tribute and get

00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:57,150
a tribute methods but obviously the Dom

00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,190
only supports like strings so it has to

00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:01,170
like wrap between the two so sometimes

00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:03,750
this leads to a bit of confusion between

00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:06,660
what the Dom needs to see and what FMC's

00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:08,520
but normally that's not a big of bigger

00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,380
not a bigger problem but like I'm

00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,780
actually materials like the worst thing

00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,550
because it has so many objects in its

00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,800
properties anyway

00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:18,330
cool so now we have like our two objects

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,430
here and we have we know how to like

00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:22,710
copy it to and from but it's kind of

00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:25,710
boring is like we have about how many

00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:28,920
primitives do we have we have like 10 12

00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:30,420
maybe I don't know see like one actually

00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,079
let's start from from the top actually

00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,069
one two

00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:36,599
three four five six yeah I don't know

00:39:35,069 --> 00:39:38,910
it doesn't scroll anymore that's nice

00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:40,859
it's like maybe like twelve or something

00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,390
like that or maybe twenty who knows but

00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:45,150
it's not that terribly exciting so let's

00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:49,499
let add some more interesting things for

00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:51,029
instance if you wanna have a background

00:39:49,499 --> 00:39:53,160
color because right now this is white

00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:56,069
because the page is white and if we

00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,039
would go into the page with obser that

00:39:56,069 --> 00:40:03,599
was the wrong keyboard combination ctrl

00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:06,390
shift well whatever I thought ah give me

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,039
my freaking dev tools come on if I would

00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:12,569
go to the body and give it a background

00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:14,160
color of let's say background green then

00:40:12,569 --> 00:40:15,749
this is this is not nice this is

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,609
actually convenient for AR because

00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:19,140
basically the scene is transparent so it

00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:21,239
takes whatever color is behind it so if

00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,799
we would have to have a an AR

00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:23,910
application we would take the camera

00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:25,940
picture and just put it in the

00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,499
background

00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:31,200
but this is not quite what we want right

00:40:28,499 --> 00:40:33,059
I don't want the page behind to dictate

00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:40,969
what I'm gonna see so what we do instead

00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:40,969
is we create a new entity sky

00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:49,650
and I think there's I think sky blue is

00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:54,000
supported let's see if it is no it's not

00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:56,220
grayed out no bigger and I'm doing this

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,039
mistake I keep making this mistake it's

00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:04,890
a material color sky blue and I think

00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:06,269
sky blue support it should be well you

00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,890
know what I'm actually not sure that I'm

00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:10,170
not using the sky that often so there's

00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:11,430
actually a thing that I try to not show

00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:14,279
you but let's let's do it anyways

00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:15,960
there's usually a direct variation of

00:41:14,279 --> 00:41:19,259
these components that isn't used like

00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,150
this so you can do a sky as well and

00:41:19,259 --> 00:41:22,410
then you can do actually like sky blue

00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,119
and I'm pretty sure that I'm should be

00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:27,839
getting the sky blue background yes now

00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:30,420
I do so you can do that and what it does

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:33,809
is it puts a really really really large

00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:36,299
sphere around us a gigantic sphere like

00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:38,339
the sky would be a sphere around the

00:41:36,299 --> 00:41:39,779
earth which is obviously not true but

00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:41,700
you know there's like Hollow Earth

00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:43,380
people that think that's the true thing

00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,779
but let's not talk about them too much

00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:53,660
so we can't give this as a color and

00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:53,660
that's nice so yes that's a good start

00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:05,160
but we can also put an image onto this

00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:06,839
now it might not make sense to put any

00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,940
image because what we really want to do

00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:12,329
is we want to put a 360-degree image so

00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:14,640
let me actually I have a I might have to

00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:18,499
take a turn on the lights again I have a

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:23,069
little 360 degree camera with me

00:42:18,499 --> 00:42:24,779
that is the Ricoh theta s and I hope

00:42:23,069 --> 00:42:26,640
that it's charged because I charged it

00:42:24,779 --> 00:42:28,380
yesterday but I'm never sure if there if

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,690
the outlet because my adapters a little

00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:36,539
wonky and you know long story short is

00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:42,170
 so let's turn on the light ah Java

00:42:36,539 --> 00:42:46,200
has had a hot cache and it's pretty good

00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:47,880
so this thing requires me to connect my

00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,719
phone to this particular Wi-Fi that its

00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:55,140
Bonnie don't get me started and here we

00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:56,940
go and I can take the app connected no

00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:59,969
internet no really my phone my camera

00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:02,309
does not have internet how die is it so

00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:03,539
let's see it's gonna look like super

00:43:02,309 --> 00:43:05,489
weird because my hands are gonna look

00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,940
like gigantic probably but it's gonna be

00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:10,829
fine

00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:15,269
so say jeez that was it

00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:19,219
it's super exciting isn't it so I get a

00:43:15,269 --> 00:43:21,539
360-degree picture from us which is nice

00:43:19,219 --> 00:43:23,479
transferring then I have to upload it to

00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:26,190
the cloud to download it to my computer

00:43:23,479 --> 00:43:29,519
share it with everyone because that's

00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:35,219
how technology works in 2018

00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:38,430
isn't it exciting so let's let's connect

00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:44,039
to the actual Wi-Fi that we want to use

00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:45,569
here shangri-la come on well no don't

00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:49,249
forget the Wi-Fi connect to the Wi-Fi

00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:51,719
you bastard and ok seems to be connected

00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:54,059
does the thing do the thing that I

00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:57,140
wanted to do let's see if it's uploaded

00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:57,140
in my photos already

00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:04,500
let's go up yeah yeah has already

00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:07,440
uploaded to the cloud that's amazing so

00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:10,020
I'll quickly go to my other browser and

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,640
go to photos I hope that I don't have

00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,980
any incriminating photos anywhere near

00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,810
here and here we have like this gigantic

00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:19,500
image and I'm gonna download it and show

00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:20,970
you how it looks like by itself so this

00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,530
is the this is how the image looks like

00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:25,230
and it looks a bit weird you see like

00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:27,180
it's like stretched here and it's like

00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,190
stretched there my hand looks like I

00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:33,089
have the an arm of like ten meters

00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:38,339
length or something so yeah let's let's

00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:42,060
put that on glitch which is where's my

00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:44,750
other window here so I can upload it and

00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:48,150
then I can share the link with you all

00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:53,280
we get computer and this is the image

00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:55,710
that I just took it's gonna be a super

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,960
long URL so what I'm gonna do is listen

00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:59,609
carefully now because I had so many

00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,890
problems with what's gonna happen in a

00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:05,099
second what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:08,069
put the link in a link shortener however

00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:10,470
that link shortener does not work as a

00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:12,510
source for the texture so what you want

00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:14,550
to do is you want to click on the short

00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:16,980
link that I'm gonna share with you take

00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:19,740
the long URL and copy that into your

00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,960
iframes scene again if you use the short

00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:25,079
URL into in your AFM scene it's not

00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,790
gonna work I'm just gonna use it so that

00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:28,589
we have a better experience and using

00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:31,920
the gigantic URL that this is gonna give

00:45:28,589 --> 00:45:33,750
me unless you want to type that out so

00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,599
let's go to like I don't know I'll you

00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:39,270
know goo dog cos I don't think they need

00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:42,890
a root registration I'm not a robot go

00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:45,780
away good thank you

00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:48,300
here we go so this is the URL that you

00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:52,680
want to want to copy over I may actually

00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:54,900
you know that so this is the one you do

00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:57,660
not put that into your iframe scene you

00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:59,250
click on that link or put that link into

00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:01,890
your address bar and you get the longer

00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:04,200
version back and the long link is what

00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:10,069
we need the long URL is what you want to

00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:15,389
copy very important

00:46:10,069 --> 00:46:17,659
yes sure I'm sorry yes of course I can

00:46:15,389 --> 00:46:17,659
do that

00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:21,769
there we go

00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:42,330
all right all done everyone got the

00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:44,360
terrible long URL that we are looking

00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:47,100
for wonderful

00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,600
so the terrible long URL and I'm just

00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,190
gonna check if it actually does yeah it

00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:54,900
automatically replaces with the long URL

00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:56,820
so what we do is I don't need that

00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,220
anymore because I want to be back in my

00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:01,440
HTML so instead of saying color what we

00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,930
can do is we can give it a source SRC

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:08,330
like an image would get a source and we

00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:08,330
can copy in or paste in that long URL

00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:20,980
and then so basically a sky source SRC

00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:25,630
equals and then this long URL we're

00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:30,400
gonna get this and we can turn around

00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:33,510
and hi everyone how are y'all doing

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,730
yeah I can't wave back in VR just yet

00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:38,170
bar all right so yes and you can do that

00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:39,490
with pretty much any of these pictures

00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,950
these pictures are called a Cree

00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:43,619
rectangular pictures because basically

00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:48,070
what you're doing is you take a

00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:49,630
360-degree sphere and you unroll that on

00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:51,550
to basically you take like you have to

00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,930
imagine like wrapping a balloon in a

00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,970
piece of paper and then rolling that

00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:55,869
down to like this the plain piece of

00:47:54,970 --> 00:48:00,250
paper again

00:47:55,869 --> 00:48:03,100
so as this the sky is a gigantic sphere

00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:06,250
and this picture was a gigantic sphere

00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:07,960
it lines up perfectly it's just we just

00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:11,859
have to put it on as a texture and it

00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:13,510
looks like the right thing and by the

00:48:11,859 --> 00:48:15,880
way if you were wondering like this is a

00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:17,500
VR workshop why are we not doing VR why

00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,240
are we typing things into our computer

00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,400
and looking at our computer the reason

00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:24,190
for that is a it's really hard to get

00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:28,180
enough devices like we have a few to try

00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:29,859
out in them in a moment but also it's

00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:31,450
like super inconvenient to debug most of

00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:33,520
the times because you have to put it

00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:35,170
into like a USB and then you have to get

00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,250
like the remote debugger working and all

00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,530
that kind of stuff and then you're like

00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:40,300
oh it's not looking right so it is

00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:41,800
it is better than we'd like unity or on

00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,810
on any of these because you don't have

00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,609
to like compile anything beforehand but

00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:48,640
it's still like a little an easy and the

00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:50,440
good thing is a frame is responsive so

00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,810
you see like this this is a button down

00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,460
here but I don't have a VR headset right

00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:57,310
now right so if I click that it just

00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:59,920
goes into full screen mode nice if I

00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:02,260
would have a device that has a like a

00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,910
phone if I would have a haven't done it

00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,890
on the phone it would automatically

00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:08,560
figure out like oh I can do VR with this

00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:10,180
and basically I show you an actual VR

00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,490
picture and use the actual device

00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,170
orientation to look around so like it is

00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:15,940
responsive to the device that you're on

00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:19,570
so basically all you're seeing here in

00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:22,210
non VR you can try out later in VR with

00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:24,040
no additional magic and that's the

00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:25,710
beauty of it right and it only works on

00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,480
like HTC vive if it works on

00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:30,900
Kilis rift it works on cardboard it

00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:35,220
works on gear VR it works on daydream it

00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:37,770
works on Windows mixed reality headsets

00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:39,089
not the hololens though i'm working on

00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:42,150
that with microsoft it's gonna be an

00:49:39,089 --> 00:49:44,130
interesting journey so yeah basically

00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:46,470
all the other VR headsets that are out

00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:48,869
there on the market do support or most

00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:50,250
of them support web PR and a frame just

00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:52,470
works with them without having to do

00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:55,560
like any magic so basically we are

00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:58,290
settled when we got 3d right on the

00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:00,000
screen we have done for VR as well and

00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:01,530
we're gonna explore that in a bit like I

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,490
have a few headsets here that you can

00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:07,349
try with your phones okay right so this

00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:09,780
this is nice as well so cool yeah we

00:50:07,349 --> 00:50:11,550
have a 360-degree picture but you see

00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,410
like if I'm if I'm now I'm moving around

00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:15,180
with WASD but it doesn't look like I'm

00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:17,940
moving around and that's because the sky

00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:19,050
is gigantic right so like you see that

00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:20,369
I'm actually moving around but the

00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:22,320
picture in the background does not move

00:50:20,369 --> 00:50:24,780
and the reason for that is that the sky

00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,339
is like I don't even know how large it

00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,230
is probably like 10,000 meters or

00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:30,359
something or maybe a thousand meters and

00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:32,160
in size so if you think about it if you

00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:35,280
would be walking on a field and it's

00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,080
like a tree a kilometer away and you

00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:39,030
walk toward it it's not gonna be like oh

00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,250
my god the tree is gonna move so much

00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,720
because that's the parallax that we get

00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:43,530
in our perception that things that are

00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,240
farther away

00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:47,280
I'm not moving as much as things that

00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,500
are closer by so that's why this is

00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,270
actually like motion is working in it

00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:55,530
but you're not really seeing it because

00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:57,720
the sky is so huge but you know let's

00:50:55,530 --> 00:51:00,960
let's try some more interesting 3d

00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:04,320
objects so how can we get 3d objects

00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,330
well you have to be coming through the

00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,589
artists no just kidding you should you

00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:09,240
should though because it's like a super

00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:10,650
interesting experience and I can highly

00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,300
recommend it and it's not as hard as it

00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:15,869
looks to be honest it's like it's not

00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:17,760
too complicated but we're gonna do it

00:51:15,869 --> 00:51:21,089
easier we're gonna get our scripts back

00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,320
so I suggest that actually no you know

00:51:21,089 --> 00:51:26,040
what we're gonna start with the first

00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:28,680
script first so this is like a shameless

00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:31,170
plug because this is what the company I

00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,880
work for archaeologic builds this thing

00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:37,050
where it's a platform that we build for

00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,670
you to build VR AR and 3d applications

00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:41,940
for architecture

00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:43,770
and interior design and what we are

00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:45,810
trying to do is make your life easier

00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:47,100
and we started our journey with an

00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:48,510
experiment and we're going to show you

00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:51,660
in a second what that experiment is

00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:53,370
going to look like so here's my scene

00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:55,980
nothing has changed nothing new has

00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:59,070
appeared except what happens if I open

00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,930
the inspector do you notice a difference

00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:03,120
probably not because it's like super

00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:07,920
subtle because we're not like marketing

00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:09,840
dicks so up here in the sidebar there's

00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:13,920
a new button that hasn't been there

00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:16,170
before it's the 3d dot IO button and we

00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,150
did that to make your life a little

00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,410
easier so what I can do is I can click

00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:22,260
on it and I get this wonderful little

00:52:19,410 --> 00:52:24,810
menu here and AHA this is interesting

00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:28,050
there's a bunch of stuff one of them

00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:30,600
being poly Google calm so Google has

00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:32,670
built a few applications and that allow

00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:36,650
you to create 3d content really easily

00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:38,970
in VR boom one of them is tilt brush

00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:41,490
actually tilt brush costs money now so

00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:43,290
I'm not that happy about it but um it's

00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:44,400
like twenty dollars or something but

00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,380
it's really worth it because basically

00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,500
what it is it's like paint but in 3d

00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:51,240
space so you get like a brush and then

00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,490
you can just say I like painting and you

00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:56,580
can paint with fire and water and stuff

00:52:53,490 --> 00:53:00,870
I mean you can paint with fire at home

00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:03,360
once maybe but in VR it's a lot safer so

00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:05,250
that's like nice and then you can export

00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,660
that to like their platform which is

00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:08,160
called poly and there's also another

00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:11,100
thing that's called Google blocks and

00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:12,540
it's like basic like you NVR when you

00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:15,090
have a bunch of primitive shapes like

00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:17,310
spheres and boxes and basically what if

00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:18,570
a fem has its primitives as well and you

00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:20,100
just like put them here and then you

00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,390
drag them up and then you remove bits

00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:23,820
and pieces and then you color them in

00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:25,740
and hey you have a car or a house or

00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:30,690
whatever so we can like look for

00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:34,170
something like horse so this is stuff

00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:39,930
that people create it Wow okay this is

00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:42,480
underwhelming let's try three okay

00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:43,800
better but still not good and here we're

00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,490
actually gonna see like one of the

00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:48,900
biggest problems with these objects so

00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:50,610
if we click on this tree for instance

00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,150
I'm taking like the first one that I get

00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:54,819
here tree by and I'm

00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:57,430
unfortunate whoops okay hi projector how

00:53:54,819 --> 00:53:59,799
are you doing I'm clicking on the first

00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:02,650
tree that I got and it's gonna say like

00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:06,059
loading and it's gonna load and hey

00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:11,559
here's a tree do you see the tree it is

00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:13,329
tiny as and and that's exactly my

00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:15,250
problem with this kind of stuffs like

00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:17,680
where's my okay I have like this is a

00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:20,559
tree come on

00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:22,270
and it gets better so I'm not blaming

00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,849
the author the problem is like 3d

00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:26,980
modeling is actually hard and we see why

00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:28,750
it's hard here so first things first you

00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:30,789
might see a weird what the hell is going

00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:32,440
on with the protector you might want to

00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:35,109
see you might see a thing that it's like

00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:39,549
a little odd which is like I'm here on

00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:42,220
the object but the the cursor is here ha

00:54:39,549 --> 00:54:44,230
what the heck has happened so now I

00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:45,640
might go like oh this is not a problem

00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:47,079
I can make the tree larger so let's

00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:52,150
let's try scaling up the tree so let's

00:54:47,079 --> 00:54:53,559
say like 2 2 2 double the size hmm did

00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:54,010
that actually scale it up I don't think

00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:58,059
so

00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:59,440
let's try like 4 4 4 what the hell is

00:54:58,059 --> 00:55:01,210
going on okay now it's not actually

00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,750
because I'm scaling the light okay that

00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:06,069
was fun so that's like okay still we

00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:07,900
have a bit of a problem here because you

00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:11,799
see like the cursor is not where the

00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:13,270
action am I am I am i killing the

00:55:11,799 --> 00:55:15,849
projector with like it too high of a

00:55:13,270 --> 00:55:19,170
resolution or something let's let's

00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:21,849
scale to whatever it says it has

00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:25,180
hopefully that's gonna fix the graphics

00:55:21,849 --> 00:55:26,770
problems okay anyway um so yeah you see

00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:28,329
the cursor is not where the actual three

00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:31,180
years and if I now start scaling it up

00:55:28,329 --> 00:55:38,400
just watch just watch where the thing is

00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:42,520
- to - good pie tree has been a fun ride

00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:44,109
by and why is that like what the hell is

00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:47,589
happening is there's a problem with a

00:55:44,109 --> 00:55:49,150
frame no the problem how this is so

00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:52,150
weird to have yourself in the background

00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:53,980
okay whatever no this is not a problem

00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,710
coming from a frame this is actually a

00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:58,660
problem with the 3d models and

00:55:55,710 --> 00:56:01,359
unfortunately a lot of 3d artists don't

00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:02,770
know this either so a lot of 3d artists

00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:04,390
come from a background where you are

00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:06,549
making it look nice when you

00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:08,349
render an image so they're like yeah and

00:56:06,549 --> 00:56:10,029
I have this object here it looks perfect

00:56:08,349 --> 00:56:11,680
from my camera and they're all it's

00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:13,059
great and I just put it on the internet

00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:15,220
and people can download it and then have

00:56:13,059 --> 00:56:16,569
fun with it but there's a few things

00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:18,130
that they don't know they simply don't

00:56:16,569 --> 00:56:19,510
know because no one tells them and we

00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:21,549
are actually fixing that right now by

00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:23,349
having like a guide for a 3d artist

00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:26,589
student to not make these mistakes and

00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:29,049
one of them is the origin of the 3d

00:56:26,589 --> 00:56:31,269
program should be the orange like the

00:56:29,049 --> 00:56:32,859
middle of your object if you're not

00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:34,299
doing that then you have the the

00:56:32,859 --> 00:56:37,180
weirdest problems just imagine it like

00:56:34,299 --> 00:56:40,990
this let me let me show you something so

00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:43,869
if I take this water bottle and I model

00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:46,359
it in a 3d program then I have a

00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:47,769
coordinate system in the 3d program and

00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:49,630
I have a coordinate system in a frame

00:56:47,769 --> 00:56:52,000
for instance so we could start with like

00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:54,250
if I'm now let's say I'm a smart 3d

00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,569
artist and I put my zero zero zero it's

00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,039
right in the middle of the bottle right

00:56:55,569 --> 00:56:58,450
right in the middle I can't actually I

00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:02,019
put my finger actually I can't put my

00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:06,430
finger in its right it's right here oh

00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:09,210
that was inappropriate anyway so like my

00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:11,650
ball is right here so now if I if I

00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:13,869
rotate it I'm gonna rotate it around

00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:16,210
this point and everything will be

00:57:13,869 --> 00:57:18,460
exactly as I expected but what happens

00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:21,930
if my zero zero zero is here and my

00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:24,640
bottle is here what do you think happens

00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:26,529
that's the right gesture so I'm still

00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:29,799
rotating around this point but now my

00:57:26,529 --> 00:57:33,759
bottle in my scene goes way and you're

00:57:29,799 --> 00:57:35,980
like no that was no that was not exactly

00:57:33,759 --> 00:57:37,509
what I wanted to do and scaling has the

00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:39,460
same problem when you've scaled all the

00:57:37,509 --> 00:57:41,579
math is wrong and then it scales like in

00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:43,539
a different direction you're like no

00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:44,680
this should not have happened so it

00:57:43,539 --> 00:57:47,140
should always be like in the middle

00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:49,329
where at zero zero zero in your 3d

00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:54,220
editing program and you should also take

00:57:49,329 --> 00:57:57,519
care of the scaling poly and paint brush

00:57:54,220 --> 00:58:00,279
tip brush and what's the other thing

00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:03,160
called blocks do not give you a hint on

00:58:00,279 --> 00:58:05,440
the scale so the problem is like 3d

00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:08,890
programs use units and units mean

00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:10,990
whatever you think they mean now 99% of

00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:12,759
the people on the world say one unit is

00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:15,099
one meter because it's an easier system

00:58:12,759 --> 00:58:17,049
to work with than like inches and feet

00:58:15,099 --> 00:58:17,980
and stuff but some people just don't

00:58:17,049 --> 00:58:19,359
care

00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:20,470
because when you render something I'm

00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:22,089
actually going to show you something

00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:23,859
real quick

00:58:22,089 --> 00:58:25,660
I just wanted because I basically just

00:58:23,859 --> 00:58:27,609
recently learned 3d modeling from a

00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:30,369
co-worker of mine and I made all the

00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:32,410
mistakes myself so I can show you what's

00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:34,300
what's wrong with people making 3d

00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:36,040
models and it's not like I'm not blaming

00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:38,290
them because the tools are just not

00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,940
helping so let's say I want to create

00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:41,890
something this is blender this is one of

00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:43,630
the 3d editing software's but you don't

00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:45,520
have to install it I just wanted to show

00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:48,130
you something real quick so I can create

00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:57,510
a cube core now can you tell me how

00:58:48,130 --> 00:59:00,820
large this cube is one by one by one

00:58:57,510 --> 00:59:04,210
whatever that's correct and the thing is

00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:06,280
like I don't even I unlike blender is a

00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:07,630
magical tool of wonder that can do all

00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,160
the things and the interface is really

00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:13,599
powerful because you can do things like

00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:15,550
this and I'm like what so it's like it's

00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,960
actually it's not that hard to work with

00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:19,599
blender surprisingly even though it

00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:21,760
might look like that it's actually not

00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,770
that that dangerous or tricky to work

00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:25,390
with it is actually kind of nice but the

00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:27,280
problem is you have no indication of

00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:28,630
what the units are so you have to like

00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,369
in the somewhere in the settings is

00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:32,380
actually well hidden and I'm honestly

00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:45,300
I'm not sure if I'm gonna find it today

00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:45,300
so let's see yeah so hi pretty good you

00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:53,370
[Laughter]

01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:11,680
think they brought some in back there

01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:15,010
somewhere yeah we also have whenever he

01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:21,190
allows you to do that you can join us at

01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:25,140
the hack attack I'm not holding you

01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:25,140
hostage just FYI

01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:30,220
coffee there which is really nice and we

01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:31,780
have a cocktail robot there cocktail a

01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:33,520
little next to our coats and it wasn't

01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:35,350
one of them are on Twitter and Facebook

01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:38,110
so if you're not following us yet is

01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:39,880
calm patience dangle and get the QR code

01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:42,190
hold it in front of the robots and it

01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:51,310
will make you a cocktail mocktails for

01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:52,930
now I think so that is about it would

01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:58,090
you mind standing there and I take a

01:00:52,930 --> 01:01:00,280
picture oh damn it all of this all this

01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:10,560
really exactly you missed our 360-degree

01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:12,220
picture it's like freaking photo ops

01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,710
thank you

01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:16,540
yeah yeah like seriously I'm not holding

01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:18,790
you hostage so if you you know want to

01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:20,710
have a coffee go ahead as I'm kind of

01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:23,610
like digressing anyways so yeah you see

01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:26,410
like the problem is if I would do this

01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:29,050
and I might even like like put it

01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:30,730
somewhere here and then move my camera

01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:32,560
somewhere and then like start rendering

01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:34,210
it like this and I'm like ya know this

01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:38,470
looks good this is exactly how I want it

01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:40,720
but if I then export this to to a 3d

01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:42,820
file then it's all wrong because you can

01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:46,450
you can tell if I go to the top level

01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:49,150
view that if I would now rotate it in a

01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:51,100
frame this being my zero zero zero it

01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:54,220
would like do this entire like bananas

01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:57,310
crazy movement around a Sun that doesn't

01:01:54,220 --> 01:02:00,070
exist and and that's like really really

01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:02,050
hard to get right so yet bear that in

01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:04,510
mind when you download things from the

01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:06,760
Internet's learn at least the minimum

01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:09,640
blender you need to actually fix models

01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:11,110
so like let's say like I'm actually

01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:13,720
gonna show you this just real quick

01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:15,640
because it's not that hard so let's say

01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,830
we we downloaded this wonderful model

01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,030
and it's not in the right position what

01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:22,240
you definitely want to do is you want to

01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:23,980
put your camera on the top and probably

01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:28,090
disable perspective so that's a little

01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:31,120
easier and then you can use G like grab

01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:33,250
and then move it to the center like this

01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:35,200
obviously that's not always that easy

01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:36,910
there's actually better way actually I

01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,350
made a video with a co-worker of mine

01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:38,740
I'm probably gonna share the link on my

01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:41,800
tour

01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:43,240
account later on because we explain this

01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,790
in much much more detail and then you

01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:47,770
would go like to the front and you see

01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:50,500
that gets too far up so I actually got

01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:52,420
now gonna gonna move it down and now

01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:56,080
this is this is nicer to work with for

01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:58,030
artists or sorry for for programmers but

01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:59,710
anyway that's a video that explains it

01:02:58,030 --> 01:03:01,540
now that I think about it let's ignore

01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:02,860
that but basically what we want to do is

01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,360
we want to have like models that have

01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:06,580
the right scale so we don't have to

01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,990
scale them up we have the right rotation

01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:10,150
so we don't have to rotate them that

01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:12,280
much and that are centered around the

01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:14,440
origins that we don't have these weird

01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:16,960
behaviors so Polly is not the best

01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:18,100
source for this unfortunately and now by

01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:19,990
the way we're doing a little trick here

01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:21,550
so you see like all the objects in the

01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:23,560
scene are on the left hand side so we

01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:24,610
can click the little trash can icon and

01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:31,270
off we go

01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:33,040
goodbye a little tree not that easily it

01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:35,650
is possible it's just like a lot of

01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:38,260
gymnastics and it is just easier to fix

01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:42,160
it and it's not worth it we also have

01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:44,050
like other things in in in our wonderful

01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:46,230
little plugin so here we have the

01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:48,310
furniture library and the staff picks

01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:50,760
staff pics are basically we have a

01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:54,940
service and it's it's for free actually

01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:57,840
we have a service that allows you to to

01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:59,410
get a 3d model from the floor plan

01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,090
obviously we're not going to show

01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:03,130
everyone's floor plans here but we have

01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:04,630
like a few 3d modes that we created for

01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:06,250
instance like the Big Bang Theory

01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:10,390
apartment and you can just drag and drop

01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:13,630
it in and boom here you have it and if I

01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:16,300
now go back to the scene I am standing

01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:18,880
in okay this is weird let's go inside

01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:22,300
whoops where am i right now

01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:25,840
oh there's a gigantic thing in here yeah

01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:28,240
talk about scale right hi so this is

01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:31,150
this is to scale this is Sheldon's spot

01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:33,970
and stuff like that so this is scaled

01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:36,609
correctly and it is normally aligned to

01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:38,560
the axes and it is nice to work with and

01:04:36,609 --> 01:04:41,830
then you can just just drag-and-drop

01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:43,570
things in and export them like the other

01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:45,250
things let me actually remove like some

01:04:43,570 --> 01:04:48,190
of my stuff here because it's like super

01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:52,480
annoying let's get rid of the sky as

01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:55,780
well and let's get rid of the

01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:58,360
- goodbye box so what we can do then is

01:04:55,780 --> 01:05:00,250
we can click here you can click on the

01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:02,190
little duplicate here to make it appear

01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:05,050
more than once or what it can also do is

01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:07,180
over here on the right hand side outside

01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:07,930
of what the projector shows so it's

01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:11,500
amazing

01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:18,610
let's see pop so we can copy this again

01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:20,770
copy go into our editor go away go into

01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:23,020
our editor I'm gonna remove the sky here

01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:25,420
as well and I'm gonna remove these two

01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:28,060
primitives as well and then if I paste

01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:32,200
this I get like Gupta I get the a entity

01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:35,140
and now if we are coming back here then

01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:39,370
we are back in the in the apartment

01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:40,900
of Big Bang Theory that same thing works

01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:42,520
with the furniture library so if you

01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:45,600
only need a single piece of furniture so

01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:47,770
let me remove this gigantic pieces of

01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,270
architecture and just like load one

01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:54,220
piece of furniture let's say like I

01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:56,050
wonder so far I can select so far and I

01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:58,300
like this sofa a lot so I'm gonna pick

01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:59,860
it and these are actually real furniture

01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:03,100
pieces and you can tell like that the

01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:06,580
scale makes sense we could sit down on

01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:09,640
this one and if I put like I don't know

01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:10,930
do we have plants I don't I don't know

01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:15,520
I've never tried this let's see what

01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:20,320
happens ha we do have plants that's nice

01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:22,630
a little greenery and you see that you

01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:25,000
like the bounding box fits correctly and

01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:27,670
the the cursors at the right position

01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,530
and I can just like drag-and-drop things

01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:31,420
next to it and they look like they are

01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:33,550
reasonably sized if you think about it

01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:35,470
so far this like little palm tree why

01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:39,610
would you put like such a tree in or

01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:41,350
whatever like this looks reasonable and

01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:46,240
you can import them really easily into

01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:49,360
your a-frame scene so that's nice but

01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:53,040
you can do other things so like what I

01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:58,420
like to do is like 3d free 3d model

01:06:53,040 --> 01:07:00,730
gives you a bunch of 3d warehouses they

01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:02,680
are called sometimes you can also paint

01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:04,600
it like please please please if you see

01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,460
a nice 2d model just pay the artist it's

01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:07,410
worth it

01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:10,829
mm-hm but there's a bunch of free stuff

01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:14,369
available as well but what you want to

01:07:10,829 --> 01:07:16,650
do is consider performance performance

01:07:14,369 --> 01:07:18,839
is always a bit of a problem when you

01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:20,880
have lots of objects so you want to

01:07:18,839 --> 01:07:24,980
probably try the low poly things if

01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:27,420
possible and like how do I put this

01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:30,450
depending on what you want to do as a 3d

01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:32,160
artist you can take a different amount

01:07:30,450 --> 01:07:34,740
of triangles for the same object let's

01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:36,480
say I get a chair a chair is not that

01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:38,130
complicated normally and you can do a

01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,740
lot of things with like ticks there'd be

01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:42,690
like tricks that 3d artists might use to

01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:44,700
make it look really nice so you can use

01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:47,099
let's say a thousand triangles for share

01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:49,470
chair or you can use a hundred thousand

01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:50,940
triangles for chair and if you consider

01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:52,410
like two hundred thousand triangles

01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:55,260
being like the maximum that is

01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:58,200
reasonable to put in a scene like into

01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:59,849
your entire world then a chair with one

01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,619
thousand one hundred thousand triangles

01:07:59,849 --> 01:08:02,910
is like half of everything you've got

01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:05,160
for your entire world that's not

01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:07,589
necessarily a good idea so you want to

01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:09,630
try to find like the polygon account to

01:08:07,589 --> 01:08:11,460
be as minimal as like as low as possible

01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:13,109
while it's still looking great and low

01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:17,130
polygons does not necessarily mean that

01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:19,500
it looks terrible for instance this this

01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:22,279
horse is actually relatively low on

01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:24,330
polygons but it looks pretty great

01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:28,410
how many polygons this will actually

01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:30,239
have let's see polygons four thousand

01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:32,160
two hundred so that's like not too bad

01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:34,469
it's not too great either but it's not

01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:36,509
too bad either so you want to find the

01:08:34,469 --> 01:08:38,759
ones that are actually making sense or

01:08:36,509 --> 01:08:46,259
you create your own ones that's also a

01:08:38,759 --> 01:08:48,000
possibility nothing's impossible kill so

01:08:46,259 --> 01:08:49,949
we can do that and we can like use a

01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,719
bunch of these models and we can combine

01:08:49,949 --> 01:08:53,219
them as well so let me go back to the

01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:56,580
staff pics there's a model there

01:08:53,219 --> 01:09:00,060
particularly like which is this one's

01:08:56,580 --> 01:09:02,940
like called the style house it's famous

01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:05,190
building I think in LA maybe I should

01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:07,199
not put it where like the couch is now

01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:09,739
in the pool so I might want to

01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:09,739
reconsider that

01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:17,350
so we can go in here and I can remove

01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:18,760
these ones because you know the plants

01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:20,620
are nice but if they are standing in the

01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:25,480
pool I don't know I don't feel confident

01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:28,180
about that and I can now go and and copy

01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:29,980
that one into our a frame scene as well

01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:31,720
so I'm gonna remove the original one

01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:39,010
that I put in and put in the straw house

01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:40,960
instead let's do that and here we go

01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:43,090
now we have the star house maybe put

01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:46,000
like sky around again so that we have a

01:09:43,090 --> 01:09:52,630
nicer looking surrounding so I do like a

01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:56,620
sky color sky blue yeah it's looking a

01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:58,270
little better not exactly sure why we're

01:09:56,620 --> 01:10:01,060
not oh because it's one of the things

01:09:58,270 --> 01:10:03,040
where we do like a look into so this one

01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:05,200
does not have a have a roof okay well

01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:06,910
it's a bit weird to not have a roof but

01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:08,710
let's let's not go just have to detail

01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:11,820
right now and we can walk on the water

01:10:08,710 --> 01:10:14,170
that's also nice

01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:15,700
so importing 3d models is not as

01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:17,830
complicated but what if you don't want

01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:21,340
to use one of our 3d models well that is

01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:24,520
absolutely fine in which case you

01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:27,970
probably want to want to import a 3d

01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:31,180
model let me actually see so glitch is a

01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:34,510
bit particular about paths which is not

01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:37,810
making it easier but I'm gonna quickly

01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:40,210
do something for you so imagine that I

01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:43,180
find a blender file online which I

01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:46,570
conveniently did because it's the exact

01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:48,730
same model what I can then do is I can

01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:50,830
take this and import export it into a

01:10:48,730 --> 01:10:52,390
format that makes sense and to be honest

01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:56,200
there's like a lot of different 3d

01:10:52,390 --> 01:11:00,190
formats and I highly recommend you to

01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:02,170
use what is called the gltf format I'm

01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:05,860
gonna explain a little bit why that

01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:08,170
matters in a second so let's know

01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:09,820
actually I do want to export all this I

01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:11,260
do not want to export the camera I do

01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:14,190
not want to export animations because

01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:18,040
we're not having any missions in here so

01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:21,310
let me export this into gltf yeah

01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:23,950
bless you so gltf is tracing is just

01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:24,370
like a format for 3d data it's like the

01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:29,170
JPEG

01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:31,240
egg for 3d if you want it's a format

01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:33,430
specifically optimized for using on the

01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:36,820
web and I'm gonna show you what other

01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:40,770
formats exist so like one of them one of

01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:47,970
the other very popular formats is obj

01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:47,970
obj is like a super old format that is

01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:53,440
basically supported by every 3d software

01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:55,980
in the market so you oftentimes find

01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:58,330
OBJ's but they have a huge disadvantage

01:11:55,980 --> 01:12:00,880
now let's have a look so this is this is

01:11:58,330 --> 01:12:05,230
one of these obj files let's have a look

01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:07,000
inside how it looks like aha so this

01:12:05,230 --> 01:12:09,430
file is actually a text file basically

01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:12,700
and if we look at it closely and I'm

01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:14,320
gonna zoom in a lot if my browser still

01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:16,480
like okay blenders in the background

01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:18,520
still exporting so that's gonna eat up a

01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:21,160
lot of power so we see like a lot of

01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:25,540
numbers here you have any idea what

01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:26,830
these numbers might mean correct those

01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:28,540
are points in 3d

01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:30,370
you're oftentimes not calling them

01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:33,550
points you're calling them vertices and

01:12:30,370 --> 01:12:36,490
three vertices usually form one triangle

01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:38,560
which is also called a face so here we

01:12:36,490 --> 01:12:41,320
have like lots of coins and lots more

01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:45,100
points and even more points and blah

01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:48,460
blah blah and then down there somewhere

01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:50,560
you have like VT those are texture

01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:53,350
coordinates I'm gonna explain that in a

01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:55,300
little later or UV coordinates called

01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:58,840
them as well depends a little bit and

01:12:55,300 --> 01:13:01,480
then we have like faces which are

01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:03,790
connecting these points to triangles and

01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,410
then you know maybe we have groups and

01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:09,430
stuff so you see like it's a really

01:13:05,410 --> 01:13:11,890
really long file and that's for 787

01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:16,750
polygons 102 triangles it has three

01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:18,250
thousand lines and it has a size of it

01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:19,630
has the size somewhere doesn't it no it

01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:21,520
does not show the size where does it

01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:23,620
show does it do it here because some way

01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,330
github shows the size right it's a few

01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:26,860
megabytes actually yeah now actually no

01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:28,660
it's not that large so this one is

01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:31,570
relatively small it's like 86 kilobyte

01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:37,590
but it's 86 kilobytes for a hundred

01:13:31,570 --> 01:13:40,740
triangles that's not very good right

01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:42,150
and there's like no material information

01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:45,360
here that's in a second file

01:13:42,150 --> 01:13:46,920
it's the MTL file and that looks more

01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,870
less like this you have like a material

01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:50,730
with a bunch of like color numbers here

01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:52,290
and then it references the images it's

01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:53,880
like you have to do a lot of text

01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:55,530
parsing and you have to get all this

01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:57,750
text over the wire so it's not very

01:13:55,530 --> 01:14:01,020
efficient right because if you think

01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:02,370
about this let's think about the data

01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:04,500
that is in here for a second so we

01:14:02,370 --> 01:14:07,350
basically have a bunch of points in here

01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:09,570
and they are like three comma values so

01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:12,210
comma values are usually a floating

01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:16,950
point values are usually saved as 32-bit

01:14:12,210 --> 01:14:19,500
values so the 32-bit is four bytes so we

01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:23,640
have three of them X Y and that so we

01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:26,100
have 3 x 4 byte makes 12 bytes for one

01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:28,170
coordinate for one vertex right but if

01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:30,570
you look at it here each of these

01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:38,160
characters is a byte so they're like 1 2

01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:40,860
3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 so this much

01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:43,260
space is what it would normally take to

01:14:40,860 --> 01:14:46,410
store one of these coordinates so we are

01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:47,820
wasting a lot of space and even worse

01:14:46,410 --> 01:14:49,800
we're wasting a lot of processing power

01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:52,020
because we have to read this line by

01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,790
line break it up into smaller bits and

01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:56,130
then parse that into floats and then put

01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:58,230
that into the memory for the for the 3d

01:14:56,130 --> 01:15:00,240
engine to pick it up it's like a lot of

01:14:58,230 --> 01:15:03,120
CPU power needed to actually parse this

01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:05,040
into a 3d model and you can imagine that

01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,960
on mobile doing that with like a 2

01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:10,200
megabyte file of this format is not

01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:12,200
gonna be great so that's why there's

01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:14,790
other formats available like G ot F

01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:17,070
which is adjacent based file format but

01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:18,960
it can also be binary and then it like

01:15:17,070 --> 01:15:21,000
saves a lot of space so that's actually

01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,320
you know what let's let's up export this

01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,840
into obj as well just to get a

01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:28,580
comparison so I'm gonna export this into

01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:33,630
obj and we're gonna do that export

01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:36,030
da-da-da-da-da okay and now let's have a

01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:37,890
look at the files this is not the right

01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:40,560
folder this is the right folder so here

01:15:37,890 --> 01:15:42,990
we have like the G RTF file a complete

01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,880
completely including everything all the

01:15:42,990 --> 01:15:47,910
images is quite large is 150 megabytes

01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:51,210
the obj is like 16 megabytes but what

01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:53,100
happens if I'm not including all the

01:15:51,210 --> 01:15:55,800
Cheerios all the files let's see there

01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:58,739
must be in where is it actually here

01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:02,810
here it is style house Jay G RTF let's

01:15:58,739 --> 01:16:06,960
have a look get info so this one is like

01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:11,160
400 kilobytes 448 kilobytes versus 16

01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:12,989
point 2 megabytes hmm and I can get that

01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:15,000
as a single file version which is nice

01:16:12,989 --> 01:16:17,219
it's quite large but it contains all the

01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:20,160
images and the reason why I did that is

01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:22,440
because unfortunately glitch is not

01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:23,820
making it easy to upload things that are

01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,530
referencing other things because

01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:27,120
normally what you would do is you would

01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:29,520
use browser caching so you would have

01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:32,310
like a gif file referencing all the

01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:34,170
images because then if like the model

01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:35,550
changes and one image changes you would

01:16:34,170 --> 01:16:38,070
only download that one image and the

01:16:35,550 --> 01:16:40,770
JSON file just like 400 kilobytes and

01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:43,800
you would not download all the the

01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:45,270
textures again but unfortunately glitch

01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,219
has a problem with like linking to other

01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:49,620
things so we only have to upload one

01:16:47,219 --> 01:16:51,989
file to make that work and that

01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:54,480
unfortunately means that I'm in the

01:16:51,989 --> 01:16:55,920
wrong folder here I believe it's not the

01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:58,260
right folder yes that looks like the

01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:00,420
right folder let's see how that goes

01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:03,120
we're uploading 150 megabytes that's

01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:05,460
gonna be whoo okay no damn that looks

01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,850
more like this oh look at that it's half

01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:10,760
done

01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:14,540
how did that work yeah I never mind oh

01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:17,130
boy I think it's time for a coffee break

01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:21,080
but basically how we how we can use

01:17:17,130 --> 01:17:24,450
these gltf files oh Jesus

01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:26,700
this is gonna be painful conveniently

01:17:24,450 --> 01:17:29,400
it's like the same thing a frame comes

01:17:26,700 --> 01:17:29,880
with a can actually yes I can that's

01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:32,070
lovely

01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:33,390
comes to the component for gltf models

01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:36,750
so what we can do is we can say like a

01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:38,940
entity gltf model and then just give it

01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:40,380
a URL to the gltf model so now we don't

01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:46,440
have it but so I'm basically gonna be

01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:47,910
like to be found out dot yeah so

01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:49,860
basically we put in the g-- RTF file

01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:53,340
name here and then it loads the geo TF

01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:56,210
automatically it's actually faster than

01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:58,739
I would have expected that's pretty good

01:17:56,210 --> 01:18:00,390
and then we would basically get the same

01:17:58,739 --> 01:18:04,419
model so it's a bit of pointless but you

01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:07,169
can use gltf models like this it's nice

01:18:04,419 --> 01:18:09,820
okay now we have 3d models in here and

01:18:07,169 --> 01:18:10,989
we have experimented a little bit but

01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:12,579
let's let's do something more

01:18:10,989 --> 01:18:14,079
interesting that's add something that is

01:18:12,579 --> 01:18:21,489
moving and you know something more

01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:27,399
interesting into this so let's say I do

01:18:21,489 --> 01:18:31,749
my geometry primitive box material

01:18:27,399 --> 01:18:37,409
oops ah color red and I position nope

01:18:31,749 --> 01:18:37,409
nope nope nope position it to 0-2

01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:44,750
when I'm removing this as well because

01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:46,640
we don't really need that oh do I have

01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:52,540
the URL now that's convenient let's

01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:52,540
let's try if that works gltf model and

01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:59,990
right I honestly have never tried what

01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:01,820
happens when you export it as a single

01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:03,110
file so I'm looking forward to find out

01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:07,990
what happens when you export it as a

01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:07,990
single file that's what I thought

01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:11,960
it doesn't complain so it's probably

01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:18,710
still loading it

01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:21,740
who knows let's try that out yeah that

01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:23,690
might take a while and that's precisely

01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:25,160
why you don't do single this is an

01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:26,990
important lesson learned by the way like

01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,850
do not use the single file option

01:19:26,990 --> 01:19:30,920
because it's just like not worth it

01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:33,770
as it like blocks the rendering until it

01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:38,330
actually comes back from the network ok

01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:40,090
I'll leave that in though actually no I

01:19:38,330 --> 01:19:42,380
won't because I'm gonna use it anyway

01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:43,730
but this is basically how you would do

01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:44,960
it you would take the URL and put it

01:19:43,730 --> 01:19:47,480
into the thing and then you'll be good

01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:50,570
why is this thing coming back the entire

01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:56,780
time so let me move this down here and

01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:59,180
let me move this down here so what it's

01:19:56,780 --> 01:20:04,280
unhygienic model so that's gonna start

01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:05,900
rendering once it has everything in then

01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,760
it would basically render as they are

01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:09,560
arriving from the network so if you have

01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:12,920
like smaller models that's exactly it's

01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:14,360
like basically what happens is if you if

01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:16,070
you would not have the single file

01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:18,200
version of the smaller it would download

01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:19,520
the tiny Jason and then discover all the

01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,380
different bits and pieces and it will

01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,480
discover like the the binary file files

01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:24,800
for all the vertices and faces and it

01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:26,090
will discover the images and start

01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,680
downloading them in parallel and

01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:29,240
basically once it has everything that it

01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:33,620
needs to render it would start rendering

01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:35,000
and we in red renders other entities as

01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:36,940
well and in the background so it's not

01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,870
like blocking everything it's just like

01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:40,040
obviously if you have too many to

01:20:38,870 --> 01:20:41,150
actually download at the same time

01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:42,860
because you have this like download

01:20:41,150 --> 01:20:46,010
limit off I think like 16 connections

01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:48,410
per host then that would start blocking

01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:50,090
but without that it wouldn't ok so what

01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:54,130
we haven't done so far is we haven't

01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:58,190
done what's called hierarchies

01:20:54,130 --> 01:21:00,950
so what we can do is we can actually

01:20:58,190 --> 01:21:02,890
conveniently put things inside of other

01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:05,570
things so let's do like n/a entity

01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:09,380
actually make the outside primitive a

01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:12,610
sphere and the color yellow and then

01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:17,300
inside here we do like geometry

01:21:12,610 --> 01:21:19,820
primitive box well this is a bit no

01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:25,730
let's test this fear come on material

01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:27,110
color blue now and actually probably

01:21:25,730 --> 01:21:29,060
also what's what's gonna be interesting

01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:31,970
is like we can do like scale observe

01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:35,360
scale and they've got like 0.25 so 25%

01:21:31,970 --> 01:21:38,090
of the original scale and now we only

01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:41,030
see like our gigantic well not gigantic

01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:43,400
but I love our yellow blob here or

01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:44,780
yellow blob where's our blue blob well

01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:49,760
it's inside because it's the same

01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:51,290
position so what we can do here is as

01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:54,290
you can see like this is now nested this

01:21:51,290 --> 01:21:55,730
is a child of the other thing we can

01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:58,460
address it in the editor in the

01:21:55,730 --> 01:21:59,690
inspector like this so here you see like

01:21:58,460 --> 01:22:02,660
there's an entity but now you have a

01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:04,910
tiny little blob on the side to it so if

01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:06,770
I press on that you see that last I can

01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:09,950
hand it to you hidden inside oh my god

01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:10,400
and I can move it out and hey look at

01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:14,420
that

01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:17,870
hi there's a little thing here so now we

01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:21,730
have I don't know Sun and the planet

01:22:17,870 --> 01:22:25,220
nice what's worth mentioning is that

01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:28,070
they are now hierarchically connected so

01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:29,810
the Sun is the parent of the little

01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:32,420
actually let's let's get them ID so that

01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:37,970
we can easily spot them later on

01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:39,980
so ID earth so if I now say I want to

01:22:37,970 --> 01:22:41,330
position them somewhere else and I'm

01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:42,980
gonna do that in a second I'm just gonna

01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:45,380
clean up the code here a little bit as

01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:47,950
well so it's a little easier to read on

01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:57,530
the projector so if I now say oops

01:22:47,950 --> 01:23:00,470
position say like three zero zero you

01:22:57,530 --> 01:23:02,660
wouldn't be able to tell that this is

01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:04,820
like not the global position this is a

01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:07,369
relative position to this one but what

01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:10,099
happens if I'm now moving

01:23:07,369 --> 01:23:13,699
the Sun maybe let's say like I move it

01:23:10,099 --> 01:23:15,949
to like minus five and maybe like 1.6 so

01:23:13,699 --> 01:23:19,010
that's on a level and look at that our

01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:20,539
little planet has moved with it so the

01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:22,459
position of this little planet is no

01:23:20,539 --> 01:23:23,539
longer like in world coordinates it's

01:23:22,459 --> 01:23:26,539
now in coordinates

01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:28,999
real relative to the Sun so basically

01:23:26,539 --> 01:23:30,799
what I'm saying is my son is somewhere

01:23:28,999 --> 01:23:35,149
let's say like my son is that like I

01:23:30,799 --> 01:23:38,749
don't know so let's say this is 0 0 0

01:23:35,149 --> 01:23:42,619
and my son is that like 0 0 minus 1 and

01:23:38,749 --> 01:23:45,319
now if I say the little son the little

01:23:42,619 --> 01:23:48,649
earth which is like my child will be at

01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:50,059
0 0 0 it's gonna be where I am and if I

01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:52,939
move it's gonna be moving with me

01:23:50,059 --> 01:23:55,609
because it's attached to me right so if

01:23:52,939 --> 01:23:57,469
I say like can this please move one

01:23:55,609 --> 01:23:59,179
meter into there oh sorry yeah into the

01:23:57,469 --> 01:24:01,519
screen like minus 1 then it's gonna be

01:23:59,179 --> 01:24:03,379
behind me because it's going always from

01:24:01,519 --> 01:24:06,019
where I am and not like in world

01:24:03,379 --> 01:24:08,599
coordinates this is convenient for an

01:24:06,019 --> 01:24:14,569
interesting reason because we can do

01:24:08,599 --> 01:24:18,559
things like this we can use this to

01:24:14,569 --> 01:24:20,449
create an animation and we're gonna do

01:24:18,559 --> 01:24:22,459
this not inside the earth because then

01:24:20,449 --> 01:24:24,109
it's gonna spin the earth but we're

01:24:22,459 --> 01:24:26,659
gonna do it inside the Sun so on the

01:24:24,109 --> 01:24:31,399
same level as the earth we're gonna do

01:24:26,659 --> 01:24:33,319
like a animation and I have to look up

01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:35,139
the syntax for this because I for the

01:24:33,319 --> 01:24:37,369
life of me I can't remember the syntax

01:24:35,139 --> 01:24:39,049
because I think it's like prop or is it

01:24:37,369 --> 01:24:42,649
actually it's out to attribute okay cool

01:24:39,049 --> 01:24:46,489
that's what I needed to know so the

01:24:42,649 --> 01:24:50,689
animation tag is using its parent it's

01:24:46,489 --> 01:24:53,809
direct parent to change a property over

01:24:50,689 --> 01:24:55,459
time or an attribute over time so I have

01:24:53,809 --> 01:24:59,209
to tell it which attribute I want to

01:24:55,459 --> 01:25:03,169
change and I can for instance say I want

01:24:59,209 --> 01:25:06,949
to change the position and now if I say

01:25:03,169 --> 01:25:08,839
we started at say like minus 2 then I

01:25:06,949 --> 01:25:10,549
can say actually it doesn't really

01:25:08,839 --> 01:25:13,459
matter let's say like we started 0 and

01:25:10,549 --> 01:25:15,679
then say like I want to start from and

01:25:13,459 --> 01:25:16,939
it takes the value that makes sense in

01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:18,529
the context so in this case this is a

01:25:16,939 --> 01:25:20,929
position so we need to give it three

01:25:18,529 --> 01:25:30,110
numbers so I said like I want to start

01:25:20,929 --> 01:25:31,550
- 2 11.6 - 5 woopsy 2 - 1 point 6 - 5 so

01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:34,219
it's gonna move from the left to right

01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:36,499
and I think it's like they're not like

01:25:34,219 --> 01:25:38,809
actual de-rate right yes sir so we give

01:25:36,499 --> 01:25:40,999
it a duration for the time that this

01:25:38,809 --> 01:25:46,510
motion should take and I would say like

01:25:40,999 --> 01:25:46,510
5 seconds those 5,000 milliseconds and

01:25:47,079 --> 01:25:51,349
and if we reload you see that it does a

01:25:50,539 --> 01:25:55,820
motion

01:25:51,349 --> 01:25:57,320
hurrah and it does it exactly once now

01:25:55,820 --> 01:26:00,760
there's a bunch of properties that I can

01:25:57,320 --> 01:26:06,050
set for instance I can set repeat

01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:07,729
indefinitely I think I can never tell

01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:09,199
it's like English not being my first

01:26:07,729 --> 01:26:11,599
language I'm having a hard time actually

01:26:09,199 --> 01:26:13,789
spelling that right to be honest yes all

01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:15,949
right so if you do like repeat

01:26:13,789 --> 01:26:21,709
indefinitely it's gonna keep repeating

01:26:15,949 --> 01:26:23,510
that animation the problem now is that

01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:26,150
you can see that it doesn't do what you

01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:27,739
might want it to have it do like it

01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:30,079
doesn't actually bounce between the two

01:26:27,739 --> 01:26:31,729
it just basically restarts the energy in

01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:38,630
the animation after like five seconds

01:26:31,729 --> 01:26:42,800
it's like we flip hey this is not not

01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:44,059
quite what we want so there is a few

01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:45,800
attributes down here and this is like

01:26:44,059 --> 01:26:47,269
the nice thing everything that a frame

01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:49,219
comes with is really really well

01:26:47,269 --> 01:26:51,800
documented and you have like lots of

01:26:49,219 --> 01:26:53,389
documentation available and if you find

01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,189
something that is unclear you can edit

01:26:53,389 --> 01:26:56,689
the page or go to view source or go to

01:26:55,189 --> 01:27:01,489
get up and actually suggest that there

01:26:56,689 --> 01:27:05,889
should be in a fixed being made so this

01:27:01,489 --> 01:27:09,920
is nice and here's a direction property

01:27:05,889 --> 01:27:12,619
that you can set to alternate so we do

01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:15,229
that so actually let me let me redo the

01:27:12,619 --> 01:27:18,249
the way that we do these attributes so

01:27:15,229 --> 01:27:18,249
that's a little easier yes

01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:26,239
yeah well yeah that's a tricky one so

01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:28,820
there is a frame itself has an animation

01:27:26,239 --> 01:27:31,250
component but there is a better one that

01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:32,690
I don't go into because we would have to

01:27:31,250 --> 01:27:34,160
use an external component and I would

01:27:32,690 --> 01:27:36,620
like to show you the a-frame bits and

01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:37,910
pieces first but it like it does say and

01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:39,890
I would have actually mentioned that

01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:43,100
there is an external component done by

01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:45,910
Kevin go that is having more

01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:48,530
possibilities because this is a limited

01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:50,180
component so for more cool stuff you can

01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:52,400
actually check out the a-frame animation

01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:54,980
component and they have like more things

01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:57,050
and they're a little little well well

01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:58,489
ahead of the actual thing unfortunately

01:27:57,050 --> 01:28:00,470
and they have things like you can have

01:27:58,489 --> 01:28:02,390
timeline to actually coordinate multiple

01:28:00,470 --> 01:28:04,190
animations and stuff like that it's just

01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:06,890
a little too much for a basic workshop I

01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:10,489
would say and then you see like

01:28:06,890 --> 01:28:12,830
elasticity they have a way to not round

01:28:10,489 --> 01:28:14,420
the values start events pause events if

01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:17,239
it should autoplay you can combine

01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:18,800
multiple animations all that but we

01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:20,450
start with a simple animation so we are

01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:23,390
now in the documentation for the for the

01:28:20,450 --> 01:28:24,980
built-in animation component but if you

01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:26,780
would have more complicated animations I

01:28:24,980 --> 01:28:28,160
highly highly recommend not using the

01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:30,920
a-frame component but using the external

01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,420
one as it is more powerful but for the

01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:37,100
simple ones this one is perfectly fine

01:28:32,420 --> 01:28:44,930
so if we now say direction I'll turn

01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:47,530
eight we're getting this alternating

01:28:44,930 --> 01:28:47,530
pattern

01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:55,260
now this is not quite what a star does

01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:57,880
what the Sun does but what we can do is

01:28:55,260 --> 01:29:00,640
we can say okay maybe what we want to do

01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:02,350
is we want to change the rotation and

01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:04,120
we're going to start from zero zero zero

01:29:02,350 --> 01:29:06,970
which conveniently it is already so we

01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:11,470
don't even need to mention that and we

01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:13,390
want to rotate around let's say the yeah

01:29:11,470 --> 01:29:14,890
let's say only the y-axis to begin with

01:29:13,390 --> 01:29:18,970
like let's start with this and we want

01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:20,860
to go 360 degrees 360 degrees and I

01:29:18,970 --> 01:29:22,150
don't want the direction to alternate in

01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:28,690
this case because that's gonna look

01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:31,420
weird and here we are well this is not

01:29:28,690 --> 01:29:32,890
quite how a rotation works right this is

01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:36,940
gonna be this is gonna be a really

01:29:32,890 --> 01:29:39,730
really weird day here why does that

01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:42,100
happen well this is because of easing by

01:29:39,730 --> 01:29:44,650
default it eases in and out so basically

01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:46,630
it becomes faster and slower to the to

01:29:44,650 --> 01:29:49,030
the ends and the beginnings so we would

01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:51,550
have to fix that and we can do so by

01:29:49,030 --> 01:29:53,530
saying easing linear so that's not

01:29:51,550 --> 01:29:55,830
actually doing like modification of the

01:29:53,530 --> 01:29:55,830
speeds

01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:11,460
we so now we have a rotating earth

01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:12,690
that's nice but there's a little bit of

01:30:11,460 --> 01:30:15,570
a problem actually I want to show you

01:30:12,690 --> 01:30:17,610
something real quick and I'm gonna go to

01:30:15,570 --> 01:30:19,680
Google Image Search obviously don't do

01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:23,480
that for various copyright reasons but

01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:26,790
I'm gonna do it anyways some surface

01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:28,860
okay that's let's use I don't know let's

01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:32,040
use like this one that sounds like a

01:30:28,860 --> 01:30:35,370
reasonable thing do you view image copy

01:30:32,040 --> 01:30:38,370
image dress so in the materials you

01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:40,050
can't just specify like a color but you

01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:42,270
can actually also give it a source so I

01:30:40,050 --> 01:30:44,640
can say like source and then use an

01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:47,310
image source like this and it's not

01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:49,770
working because probably this is an HTTP

01:30:47,310 --> 01:30:51,540
no this is an HTTP URL so what is the

01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:54,780
problem oh is that one of the cases

01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:56,910
where so the syntax has recently gotten

01:30:54,780 --> 01:30:59,100
a little inconclusive let's put it that

01:30:56,910 --> 01:31:02,220
way because depending on the know what's

01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:08,310
the problem here that's it oh it's

01:31:02,220 --> 01:31:09,690
a ah cross-origin shizzles come on okay

01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:14,100
fine what we're gonna do is like I'm

01:31:09,690 --> 01:31:16,560
gonna save this image why do I have to

01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:20,190
do this and I'm gonna upload it here to

01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:21,960
the assets boom and as that is not such

01:31:20,190 --> 01:31:27,330
a large file it should actually upload

01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:29,340
it too quickly and here we have it it's

01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:32,640
probably gonna look weird because I

01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:35,180
don't think it's a proper proper equal

01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:42,090
rectangular image but it's gonna be fine

01:31:35,180 --> 01:31:43,530
so cross-origin like seriously come on

01:31:42,090 --> 01:31:46,350
don't be like that

01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:48,570
people don't cross-origin your things

01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:51,900
here we go but now this is not what we

01:31:48,570 --> 01:31:55,260
want right it's weird that why would the

01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:57,990
Sun rotate the same speed as the as the

01:31:55,260 --> 01:32:01,260
earth this is not really what we want to

01:31:57,990 --> 01:32:02,970
do and this is where the fact that oh my

01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:04,320
god what the friends of project are

01:32:02,970 --> 01:32:08,220
doing do you see like the little halo

01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:12,170
behind the what the rip this is not a

01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:12,170
thing this is the projector nice

01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:20,080
okay whatever this is fascinating so if

01:32:17,890 --> 01:32:22,660
you remember from the very beginning an

01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:24,490
entity is invisible right unless we

01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:26,800
attach a component to it that makes it

01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:29,650
visible it is invisible so what we can

01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:31,180
do is we can change our coat a tiny

01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:36,850
little bit what we can do is we can say

01:32:31,180 --> 01:32:38,890
hey I would like this entity to maybe

01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:45,130
not rotate instead we have like an

01:32:38,890 --> 01:32:47,920
invisible child that we put both the

01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:52,000
animation and the RG both the animation

01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:53,470
and the earth goes in there so I remove

01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,770
them here and I put them into this

01:32:53,470 --> 01:32:59,320
entity and move them in a little bit so

01:32:56,770 --> 01:33:01,300
that's easier to spot and I probably

01:32:59,320 --> 01:33:03,390
like do it like this is a little easier

01:33:01,300 --> 01:33:07,030
to spot where the indentation comes in

01:33:03,390 --> 01:33:09,220
so now we have the Sun and as child of

01:33:07,030 --> 01:33:11,320
the Sun we have an invisible entity and

01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:14,260
the invisible entity has an animation

01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:14,800
and the earth is relative to this

01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:17,980
particular

01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:20,650
invisible entity and now we have this

01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:22,270
effect and it's not a performance

01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:24,070
problem because an entity that has

01:33:22,270 --> 01:33:26,140
nothing to render does not render

01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:28,360
anything so it's not having any overhead

01:33:26,140 --> 01:33:31,420
really it's a tiny little JavaScript

01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:33,430
instance in the rendering list but it's

01:33:31,420 --> 01:33:34,960
not actually rendered so you don't have

01:33:33,430 --> 01:33:40,600
to worry about like performance problems

01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:42,100
with invisible entities regarding

01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:44,020
performance I also wanted to highlight

01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:45,880
something else that is a pitfall that a

01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:48,250
lot of people get really really confused

01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:50,890
with so what happens if I put the earth

01:33:48,250 --> 01:33:53,560
exactly around where the camera is at

01:33:50,890 --> 01:33:55,120
the beginning that's already the Sun so

01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:56,650
now this is confusing right why am I not

01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:58,870
seeing this I'm in the middle of the Sun

01:33:56,650 --> 01:34:00,990
but I'm not seeing anything and the

01:33:58,870 --> 01:34:03,760
reason for that is a performance

01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:08,640
optimization that is usually done which

01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:10,900
is it assumes that if you have an object

01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:14,380
90% of the times so if I have this

01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:16,630
object here it doesn't make sense to

01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:18,250
render anything inside that is not

01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:19,780
visible from the outside so basically it

01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:21,190
tries to be clever and goes like this

01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:22,840
part here I actually don't have to

01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:25,179
render it because it's hidden you

01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:27,400
and see it so why would I render it so

01:34:25,179 --> 01:34:29,830
the problem with that is that it's it's

01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:31,449
not necessarily like smart about if

01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:33,550
you're inside of the things so this is

01:34:31,449 --> 01:34:36,429
not rendering because the material is by

01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:40,510
default not rendering the insides we can

01:34:36,429 --> 01:34:42,280
fix that and if you look into the know

01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:44,920
that's the camera I don't know what the

01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:47,679
camera I want the Sun if you look at the

01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:50,230
material component you see something

01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:52,960
where it says side and it has front so

01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:56,380
this is like the outside of something we

01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,820
can as well render the inside and then

01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:59,320
here we are in the middle of the Sun

01:34:57,820 --> 01:35:02,679
which is probably not a good spot to be

01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:04,480
in but yeah so now it's rendering the

01:35:02,679 --> 01:35:06,310
inside but the fun thing is if I now go

01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:09,070
outside of the Sun it looks a bit weird

01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:12,010
right because it's now only rendering

01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:13,510
the insides or not the outsides so this

01:35:12,010 --> 01:35:15,699
is probably not what we want what we

01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:17,920
want instead might be that we want to

01:35:15,699 --> 01:35:20,409
render both sides so this has a

01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:24,760
performance impact because you're always

01:35:20,409 --> 01:35:28,119
rendering both sides but it's sometimes

01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:31,119
the only thing that actually helps so

01:35:28,119 --> 01:35:33,580
you might have things like let's say a

01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:35,500
building with a window and you want to

01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:37,239
see through the window into the building

01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:41,170
and then the insides would not render if

01:35:37,239 --> 01:35:43,000
they would not be set up correctly we

01:35:41,170 --> 01:35:46,000
actually our models do that

01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:47,500
because we assume that only the insides

01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:49,119
of the walls are not something you want

01:35:47,500 --> 01:35:50,619
to render so basically was that our in

01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:51,760
doors are actually facing in the right

01:35:50,619 --> 01:35:55,270
direction so it actually renders

01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:56,469
correctly automatically but yeah that's

01:35:55,270 --> 01:36:00,730
a that's the thing that you have to

01:35:56,469 --> 01:36:02,320
figure out also transparency is

01:36:00,730 --> 01:36:04,179
supported you have to like set the

01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:06,219
transparent flag and then the opacity to

01:36:04,179 --> 01:36:08,380
like 0.5 for instance and then we have

01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:10,000
like a half transparent Sun sometimes

01:36:08,380 --> 01:36:11,260
that looks a bit weird and funky and

01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,989
this is in this case because we're

01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:15,489
rendering double sided and it like

01:36:13,989 --> 01:36:17,050
doesn't know which side is the actual

01:36:15,489 --> 01:36:18,699
thing that it wants to render so you

01:36:17,050 --> 01:36:21,130
want to avoid having double side

01:36:18,699 --> 01:36:22,780
renderings with most of the transparent

01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:25,330
objects because it just doesn't know

01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:28,889
which side it is showing whereas it's

01:36:25,330 --> 01:36:28,889
like giving this weird effect

01:36:29,059 --> 01:36:38,349
okay any questions so far could you just

01:36:34,250 --> 01:36:38,349
stop at the code I can

01:36:41,530 --> 01:36:47,840
anything not working anyone wondering

01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:53,480
about the thing I'm trying to get to the

01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:56,600
animation how would you suggest

01:36:53,480 --> 01:37:00,739
debugging like an animation oh that's

01:36:56,600 --> 01:37:04,340
that's a tricky one look at the code and

01:37:00,739 --> 01:37:07,280
see like so you have the animation at

01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:09,320
this like yeah so did it work in the

01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:12,650
beginning or did it like never ever work

01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:13,969
ah right okay fair enough so what you

01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:16,040
want to do is like the animation always

01:37:13,969 --> 01:37:19,370
animates the object that it is like its

01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:21,380
parent so in this case we have like the

01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:22,880
a entity is an invisible thing but it

01:37:21,380 --> 01:37:26,960
has two children it has the animation

01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:29,060
and the this the earth and the earth has

01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:31,370
an offset so like the earth because it's

01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:32,870
just a blue blob if you would rotate it

01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:35,030
you wouldn't see it so you would have to

01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:38,300
move it off the origin as I explained

01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:39,889
earlier with the 3d models I move this

01:37:38,300 --> 01:37:42,679
thing so basically let's have a look at

01:37:39,889 --> 01:37:45,409
this I move this thing to the right

01:37:42,679 --> 01:37:46,880
three meters off the origin of the

01:37:45,409 --> 01:37:49,219
actual entity right so we have this

01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:52,489
invisible entity here I move the earth

01:37:49,219 --> 01:37:54,800
to the side and I have the animation as

01:37:52,489 --> 01:37:56,690
a child as well and the animation is

01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:58,580
turning the invisible entity and because

01:37:56,690 --> 01:38:03,590
this thing is off the origin it was like

01:37:58,580 --> 01:38:04,969
there so this is what should happen the

01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:06,409
next step would be to check the

01:38:04,969 --> 01:38:08,210
attributes because I think and sometimes

01:38:06,409 --> 01:38:11,150
they are not very obvious like attribute

01:38:08,210 --> 01:38:12,770
rotation okay I get you that pa'dar it's

01:38:11,150 --> 01:38:15,530
like not the most obvious thing and

01:38:12,770 --> 01:38:16,909
repeat indefinitely for me as a

01:38:15,530 --> 01:38:19,780
non-native English speaker it's also

01:38:16,909 --> 01:38:23,420
pretty hard to spell right to be honest

01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:25,280
and if all of that is right then I would

01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:28,250
wonder why it's not working should I

01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:30,199
have a look describe the structure it

01:38:28,250 --> 01:38:31,969
should be an a seem like website just

01:38:30,199 --> 01:38:32,599
the base would be a scene and empty

01:38:31,969 --> 01:38:34,429
entity

01:38:32,599 --> 01:38:37,250
and then inside of it are two entities

01:38:34,429 --> 01:38:41,630
in managed me up one since okay I'm

01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:43,159
gonna be on the outside like probably

01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:44,659
like the simplest thing you could build

01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:47,329
something like this so let's let's start

01:38:44,659 --> 01:38:51,530
with a like an a entity that is

01:38:47,329 --> 01:38:55,730
basically empty and inside you have

01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:57,560
another a entity that is positioned

01:38:55,730 --> 01:38:59,960
slightly off let's say like three meters

01:38:57,560 --> 01:39:01,520
to the right and you have to give it

01:38:59,960 --> 01:39:07,310
something that it's makes it visible so

01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:12,290
like primitive sphere material material

01:39:07,310 --> 01:39:16,460
color red so let's do that let's put it

01:39:12,290 --> 01:39:18,530
here and let's put this here and then on

01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:20,179
the same level of indentation so in the

01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:22,489
same in the external like in the

01:39:20,179 --> 01:39:24,260
surrounding entity not in the entity

01:39:22,489 --> 01:39:28,659
that is the little sphere that we just

01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:28,659
created you do like a animation and

01:39:29,050 --> 01:39:42,020
attribute rotation to 0 360 0 door 3000

01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:44,360
maybe it's like the smallest thing you

01:39:42,020 --> 01:39:48,739
can probably do and then you should have

01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:52,369
oh it's not it's not moving that's great

01:39:48,739 --> 01:39:54,349
it's because it actually might have

01:39:52,369 --> 01:39:55,760
moved it's just like it has moved 3

01:39:54,349 --> 01:39:56,989
seconds long and that might actually

01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:59,449
have been passed already

01:39:56,989 --> 01:40:01,869
so let's actually give it like the

01:39:59,449 --> 01:40:01,869
repeat

01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:12,650
sorry but it would no no yeah this is

01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:14,360
this is where it's configure where I

01:40:12,650 --> 01:40:17,719
find it confusing when I learned this

01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:19,250
this stuff is it it is a solid sphere

01:40:17,719 --> 01:40:22,010
that is correct but it's not rotating

01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:24,290
around itself because and let me repeat

01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:28,460
that again look at look at the structure

01:40:24,290 --> 01:40:31,579
real clear so basically yes the

01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:34,520
animation is going to its parent right

01:40:31,579 --> 01:40:35,989
so actually I can I can like collapse it

01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:40,040
the collapsing is not really helping

01:40:35,989 --> 01:40:42,230
much is this yeah so basically this this

01:40:40,040 --> 01:40:45,010
would rotate this invisible entity and

01:40:42,230 --> 01:40:48,079
the sphere is slightly off the origin

01:40:45,010 --> 01:40:53,719
that should actually rotate it around me

01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:56,230
and it does we I love the blur on the

01:40:53,719 --> 01:40:59,050
projector like the best thing ever you

01:40:56,230 --> 01:41:02,239
describe from here if you want now like

01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:05,030
so now I have like the smaller sphere

01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:06,980
spinning just around the camera well if

01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:10,369
you make that center point now move out

01:41:06,980 --> 01:41:13,250
to where the other spheres what I then

01:41:10,369 --> 01:41:14,929
do this where's the other sphere

01:41:13,250 --> 01:41:16,849
actually is right okay it's right where

01:41:14,929 --> 01:41:21,739
we are so that's let's say like s minus

01:41:16,849 --> 01:41:25,130
five I move this top-level entity where

01:41:21,739 --> 01:41:26,300
the other thing is or so that's one one

01:41:25,130 --> 01:41:28,510
way of doing it so the basically I would

01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:30,770
have to like figure out is like 0 1 or 6

01:41:28,510 --> 01:41:32,480
minus 5 and I might want to actually

01:41:30,770 --> 01:41:35,360
move this somewhere else let's say like

01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:37,099
I move this to 5 maybe because I don't

01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:40,219
want to have them like rotate on the

01:41:37,099 --> 01:41:41,510
same it has the easing ok I give you

01:41:40,219 --> 01:41:42,920
that it's like still doing like the

01:41:41,510 --> 01:41:44,570
weird easing thing but basically now

01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:47,179
this this does the thing but this has

01:41:44,570 --> 01:41:49,869
the downside of if I now move the Sun

01:41:47,179 --> 01:41:52,760
down here right as I say like minus 5

01:41:49,869 --> 01:41:54,739
then the Sun and the earth has moved but

01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:56,659
this one thing has moved right so if I

01:41:54,739 --> 01:42:00,320
want to make that follow what I would do

01:41:56,659 --> 01:42:03,770
is I would take the entire thing that's

01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:05,119
let's call this like I like to call them

01:42:03,770 --> 01:42:07,520
anchors because they're kind of like

01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:09,440
invisible anchors right so I call this

01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:12,739
the anchor and then I use the entire

01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:15,020
block here and I would move that into

01:42:12,739 --> 01:42:16,610
the same entity as the Sun or actually

01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:18,469
make it a child of the Sun that work

01:42:16,610 --> 01:42:22,010
as well so I would make the entire

01:42:18,469 --> 01:42:23,840
anchor a child of the Sun and then the

01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:25,429
anchor would not have to actually be

01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:27,350
positioned of the Sun because I wanted

01:42:25,429 --> 01:42:30,050
to be like the same point as where the

01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:33,230
Sun is so I can do that and now I have

01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:34,969
like the whoops okay now I have the

01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:37,760
effect that this is moving with the Sun

01:42:34,969 --> 01:42:41,389
so if I move the Sun back to zero on the

01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:44,239
x axis the red thing still rotates

01:42:41,389 --> 01:42:46,489
around the Sun so you have to be like it

01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:48,230
actually I really really really love the

01:42:46,489 --> 01:42:50,719
inspector for this because you get like

01:42:48,230 --> 01:42:53,480
this tree structure nicer here right so

01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:56,060
now we see like the Sun has two children

01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:57,739
one is the anchor for the blue little

01:42:56,060 --> 01:42:59,449
planet and one is the anchor for the red

01:42:57,739 --> 01:43:02,659
little planet and then you have like the

01:42:59,449 --> 01:43:04,580
entity of the Red Planet is a child of

01:43:02,659 --> 01:43:06,969
this entity of the anchor and then they

01:43:04,580 --> 01:43:10,510
have the same setup here for the earth

01:43:06,969 --> 01:43:28,100
as you get this like hierarchical

01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:29,139
relationship adds to it yes correct that

01:43:28,100 --> 01:43:31,969
is correct

01:43:29,139 --> 01:43:33,980
if you have these these hierarchies then

01:43:31,969 --> 01:43:36,650
the positions are always like relative

01:43:33,980 --> 01:43:38,150
to its to its parent and that actually

01:43:36,650 --> 01:43:39,770
is true for all of them right that I

01:43:38,150 --> 01:43:42,050
mean the sky has a position that is

01:43:39,770 --> 01:43:44,480
relative to the scene this is always

01:43:42,050 --> 01:43:46,480
relative to the parent and if you share

01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:51,199
the parent then you share the offsets

01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:53,330
you can either take the entity that is

01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:55,100
the parent to the animation and put that

01:43:53,330 --> 01:43:57,110
inside of the entity of the bigger

01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:58,880
planet yeah or you can have them be two

01:43:57,110 --> 01:44:00,199
separate entities and just position them

01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:02,480
yes correct

01:44:00,199 --> 01:44:04,130
with the downs like the second one with

01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:05,000
the downside that if I move the thing

01:44:04,130 --> 01:44:06,500
then the other thing does not

01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,760
automatically move with it right if it's

01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:11,210
like exactly you have to then figure

01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:13,820
that one out so basically you can use

01:44:11,210 --> 01:44:17,110
invisible entities to group items and

01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:17,110
then make sure that they stick together

01:44:18,840 --> 01:44:24,430
which is actually what happens under the

01:44:22,330 --> 01:44:26,290
hood when you load 3d models because a

01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:28,450
lot of 3d models are actually made from

01:44:26,290 --> 01:44:31,960
individual smaller bits and pieces that

01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:33,640
you can address individually and you

01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:35,440
don't see that because it's normally not

01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:37,200
exposed to you but basically it's

01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:39,880
exactly the same thing like you have one

01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:41,530
container entity that is invisible and

01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:43,570
then all the small let's say you have a

01:44:41,530 --> 01:44:45,190
robot right and you have like the two

01:44:43,570 --> 01:44:47,050
arms of the robot and the two legs of

01:44:45,190 --> 01:44:48,460
the robot and the head of the robot but

01:44:47,050 --> 01:44:50,710
you don't want to have to like say like

01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:52,570
I'm now moving the head and the leg and

01:44:50,710 --> 01:44:54,550
the other leg to the same new position

01:44:52,570 --> 01:44:56,260
but you want to kind of have this all go

01:44:54,550 --> 01:44:57,970
in one one place so basically what the

01:44:56,260 --> 01:45:00,160
loader does is it creates an empty

01:44:57,970 --> 01:45:01,989
entity that holds everything the entire

01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:04,239
robot and it only gives you the robot

01:45:01,989 --> 01:45:05,560
but then internally the animations bits

01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:11,610
and pieces actually address the

01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:11,610
individual arms and stuff so yeah

01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:18,000
and yeah sometimes it's like super

01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:20,720
convenient to actually have access to

01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,720
this kind of stuff

01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:49,310
so let's use any other questions by the

01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:51,530
way anything unclear as again let me

01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:53,780
repeat what I said earlier on one second

01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:54,349
this is for you so if something's

01:45:53,780 --> 01:45:56,630
unclear

01:45:54,349 --> 01:45:58,940
I screwed up and I really really love to

01:45:56,630 --> 01:46:00,830
have your question and and figure out a

01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:02,900
how to better explain it next time and

01:46:00,830 --> 01:46:15,170
be make this work for you

01:46:02,900 --> 01:46:19,639
yes very good question so actually we

01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:22,820
haven't touched that topic yet but it is

01:46:19,639 --> 01:46:24,440
I wonder if they have it here yes so as

01:46:22,820 --> 01:46:26,750
you can see like the the camera that

01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:28,670
gets inserted into the into the document

01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:31,790
automatically and we can do our own if

01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:33,710
we want it has not only like a bunch of

01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:36,050
properties itself but it also has two

01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:39,320
components the look controls and the

01:46:36,050 --> 01:46:41,659
WASD controls look how blue controls are

01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:44,389
the the mouse dragging around or if

01:46:41,659 --> 01:46:46,790
you're in VR your head motion so the

01:46:44,389 --> 01:46:48,469
loop controls are what makes the camera

01:46:46,790 --> 01:46:53,270
move with your head if you are using one

01:46:48,469 --> 01:46:55,340
of the VR headsets and the WASD controls

01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:57,619
are literally like moving around in

01:46:55,340 --> 01:46:59,599
space or if you have a headset like the

01:46:57,619 --> 01:47:01,159
HTC vive for the oculus rift that also

01:46:59,599 --> 01:47:02,960
tracks position in the room then it also

01:47:01,159 --> 01:47:05,540
lets you literally walk around in the

01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:09,080
room automatically so and if you want to

01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:11,420
fly that is a setting for the WASD

01:47:09,080 --> 01:47:13,760
controls where you literally just have

01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:16,699
to say like I want to fly so there's

01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:18,550
like a little checkbox here I mean move

01:47:16,699 --> 01:47:22,639
zoom in a little bit

01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:26,690
so you have in the WASD controls you

01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:30,190
have a fly parameter that's the camera

01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:34,070
entity so I selected the camera here and

01:47:30,190 --> 01:47:36,860
it does not yes and now if I'm looking

01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:40,429
up and use W then you see that I'm

01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:42,349
flying up over the so it now actually

01:47:40,429 --> 01:47:46,190
doesn't it no longer restricts my

01:47:42,349 --> 01:47:47,719
movement to the to the to the ground

01:47:46,190 --> 01:47:51,020
plane but it actually lets me move

01:47:47,719 --> 01:47:52,070
whatever be aware that this does not

01:47:51,020 --> 01:47:53,990
work in

01:47:52,070 --> 01:47:55,730
we are for the obvious reasons that if

01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:57,620
you are like having the position data

01:47:55,730 --> 01:48:01,130
from the HTC vive it's gonna use that

01:47:57,620 --> 01:48:02,750
it's not gonna let you fly yes it is

01:48:01,130 --> 01:48:04,130
possible to do that it's just like you

01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:08,990
would have to probably use a different

01:48:04,130 --> 01:48:11,180
way of controlling things and you can I

01:48:08,990 --> 01:48:13,370
think I've never done that but it's

01:48:11,180 --> 01:48:15,650
definitely possible with the influences

01:48:13,370 --> 01:48:17,300
with the cardboard the cardboard you

01:48:15,650 --> 01:48:19,580
don't have position data so you can just

01:48:17,300 --> 01:48:21,890
like move the user where they look for

01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:24,050
instance and then that would work

01:48:21,890 --> 01:48:26,300
probably also there's an interesting

01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:28,010
thing if you are if you're using the URL

01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:28,880
that glitch gives you on your phone

01:48:28,010 --> 01:48:32,870
you're going to see something

01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:35,240
interesting because the the loop

01:48:32,870 --> 01:48:37,510
controls that are automatically used let

01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:42,380
me go to like four units

01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:49,340
- tendency it's interesting one tendency

01:48:42,380 --> 01:48:51,380
a glitch da me you get what's called the

01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:52,910
magic window function which can be like

01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:54,560
super nice or can be super terrible

01:48:52,910 --> 01:48:57,140
because if you are then like turning

01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:58,490
around in the room you're actually

01:48:57,140 --> 01:49:01,550
turning the camera and that's what the

01:48:58,490 --> 01:49:03,290
loop controls do automatically so I can

01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:04,220
show you why that is not necessarily the

01:49:03,290 --> 01:49:06,620
best thing ever

01:49:04,220 --> 01:49:09,800
like it's super cool but it's not always

01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:11,900
what you want so if I now load it takes

01:49:09,800 --> 01:49:13,550
this as zero and basically it shows you

01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:16,430
actually my screen is like super dark I

01:49:13,550 --> 01:49:19,180
should probably crank up this okay right

01:49:16,430 --> 01:49:21,770
you see you see the Sun here right

01:49:19,180 --> 01:49:23,780
everyone sees it and I can now like move

01:49:21,770 --> 01:49:26,000
my phone that's cool but now imagine

01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:27,500
that I'm I don't know I'm walking

01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,580
somewhere now I'm sitting down in the

01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:31,340
Train like this

01:49:28,580 --> 01:49:33,470
I see nothing and I have to actually

01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:35,390
like move my head around or reload the

01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:37,150
page this it's not always what you want

01:49:35,390 --> 01:49:39,890
but it's kind of like an interesting

01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:45,910
interesting thing it's an interesting

01:49:39,890 --> 01:49:45,910
default I would say to start from

01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:51,510
and if you don't want that you would

01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:53,130
have to remove the the look controls and

01:49:51,510 --> 01:49:57,739
find something else that does the right

01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:57,739
thing for you our scene

01:50:05,670 --> 01:50:10,990
okay is everyone back everyone's seeing

01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:13,300
the people next to them or are we are we

01:50:10,990 --> 01:50:14,590
did we lost someone to the to the coffee

01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:16,530
back I think there's like two people

01:50:14,590 --> 01:50:24,310
missing for the coffee break

01:50:16,530 --> 01:50:26,080
bum wait a few more seconds also another

01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:28,810
tip that I keep seeing people make a

01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:30,070
mistake with so you place a camera I'm

01:50:28,810 --> 01:50:31,540
gonna expect that in more detail later

01:50:30,070 --> 01:50:33,910
on but basically what you can do is you

01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:37,270
can say like I want my own camera and I

01:50:33,910 --> 01:50:39,760
can select IAE entity camera and hey

01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:41,950
look at that we have a camera first

01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:43,390
things first if I do that and reload you

01:50:41,950 --> 01:50:45,340
might notice that I can no longer use

01:50:43,390 --> 01:50:47,350
the mouse or the keyboard to move around

01:50:45,340 --> 01:50:49,930
so if you do that like you lose the

01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:52,150
default camera which automatically has

01:50:49,930 --> 01:50:54,490
the controls attached to them but also

01:50:52,150 --> 01:50:56,470
what some people unfortunately like to

01:50:54,490 --> 01:50:59,350
do and this is really unfortunate is

01:50:56,470 --> 01:51:00,970
they position the camera somewhere so

01:50:59,350 --> 01:51:04,660
let's say like I put the camera to like

01:51:00,970 --> 01:51:07,780
I don't know five meter sorry zero zero

01:51:04,660 --> 01:51:10,750
five let's say like that and this is

01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:13,930
nice for a regular like 3d thing and it

01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:17,770
looks okay and great but what do you

01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:22,270
think happens if I'm going into VR is it

01:51:17,770 --> 01:51:24,190
gonna look like that it's not and the

01:51:22,270 --> 01:51:26,920
reason is that if for instance I'm using

01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:28,540
an HTC vive I actually have a position

01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:30,820
in the room right because the HTC vive

01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:32,290
tracks the room so I know where in the

01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:35,170
room I am so that's where the camera

01:51:32,290 --> 01:51:39,430
will automatically move to and even

01:51:35,170 --> 01:51:42,430
worse if I am using a cardboard or a

01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:43,270
Google cardboard as it started a dream

01:51:42,430 --> 01:51:45,370
or something like that

01:51:43,270 --> 01:51:47,290
it's gonna start at me it doesn't have

01:51:45,370 --> 01:51:49,270
position data so it starts at zero zero

01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:52,270
zero and then that's where the camera

01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:54,160
moves so I'll not be where I think I am

01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:55,870
and I've seen that a lot of people like

01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:58,180
mix that up and basically like when like

01:51:55,870 --> 01:52:00,640
oh but my up like my 3d object that I

01:51:58,180 --> 01:52:02,410
found on the Internet's and I'm using is

01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:04,270
unfortunately not positioning around the

01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:06,520
origin so it's like in ten meters over

01:52:04,270 --> 01:52:08,410
there and 50 meters over there so I'm

01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:10,440
just gonna move my camera there instead

01:52:08,410 --> 01:52:13,210
of moving the object around the origin

01:52:10,440 --> 01:52:14,560
with the downside that they it looks

01:52:13,210 --> 01:52:15,700
great on there on the computer and

01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,200
they're like yeah this is awesome this

01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:18,830
is great let's let's send it out and

01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:22,100
then the first person to put it on to

01:52:18,830 --> 01:52:25,670
our goggles is like I'm I'm standing in

01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:27,500
nowhere and back in there at the horizon

01:52:25,670 --> 01:52:29,270
and like fifty meters away from me is

01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:32,420
something but I don't know I don't know

01:52:29,270 --> 01:52:33,800
how to get there right and that's that's

01:52:32,420 --> 01:52:35,960
a problem so you always want to make

01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:38,630
sure that the origin position makes

01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:40,280
sense which means you might want to move

01:52:38,630 --> 01:52:42,230
like your objects and your scenery

01:52:40,280 --> 01:52:49,400
around to make it match the origin

01:52:42,230 --> 01:52:51,770
position you can't guarantee that but it

01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:53,870
is it is more like like the let's let's

01:52:51,770 --> 01:52:55,400
face it like the maximum room size I

01:52:53,870 --> 01:52:57,590
think that the HTC vive supposes like

01:52:55,400 --> 01:53:05,210
6.5 meters so you could theoretically

01:52:57,590 --> 01:53:07,400
just move over but not necessarily but

01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:09,050
like you can you can for instance try to

01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:10,160
figure out the position at start and

01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:11,750
then like move things around a little

01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:14,330
bit or something like that and actually

01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:16,010
I think recently Firefox fixed it and

01:53:14,330 --> 01:53:18,710
now you actually always start at zero

01:53:16,010 --> 01:53:20,060
zero zero and it just adapts to to where

01:53:18,710 --> 01:53:23,120
it should be but I think it wasn't like

01:53:20,060 --> 01:53:24,650
that in the beginning it's a reasonable

01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:27,230
assumption at zero zero zero is good

01:53:24,650 --> 01:53:28,970
point to start with but actually there's

01:53:27,230 --> 01:53:32,270
like VR has a lot of interesting

01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:35,120
challenges one of them being now cool

01:53:32,270 --> 01:53:37,330
you have an HTC vive but a not all your

01:53:35,120 --> 01:53:40,160
users are gonna use that some being on

01:53:37,330 --> 01:53:45,190
cardboard for instance actually most of

01:53:40,160 --> 01:53:48,050
them are probably on cardboard and B

01:53:45,190 --> 01:53:49,640
what happens if I have an HTC vive but I

01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:51,440
only have like two by two meters which I

01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:54,740
think that the minimum is like 1.5

01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:59,950
meters by 1.5 meters space and now I

01:53:54,740 --> 01:54:03,200
have a 10 meter room how does that work

01:53:59,950 --> 01:54:05,060
and the answer to that is this thing

01:54:03,200 --> 01:54:06,560
called teleport controls and you can use

01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:08,120
the controller to actually a teleport

01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:10,640
you somewhere like you point on the

01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:12,950
floor and then you teleport there it's

01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:14,450
better but then you have the UX problem

01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:18,260
that not everyone knows how that works

01:54:14,450 --> 01:54:20,150
it's not obvious how this works and yeah

01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:22,070
it's like a lot of a lot of work has to

01:54:20,150 --> 01:54:27,650
be done so what we experimented with is

01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:29,210
um I don't remember the URL so be be

01:54:27,650 --> 01:54:30,830
nice with me right now because I'm

01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:32,540
basically doing something off script I

01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:33,980
love to like do things that

01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:35,710
just come to my mind but sometimes it

01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:38,360
backfires which is like super annoying

01:54:35,710 --> 01:54:39,620
so then an experiment that I did that

01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:43,550
works with pretty much everything is you

01:54:39,620 --> 01:54:45,770
have this cursor that looks so basically

01:54:43,550 --> 01:54:48,170
works where you look at so you look at

01:54:45,770 --> 01:54:51,170
this thing unfortunately now the model

01:54:48,170 --> 01:54:53,810
is loading and to move I look on the

01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:55,520
ground and it should trigger but it's

01:54:53,810 --> 01:54:59,030
obviously not triggering because screw

01:54:55,520 --> 01:55:02,570
me that's why here we go oh great I

01:54:59,030 --> 01:55:04,580
broke it as I said I go off-script this

01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:05,300
is like the fun thing ah okay now it's

01:55:04,580 --> 01:55:07,430
not broken

01:55:05,300 --> 01:55:09,440
nice that's probably an old version that

01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:10,820
has like a maximum range or something so

01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:12,290
basically you look on the ground and

01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:13,910
then you move there you teleport there

01:55:12,290 --> 01:55:15,500
or should i teleport it through the

01:55:13,910 --> 01:55:18,050
modal so I probably want to teleport

01:55:15,500 --> 01:55:20,210
back real quick and then like look at

01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:23,510
this thing and it goes whoop and I did

01:55:20,210 --> 01:55:25,640
user tests and my sample size is super

01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:29,210
small so don't quote me on it my sample

01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:30,800
says like 20 people and I test with

01:55:29,210 --> 01:55:32,750
people who have never done VR before

01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:35,450
with the cardboard and they understood

01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:37,550
what they had to do so people understand

01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:38,960
this way of navigating as I could so how

01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:41,240
can I move over there just look on the

01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:42,830
ground oh yeah make sense and actually I

01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:44,390
only had to tell like three people that

01:55:42,830 --> 01:55:47,090
and the other people just knew what they

01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:49,280
had to do magically so this is but again

01:55:47,090 --> 01:55:50,990
like 20 the sample size 20 is such

01:55:49,280 --> 01:55:53,080
nothing so basically just don't trust me

01:55:50,990 --> 01:55:55,820
on that one

01:55:53,080 --> 01:55:57,170
but yeah after that it's like a lot of

01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:59,180
stuff going on it's gonna be super

01:55:57,170 --> 01:56:00,710
interesting and with a R for instance

01:55:59,180 --> 01:56:02,930
you don't have that problem because you

01:56:00,710 --> 01:56:06,110
are using the real world as a reference

01:56:02,930 --> 01:56:11,570
point so moving around is not that much

01:56:06,110 --> 01:56:16,340
of an issue and yeah lots of interesting

01:56:11,570 --> 01:56:20,630
user experience things going on and the

01:56:16,340 --> 01:56:22,730
best moment I had was when when I felt

01:56:20,630 --> 01:56:24,320
so bad for like making a bunch of UX

01:56:22,730 --> 01:56:28,280
mistakes and one of our projects and

01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:30,980
then I went to a conference where they

01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:34,820
had someone demoing VR and had like a

01:56:30,980 --> 01:56:36,440
room escape game and the user had five

01:56:34,820 --> 01:56:38,240
minutes to escape from the room and

01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:40,220
pretty much every user that tried it

01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:42,920
took like three minutes to figure out

01:56:40,220 --> 01:56:45,170
how teleport works and and they were

01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:45,980
like super super confused about

01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:47,660
everything I guess

01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:49,820
how do i this is how I move all right

01:56:47,660 --> 01:56:53,890
okay oh all my time is over already

01:56:49,820 --> 01:56:56,480
what and I'm like yes it's not just me

01:56:53,890 --> 01:57:01,520
so you have teleport control Zyra super

01:56:56,480 --> 01:57:04,040
nice but not obvious to people yet we're

01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:07,489
gonna see that also by the way how many

01:57:04,040 --> 01:57:10,130
how many let's say oculus rifts to use

01:57:07,489 --> 01:57:12,700
thing have been sold in 2016 I don't

01:57:10,130 --> 01:57:16,930
have the numbers for 2017 unfortunately

01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:23,200
like worldwide just a rough ballpark a

01:57:16,930 --> 01:57:23,200
million ten million okay less what

01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:27,380
hundreds of thousands is around the

01:57:26,060 --> 01:57:29,150
right ballpark it's like I think it's

01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:33,080
like four hundred thousands or something

01:57:29,150 --> 01:57:37,239
HTC vive global sales in 2016 were I

01:57:33,080 --> 01:57:39,590
think like five hundred thousand ish

01:57:37,239 --> 01:57:42,070
how many card posts do you think have

01:57:39,590 --> 01:57:42,070
been sold

01:57:45,070 --> 01:57:50,090
and I have a guess in them what like

01:57:47,930 --> 01:57:54,320
what ball is it hundred thousands or is

01:57:50,090 --> 01:58:01,280
it millions or how many millions do you

01:57:54,320 --> 01:58:04,820
think less than 10 has been 82 million

01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:06,140
devices in the market and that's only

01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:09,140
like the official channels because you

01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:11,120
can get like weird knockoff things from

01:58:09,140 --> 01:58:13,040
Aliexpress or something like that and

01:58:11,120 --> 01:58:15,050
yeah they don't count I think so that's

01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:16,610
like it's it's bananas so this is like

01:58:15,050 --> 01:58:19,610
the reality or has been at least the

01:58:16,610 --> 01:58:22,310
reality of VR in like 2016 beginning of

01:58:19,610 --> 01:58:24,140
2017 I still haven't found numbers for

01:58:22,310 --> 01:58:25,670
2017 so I'm really really looking

01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:27,980
forward to see when the numbers come out

01:58:25,670 --> 01:58:29,390
for the four last year because I expect

01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:33,350
that to change a little bit but it's

01:58:29,390 --> 01:58:35,390
like just just seeing that let me see if

01:58:33,350 --> 01:58:36,860
I actually I have slides for tomorrow so

01:58:35,390 --> 01:58:39,560
you're gonna get like a super sneak peek

01:58:36,860 --> 01:58:42,590
of what you're so totally not supposed

01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:45,860
to see right now but I just think the

01:58:42,590 --> 01:58:47,540
graphic is just like beautiful I hope

01:58:45,860 --> 01:58:50,510
that I have it in this version of the

01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:53,150
talk I might have removed it yeah damn

01:58:50,510 --> 01:58:54,650
it I don't have it in this one in that

01:58:53,150 --> 01:58:57,530
case you see something that no one else

01:58:54,650 --> 01:58:59,030
is gonna see I'm gonna go to an older

01:58:57,530 --> 01:59:04,280
version of this talk because I'm pretty

01:58:59,030 --> 01:59:06,350
sure I had a chart somewhere that was

01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:08,990
like super fun to look at because it's

01:59:06,350 --> 01:59:09,200
just like bananas where is it ah here we

01:59:08,990 --> 01:59:14,030
go

01:59:09,200 --> 01:59:14,900
yes no no no no no no don't just jump

01:59:14,030 --> 01:59:16,940
ahead of myself

01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:19,250
okay here we go so like this is this has

01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:22,790
been like the VR market in 2016

01:59:19,250 --> 01:59:24,590
right you have like oculus rift HTC vive

01:59:22,790 --> 01:59:26,060
playstation we are actually doing pretty

01:59:24,590 --> 01:59:29,000
well daydream has just entered the

01:59:26,060 --> 01:59:30,830
market that that year so it's like this

01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:33,290
is comparing a full year against like

01:59:30,830 --> 01:59:35,930
maybe a quarter maximum and then you

01:59:33,290 --> 01:59:38,510
have like the gear VR that outsells them

01:59:35,930 --> 01:59:41,830
is like 2.2 million units and then you

01:59:38,510 --> 01:59:46,280
have like the cart whoops the cardboard

01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:47,840
slightly more this is like pretty pretty

01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:51,640
impressive I might actually enter these

01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:51,640
slides back into my talk for tomorrow

01:59:52,380 --> 02:00:01,510
so then at most yeah because there's

01:59:59,380 --> 02:00:02,650
older versions of car parts that do not

02:00:01,510 --> 02:00:04,420
have a button like they have this

02:00:02,650 --> 02:00:07,900
magnetic thing that basically works with

02:00:04,420 --> 02:00:10,090
no phone and yes we have one button as

02:00:07,900 --> 02:00:11,590
an interaction and obviously the gaze of

02:00:10,090 --> 02:00:13,780
the user where the users looking at and

02:00:11,590 --> 02:00:22,920
like this is an established pattern of

02:00:13,780 --> 02:00:25,480
having a gaze cursor oh yeah absolutely

02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:26,710
and it doesn't have position tracking so

02:00:25,480 --> 02:00:28,329
it doesn't know where in the space you

02:00:26,710 --> 02:00:31,119
are so you can't do like whoa I'm gonna

02:00:28,329 --> 02:00:32,650
know look down here that doesn't work it

02:00:31,119 --> 02:00:35,230
only has the orientation so it only

02:00:32,650 --> 02:00:38,710
looks knows where you look at so that's

02:00:35,230 --> 02:00:41,800
like yeah that's the harsh reality so I

02:00:38,710 --> 02:00:44,400
mean it's kind of interesting to see

02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:47,409
like a lot of people are building

02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:50,619
building VR applications specifically

02:00:47,409 --> 02:00:52,750
for like one type of hardware and then

02:00:50,619 --> 02:00:54,309
it's mostly like the high-end thing it's

02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:55,900
like oh yeah we has this amazing demo

02:00:54,309 --> 02:00:59,250
for oculus rift on that core what

02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:59,250
happens when I open that in my cardboard

02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:08,530
right so it's like it's not a frame has

02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:11,079
this lovely thing called progressive

02:01:08,530 --> 02:01:13,119
controls so they are basically like

02:01:11,079 --> 02:01:15,190
upgrading themselves and you get like

02:01:13,119 --> 02:01:17,320
more interaction so for instance for

02:01:15,190 --> 02:01:18,820
click it figures out oh this is the

02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:20,559
thing that doesn't have any controllers

02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:22,059
attached to it so I'm just gonna use the

02:01:20,559 --> 02:01:24,219
gate so you have a little cursor that

02:01:22,059 --> 02:01:26,440
like zooms in on to a point and then

02:01:24,219 --> 02:01:28,750
actually it fires a click event on the

02:01:26,440 --> 02:01:30,789
object that you have looked at last and

02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:33,010
that's like super nice and if you then

02:01:30,789 --> 02:01:34,510
have a cursor like yes sorry controller

02:01:33,010 --> 02:01:35,769
then it goes like oh there's a

02:01:34,510 --> 02:01:37,119
controller that's like super nice and if

02:01:35,769 --> 02:01:39,670
it's like a cardboard controller you

02:01:37,119 --> 02:01:41,199
only get one thing so I can then

02:01:39,670 --> 02:01:42,840
actually point at something and like

02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:45,460
press the button and it's a click event

02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:47,019
so the rest of the code doesn't care and

02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:48,489
then I have two controllers because I

02:01:47,019 --> 02:01:49,119
have an oculus rift and I'm like cool

02:01:48,489 --> 02:01:51,070
it's nice

02:01:49,119 --> 02:01:52,599
whew you basically have like a laser

02:01:51,070 --> 02:01:54,880
kind of thing going from the controllers

02:01:52,599 --> 02:01:56,889
and you're like okay click and it does a

02:01:54,880 --> 02:02:00,099
click event so the rest of the code

02:01:56,889 --> 02:02:01,960
still doesn't care I'm not gonna lie

02:02:00,099 --> 02:02:03,940
it's not always that easy because some

02:02:01,960 --> 02:02:05,380
some interactions are just not easy to

02:02:03,940 --> 02:02:07,540
map like for instance when you have some

02:02:05,380 --> 02:02:09,070
may edit things if you have two

02:02:07,540 --> 02:02:10,480
controllers and you know that then you

02:02:09,070 --> 02:02:12,159
can just go like yeah and I'm gonna drag

02:02:10,480 --> 02:02:16,270
these out how do you do that on a

02:02:12,159 --> 02:02:20,350
cardboard not easy does not naturally

02:02:16,270 --> 02:02:21,909
come like immediately obviously but you

02:02:20,350 --> 02:02:24,130
can detect what you've got and then

02:02:21,909 --> 02:02:26,260
there's like things I saw I made that

02:02:24,130 --> 02:02:28,090
mistake a lot of times a lot of times

02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:29,800
and I got myself really angry with

02:02:28,090 --> 02:02:32,770
myself so that's kind of cool because I

02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:34,870
learned something there when I build

02:02:32,770 --> 02:02:36,489
something for the HTC vive I was like I

02:02:34,870 --> 02:02:40,840
have two controllers I'm gonna make use

02:02:36,489 --> 02:02:44,320
of two controllers but they are wireless

02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:47,620
controllers so they do have a battery in

02:02:44,320 --> 02:02:49,810
them so this one might actually run out

02:02:47,620 --> 02:02:51,699
of power and ventually and they do not

02:02:49,810 --> 02:02:54,310
always like need to be recharged at the

02:02:51,699 --> 02:02:56,560
same time so I went ran into a lot of

02:02:54,310 --> 02:02:58,900
situations where I knew the hardware I

02:02:56,560 --> 02:03:00,670
would be using but I assume that I have

02:02:58,900 --> 02:03:01,900
two controllers when I really only had

02:03:00,670 --> 02:03:04,510
one because the other one needed two

02:03:01,900 --> 02:03:10,780
recharging so I was like and now I use

02:03:04,510 --> 02:03:12,730
this second controller which is and then

02:03:10,780 --> 02:03:16,150
you go out and like the entire immersion

02:03:12,730 --> 02:03:18,909
is broken so not very good so don't

02:03:16,150 --> 02:03:21,310
assume things like number of controllers

02:03:18,909 --> 02:03:23,820
or a system that you're on assume

02:03:21,310 --> 02:03:26,440
cardboard and then enhance based on that

02:03:23,820 --> 02:03:29,110
unless you really really really really

02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:31,630
know this the setup that you've got so

02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:34,030
for instance I built a demo for google

02:03:31,630 --> 02:03:35,830
chrome dev summit where I knew that I

02:03:34,030 --> 02:03:37,360
would have like recharged controllers

02:03:35,830 --> 02:03:39,010
all the time because it's basically a

02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:42,010
short demo and straight back to the

02:03:39,010 --> 02:03:44,770
charger and I had an HTC vive so I

02:03:42,010 --> 02:03:46,659
actually just optimized for that but

02:03:44,770 --> 02:03:49,030
it's not a good idea to do that for that

02:03:46,659 --> 02:03:51,370
VR because the promise of APR is it

02:03:49,030 --> 02:03:52,900
responsively response to what the

02:03:51,370 --> 02:03:55,179
environment you're in and it works

02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:56,830
everywhere and if you're not making sure

02:03:55,179 --> 02:03:58,570
that it does then you're probably

02:03:56,830 --> 02:04:00,580
letting your users down which is not

02:03:58,570 --> 02:04:04,840
something that you want to do alright

02:04:00,580 --> 02:04:06,670
moving swiftly on any any other

02:04:04,840 --> 02:04:10,510
questions anything you're wondering

02:04:06,670 --> 02:04:13,870
about anything that's not working No

02:04:10,510 --> 02:04:15,340
okay well let's let's go back to the

02:04:13,870 --> 02:04:17,380
camera thing that I was talking about

02:04:15,340 --> 02:04:19,560
real quick and then we're gonna have a

02:04:17,380 --> 02:04:23,620
look at lighting as well

02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:25,719
so as I said this weird thing here with

02:04:23,620 --> 02:04:28,060
the with the orange lines and the white

02:04:25,719 --> 02:04:30,250
line that's our camera and that's nice

02:04:28,060 --> 02:04:32,699
because if I'm automatically adds this

02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:35,650
for us if we are not doing it so I can

02:04:32,699 --> 02:04:39,610
click on the camera in the left hand

02:04:35,650 --> 02:04:43,480
side scene graph and then on the right

02:04:39,610 --> 02:04:45,100
hand side the the entity pops up and we

02:04:43,480 --> 02:04:47,980
have like a bunch of components we have

02:04:45,100 --> 02:04:49,960
like a camera component that has the

02:04:47,980 --> 02:04:51,880
field of view of 80 degrees we can

02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:54,250
change that so let's say like 60 degrees

02:04:51,880 --> 02:04:55,540
and we just have a like titer field of

02:04:54,250 --> 02:04:58,000
view it doesn't really matter that much

02:04:55,540 --> 02:04:59,680
I would just leave it like that we can

02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:02,170
specify the user height so if for some

02:04:59,680 --> 02:05:03,489
reason we are mostly around people who

02:05:02,170 --> 02:05:06,790
have one meter eighty then we just

02:05:03,489 --> 02:05:08,410
change it to 1 meter 80 but it also has

02:05:06,790 --> 02:05:10,239
added other components so it's not only

02:05:08,410 --> 02:05:13,510
in a camera component it's also look

02:05:10,239 --> 02:05:15,310
controls and WASD controls and look

02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:17,620
controls and WASD controls are

02:05:15,310 --> 02:05:19,510
components that make the camera respond

02:05:17,620 --> 02:05:22,660
to input so we can move

02:05:19,510 --> 02:05:25,300
WASD we can use the WASD keys to move

02:05:22,660 --> 02:05:27,900
around and we can use the loop controls

02:05:25,300 --> 02:05:31,870
to use the mouse to drag around or in VR

02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:33,820
this would then also be be using their

02:05:31,870 --> 02:05:37,090
orientation so if I put my phone into

02:05:33,820 --> 02:05:39,190
into a VR headset this one does not know

02:05:37,090 --> 02:05:40,810
where in the room I am but it knows if

02:05:39,190 --> 02:05:41,980
I'm looking in that direction on that

02:05:40,810 --> 02:05:44,800
direction so that's what the look

02:05:41,980 --> 02:05:47,830
controls do if you disable the loop

02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:52,120
controls the user can turn their heads

02:05:47,830 --> 02:05:53,620
you can do that but prepare to have a

02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:57,640
bucket around because people then

02:05:53,620 --> 02:06:01,960
usually vomit it's a bucket full of fun

02:05:57,640 --> 02:06:03,550
to do that you can also create your own

02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:05,710
camera you don't have to rely on the

02:06:03,550 --> 02:06:11,050
camera that FM gives you so let's do

02:06:05,710 --> 02:06:12,880
like an an a entity camera here a entity

02:06:11,050 --> 02:06:17,230
camera so you're not gonna see a

02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:23,020
difference except for the problem that

02:06:17,230 --> 02:06:25,630
you can no longer move with WASD or turn

02:06:23,020 --> 02:06:27,790
with the mouse or even in VR you would

02:06:25,630 --> 02:06:31,150
just like get the straight look and it's

02:06:27,790 --> 02:06:32,600
not gonna do anything useful it also

02:06:31,150 --> 02:06:34,250
allows you parameter

02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:37,430
like the user height that I specified

02:06:34,250 --> 02:06:43,490
early on so we can give it like the user

02:06:37,430 --> 02:06:47,060
height of 1 meter 60 or 1 meter 80 or

02:06:43,490 --> 02:06:50,060
whatever notice here there's an

02:06:47,060 --> 02:06:54,920
important bit right there which is I

02:06:50,060 --> 02:06:56,660
would always use this instead of because

02:06:54,920 --> 02:07:00,200
you can basically do what you could do

02:06:56,660 --> 02:07:04,010
and you should not do is you could do

02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:07,840
like position 0 0 0 1 meter 60 0 right

02:07:04,010 --> 02:07:12,470
and it kind of looks the same right

02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:14,300
except that if you're now going into VR

02:07:12,470 --> 02:07:17,570
you're gonna see something weird happen

02:07:14,300 --> 02:07:20,540
and what's gonna happen there is that in

02:07:17,570 --> 02:07:23,480
VR it assumes or it tries to get the

02:07:20,540 --> 02:07:24,950
actual camera position in what X sorry

02:07:23,480 --> 02:07:27,200
in Y direction and also in the other

02:07:24,950 --> 02:07:28,580
directions if possible and what happens

02:07:27,200 --> 02:07:30,650
if I do it in the cardboard or in a

02:07:28,580 --> 02:07:33,590
Google daydream or Google sorry Samsung

02:07:30,650 --> 02:07:36,440
gear VR it's gonna set it to 1 meter 60

02:07:33,590 --> 02:07:38,330
that's like a same default or whatever

02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:41,300
we set in user height that's gonna be

02:07:38,330 --> 02:07:44,450
used so if I put my camera on to 1 meter

02:07:41,300 --> 02:07:47,780
60 in position it's gonna add 1 meter 60

02:07:44,450 --> 02:07:50,890
on top of that so then we have 3 meter

02:07:47,780 --> 02:07:53,180
20 tall which is very unusual for humans

02:07:50,890 --> 02:07:54,560
for most humans at least it's gonna be

02:07:53,180 --> 02:07:56,960
an interesting experience but unless

02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:59,150
that's what you want that's gonna be

02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:04,370
weird and also if you have the actual

02:07:59,150 --> 02:08:06,500
height it is kind of nice to to be

02:08:04,370 --> 02:08:09,590
actually like as tall as you are within

02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:10,880
the real life so oculus and HTC actually

02:08:09,590 --> 02:08:13,130
give you this information so you should

02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:15,830
use it and use ur height takes that into

02:08:13,130 --> 02:08:18,260
account position does not right so you

02:08:15,830 --> 02:08:20,390
don't want to do that you want to leave

02:08:18,260 --> 02:08:21,560
it where it is you can also put

02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:25,490
obviously you can position it anywhere

02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:27,800
else like I can do like 0 0 - actually

02:08:25,490 --> 02:08:30,740
you know 10 just plus 10 so you go

02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:32,960
really really far away but I said that

02:08:30,740 --> 02:08:34,340
earlier on but I'm gonna repeat it for

02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:36,830
people grabbing a coffee in the meantime

02:08:34,340 --> 02:08:39,800
if you do that the problem is that once

02:08:36,830 --> 02:08:41,960
you start VR you are actually at 0 0 0

02:08:39,800 --> 02:08:43,300
with the camera or even like in the room

02:08:41,960 --> 02:08:47,409
if you move around the room

02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:49,090
we are gear supports that so what's

02:08:47,409 --> 02:08:51,309
gonna happen is it's gonna not look like

02:08:49,090 --> 02:08:52,840
you expect it to look like so what you

02:08:51,309 --> 02:08:55,360
should be doing is you should be keeping

02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:56,980
the camera at zero zero zero and assume

02:08:55,360 --> 02:09:00,159
that that's like the reasonable thing so

02:08:56,980 --> 02:09:04,000
we can leave this out actually we can

02:09:00,159 --> 02:09:05,949
also do animations with the camera so

02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:12,360
let's do that let's just for shits and

02:09:05,949 --> 02:09:18,489
giggles a animation attribute rotation

02:09:12,360 --> 02:09:24,099
to zero 360 zero duration five seconds

02:09:18,489 --> 02:09:29,099
and now our camera turns we if your

02:09:24,099 --> 02:09:29,099
users using the are goggles and that

02:09:30,150 --> 02:09:36,250
yeah that's that's where vomiting

02:09:33,340 --> 02:09:38,590
happens so don't do that don't move the

02:09:36,250 --> 02:09:43,239
camera you can do that as long as you

02:09:38,590 --> 02:09:46,719
know that you're not in VR and you can

02:09:43,239 --> 02:09:48,760
check that you can actually I would have

02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:50,949
to check I'm relatively sure that it's

02:09:48,760 --> 02:09:56,530
on the a scene actually there is a

02:09:50,949 --> 02:09:58,840
property somewhere I don't know but this

02:09:56,530 --> 02:10:00,579
it's in the docs that's that's check the

02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:06,070
docs because this is actually important

02:10:00,579 --> 02:10:08,440
to know my brains not working that well

02:10:06,070 --> 02:10:12,540
when it comes to remembering things so I

02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:15,489
need documentation for everything it has

02:10:12,540 --> 02:10:19,570
it sends you events that's for sure and

02:10:15,489 --> 02:10:21,099
I'm pretty sure it also has a it has a

02:10:19,570 --> 02:10:24,280
component that actually gives you the

02:10:21,099 --> 02:10:27,190
information but this is the wrong thing

02:10:24,280 --> 02:10:28,630
it does definitely have a property

02:10:27,190 --> 02:10:31,599
somewhere but you could listen for

02:10:28,630 --> 02:10:34,380
events as well I'd enter VR and exit VR

02:10:31,599 --> 02:10:37,889
gives you definitely this information

02:10:34,380 --> 02:10:37,889
that you need

02:10:39,370 --> 02:10:44,780
isn't it giving us alright so you want

02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:47,230
to listen to these events to figure that

02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:49,550
one out we do that for camera tours

02:10:47,230 --> 02:10:53,330
because it's just like it's not a good

02:10:49,550 --> 02:10:55,700
pattern to never in VR never you move

02:10:53,330 --> 02:10:57,350
the users point of view unless they

02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:59,780
expect it to move so if you have like a

02:10:57,350 --> 02:11:01,340
rollercoaster ride it is fine because

02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:03,320
you have a reference point that moves do

02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:05,450
not just move the camera around move an

02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:07,820
object around the user be it like a

02:11:05,450 --> 02:11:10,520
carriage or a train coach or whatever

02:11:07,820 --> 02:11:12,770
like anything an elevator is fine as

02:11:10,520 --> 02:11:15,770
well just never ever just move the user

02:11:12,770 --> 02:11:17,300
without the user willingly doing that

02:11:15,770 --> 02:11:19,490
and that starts with things like

02:11:17,300 --> 02:11:22,460
teleporting is always already a like a

02:11:19,490 --> 02:11:24,950
gray area cool now if we want to get

02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:27,920
back like the look controls and WASD

02:11:24,950 --> 02:11:32,060
controls we just add them like this SD

02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:33,770
controls so now it's basically the back

02:11:32,060 --> 02:11:35,690
to the original functionality so I can

02:11:33,770 --> 02:11:39,140
look around with a mouse and with

02:11:35,690 --> 02:11:40,790
keyboard I moved and on the VR headset

02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:43,340
like these that we have here we would

02:11:40,790 --> 02:11:44,720
still be able to like look around but we

02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:46,610
wouldn't be able to move actually

02:11:44,720 --> 02:11:48,700
because it doesn't have position

02:11:46,610 --> 02:11:51,380
information these people as are these

02:11:48,700 --> 02:11:56,230
headsets do not have position

02:11:51,380 --> 02:12:00,410
information unfortunately we can also

02:11:56,230 --> 02:12:01,580
control some of the parameters so for

02:12:00,410 --> 02:12:03,620
instance you might have noticed that

02:12:01,580 --> 02:12:06,380
when we have the WASD controls we are

02:12:03,620 --> 02:12:08,900
always moving on the same plane so we're

02:12:06,380 --> 02:12:11,150
not actually moving up or down and this

02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:13,430
entire like user height missing actually

02:12:11,150 --> 02:12:16,340
makes me nervous so that just like

02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:18,200
editing so now we can only move like

02:12:16,340 --> 02:12:19,790
forward and backward and left and right

02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:23,120
we can't move up or down like we can't

02:12:19,790 --> 02:12:26,500
fly around what we can do in the WASD

02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:29,030
controls it has a fly property or

02:12:26,500 --> 02:12:32,270
attribute that allows us to basically

02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:34,430
change that and if we look up and use W

02:12:32,270 --> 02:12:36,650
then we're actually flying up if we look

02:12:34,430 --> 02:12:38,060
down and use W we fly down and stuff

02:12:36,650 --> 02:12:41,330
like that so now we have like flying

02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:44,480
controls that does not mean that in VR

02:12:41,330 --> 02:12:45,890
you can fly unfortunately you would have

02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:47,510
to implement that yourself I don't think

02:12:45,890 --> 02:12:50,110
there's anything that doesn't

02:12:47,510 --> 02:12:50,110
automatically

02:12:50,870 --> 02:12:53,870
okay

02:12:54,680 --> 02:12:58,840
remove some of the things here so

02:13:02,950 --> 02:13:10,970
there's also lighting coming into play

02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:14,780
here as I said like 3GS AB nothing a

02:13:10,970 --> 02:13:17,150
frame automatically adds lights so we

02:13:14,780 --> 02:13:18,230
don't have to which is nice but maybe we

02:13:17,150 --> 02:13:20,000
want to have different lighting

02:13:18,230 --> 02:13:24,350
conditions so what we can do is we can

02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:26,360
do like a entity / a entity and then we

02:13:24,350 --> 02:13:29,330
give it a light how do we do that well

02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:32,600
that's a component for that so we do

02:13:29,330 --> 02:13:36,260
like light now we have to figure out

02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:40,270
what type of light we want and one of

02:13:36,260 --> 02:13:40,270
the easiest types is the ambient light

02:13:41,500 --> 02:13:45,380
ambient light is basically like daylight

02:13:43,940 --> 02:13:47,900
it doesn't come from a certain direction

02:13:45,380 --> 02:13:49,850
it's just like all around us and it

02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:52,910
shouldn't be too bright because it's

02:13:49,850 --> 02:13:57,320
gonna apply to all the things all the

02:13:52,910 --> 02:13:59,000
faces all the objects in our scene so

02:13:57,320 --> 02:14:05,540
what we can do is like we can give it a

02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:07,310
color let's say blue now this is really

02:14:05,540 --> 02:14:11,540
really dark blue so that's not the best

02:14:07,310 --> 02:14:16,910
idea I had so let's actually give it a

02:14:11,540 --> 02:14:18,590
slightly brighter I don't know yeah it's

02:14:16,910 --> 02:14:21,140
actually not a good not not a bad idea

02:14:18,590 --> 02:14:23,210
let's let's try this eye on so now you

02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:25,310
see something curious it's actually not

02:14:23,210 --> 02:14:27,950
that easy to spot on on the projector

02:14:25,310 --> 02:14:29,750
maybe if I go closer no it's actually

02:14:27,950 --> 02:14:32,120
really really hard to see but on your

02:14:29,750 --> 02:14:34,730
screen the Sun is now like greenish and

02:14:32,120 --> 02:14:37,840
that's because the the blue well

02:14:34,730 --> 02:14:41,690
actually this is see on lights mixes

02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:43,610
with the color of the sun's we like so

02:14:41,690 --> 02:14:45,710
we have like this orange color and see

02:14:43,610 --> 02:14:49,610
on mixing into this like weird greenish

02:14:45,710 --> 02:14:51,530
color if I would instead of using this

02:14:49,610 --> 02:14:53,350
this particular image if I would use a

02:14:51,530 --> 02:14:59,600
color as a plane color let's say like

02:14:53,350 --> 02:15:01,730
come on I use color white then the Sun

02:14:59,600 --> 02:15:05,290
is no it's actually not white it's

02:15:01,730 --> 02:15:05,290
actually using the light color

02:15:08,249 --> 02:15:12,710
right

02:15:10,239 --> 02:15:15,559
and you also see something else if I

02:15:12,710 --> 02:15:18,920
move around the Sun as I as I mentioned

02:15:15,559 --> 02:15:20,389
earlier the problem with the ambient

02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:23,239
light is it doesn't have any direction

02:15:20,389 --> 02:15:24,739
it's just everywhere and that's usually

02:15:23,239 --> 02:15:26,840
a good idea but you should never like to

02:15:24,739 --> 02:15:28,460
use super bright colors if you need an

02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:32,889
ambient light that gives you some colors

02:15:28,460 --> 02:15:37,880
probably use like a dark ish gray and

02:15:32,889 --> 02:15:39,500
then use other lights on top of it by

02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:42,079
the way if you want like a night scene

02:15:39,500 --> 02:15:45,409
you can also abuse this by actually

02:15:42,079 --> 02:15:47,389
looks like putting a black light in so

02:15:45,409 --> 02:15:49,520
this is now a night scene because it

02:15:47,389 --> 02:15:52,969
doesn't actually have anything that's

02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:58,300
like driving it so what if I don't use

02:15:52,969 --> 02:15:58,300
that if I use it like a darker blue I

02:15:59,349 --> 02:16:04,040
say actually still like too bright let's

02:16:01,730 --> 02:16:05,540
use like a super dark blue yeah so now

02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:07,070
we have like a light scene and you don't

02:16:05,540 --> 02:16:08,059
see anything that's not not very

02:16:07,070 --> 02:16:09,949
interesting right

02:16:08,059 --> 02:16:12,290
so what we probably want to do is we

02:16:09,949 --> 02:16:13,699
want to want to use more interesting

02:16:12,290 --> 02:16:14,900
lights let's let's start with a point

02:16:13,699 --> 02:16:17,300
light let's start with a point light

02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:18,980
that we position we don't have any

02:16:17,300 --> 02:16:20,840
positioning here so that where the

02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:22,969
camera is below the camera actually but

02:16:20,840 --> 02:16:24,920
it's like where we are and we give it a

02:16:22,969 --> 02:16:28,429
color let's say see on just because we

02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:31,880
had light that early on I shouldn't use

02:16:28,429 --> 02:16:34,429
like the the hash type point and then we

02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:37,069
see that now we actually do have like a

02:16:34,429 --> 02:16:40,939
light bulb that is below the camera that

02:16:37,069 --> 02:16:43,609
lights straight onto our well son if you

02:16:40,939 --> 02:16:46,309
want to call it a Sun actually let's

02:16:43,609 --> 02:16:49,460
let's make the Sun yellow again just you

02:16:46,309 --> 02:16:51,620
know now the see on color shines on the

02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:53,809
yellow sphere making it green it's

02:16:51,620 --> 02:16:56,300
probably not exactly what we want so we

02:16:53,809 --> 02:16:59,170
can make this white and then it looks

02:16:56,300 --> 02:16:59,170
like what we would expect

02:17:02,769 --> 02:17:06,189
that's an interesting one not an ambien

02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:07,689
like that you could put a point light

02:17:06,189 --> 02:17:12,870
into the Sun so what I can do is I can

02:17:07,689 --> 02:17:15,160
take this make it a child of the Sun and

02:17:12,870 --> 02:17:16,570
it's not quite what you would expect

02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:18,790
probably we're gonna see that in a

02:17:16,570 --> 02:17:23,260
second so this is not what you expect

02:17:18,790 --> 02:17:25,809
right no and what the reason why this is

02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:28,450
is because we have a problem so how how

02:17:25,809 --> 02:17:30,910
does lighting actually work let me let

02:17:28,450 --> 02:17:32,260
me quickly it's gonna be in the this is

02:17:30,910 --> 02:17:34,240
one this is one of my favorite

02:17:32,260 --> 02:17:36,040
explanations because it's actually

02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:38,920
pretty simple but it's it's not obvious

02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:41,170
so how do we calculate light well let's

02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:44,200
have a have an example here we have a

02:17:41,170 --> 02:17:46,990
light source there and we have a surface

02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:48,670
here right and now obviously I have it

02:17:46,990 --> 02:17:50,710
like black but technically this is like

02:17:48,670 --> 02:17:53,559
fully bright as bright as the projectors

02:17:50,710 --> 02:17:56,320
makes it based on the light coming from

02:17:53,559 --> 02:17:58,840
the projector hitting this fully frontal

02:17:56,320 --> 02:18:00,840
now what does fully from so mean well if

02:17:58,840 --> 02:18:04,030
you think about it this surface here is

02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:06,240
facing in that direction and the light

02:18:04,030 --> 02:18:08,500
coming in faces in that direction

02:18:06,240 --> 02:18:11,139
there's a hundred eighty degrees between

02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:12,790
the two so it's like full-on it's a

02:18:11,139 --> 02:18:14,439
hundred percent light of the light that

02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:16,960
comes from that direction hits this

02:18:14,439 --> 02:18:19,290
surface now what would happen if I would

02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:22,660
start to move the surface like this

02:18:19,290 --> 02:18:24,519
right now it's no longer the same now we

02:18:22,660 --> 02:18:27,670
have a different angle now we have like

02:18:24,519 --> 02:18:30,070
the light coming this way the surface

02:18:27,670 --> 02:18:31,330
facing this way so we have 45 degrees so

02:18:30,070 --> 02:18:32,649
we only have like half of the light

02:18:31,330 --> 02:18:35,110
actually hitting it if you think about

02:18:32,649 --> 02:18:37,090
it it's like half of the lights kind of

02:18:35,110 --> 02:18:38,500
like goes bonk and go somewhere else and

02:18:37,090 --> 02:18:41,500
then only half of the light actually

02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:44,530
comes back to our eyes if I would like

02:18:41,500 --> 02:18:46,149
lift it up entirely yeah then I can't

02:18:44,530 --> 02:18:48,370
actually do that far but basically if I

02:18:46,149 --> 02:18:50,320
would lift it up to 90 degrees so that

02:18:48,370 --> 02:18:52,570
his face is this way and the light comes

02:18:50,320 --> 02:18:56,110
from here the surface is not being

02:18:52,570 --> 02:18:58,570
affected by the light at all now how do

02:18:56,110 --> 02:19:01,510
we model this in computers because we

02:18:58,570 --> 02:19:03,160
can't actually like you know shoot light

02:19:01,510 --> 02:19:04,510
rays and then see what happens in the

02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:06,130
real world and then somehow like map

02:19:04,510 --> 02:19:08,050
that know what we have to do is we have

02:19:06,130 --> 02:19:09,849
to figure this one out differently and

02:19:08,050 --> 02:19:11,649
what you can do is it's relatively easy

02:19:09,849 --> 02:19:13,689
to figure out based on their geometry

02:19:11,649 --> 02:19:13,969
it's not too hard to figure out where

02:19:13,689 --> 02:19:16,700
some

02:19:13,969 --> 02:19:20,330
things facing the direction something is

02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:22,309
facing is called the normal vector right

02:19:20,330 --> 02:19:25,279
so if we if we go into our coordinate

02:19:22,309 --> 02:19:27,279
system X being like this Y being like

02:19:25,279 --> 02:19:31,550
this and zette being like this the light

02:19:27,279 --> 02:19:33,019
has a vector of minus one and like zero

02:19:31,550 --> 02:19:35,090
zero because it doesn't go to the left

02:19:33,019 --> 02:19:37,040
or to the right to up or down so

02:19:35,090 --> 02:19:38,660
basically zero zero and then minus one

02:19:37,040 --> 02:19:40,849
because it goes in this direction the

02:19:38,660 --> 02:19:42,170
length of the vector doesn't matter so

02:19:40,849 --> 02:19:43,880
we're just gonna set the length to one

02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:45,290
we normalize the vector that's what's it

02:19:43,880 --> 02:19:47,929
called and then we have the normal

02:19:45,290 --> 02:19:52,479
vector from the surface going the exact

02:19:47,929 --> 02:19:55,189
opposite way this is like zero zero one

02:19:52,479 --> 02:19:57,800
so now what we can do is we can figure

02:19:55,189 --> 02:19:59,720
out from the textbooks or Google how to

02:19:57,800 --> 02:20:01,640
actually calculate the angle between the

02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:04,520
two and then we have the angle so we

02:20:01,640 --> 02:20:07,670
would know okay 100 degrees and we want

02:20:04,520 --> 02:20:09,770
a hundred percent of the light if we

02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:12,140
have 90 degrees we want zero percent of

02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:15,529
the lights and if we have 45 degrees we

02:20:12,140 --> 02:20:18,529
want fifty percent of the light how do

02:20:15,529 --> 02:20:20,450
we model this in an equation hmm if you

02:20:18,529 --> 02:20:23,210
do a bit of trigonometry and look at

02:20:20,450 --> 02:20:25,399
like circles and Pythagoras and all that

02:20:23,210 --> 02:20:27,830
kind of stuff eventually or if you just

02:20:25,399 --> 02:20:30,790
Google for it that's an alternative to

02:20:27,830 --> 02:20:34,760
this a function that with an angle of

02:20:30,790 --> 02:20:38,420
180 degrees is 1 and with an angle of 90

02:20:34,760 --> 02:20:41,330
degrees is 0 happens to be cosine so

02:20:38,420 --> 02:20:42,560
this is how lighting works in computer

02:20:41,330 --> 02:20:44,960
graphics you're not doing like any

02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:48,020
magical sorcery you're just figuring out

02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:49,580
my light goes that way my surface faces

02:20:48,020 --> 02:20:51,710
that way what's the angle between them

02:20:49,580 --> 02:20:53,600
cosine that and we have how much color

02:20:51,710 --> 02:20:58,430
we got right so basically we have like

02:20:53,600 --> 02:21:01,160
let's say we have a red color here and

02:20:58,430 --> 02:21:03,680
the white color here we just multiply

02:21:01,160 --> 02:21:04,970
the two with the cosine and then that's

02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:07,840
it that's what happens so it's like

02:21:04,970 --> 02:21:11,270
cosine of 180 is one called one times

02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:13,850
one which is like the bright white light

02:21:11,270 --> 02:21:15,560
plus one only for red and then you

02:21:13,850 --> 02:21:18,979
basically just get that together and

02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:21,920
then you have like a fully Lidz white or

02:21:18,979 --> 02:21:24,080
sorry red sphere here and obviously

02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:25,670
because the sphere has more faces facing

02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:27,439
in the other directions you do that for

02:21:25,670 --> 02:21:29,630
each of these faces and then

02:21:27,439 --> 02:21:33,189
get the different shades of a color this

02:21:29,630 --> 02:21:36,140
is why you get like you know the the ha

02:21:33,189 --> 02:21:41,409
come back okay why it's not as bright

02:21:36,140 --> 02:21:44,180
here as it is here this is all it does

02:21:41,409 --> 02:21:45,560
ish like this is the simplest way of

02:21:44,180 --> 02:21:48,470
doing this kind of lighting it's called

02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:50,090
Lambert lighting Lambert lighting has a

02:21:48,470 --> 02:21:52,369
problem it has multiple problems

02:21:50,090 --> 02:21:55,970
actually the first things first when we

02:21:52,369 --> 02:21:58,159
do that for for each of the phases if

02:21:55,970 --> 02:22:01,039
these phases are very large it's not

02:21:58,159 --> 02:22:03,499
going to look as good we can we can

02:22:01,039 --> 02:22:05,949
simulate that by going into the

02:22:03,499 --> 02:22:08,600
inspector clicking on the sphere and

02:22:05,949 --> 02:22:10,760
somewhere here it should have segments

02:22:08,600 --> 02:22:14,689
yes so let's set the segments to a

02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:16,760
relatively low number and go back so now

02:22:14,689 --> 02:22:18,949
you see like we are not having as many

02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:20,600
like the shape is not as round anymore

02:22:18,949 --> 02:22:22,249
and maybe I should actually stop

02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:26,180
rotating it because it's like super

02:22:22,249 --> 02:22:30,199
annoying can you maybe not rotate that

02:22:26,180 --> 02:22:31,850
be like super cool thank you and I

02:22:30,199 --> 02:22:33,470
should have said so here it looks kind

02:22:31,850 --> 02:22:35,810
of nice right it looks kind of smooth

02:22:33,470 --> 02:22:39,499
actually I'm not never sure how how well

02:22:35,810 --> 02:22:41,989
the projector does but if I remember

02:22:39,499 --> 02:22:44,359
like if I reduce the number of vertices

02:22:41,989 --> 02:22:46,220
and faces then it's not gonna look as

02:22:44,359 --> 02:22:48,380
smooth and you see like the lighting

02:22:46,220 --> 02:22:50,239
also does not look as nice anymore it's

02:22:48,380 --> 02:22:52,939
a little rougher here and it's like not

02:22:50,239 --> 02:22:55,970
as nice here and that's because we do it

02:22:52,939 --> 02:22:57,739
once per face there's also ways of doing

02:22:55,970 --> 02:22:59,029
like more calculations by doing it for

02:22:57,739 --> 02:23:02,180
each of the vertices and then like

02:22:59,029 --> 02:23:03,859
interpolating between the two so that's

02:23:02,180 --> 02:23:05,149
another way of doing it but like this is

02:23:03,859 --> 02:23:06,859
the way that Lambert does it and the

02:23:05,149 --> 02:23:08,810
other problem is if I want this to make

02:23:06,859 --> 02:23:11,270
it like super shiny then I'm not gonna

02:23:08,810 --> 02:23:13,880
have and I can actually return actually

02:23:11,270 --> 02:23:15,590
let's just reload to the smoother thing

02:23:13,880 --> 02:23:17,630
but you see like it's not very shiny

02:23:15,590 --> 02:23:20,060
right there's no like nice shiny light

02:23:17,630 --> 02:23:22,340
and that's because this this Lambert

02:23:20,060 --> 02:23:23,840
equation does not allow that we would

02:23:22,340 --> 02:23:25,999
have to make sure that something that is

02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:28,489
coming straight on it it's much much

02:23:25,999 --> 02:23:30,979
brighter and then quickly stops being as

02:23:28,489 --> 02:23:32,930
bright around the same like like angles

02:23:30,979 --> 02:23:35,090
so there's different equations and one

02:23:32,930 --> 02:23:36,680
of them being the Phong equation that

02:23:35,090 --> 02:23:39,560
allows more complicated lighting

02:23:36,680 --> 02:23:41,000
situations and conveniently you don't

02:23:39,560 --> 02:23:42,860
have to worry about it I just wanted

02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:44,870
to let you know that these exists if you

02:23:42,860 --> 02:23:49,330
hear like Phong shading that's like

02:23:44,870 --> 02:23:52,100
shiny glossy materially materials and

02:23:49,330 --> 02:23:56,210
Lambert shading is like silky smooth

02:23:52,100 --> 02:23:57,620
materials we can fix that lighting

02:23:56,210 --> 02:24:00,320
problem if you want to make this like

02:23:57,620 --> 02:24:02,090
more glossy conveniently by just

02:24:00,320 --> 02:24:03,740
increasing a value here we don't have to

02:24:02,090 --> 02:24:07,550
worry about all this kind of stuff what

02:24:03,740 --> 02:24:09,860
we can do is we can say hey can we be

02:24:07,550 --> 02:24:12,020
like more mentally and I can like set it

02:24:09,860 --> 02:24:14,300
to a value of 1 for instance and then I

02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:15,890
gets like super shiny it's probably like

02:24:14,300 --> 02:24:17,840
even too shiny because like the

02:24:15,890 --> 02:24:19,580
spotlight is like super bright so now

02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:21,110
this looks more metally I would say

02:24:19,580 --> 02:24:23,480
because it has the spotlight it has this

02:24:21,110 --> 02:24:26,450
highlight over here it's kind of look

02:24:23,480 --> 02:24:29,600
nicer on your computer screens probably

02:24:26,450 --> 02:24:32,570
than on this screen but hey so I can say

02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:36,110
like metal Ness Third Point let's say

02:24:32,570 --> 02:24:40,190
like 75 it's a 75% metal and then you

02:24:36,110 --> 02:24:42,290
get like a nice highlight instead but

02:24:40,190 --> 02:24:45,920
now the question was how can we make the

02:24:42,290 --> 02:24:47,300
Sun like shine and look nice yes we can

02:24:45,920 --> 02:24:49,280
the problem is with the light and

02:24:47,300 --> 02:24:51,470
internally it doesn't mean that it

02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:53,480
actually lights up the surface because

02:24:51,470 --> 02:24:54,950
the surfaces are like the surface of the

02:24:53,480 --> 02:24:58,790
Sun goes like this way the light goes

02:24:54,950 --> 02:25:00,950
like this way and 0 degrees not gonna be

02:24:58,790 --> 02:25:02,870
nice what we want to do instead is we

02:25:00,950 --> 02:25:05,060
want to set a different type of color so

02:25:02,870 --> 02:25:07,370
what this is actually like miss named a

02:25:05,060 --> 02:25:09,560
bit because in computer graphics books

02:25:07,370 --> 02:25:10,070
you're gonna find this as the diffuse

02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:12,800
color

02:25:10,070 --> 02:25:16,100
now what this diffuse color mean diffuse

02:25:12,800 --> 02:25:20,000
color is the color that is being

02:25:16,100 --> 02:25:22,010
reflected from the surface because

02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:23,870
that's how lights were or how material

02:25:22,010 --> 02:25:27,640
colors work right if you have a green

02:25:23,870 --> 02:25:31,130
car it means that red and blue are

02:25:27,640 --> 02:25:33,170
absorbed and green is reflected so

02:25:31,130 --> 02:25:35,060
that's basically it diffuse it spreads

02:25:33,170 --> 02:25:37,070
the light in different directions is a

02:25:35,060 --> 02:25:38,960
reflection is when it comes exactly back

02:25:37,070 --> 02:25:41,900
where it came from and diffuses when it

02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:43,880
likes like you know goes astray a little

02:25:41,900 --> 02:25:47,720
bit so this is the diffuse color if we

02:25:43,880 --> 02:25:51,070
want this to shine light or like looks

02:25:47,720 --> 02:25:53,540
shiny then we would have to emit light

02:25:51,070 --> 02:25:54,800
right because the Sun looks like it

02:25:53,540 --> 02:25:57,290
looks because it emits

02:25:54,800 --> 02:25:59,330
slight now this is not the same as

02:25:57,290 --> 02:26:00,979
having the light there the light that

02:25:59,330 --> 02:26:04,250
you put at a point light that we put in

02:26:00,979 --> 02:26:05,600
the Sun is lighting up other things it's

02:26:04,250 --> 02:26:07,280
not lighting up the Sun because we're

02:26:05,600 --> 02:26:08,450
inside the Sun and it doesn't work with

02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:11,899
the angles so we have to set the

02:26:08,450 --> 02:26:13,580
emissive color as well I can say

02:26:11,899 --> 02:26:15,500
actually no no I'm not doing it on the

02:26:13,580 --> 02:26:16,670
red sphere that's not a bad not a good

02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:22,880
idea abort mission

02:26:16,670 --> 02:26:25,210
abandon ship so emissive yellow and look

02:26:22,880 --> 02:26:25,210
at that

02:26:36,681 --> 02:26:47,480
okay as a tricky one

02:26:45,190 --> 02:26:50,780
theoretically hypothetically it should

02:26:47,480 --> 02:26:52,311
work when you set up the let's see

02:26:50,780 --> 02:26:56,601
actually that's a good question

02:26:52,311 --> 02:26:58,070
I know how to do it in blender but I'm

02:26:56,601 --> 02:26:59,721
not exactly sure actually we have

02:26:58,070 --> 02:27:04,820
textures here they're gonna look weird

02:26:59,721 --> 02:27:06,261
but it it proves the point um so I don't

02:27:04,820 --> 02:27:07,730
know actually I do have the actual

02:27:06,261 --> 02:27:09,471
texture that I want it does well

02:27:07,730 --> 02:27:11,660
completely forgot about that we

02:27:09,471 --> 02:27:14,811
downloaded this here because of cause

02:27:11,660 --> 02:27:20,420
origin shizzles okay so that's like

02:27:14,811 --> 02:27:21,950
source this and that's what I thought

02:27:20,420 --> 02:27:23,330
so this is this is gonna be tricky

02:27:21,950 --> 02:27:26,150
you're probably gonna have to write your

02:27:23,330 --> 02:27:27,290
own material to make that work I don't

02:27:26,150 --> 02:27:29,721
think it's actually what happens when I

02:27:27,290 --> 02:27:33,561
say like can I can I actually do that

02:27:29,721 --> 02:27:35,271
never tried it nope it doesn't support

02:27:33,561 --> 02:27:36,920
because there's no such thing as an

02:27:35,271 --> 02:27:39,530
emissive map so you would probably have

02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:46,490
to do this like differently a way to

02:27:39,530 --> 02:27:47,900
fake it is to let's see it's nice a way

02:27:46,490 --> 02:27:51,710
to fake this and I actually don't know

02:27:47,900 --> 02:27:53,780
the the parameters for this again so

02:27:51,710 --> 02:27:55,221
we're gonna look them up is to actually

02:27:53,780 --> 02:27:56,240
say that it should not it should not

02:27:55,221 --> 02:27:59,330
care about like because there's

02:27:56,240 --> 02:28:00,620
different way like light in a 3d scene

02:27:59,330 --> 02:28:02,301
it's not something that you physically

02:28:00,620 --> 02:28:04,851
intrinsically have to have it's

02:28:02,301 --> 02:28:06,740
something that you choose to need if you

02:28:04,851 --> 02:28:09,290
want that so you can actually tell it to

02:28:06,740 --> 02:28:17,360
like ignore lighting it entirely and I

02:28:09,290 --> 02:28:18,830
think aha you here we go flat shader is

02:28:17,360 --> 02:28:21,351
that the thing that I want standard

02:28:18,830 --> 02:28:25,610
material do I get to actually pick a

02:28:21,351 --> 02:28:27,820
different material I wonder how do I set

02:28:25,610 --> 02:28:27,820
like

02:28:29,079 --> 02:28:32,510
I'll try something because I've never

02:28:31,279 --> 02:28:34,239
used that property now that I think

02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:38,029
about it so let's see what happens

02:28:34,239 --> 02:28:39,890
called shader basic I don't know if

02:28:38,029 --> 02:28:45,010
that's the right thing no it's not okay

02:28:39,890 --> 02:28:47,479
cool I kind of expect that to happen

02:28:45,010 --> 02:28:48,829
we're getting somewhere I'm not exactly

02:28:47,479 --> 02:28:54,470
sure where we are getting was an

02:28:48,829 --> 02:28:57,520
interesting anyways this is the flat

02:28:54,470 --> 02:29:00,260
shape because AHA right so a flat shader

02:28:57,520 --> 02:29:02,149
it's a bit confusing because the a-frame

02:29:00,260 --> 02:29:04,220
uses three j/s under the hood and 3GS

02:29:02,149 --> 02:29:05,840
calls at a basic material and the basic

02:29:04,220 --> 02:29:09,199
material just ignores light and just use

02:29:05,840 --> 02:29:10,640
it as color and here it's like a flat

02:29:09,199 --> 02:29:14,510
shader which to me is something

02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:16,010
different but okay it whatever so

02:29:14,510 --> 02:29:17,659
basically by saying that you want the

02:29:16,010 --> 02:29:20,180
shader to be flat rather than the

02:29:17,659 --> 02:29:22,159
standard you get a shader that ignores

02:29:20,180 --> 02:29:24,619
lighting entirely and just uses the

02:29:22,159 --> 02:29:26,479
texture that you give it and which

02:29:24,619 --> 02:29:28,220
effectively looks if the texture is

02:29:26,479 --> 02:29:30,680
right looks like it's emitting light but

02:29:28,220 --> 02:29:32,420
it's actually not emitting light okay so

02:29:30,680 --> 02:29:35,300
now we have like this wonderful little

02:29:32,420 --> 02:29:37,130
scene with the Sun and the little planet

02:29:35,300 --> 02:29:43,340
orbiting and actually let's find a and

02:29:37,130 --> 02:29:46,489
an earth texture as well just Y not very

02:29:43,340 --> 02:29:47,630
good question not as easy for glowing

02:29:46,489 --> 02:29:49,430
you would have to write your own

02:29:47,630 --> 02:29:52,729
material and an old shader I think

02:29:49,430 --> 02:29:54,350
there's might be an effect for it that's

02:29:52,729 --> 02:29:57,520
actually that's actually look for it I

02:29:54,350 --> 02:29:57,520
don't I don't know for sure

02:30:00,851 --> 02:30:14,801
fear and put it inside to some expected

02:30:06,391 --> 02:30:16,601
right hemisphere lights right but it

02:30:14,801 --> 02:30:23,341
doesn't have a position the hemisphere

02:30:16,601 --> 02:30:23,341
lights shouldn't have a position okay

02:30:24,391 --> 02:30:31,091
but are you sure it looks the same on

02:30:26,471 --> 02:30:33,190
the on the back of the Sun if you go if

02:30:31,091 --> 02:30:34,841
you go around the Sun I'm relatively

02:30:33,190 --> 02:30:37,870
sure with the hemisphere light you might

02:30:34,841 --> 02:30:39,551
not see because hemisphere lights are

02:30:37,870 --> 02:30:41,711
basically working like the natural Sun

02:30:39,551 --> 02:30:44,041
would work on the earth so they shine in

02:30:41,711 --> 02:30:44,041
one direction

02:30:55,010 --> 02:30:59,700
my work but I would be surprised because

02:30:58,080 --> 02:31:02,070
it's normally literally meant to like

02:30:59,700 --> 02:31:03,870
shine on one side of a thing and not

02:31:02,070 --> 02:31:06,780
like all around it I would be surprised

02:31:03,870 --> 02:31:08,070
at that work but you know if if you're

02:31:06,780 --> 02:31:09,570
right that'd be amazing because that

02:31:08,070 --> 02:31:12,750
means I learned something today that's

02:31:09,570 --> 02:31:14,760
be cool try going behind the Sun does

02:31:12,750 --> 02:31:16,850
the back of the Sun also get lighted

02:31:14,760 --> 02:31:19,710
that way

02:31:16,850 --> 02:31:21,330
or below the Sun because the hemisphere

02:31:19,710 --> 02:31:24,150
light has to like it it literally is a

02:31:21,330 --> 02:31:26,070
half a sphere so it has to light from

02:31:24,150 --> 02:31:27,660
one direction but I don't see that you

02:31:26,070 --> 02:31:28,770
would have to have a second hemisphere

02:31:27,660 --> 02:31:33,150
light to actually light from the other

02:31:28,770 --> 02:31:37,410
direction as well anyhow and that's

02:31:33,150 --> 02:31:39,689
really cool cool yeah so to make it glow

02:31:37,410 --> 02:31:40,920
you would have to oh what the hell you

02:31:39,689 --> 02:31:42,630
would have to use a component to

02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:44,850
actually make that work and I would not

02:31:42,630 --> 02:31:49,500
necessarily use that because it will

02:31:44,850 --> 02:31:51,270
definitely have a performance impact you

02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:53,160
can write your own shaders and they are

02:31:51,270 --> 02:31:57,450
probably custom shaders available for

02:31:53,160 --> 02:32:00,570
glowing somewhere like when when you use

02:31:57,450 --> 02:32:02,670
our 3d models you actually get a

02:32:00,570 --> 02:32:04,530
different shader than the three J's or a

02:32:02,670 --> 02:32:11,939
frame shatters because we do light maps

02:32:04,530 --> 02:32:14,960
differently I mean there's other types

02:32:11,939 --> 02:32:17,640
of light as well you don't only have the

02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:19,170
the point lights you also have the

02:32:17,640 --> 02:32:20,970
hemisphere light you also have the

02:32:19,170 --> 02:32:23,310
directive light a directional light

02:32:20,970 --> 02:32:27,479
breezes and you can then start to like

02:32:23,310 --> 02:32:29,370
experiment with things so for instance

02:32:27,479 --> 02:32:33,180
we might want to do something slightly

02:32:29,370 --> 02:32:35,130
different I'm actually not gonna remove

02:32:33,180 --> 02:32:36,630
all of this but I'm gonna comment it out

02:32:35,130 --> 02:32:42,120
so that it doesn't get in our way

02:32:36,630 --> 02:32:47,430
um so I'm gonna leave the sky in because

02:32:42,120 --> 02:32:53,660
it's a nice half the sky here so I can

02:32:47,430 --> 02:32:58,410
have an a entity geometry primitive

02:32:53,660 --> 02:33:00,960
plane and I oh god I can never remember

02:32:58,410 --> 02:33:04,350
I'm gonna do like this and I'm gonna see

02:33:00,960 --> 02:33:06,360
what happens because I can never

02:33:04,350 --> 02:33:07,561
remember which way I have to rotate it

02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:10,110
to make it look the way

02:33:07,561 --> 02:33:13,440
I want to make it look like so I'm gonna

02:33:10,110 --> 02:33:16,620
start with this and I'm gonna figure out

02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:20,370
the rotation by just like turning it and

02:33:16,620 --> 02:33:25,230
see it's negative okay okay enough so

02:33:20,370 --> 02:33:25,681
we're gonna rotate this rotation zero no

02:33:25,230 --> 02:33:28,351
sorry

02:33:25,681 --> 02:33:33,570
- 9000 so we were tailing around the

02:33:28,351 --> 02:33:38,400
x-axis and I'm gonna gonna give this one

02:33:33,570 --> 02:33:39,091
a width of 100 and the height of our

02:33:38,400 --> 02:33:43,200
depth

02:33:39,091 --> 02:33:44,940
I think it's depth depth of 100 so now

02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:46,650
we have like a plane that is our ground

02:33:44,940 --> 02:33:48,360
plane and I'm actually not seeing it and

02:33:46,650 --> 02:33:50,700
it might be because I might have done

02:33:48,360 --> 02:33:53,761
something that is wrong right it's not

02:33:50,700 --> 02:33:55,950
depth in that case it is is it height

02:33:53,761 --> 02:33:57,751
that's like super weird yeah okay fair

02:33:55,950 --> 02:34:00,990
enough and you see like I didn't give it

02:33:57,751 --> 02:34:03,631
a man material yet and immediately three

02:34:00,990 --> 02:34:06,301
J's as I keep saying three days Jesus

02:34:03,631 --> 02:34:08,101
Christ a frame jumps in and for our

02:34:06,301 --> 02:34:11,851
ground so I'm we now have created a

02:34:08,101 --> 02:34:13,711
ground plane and for that to like look

02:34:11,851 --> 02:34:15,990
like something it just generates the

02:34:13,711 --> 02:34:17,820
color and make sure that we are we're

02:34:15,990 --> 02:34:22,891
seeing it but I can also give it like a

02:34:17,820 --> 02:34:25,400
material I can say I know I want this to

02:34:22,891 --> 02:34:25,400
be color

02:34:26,061 --> 02:34:36,931
0:08 a zero zero so we have a bit of

02:34:30,870 --> 02:34:42,721
that now I can actually make that white

02:34:36,931 --> 02:34:49,041
whoops ah make that white node hunt

02:34:42,721 --> 02:34:52,440
hashtag white and I can create a light

02:34:49,041 --> 02:34:54,030
light and position it somewhere and I'm

02:34:52,440 --> 02:34:57,240
just gonna position it actually I don't

02:34:54,030 --> 02:34:58,801
have to position it I think I wanted a

02:34:57,240 --> 02:35:00,900
different light I want a directional

02:34:58,801 --> 02:35:03,061
light and again I can never remember the

02:35:00,900 --> 02:35:06,900
parameters so I just gonna check them

02:35:03,061 --> 02:35:10,221
out here direction of what kind of

02:35:06,900 --> 02:35:14,631
direction does it automatically go to

02:35:10,221 --> 02:35:14,631
the example below creates

02:35:19,869 --> 02:35:24,470
shining from the upper left at a

02:35:21,919 --> 02:35:26,180
45-degree angle where did the star 45 to

02:35:24,470 --> 02:35:27,680
all right okay all right yes yes it's

02:35:26,180 --> 02:35:29,959
because the directional light is

02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:31,489
basically it's not quite like the Sun

02:35:29,959 --> 02:35:33,890
actually works but it's basically like

02:35:31,489 --> 02:35:36,979
light coming from some direction and

02:35:33,890 --> 02:35:38,930
going towards the origin so the position

02:35:36,979 --> 02:35:40,549
doesn't actually matter that much and it

02:35:38,930 --> 02:35:44,479
except for we need to figure out like

02:35:40,549 --> 02:35:46,759
the the difference between where the

02:35:44,479 --> 02:35:48,259
light is positioned and the origin is

02:35:46,759 --> 02:35:51,680
the direction that the light is gonna

02:35:48,259 --> 02:35:54,499
shine in towards so if I say zero one

02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:56,689
zero the light is gonna come from the

02:35:54,499 --> 02:35:59,299
top and shine to the bottom because this

02:35:56,689 --> 02:36:00,859
is our ground and this is our light so

02:35:59,299 --> 02:36:02,449
the like this is the the difference

02:36:00,859 --> 02:36:04,129
between the light position in the origin

02:36:02,449 --> 02:36:06,560
position this is gonna shine in that

02:36:04,129 --> 02:36:09,379
direction from the top and I give it a

02:36:06,560 --> 02:36:17,779
color oh yeah let's do something way

02:36:09,379 --> 02:36:22,720
purvey V let's go ah let's try a a zero

02:36:17,779 --> 02:36:22,720
zero a a and then we do a second light

02:36:22,839 --> 02:36:30,199
same light except for I do a different

02:36:26,029 --> 02:36:32,149
color and I do a different position so

02:36:30,199 --> 02:36:35,119
now this lights shining from the bottom

02:36:32,149 --> 02:36:37,909
up and to have a magenta light shining

02:36:35,119 --> 02:36:41,299
down from from above and another light

02:36:37,909 --> 02:36:45,430
shining up and now we put it as an

02:36:41,299 --> 02:36:52,310
additional entity in a entity geometry

02:36:45,430 --> 02:36:55,549
primitive sphere material color white

02:36:52,310 --> 02:36:57,020
oops color white and we positioned that

02:36:55,549 --> 02:37:00,529
in front of our camera so that we

02:36:57,020 --> 02:37:02,029
actually see it actually maybe I move it

02:37:00,529 --> 02:37:10,779
up a little bit as well so that we see

02:37:02,029 --> 02:37:10,779
something and hey the 80s called

02:37:19,160 --> 02:37:25,880
now that's so much still too much

02:37:27,380 --> 02:37:36,690
no way what okay it's like super super

02:37:31,290 --> 02:37:40,850
intensive better so like yeah yeah the

02:37:36,690 --> 02:37:40,850
80s called they want their models back

02:37:42,710 --> 02:37:50,460
and this is how you do cool vaporwave

02:37:47,210 --> 02:37:53,220
and you could also now like let me

02:37:50,460 --> 02:37:58,230
actually see so I go to images google

02:37:53,220 --> 02:38:01,140
calm and I need a grid image that it's

02:37:58,230 --> 02:38:03,360
nicely Tyler ball now that's all

02:38:01,140 --> 02:38:08,640
 I just need oh god damn it

02:38:03,360 --> 02:38:11,280
ciao ah this is not what I am looking

02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:14,150
for right you know what I'll do myself

02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:22,350
because I'm a great graphical artist

02:38:14,150 --> 02:38:23,970
this is gonna be fun come on I can't be

02:38:22,350 --> 02:38:27,840
bothered to buy Adobe products so I'm

02:38:23,970 --> 02:38:29,730
like yea it is and I was like why

02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:30,750
would you use and I'm like you know

02:38:29,730 --> 02:38:33,600
let me do my thing

02:38:30,750 --> 02:38:36,380
I know what I'm doing I actually don't

02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:41,610
but you know it's kind of cool anyway so

02:38:36,380 --> 02:38:43,920
let's use black and then use white to

02:38:41,610 --> 02:38:47,100
create a little bit of oh Jesus Christ

02:38:43,920 --> 02:38:49,950
how do I make this grid parent high

02:38:47,100 --> 02:38:54,810
level so it's like 256 pixels

02:38:49,950 --> 02:38:58,230
it's like 128 so I go like 124 to a

02:38:54,810 --> 02:39:00,090
hundred thirty-two she's like no that's

02:38:58,230 --> 02:39:00,900
actually pretty tiny but it's gonna be

02:39:00,090 --> 02:39:04,680
fine I guess

02:39:00,900 --> 02:39:06,900
and then just like drag it like here I'm

02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:09,360
gonna share the URL to this particular

02:39:06,900 --> 02:39:12,390
beautiful image in a second so you don't

02:39:09,360 --> 02:39:15,410
have to do like this complicated image

02:39:12,390 --> 02:39:15,410
editing process

02:39:17,159 --> 02:39:21,840
so I'm just gonna copy the layer here

02:39:19,649 --> 02:39:23,369
and then just actually now actually I

02:39:21,840 --> 02:39:24,720
can duplicate the layer and then no I

02:39:23,369 --> 02:39:30,989
can't because it's not transfer are

02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:34,020
disguised make it transparent put it in

02:39:30,989 --> 02:39:36,359
here and then I do like layer rotate

02:39:34,020 --> 02:39:38,550
rotate rotate rotate 90 percent car

02:39:36,359 --> 02:39:39,920
twice here we go so this is my grid

02:39:38,550 --> 02:39:45,029
hurrah

02:39:39,920 --> 02:39:47,130
okay cool so export as PNG yeah let's

02:39:45,029 --> 02:39:49,050
call it grid I didn't why is it putting

02:39:47,130 --> 02:39:51,449
it into documents no don't put it into

02:39:49,050 --> 02:39:56,640
documents this is not a document this is

02:39:51,449 --> 02:40:00,949
a this is terrible and it's okay I got

02:39:56,640 --> 02:40:03,689
this Jesus so we put this into assets

02:40:00,949 --> 02:40:07,800
where's like the upload thing there's an

02:40:03,689 --> 02:40:13,350
idea from computer I go to downloads I

02:40:07,800 --> 02:40:17,970
got a grid above my grid tada and I can

02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:19,500
now go to my brain which is this one I

02:40:17,970 --> 02:40:22,470
should probably give it an ID so that I

02:40:19,500 --> 02:40:23,850
can just easier identify later on and I

02:40:22,470 --> 02:40:26,760
can give my ground a different material

02:40:23,850 --> 02:40:27,930
where I'm saying like source is this

02:40:26,760 --> 02:40:30,930
wonderful your oops

02:40:27,930 --> 02:40:31,439
what uploading UL no don't no don't you

02:40:30,930 --> 02:40:34,260
do it

02:40:31,439 --> 02:40:38,489
Jesus okay great now I have it like five

02:40:34,260 --> 02:40:43,229
times I get a URL from the asset and I

02:40:38,489 --> 02:40:46,050
put it in here and whoa okay this is

02:40:43,229 --> 02:40:51,090
strike gigantic now this is not what I

02:40:46,050 --> 02:40:54,989
want it okay let's do like oh I can't

02:40:51,090 --> 02:40:56,189
remember I think it's like repeat ten

02:40:54,989 --> 02:41:04,229
ten or something like that

02:40:56,189 --> 02:41:08,880
what's that yes right okay now we have

02:41:04,229 --> 02:41:10,590
we have fully gone vapor vase here we

02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:13,020
can make the overall scene a little less

02:41:10,590 --> 02:41:18,869
dark by adding another light like a

02:41:13,020 --> 02:41:26,079
really really gentle a entity light type

02:41:18,869 --> 02:41:31,579
and ian's color six six six six six

02:41:26,079 --> 02:41:33,020
yes that looks like enough sixes that's

02:41:31,579 --> 02:41:36,829
too bright actually already so let's

02:41:33,020 --> 02:41:40,689
let's actually make that darker yeah

02:41:36,829 --> 02:41:40,689
still still pretty bright

02:41:42,771 --> 02:41:50,210
yeah that's nicer so yeah

02:41:46,311 --> 02:41:52,130
hurrah this is the kind of stuff that

02:41:50,210 --> 02:42:00,500
you get to create and then like walk

02:41:52,130 --> 02:42:03,141
around and and have a lot of fun yes the

02:42:00,500 --> 02:42:05,271
ground is a actually let me let me fix

02:42:03,141 --> 02:42:09,021
that a little bit so that's not as hard

02:42:05,271 --> 02:42:12,590
to read on the projector let's move it

02:42:09,021 --> 02:42:14,480
around here then like rotation and then

02:42:12,590 --> 02:42:17,450
a material with a certain source and

02:42:14,480 --> 02:42:22,221
that should be it yes okay cool so yeah

02:42:17,450 --> 02:42:25,431
blah oh no oh is it all lost now it

02:42:22,221 --> 02:42:30,771
is probably all us now oh no actually

02:42:25,431 --> 02:42:32,900
it's not because no it is all lost no I

02:42:30,771 --> 02:42:34,610
I think I think I think it isn't because

02:42:32,900 --> 02:42:37,040
it must have been safe because I was

02:42:34,610 --> 02:42:38,391
able to actually go to it on my phone so

02:42:37,040 --> 02:42:43,340
it was like fortunate something

02:42:38,391 --> 02:42:45,230
something if you logged in I think I

02:42:43,340 --> 02:42:48,340
don't know I wasn't locked in so that's

02:42:45,230 --> 02:42:56,050
like I was a danger stranger danger um

02:42:48,340 --> 02:42:56,050
let's see for sure net tendency okay

02:42:56,800 --> 02:43:02,000
fortunate tendency glitched on me if

02:43:00,471 --> 02:43:03,681
that's still there then we should be

02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:06,550
good and it's still there so we should

02:43:03,681 --> 02:43:10,190
be good so let's see it's like glitch me

02:43:06,550 --> 02:43:14,690
and then like this and I was actually

02:43:10,190 --> 02:43:16,610
glitch comm isn't it ah the naming

02:43:14,690 --> 02:43:19,641
convention never occurred to me like oh

02:43:16,610 --> 02:43:21,050
look at that I I'm not signed in but it

02:43:19,641 --> 02:43:25,130
magically figures out that it's me

02:43:21,050 --> 02:43:29,110
awesome thank you so much glitch because

02:43:25,130 --> 02:43:29,110
that was like not expected to happen

02:43:29,380 --> 02:43:34,370
so yeah you have a plane we give it a

02:43:32,330 --> 02:43:36,471
certain width and height we rotated

02:43:34,370 --> 02:43:39,200
minus 90 degrees around the x-axis so

02:43:36,471 --> 02:43:42,410
that it actually faces upwards and then

02:43:39,200 --> 02:43:44,510
we give it a material with a given grid

02:43:42,410 --> 02:43:48,370
image if you want to use the grid image

02:43:44,510 --> 02:43:48,370
I can create a short URL if you want

02:43:52,369 --> 02:44:00,619
yeah you know super like I totally have

02:43:58,369 --> 02:44:02,510
the guy no not that I totally have the

02:44:00,619 --> 02:44:07,430
copyright on that but I'm okay I think I

02:44:02,510 --> 02:44:09,170
make it public domain and I won't make

02:44:07,430 --> 02:44:10,909
you pay for this like it's part to be

02:44:09,170 --> 02:44:14,899
honest the thing is actually better like

02:44:10,909 --> 02:44:16,850
I like I like 1% of the of the stock

02:44:14,899 --> 02:44:18,500
photos are just like so I think

02:44:16,850 --> 02:44:19,819
this is actually better like you know

02:44:18,500 --> 02:44:20,720
they're stuck for this way you're like

02:44:19,819 --> 02:44:22,850
what the hell

02:44:20,720 --> 02:44:31,220
women laughing at salad is one of my

02:44:22,850 --> 02:44:33,170
favorite ones like again don't use the

02:44:31,220 --> 02:44:35,750
short URL if you use the short URL in

02:44:33,170 --> 02:44:38,329
the thing it's very likely to not work

02:44:35,750 --> 02:44:40,760
because it does like a redirect instead

02:44:38,329 --> 02:44:43,760
of actually giving you the thing and

02:44:40,760 --> 02:44:45,790
then that breaks cross-origin sharing I

02:44:43,760 --> 02:44:45,790
think

02:44:50,609 --> 02:44:58,290
right any questions so far I could

02:44:55,750 --> 02:44:58,290
totally do that

02:44:58,800 --> 02:45:02,729
anything particular you're missing

02:45:12,319 --> 02:45:15,590
if you don't put the weight in a higher

02:45:13,850 --> 02:45:19,069
applying who will just extend it gently

02:45:15,590 --> 02:45:22,609
no it will be like one my one meter you

02:45:19,069 --> 02:45:24,350
can also use scale to scale it up but

02:45:22,609 --> 02:45:26,720
that that means that basically you're

02:45:24,350 --> 02:45:28,430
like stretching it a lot and that not

02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:30,910
necessarily going to look great with

02:45:28,430 --> 02:45:30,910
textures

02:45:42,500 --> 02:45:50,311
so I kind of prefer that because it

02:45:46,530 --> 02:45:52,740
makes clear that a light is a component

02:45:50,311 --> 02:45:55,680
on its own that you can attach to pretty

02:45:52,740 --> 02:45:57,450
much any entity that you wish to but

02:45:55,680 --> 02:46:00,590
technically not much of a difference

02:45:57,450 --> 02:46:02,970
there is pitfall here is for certain

02:46:00,590 --> 02:46:05,490
entities there are differences for

02:46:02,970 --> 02:46:07,200
instance writing a camera is not a good

02:46:05,490 --> 02:46:09,240
idea because of the way that the camera

02:46:07,200 --> 02:46:12,000
component system interacts with the

02:46:09,240 --> 02:46:17,641
scene this is like it's a it's a little

02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:20,490
tricky and whoops it's someone Co

02:46:17,641 --> 02:46:24,440
editing this right now because I'm not

02:46:20,490 --> 02:46:27,870
exactly sure where the color comes from

02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:30,030
is someone highlighting can I see is

02:46:27,870 --> 02:46:39,170
this someone like oh yeah look at that

02:46:30,030 --> 02:46:43,600
hi very nice meeting y'all interesting

02:46:39,170 --> 02:46:43,600
[Laughter]

02:46:47,811 --> 02:46:52,860
interesting I did not know that glyphs

02:46:50,940 --> 02:46:56,340
can do that but it's cool to figure that

02:46:52,860 --> 02:46:58,830
one out no source also like I saw a lot

02:46:56,340 --> 02:47:01,410
of people got like super confused for

02:46:58,830 --> 02:47:03,780
instance when you like a entity and then

02:47:01,410 --> 02:47:05,190
people are like color blue and it

02:47:03,780 --> 02:47:06,930
doesn't work anymore why does it not

02:47:05,190 --> 02:47:09,120
work I'm like well because it's an eye

02:47:06,930 --> 02:47:11,070
entity and color is not a component that

02:47:09,120 --> 02:47:13,561
it can use by its own it only works when

02:47:11,070 --> 02:47:15,660
you use it with a primitive component so

02:47:13,561 --> 02:47:18,391
I kind of prefer that style actually to

02:47:15,660 --> 02:47:20,760
be honest when I write a frame component

02:47:18,391 --> 02:47:22,860
called I usually don't do that but I

02:47:20,760 --> 02:47:25,200
find it easier to teach that way because

02:47:22,860 --> 02:47:30,170
it's like on consistent and you always

02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:32,670
do it like that I mean I made an

02:47:30,170 --> 02:47:33,811
exception for the sky because I couldn't

02:47:32,670 --> 02:47:37,800
be bothered to actually look up how the

02:47:33,811 --> 02:47:40,021
the sky material thing works is it's

02:47:37,800 --> 02:47:42,391
just like not really useful in most

02:47:40,021 --> 02:47:43,860
cases also by the way we don't we are

02:47:42,391 --> 02:47:45,480
not constrained to use like the things

02:47:43,860 --> 02:47:48,000
that a theme comes with so there's a

02:47:45,480 --> 02:47:49,410
thing called the a-frame component

02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:50,940
registry and I'm actually not sure I've

02:47:49,410 --> 02:47:53,160
never used it an inspector so I'm gonna

02:47:50,940 --> 02:47:55,020
see how that works so we can add things

02:47:53,160 --> 02:47:57,569
to the scene in the inspector

02:47:55,020 --> 02:47:59,399
so we can say like add a new thing and

02:47:57,569 --> 02:48:01,379
this is an entity so it's an empty

02:47:59,399 --> 02:48:03,180
nothing thing right it doesn't have

02:48:01,379 --> 02:48:06,569
anything attached to it so we can't

02:48:03,180 --> 02:48:10,109
really see any of what it has and I'm

02:48:06,569 --> 02:48:11,909
actually wondering if I'm able to this

02:48:10,109 --> 02:48:15,829
is interesting so it has all the

02:48:11,909 --> 02:48:18,720
components that that a frame comes with

02:48:15,829 --> 02:48:21,390
but it also have this has this a fan

02:48:18,720 --> 02:48:23,249
component registry and in the component

02:48:21,390 --> 02:48:26,220
registry you can search for things for

02:48:23,249 --> 02:48:29,339
instance I can search for environment

02:48:26,220 --> 02:48:31,169
and I find this and it allows me to

02:48:29,339 --> 02:48:34,619
basically like get the URL of the

02:48:31,169 --> 02:48:36,060
component and I can copy this I should

02:48:34,619 --> 02:48:37,859
have actually copied it on the other

02:48:36,060 --> 02:48:39,569
thing before and so again like if you

02:48:37,859 --> 02:48:41,430
add something you can see all the

02:48:39,569 --> 02:48:43,949
components that a frame comes with and

02:48:41,430 --> 02:48:46,470
we also actually see like the i/o 3d

02:48:43,949 --> 02:48:49,680
components because we have loaded IO 3d

02:48:46,470 --> 02:48:51,029
i/o into our scene as well so here we

02:48:49,680 --> 02:48:52,709
have all the wonderful a-frame

02:48:51,029 --> 02:48:54,959
components and then you have like the a

02:48:52,709 --> 02:48:56,789
flame registry next to it and it gives

02:48:54,959 --> 02:48:59,159
you an overview of all the different

02:48:56,789 --> 02:49:04,350
available components and there's like a

02:48:59,159 --> 02:49:08,220
lot of them you see for instance like an

02:49:04,350 --> 02:49:11,129
ocean or force graph case control yeah

02:49:08,220 --> 02:49:14,579
yeah the other layouts leap hands if you

02:49:11,129 --> 02:49:16,859
have a leap motion yeah so that's like

02:49:14,579 --> 02:49:19,649
lots of these components available which

02:49:16,859 --> 02:49:23,789
is like super nice and I have just

02:49:19,649 --> 02:49:26,069
copied one and I'm gonna go here and

02:49:23,789 --> 02:49:27,899
after our scripts I'm gonna do like

02:49:26,069 --> 02:49:29,549
script this is super confusing whoever

02:49:27,899 --> 02:49:37,529
highlighted this thing can you please

02:49:29,549 --> 02:49:39,959
unhide it just nice so what again what I

02:49:37,529 --> 02:49:42,239
have done is in the FM inspector I

02:49:39,959 --> 02:49:45,119
clicked on a frame registry and I looked

02:49:42,239 --> 02:49:49,109
for environment and you get this

02:49:45,119 --> 02:49:52,680
component here and I think they actually

02:49:49,109 --> 02:49:54,539
also have like previews yes so here we

02:49:52,680 --> 02:49:57,899
have a preview of the component what it

02:49:54,539 --> 02:50:00,359
does how to load it and how to use it

02:49:57,899 --> 02:50:02,850
and here it says like it has a bunch of

02:50:00,359 --> 02:50:06,109
presets and has a bunch of parameters

02:50:02,850 --> 02:50:07,881
and yada yada yada so I just loaded this

02:50:06,109 --> 02:50:12,351
JavaScript into

02:50:07,881 --> 02:50:16,671
scripts sin2 my documents it's a frame

02:50:12,351 --> 02:50:24,410
environment component and now I can use

02:50:16,671 --> 02:50:27,501
it in my scene they probably want to

02:50:24,410 --> 02:50:29,091
remove my my ground because I'm

02:50:27,501 --> 02:50:31,070
relatively sure that the ground actually

02:50:29,091 --> 02:50:32,631
also the lights probably because I'm

02:50:31,070 --> 02:50:36,561
relatively sure that it's gonna collide

02:50:32,631 --> 02:50:38,240
with what the what the component does so

02:50:36,561 --> 02:50:41,240
if I'm now going back and reload

02:50:38,240 --> 02:50:43,961
oh I magically lost reload capabilities

02:50:41,240 --> 02:50:48,141
so I probably want to do like show live

02:50:43,961 --> 02:50:50,030
all right so now this component creates

02:50:48,141 --> 02:50:54,610
an environment which is like very nice

02:50:50,030 --> 02:50:57,471
and as we've seen in the a-frame

02:50:54,610 --> 02:50:59,360
inspector even for these components that

02:50:57,471 --> 02:51:03,551
are not a frame components built by a

02:50:59,360 --> 02:51:03,551
frame themselves but actually built by

02:51:03,610 --> 02:51:10,251
built by by the community you get to see

02:51:08,181 --> 02:51:13,011
all the parameters in the a frame

02:51:10,251 --> 02:51:14,601
inspector so we can now explore and try

02:51:13,011 --> 02:51:20,391
things out so for instance we can use a

02:51:14,601 --> 02:51:24,400
different preset let's use strong and

02:51:20,391 --> 02:51:28,700
then you get like this Trani environment

02:51:24,400 --> 02:51:30,711
it's a bit weird but okay I don't like

02:51:28,700 --> 02:51:32,150
these weird towers let's find out what

02:51:30,711 --> 02:51:36,110
these towers are where are they coming

02:51:32,150 --> 02:51:37,761
from mm-hmm ground spikes maybe what

02:51:36,110 --> 02:51:40,431
happens when I say like Hills instead

02:51:37,761 --> 02:51:42,261
all right okay no that's not the okay

02:51:40,431 --> 02:51:44,291
that's not what I want it so I kind of

02:51:42,261 --> 02:51:46,851
want to do like spikes is okay ah

02:51:44,291 --> 02:51:49,400
dressing towers I don't like towers I

02:51:46,851 --> 02:51:52,070
like trees make no sense mushrooms are

02:51:49,400 --> 02:51:58,851
like super weird in this case so how

02:51:52,070 --> 02:52:01,011
about okay yeah no that's very nice but

02:51:58,851 --> 02:52:03,561
not what I want so can I say like

02:52:01,011 --> 02:52:08,351
nothing Oh cubes no that looks even

02:52:03,561 --> 02:52:08,351
worse let's go with nothing

02:52:08,711 --> 02:52:12,650
so you get to like explore different

02:52:11,150 --> 02:52:13,820
things like this this environment

02:52:12,650 --> 02:52:15,110
component is really nice because you

02:52:13,820 --> 02:52:17,991
don't have to do much and you get like a

02:52:15,110 --> 02:52:20,511
nice environment if you're not that much

02:52:17,991 --> 02:52:23,961
into like cyberpunk key things then what

02:52:20,511 --> 02:52:25,701
you can do is you can also try I think

02:52:23,961 --> 02:52:27,820
that's like forest somewhere and this

02:52:25,701 --> 02:52:31,070
like actually nice forest here we go

02:52:27,820 --> 02:52:35,360
forest and I have like a brightly lit

02:52:31,070 --> 02:52:36,891
scene so you don't really have to build

02:52:35,360 --> 02:52:38,391
your own environments you can use one of

02:52:36,891 --> 02:52:40,881
these templates if you really quickly

02:52:38,391 --> 02:52:42,741
want to like build something up but I

02:52:40,881 --> 02:52:43,971
highly recommend at least like trying to

02:52:42,741 --> 02:52:46,480
build your own environments because it's

02:52:43,971 --> 02:52:48,921
kind of fun and gives you like more a

02:52:46,480 --> 02:52:54,351
better feeling for the thing you were

02:52:48,921 --> 02:52:58,761
creating I'd say fortunate tendency

02:52:54,351 --> 02:53:01,730
alright okay if we wanted to get that

02:52:58,761 --> 02:53:06,320
into into our code we should be able to

02:53:01,730 --> 02:53:10,701
just say like copy this and I'm gonna

02:53:06,320 --> 02:53:14,051
 do you know what I'm gonna I'm

02:53:10,701 --> 02:53:14,051
gonna remix this

02:53:14,830 --> 02:53:27,320
[Music]

02:53:17,511 --> 02:53:27,320
don't you dare don't you dare okay um

02:53:30,359 --> 02:53:35,319
so this is actually like dragging in

02:53:33,850 --> 02:53:37,060
everything that it generates is what you

02:53:35,319 --> 02:53:40,090
see here is there's a bit of an

02:53:37,060 --> 02:53:41,470
interesting secret in this one so what

02:53:40,090 --> 02:53:43,510
we've seen in the inspector if you look

02:53:41,470 --> 02:53:45,939
closely is that this actually generates

02:53:43,510 --> 02:53:48,579
a bunch of more entities right so I had

02:53:45,939 --> 02:53:50,590
an entity with like an environment

02:53:48,579 --> 02:53:52,810
component but it actually generates a

02:53:50,590 --> 02:53:54,399
bunch of entities inside and I can

02:53:52,810 --> 02:53:56,439
either keep them or I can remove them

02:53:54,399 --> 02:54:00,579
and it's gonna regenerate them that's

02:53:56,439 --> 02:54:02,380
basically up to me but yeah so your

02:54:00,579 --> 02:54:07,539
components could theoretically create

02:54:02,380 --> 02:54:09,880
more whoops okay this is not exactly

02:54:07,539 --> 02:54:11,499
what I want it more more things inside

02:54:09,880 --> 02:54:14,979
so this component is actually slightly

02:54:11,499 --> 02:54:16,689
buggy because it should not do it should

02:54:14,979 --> 02:54:18,340
figure out that it has children and then

02:54:16,689 --> 02:54:19,840
just reuse the children but instead it's

02:54:18,340 --> 02:54:26,920
actually generating them on top of each

02:54:19,840 --> 02:54:28,810
other okay what the hell I think I'm

02:54:26,920 --> 02:54:32,050
just gonna remove everything except for

02:54:28,810 --> 02:54:36,989
the for the preset so that's let's just

02:54:32,050 --> 02:54:36,989
not have that yeah okay better

02:54:39,490 --> 02:54:43,790
by the way if you ever see like weird

02:54:41,990 --> 02:54:45,710
things happen let's let's try something

02:54:43,790 --> 02:54:47,180
I want to show you something and explain

02:54:45,710 --> 02:54:48,830
to you why it happens because that's

02:54:47,180 --> 02:54:51,680
some some of the problems that I keep

02:54:48,830 --> 02:54:56,030
seeing people having so let's say like

02:54:51,680 --> 02:54:57,500
color red so now we have two skies right

02:54:56,030 --> 02:55:00,410
we have this sky that is red and we have

02:54:57,500 --> 02:55:02,510
this sky that is dark blue and what

02:55:00,410 --> 02:55:03,740
happens is and I'm not sure if it's

02:55:02,510 --> 02:55:05,440
gonna happen that nodes it's not

02:55:03,740 --> 02:55:08,060
violently happening which is nice okay

02:55:05,440 --> 02:55:10,340
in that case that's that's not short and

02:55:08,060 --> 02:55:12,470
and the thingy and what instead I'm

02:55:10,340 --> 02:55:14,690
doing is I'm doing this I'm gonna copy

02:55:12,470 --> 02:55:19,250
the sphere and I'm gonna give this a red

02:55:14,690 --> 02:55:21,290
meta material ah dang it's not happening

02:55:19,250 --> 02:55:24,980
which is nice but it's also not what I

02:55:21,290 --> 02:55:32,240
expected I scale this slightly smaller

02:55:24,980 --> 02:55:34,190
maybe scale 0.99 0.99 49 because what I

02:55:32,240 --> 02:55:37,640
try to show you is if you have two

02:55:34,190 --> 02:55:40,220
entities that are overlapping quite

02:55:37,640 --> 02:55:41,600
exactly how this is interesting this is

02:55:40,220 --> 02:55:45,710
still not happening it's your friends

02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:47,570
everyone hmm it's interesting that I

02:55:45,710 --> 02:55:50,000
can't demo it when I really really want

02:55:47,570 --> 02:55:52,370
it but if I don't want it to happen then

02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:53,750
it happens this is like typical what I'm

02:55:52,370 --> 02:55:56,650
trying to show you is like z-fighting

02:55:53,750 --> 02:56:01,610
but I can actually reproduce the problem

02:55:56,650 --> 02:56:03,230
great basically what you want to look

02:56:01,610 --> 02:56:06,440
out for is the things are starting to

02:56:03,230 --> 02:56:07,850
flicker that's normally when two objects

02:56:06,440 --> 02:56:09,590
are kind of like on the same position

02:56:07,850 --> 02:56:12,020
and because it's the same position the

02:56:09,590 --> 02:56:14,090
rendering engine has to kind of decide

02:56:12,020 --> 02:56:16,310
on random which one to draw at the last

02:56:14,090 --> 02:56:17,690
one so it's not guaranteed to be drawn

02:56:16,310 --> 02:56:20,150
in the same order so basically is that

02:56:17,690 --> 02:56:22,400
nice it starts to fight over who's gonna

02:56:20,150 --> 02:56:23,900
be drawn first and last and that's the

02:56:22,400 --> 02:56:26,060
sides like flicker especially when you

02:56:23,900 --> 02:56:28,730
move when you see that it's normally

02:56:26,060 --> 02:56:31,490
because two things are in the same

02:56:28,730 --> 02:56:33,200
position it can also be a problem in 3d

02:56:31,490 --> 02:56:35,000
models when 2d artists are not careful

02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:36,800
enough they might actually accidentally

02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:40,120
create to face this on top of each other

02:56:36,800 --> 02:56:43,120
and then that exactly is what happens

02:56:40,120 --> 02:56:43,120
good

02:56:46,049 --> 02:56:53,219
one last thing that I'd like to show you

02:56:48,850 --> 02:56:55,749
before we try to do something in VR or

02:56:53,219 --> 02:56:57,279
give you the time to actually explore we

02:56:55,749 --> 02:56:58,869
are a little bit if you're interested is

02:56:57,279 --> 02:57:01,419
I want to show you how to write your own

02:56:58,869 --> 02:57:04,629
components because surprisingly it's not

02:57:01,419 --> 02:57:06,219
that hard it's not like super obvious

02:57:04,629 --> 02:57:08,439
but it's not at heart because there's

02:57:06,219 --> 02:57:11,560
really really good documentation that

02:57:08,439 --> 02:57:12,850
explains it really really well so what

02:57:11,560 --> 02:57:16,709
I'm gonna do is I'm first gonna I'm

02:57:12,850 --> 02:57:21,219
gonna get our nice nice teen back

02:57:16,709 --> 02:57:25,419
because I kind of liked it yeah that's

02:57:21,219 --> 02:57:27,100
the thing oh one more phone block one

02:57:25,419 --> 02:57:31,899
more thing before I do that there's also

02:57:27,100 --> 02:57:34,389
an a text component that gives you the

02:57:31,899 --> 02:57:35,679
possibility to actually create text it

02:57:34,389 --> 02:57:41,459
works slightly different than you might

02:57:35,679 --> 02:57:44,079
want to expect um the text component is

02:57:41,459 --> 02:57:49,179
documented in here as well as it's part

02:57:44,079 --> 02:57:52,629
of the text I'm sorry a part of the FM

02:57:49,179 --> 02:57:54,429
distribution you can use google fonts

02:57:52,629 --> 02:57:59,770
and stuff with it if you use it an

02:57:54,429 --> 02:58:02,259
additional an additional component for

02:57:59,770 --> 02:58:04,509
that and it has like these fonts font

02:58:02,259 --> 02:58:06,249
faces built in basically so that that

02:58:04,509 --> 02:58:08,229
works as well you can also generate

02:58:06,249 --> 02:58:10,060
funds from it I've only always found

02:58:08,229 --> 02:58:13,179
that to be like confusing and weird so I

02:58:10,060 --> 02:58:15,819
never did it but you can hypothetically

02:58:13,179 --> 02:58:17,560
do that and how it works is you position

02:58:15,819 --> 02:58:20,739
it as anything else you would position

02:58:17,560 --> 02:58:24,549
so let's say like zero to minus two and

02:58:20,739 --> 02:58:26,439
then you give it the text asset that is

02:58:24,549 --> 02:58:27,759
actually incorrect it's an a entity see

02:58:26,439 --> 02:58:30,399
that's what I meant with like being

02:58:27,759 --> 02:58:32,699
consistent a entity and you give it the

02:58:30,399 --> 02:58:35,770
text component and you give it a value

02:58:32,699 --> 02:58:42,069
and in the value you say like hello

02:58:35,770 --> 02:58:43,779
world and then where is it it doesn't

02:58:42,069 --> 02:58:46,029
show up because I think I've forgot to

02:58:43,779 --> 02:58:48,899
give it a material as well to a color

02:58:46,029 --> 02:58:48,899
white

02:58:49,601 --> 02:58:54,551
do I have to give it a Fontenot Oh

02:58:57,101 --> 02:59:09,761
probably our sphere is in the way isn't

02:58:59,601 --> 02:59:12,230
it bum - - yeah there it is hi there

02:59:09,761 --> 02:59:14,780
there's also an external components of

02:59:12,230 --> 02:59:16,400
this this one has one downside it has an

02:59:14,780 --> 02:59:18,320
upside as well as performance-wise this

02:59:16,400 --> 02:59:20,960
is really nice because it just basically

02:59:18,320 --> 02:59:23,240
renders a single face but on the other

02:59:20,960 --> 02:59:24,620
hand it doesn't have any depth right and

02:59:23,240 --> 02:59:29,540
if you are standing behind it

02:59:24,620 --> 02:59:32,301
well alright it's gone um so if you want

02:59:29,540 --> 02:59:35,030
to have something more like thick and

02:59:32,301 --> 02:59:38,360
and and with a bit of depth then there's

02:59:35,030 --> 02:59:40,160
like the 8x geometry which is really

02:59:38,360 --> 02:59:42,410
nice but it has the downside of actually

02:59:40,160 --> 02:59:44,360
rendering more triangles so it's like a

02:59:42,410 --> 02:59:45,891
bit of a you have to figure out what

02:59:44,360 --> 02:59:48,860
what makes more sense in this particular

02:59:45,891 --> 02:59:50,511
case you can also render two-dimensional

02:59:48,860 --> 02:59:53,150
images as well as like an a image

02:59:50,511 --> 02:59:54,860
component that actually renders a single

02:59:53,150 --> 02:59:58,301
image that floats in space you can also

02:59:54,860 --> 03:00:01,551
do that I think I haven't done that yet

02:59:58,301 --> 03:00:03,110
but it's not too like too exciting but

03:00:01,551 --> 03:00:04,971
if you have like regular images that you

03:00:03,110 --> 03:00:06,830
want to have like an image gallery or

03:00:04,971 --> 03:00:10,250
something like that then you can do that

03:00:06,830 --> 03:00:12,410
by basically saying a entity image and

03:00:10,250 --> 03:00:14,181
then you give it like a source and you

03:00:12,410 --> 03:00:16,790
can also give it a width actually like I

03:00:14,181 --> 03:00:19,910
don't know a JPEG and you give it a

03:00:16,790 --> 03:00:24,080
width like 0.5 which is like half a

03:00:19,910 --> 03:00:26,030
meter high it's like a 0.25 or whatever

03:00:24,080 --> 03:00:28,280
and you position that as well so that's

03:00:26,030 --> 03:00:30,351
not like super exciting but I wanted you

03:00:28,280 --> 03:00:32,511
to know that this exists it's not only

03:00:30,351 --> 03:00:36,650
360 degree images you can also do like

03:00:32,511 --> 03:00:40,431
normal 2d images so what I'd like to do

03:00:36,650 --> 03:00:46,820
is I'd like to get our I don't need to

03:00:40,431 --> 03:00:49,641
defer our script used so if we want to

03:00:46,820 --> 03:00:52,610
create a a frame component we do that

03:00:49,641 --> 03:00:54,561
using the a frame and is it a frame was

03:00:52,610 --> 03:00:59,530
it like a frame I can never remember I

03:00:54,561 --> 03:00:59,530
think it's a frame register component

03:01:00,629 --> 03:01:04,739
and we give that an object

03:01:07,271 --> 03:01:14,450
and I think we also give it a name and

03:01:12,040 --> 03:01:21,980
yes we give it a name in an object so

03:01:14,450 --> 03:01:24,740
basically I would call this planets I

03:01:21,980 --> 03:01:26,711
don't know we would have to figure this

03:01:24,740 --> 03:01:29,030
one out

03:01:26,711 --> 03:01:34,160
so let's give it like a planets

03:01:29,030 --> 03:01:35,391
component and the first thing that we

03:01:34,160 --> 03:01:38,511
have to do is we have to figure out our

03:01:35,391 --> 03:01:39,801
schema so if you remember we had in the

03:01:38,511 --> 03:01:41,721
inspector we had like all these

03:01:39,801 --> 03:01:44,000
different properties right that we could

03:01:41,721 --> 03:01:46,190
set like the material they had like

03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:49,431
color and the geometry had like

03:01:46,190 --> 03:01:51,860
primitive our component might have the

03:01:49,431 --> 03:01:57,881
same and we want to define it in here so

03:01:51,860 --> 03:02:02,450
let's say in our and our planets thing

03:01:57,881 --> 03:02:05,480
we might want to give it the number of

03:02:02,450 --> 03:02:07,011
planets that our or let's actually call

03:02:05,480 --> 03:02:11,561
it solar system that makes more sense

03:02:07,011 --> 03:02:14,301
solar system the number of planets and

03:02:11,561 --> 03:02:16,190
for the inspector to figure out what

03:02:14,301 --> 03:02:19,910
kind of data this is we have to give it

03:02:16,190 --> 03:02:21,500
like a bit of help the number is any

03:02:19,910 --> 03:02:23,150
number including floating-point numbers

03:02:21,500 --> 03:02:25,190
but that makes no sense because we can't

03:02:23,150 --> 03:02:28,311
have three point five planets that does

03:02:25,190 --> 03:02:30,830
not really work so let's use int which

03:02:28,311 --> 03:02:32,721
is just any integer number we can also

03:02:30,830 --> 03:02:34,490
give it a default value if it's not

03:02:32,721 --> 03:02:36,080
specified it should have the default

03:02:34,490 --> 03:02:37,641
value and I say this one and it can be

03:02:36,080 --> 03:02:40,971
two it doesn't matter it's just like

03:02:37,641 --> 03:02:43,070
that's gonna be the default and we can

03:02:40,971 --> 03:02:52,221
have multiple of these we can have I

03:02:43,070 --> 03:02:54,830
don't know moving shall have like type

03:02:52,221 --> 03:03:00,440
I think it's boolean I'm never sure and

03:02:54,830 --> 03:03:02,360
default shall be true so this is how we

03:03:00,440 --> 03:03:06,830
define the properties that are our

03:03:02,360 --> 03:03:10,190
component will have an ephemeris has two

03:03:06,830 --> 03:03:12,171
methods that it's gonna call on this one

03:03:10,190 --> 03:03:14,511
is the init function that's gonna be

03:03:12,171 --> 03:03:16,040
called initially and it's the update

03:03:14,511 --> 03:03:17,771
function that is called and everything

03:03:16,040 --> 03:03:21,040
something's changing

03:03:17,771 --> 03:03:23,440
oh I forgot a comma here I'm sorry for

03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:25,570
that so let's just start like with the

03:03:23,440 --> 03:03:28,301
update function and Co like updating

03:03:25,570 --> 03:03:30,610
solar systems not very exciting it's not

03:03:28,301 --> 03:03:33,190
doing anything interesting just yet

03:03:30,610 --> 03:03:34,721
but it does log something to the console

03:03:33,190 --> 03:03:37,410
so we can figure out if our component

03:03:34,721 --> 03:03:37,410
would be working

03:03:44,910 --> 03:03:49,750
so again in the schema we're defining

03:03:47,740 --> 03:03:52,510
all the properties that our component

03:03:49,750 --> 03:03:55,689
will have and then we have an init

03:03:52,510 --> 03:03:57,520
function and an update function to well

03:03:55,689 --> 03:03:59,979
create the thing initially and then

03:03:57,520 --> 03:04:02,670
afterwards whenever it needs updating we

03:03:59,979 --> 03:04:02,670
can update it

03:04:17,029 --> 03:04:22,819
here violin typing so I'll wait a moment

03:04:24,140 --> 03:04:29,550
so now we're not really using this

03:04:26,640 --> 03:04:32,250
component so we want to want to change

03:04:29,550 --> 03:04:33,779
our index.html to actually use this

03:04:32,250 --> 03:04:40,199
component so let's say like we have an

03:04:33,779 --> 03:04:42,210
EI entity and we have a solar system now

03:04:40,199 --> 03:04:44,220
if we reload we're not seeing anything

03:04:42,210 --> 03:04:46,649
because we haven't created anything yet

03:04:44,220 --> 03:04:50,310
right we haven't done anything visible

03:04:46,649 --> 03:04:53,880
but in a console it says updating solar

03:04:50,310 --> 03:04:57,300
system yay so basically this is the

03:04:53,880 --> 03:05:00,149
moment when the component is basically

03:04:57,300 --> 03:05:01,770
getting like updated information on what

03:05:00,149 --> 03:05:04,800
it should be doing based on the

03:05:01,770 --> 03:05:08,279
schematics and if we now go into our

03:05:04,800 --> 03:05:11,850
inspector actually let me remove this

03:05:08,279 --> 03:05:14,279
and go into the inspector and we select

03:05:11,850 --> 03:05:16,080
the entity which should probably be this

03:05:14,279 --> 03:05:18,830
one then we see that the properties that

03:05:16,080 --> 03:05:21,390
we've given it in the schema appear here

03:05:18,830 --> 03:05:25,590
right and I can change them and I can

03:05:21,390 --> 03:05:28,080
say for and I can say I don't want them

03:05:25,590 --> 03:05:29,880
moving so you see that based on the type

03:05:28,080 --> 03:05:31,920
that we've given the the interface

03:05:29,880 --> 03:05:34,380
actually updates and it has a few nice

03:05:31,920 --> 03:05:36,569
since I've set four but I can also like

03:05:34,380 --> 03:05:38,160
drag and then it increases in steps of

03:05:36,569 --> 03:05:39,779
one because we said it's an integer

03:05:38,160 --> 03:05:41,939
number so it doesn't do like floating

03:05:39,779 --> 03:05:43,710
point numbers in this case if you look

03:05:41,939 --> 03:05:46,859
at our console again and we see that it

03:05:43,710 --> 03:05:48,800
has been called more often now that

03:05:46,859 --> 03:05:51,689
we've changed and if I change this again

03:05:48,800 --> 03:05:54,390
you know you see like anytime this

03:05:51,689 --> 03:05:57,239
information changes it is actually

03:05:54,390 --> 03:05:58,560
changing or updating our components it's

03:05:57,239 --> 03:06:00,390
calling this function that we have in

03:05:58,560 --> 03:06:03,540
our component we can also do that

03:06:00,390 --> 03:06:05,160
manually and I'm in not exactly sure if

03:06:03,540 --> 03:06:06,750
this is gonna work the way that I want

03:06:05,160 --> 03:06:09,870
it to work so let's see like I want all

03:06:06,750 --> 03:06:11,430
a entities yes thank you and I want the

03:06:09,870 --> 03:06:16,080
one that is I should have given it an

03:06:11,430 --> 03:06:17,399
ocean I should have given it a an ID so

03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:20,189
that it's easier for me but if this

03:06:17,399 --> 03:06:21,720
looks right so components lists all the

03:06:20,189 --> 03:06:23,910
components that this particular entity

03:06:21,720 --> 03:06:26,370
has and here's our solar system

03:06:23,910 --> 03:06:29,699
components so we can go in and say solar

03:06:26,370 --> 03:06:30,530
system and now in the solar system

03:06:29,699 --> 03:06:34,580
component

03:06:30,530 --> 03:06:39,290
we have data and data is exactly what we

03:06:34,580 --> 03:06:43,190
enter here right these two match so if I

03:06:39,290 --> 03:06:45,140
now type in like five here and I call it

03:06:43,190 --> 03:06:48,590
again and we see like number of planets

03:06:45,140 --> 03:06:51,680
is now five so you can programmatically

03:06:48,590 --> 03:06:53,570
access and change this information not

03:06:51,680 --> 03:06:55,100
that you should do that but you can and

03:06:53,570 --> 03:06:56,930
then you can also manually like call

03:06:55,100 --> 03:07:01,760
update so I can actually go in here and

03:06:56,930 --> 03:07:04,370
say like solar system data moving equals

03:07:01,760 --> 03:07:09,200
true and I think it was false before and

03:07:04,370 --> 03:07:10,610
then we can call update on it and okay

03:07:09,200 --> 03:07:12,470
the inspector doesn't update that's an

03:07:10,610 --> 03:07:13,850
interesting one but if I now close and

03:07:12,470 --> 03:07:17,090
open the inspector again and it's

03:07:13,850 --> 03:07:19,370
actually updating the inspector there

03:07:17,090 --> 03:07:21,050
must be a leak somewhere cool but this

03:07:19,370 --> 03:07:22,430
is not interesting right we haven't

03:07:21,050 --> 03:07:26,570
actually rendered anything we haven't

03:07:22,430 --> 03:07:28,490
done anything interesting in our in our

03:07:26,570 --> 03:07:31,550
component so can you can we do something

03:07:28,490 --> 03:07:36,610
interesting here yes we can huh yes so

03:07:31,550 --> 03:07:46,580
how about this how about we go in and

03:07:36,610 --> 03:07:49,250
say this which is the component get oh

03:07:46,580 --> 03:07:50,660
god is it do I get object 3d or is it

03:07:49,250 --> 03:07:54,440
get through the object I can never

03:07:50,660 --> 03:08:01,490
remember the syntax here let's let's

03:07:54,440 --> 03:08:02,140
check is it like get object 3d 3d get

03:08:01,490 --> 03:08:10,010
objects

03:08:02,140 --> 03:08:13,700
no ah get 3d object okay time to look at

03:08:10,010 --> 03:08:16,010
the documentation I'm so sorry but it's

03:08:13,700 --> 03:08:18,350
like to be honest everyone reads the

03:08:16,010 --> 03:08:20,150
documentation all the time and I'm not

03:08:18,350 --> 03:08:22,580
gonna lie to you and going wrong I

03:08:20,150 --> 03:08:29,450
learned this by heart no I just we are

03:08:22,580 --> 03:08:31,490
not in school here come on set object 2d

03:08:29,450 --> 03:08:33,890
and get object 3d so okay it's like with

03:08:31,490 --> 03:08:35,720
the uppercase D alright so basically

03:08:33,890 --> 03:08:38,720
what we can do is we want to create our

03:08:35,720 --> 03:08:41,810
own things and there's two ways of doing

03:08:38,720 --> 03:08:43,730
this as I said a frame is wrapping

03:08:41,810 --> 03:08:46,250
around three J s

03:08:43,730 --> 03:08:49,400
so if you happen to know the three J's

03:08:46,250 --> 03:08:52,790
library then you can use that so what we

03:08:49,400 --> 03:08:56,690
can do is we can for instance a bar mesh

03:08:52,790 --> 03:08:59,030
equals new three mesh so mesh is

03:08:56,690 --> 03:09:02,330
basically the exact same concept as an

03:08:59,030 --> 03:09:04,250
entity and in a frame it's just then a

03:09:02,330 --> 03:09:10,550
different term for it and then if you

03:09:04,250 --> 03:09:12,620
like three e-box geometry one one one so

03:09:10,550 --> 03:09:14,360
this is like the geometry so here we

03:09:12,620 --> 03:09:17,120
have that and then we need a material we

03:09:14,360 --> 03:09:18,830
learned that earlier on actually let me

03:09:17,120 --> 03:09:21,320
we format that a little bit so that's a

03:09:18,830 --> 03:09:24,710
little easier to see is like it's a mesh

03:09:21,320 --> 03:09:26,811
basic material and by default that's

03:09:24,710 --> 03:09:29,540
gonna be white so that's gonna be okay

03:09:26,811 --> 03:09:35,181
and then we close this one and then we

03:09:29,540 --> 03:09:38,480
say like this said object 3d mesh and

03:09:35,181 --> 03:09:41,150
now our component actually explodes

03:09:38,480 --> 03:09:44,240
because this said object okay right ah

03:09:41,150 --> 03:09:46,851
is it ah maybe I'm an idiot let's see I

03:09:44,240 --> 03:09:47,210
might just be an idiot no I'm not an

03:09:46,851 --> 03:09:51,230
idiot

03:09:47,210 --> 03:09:53,330
okay cool that gives me this element

03:09:51,230 --> 03:09:53,840
said object 3d all right I know it takes

03:09:53,330 --> 03:09:56,030
an hour

03:09:53,840 --> 03:09:58,101
damn it because it can have multiple of

03:09:56,030 --> 03:10:02,030
these we're just gonna get like the mesh

03:09:58,101 --> 03:10:05,410
shall be this mesh and then hey look at

03:10:02,030 --> 03:10:09,851
that our solar system is now a white box

03:10:05,410 --> 03:10:14,061
very exciting I'm dying of happiness

03:10:09,851 --> 03:10:16,070
this is this is one way of doing it and

03:10:14,061 --> 03:10:17,780
it's definitely the more flexible way

03:10:16,070 --> 03:10:19,130
but that means that you have to learn

03:10:17,780 --> 03:10:24,290
three jeaious to write your own

03:10:19,130 --> 03:10:27,040
components but what if I tell you that's

03:10:24,290 --> 03:10:27,040
not true

03:10:27,311 --> 03:10:32,720
another way of doing this kind of thing

03:10:29,750 --> 03:10:35,120
is by saying look at that we have this

03:10:32,720 --> 03:10:37,641
element is actually the HTML element

03:10:35,120 --> 03:10:40,570
that we're in so we can append children

03:10:37,641 --> 03:10:43,311
to it now how do we create one well as

03:10:40,570 --> 03:10:45,431
it's an HTML element so what we can do

03:10:43,311 --> 03:10:47,391
is we can say okay I want the son

03:10:45,431 --> 03:10:49,160
because we have to have a son with a

03:10:47,391 --> 03:10:50,450
solar system we have to have a son come

03:10:49,160 --> 03:10:55,940
on

03:10:50,450 --> 03:10:59,930
I want the son to be an A Frame element

03:10:55,940 --> 03:11:02,330
and a entity so we create an instance of

03:10:59,930 --> 03:11:03,891
an of an a entity tag which is what the

03:11:02,330 --> 03:11:07,460
Dom does behind the scenes anyways when

03:11:03,891 --> 03:11:11,480
we were writing the HTML and then I can

03:11:07,460 --> 03:11:14,870
say like sunset attribute let's say I

03:11:11,480 --> 03:11:19,730
emissive woopsy oh this is not what I

03:11:14,870 --> 03:11:21,920
want it sorry for that emissive yellow

03:11:19,730 --> 03:11:25,880
whoops ah what the hell

03:11:21,920 --> 03:11:32,150
and then we append the Sun to the

03:11:25,880 --> 03:11:34,220
current element you can actually use

03:11:32,150 --> 03:11:37,521
that ouch no you're right I'm an

03:11:34,220 --> 03:11:46,311
idiot it's a it's the material component

03:11:37,521 --> 03:11:47,391
that has like emissive yellow sorry that

03:11:46,311 --> 03:11:49,250
was my my bad

03:11:47,391 --> 03:11:50,660
very good point very good for pointing

03:11:49,250 --> 03:11:53,440
that one out before I'm like what the

03:11:50,660 --> 03:11:53,440
hell is going on here

03:11:56,419 --> 03:12:00,930
and by the way I kind of want to move

03:11:58,949 --> 03:12:02,609
this around a little bit so right now

03:12:00,930 --> 03:12:05,579
it's under our camera it's also like not

03:12:02,609 --> 03:12:08,039
very nice let's move this around tiny

03:12:05,579 --> 03:12:10,549
little bit so that we actually see it in

03:12:08,039 --> 03:12:16,159
front of us

03:12:10,549 --> 03:12:16,159
aha why is it not doing it

03:12:18,009 --> 03:12:27,279
oh because we yeah another thing is

03:12:25,149 --> 03:12:29,049
obviously I forgot to set another

03:12:27,279 --> 03:12:31,719
component which is since you have the

03:12:29,049 --> 03:12:33,060
three components so yeah that was not

03:12:31,719 --> 03:12:39,039
very smart

03:12:33,060 --> 03:12:41,020
geometry primitive sphere so we're

03:12:39,039 --> 03:12:44,430
literally like using the Dom API to

03:12:41,020 --> 03:12:44,430
create this for us

03:12:52,120 --> 03:12:55,860
and here we are

03:13:11,499 --> 03:13:21,619
and then what we could do is we can move

03:13:18,169 --> 03:13:26,359
forward so let's let's say like for VAR

03:13:21,619 --> 03:13:32,479
i equals 0 is smaller this dot data dot

03:13:26,359 --> 03:13:35,390
number of planets i plus plus we're

03:13:32,479 --> 03:13:39,649
gonna like VAR planet equals document

03:13:35,390 --> 03:13:40,970
create element a entity so this is this

03:13:39,649 --> 03:13:44,209
is now starting to get repetitive

03:13:40,970 --> 03:13:46,909
hopefully absolutely basically it's

03:13:44,209 --> 03:13:50,180
screw this crap I'm like just gonna you

03:13:46,909 --> 03:13:51,770
know screw it let's let's do that for

03:13:50,180 --> 03:13:59,270
the sake of simplicity we're just gonna

03:13:51,770 --> 03:14:01,669
make them all I don't know read it's not

03:13:59,270 --> 03:14:06,560
Sun anymore it's planet that was my bad

03:14:01,669 --> 03:14:10,459
copy and pasta error and then you said

03:14:06,560 --> 03:14:12,050
like Sun appendchild planet also we

03:14:10,459 --> 03:14:14,810
probably want to move the planet a

03:14:12,050 --> 03:14:21,560
little like somewhere else so we do like

03:14:14,810 --> 03:14:27,249
set attribute position I was like let's

03:14:21,560 --> 03:14:30,970
go like I times 2 point 5 meters plus

03:14:27,249 --> 03:14:33,970
well that's the better in the way now 0

03:14:30,970 --> 03:14:33,970
03:14:44,479 --> 03:14:49,830
yes I'm eating in these initial offset

03:14:47,070 --> 03:14:51,840
so we're now moving them a little often

03:14:49,830 --> 03:14:54,240
than we are pending the the planet to

03:14:51,840 --> 03:15:01,439
the Sun there's a bit of a problem now

03:14:54,240 --> 03:15:06,930
that wait where's my planet hmm I do not

03:15:01,439 --> 03:15:10,830
get my planet oh it's big ha that's what

03:15:06,930 --> 03:15:13,760
you meant with an offset yes I they okay

03:15:10,830 --> 03:15:17,070
right yeah that makes sense

03:15:13,760 --> 03:15:19,439
two point five plus nine times two point

03:15:17,070 --> 03:15:23,010
five so that we do not start with zero

03:15:19,439 --> 03:15:26,220
there we go it's quite harsh isn't it so

03:15:23,010 --> 03:15:28,100
maybe we want to do like planet planet

03:15:26,220 --> 03:15:33,899
setattribute

03:15:28,100 --> 03:15:37,649
scales like I know 0.25 sort of looks so

03:15:33,899 --> 03:15:40,140
we're going to find 0.5 so that we get

03:15:37,649 --> 03:15:42,300
like a smaller planet but basically

03:15:40,140 --> 03:15:44,520
that's that's it we would now have to

03:15:42,300 --> 03:15:48,330
work out how to deal with this when the

03:15:44,520 --> 03:15:50,189
number of planets changes alternatively

03:15:48,330 --> 03:15:52,890
we could always like recalculate I mean

03:15:50,189 --> 03:15:55,770
the number of planets is probably not

03:15:52,890 --> 03:15:57,660
gonna change as often so what we could

03:15:55,770 --> 03:15:59,580
do instead is we could say like okay so

03:15:57,660 --> 03:16:01,830
the Sun is not never gonna change so we

03:15:59,580 --> 03:16:04,340
don't have to do this so what we can do

03:16:01,830 --> 03:16:06,300
is so you can say like a set of Sun

03:16:04,340 --> 03:16:10,439
actually we can do like that and then

03:16:06,300 --> 03:16:12,660
like this Sun equals Sun so that we have

03:16:10,439 --> 03:16:18,500
a reference from it and then we take

03:16:12,660 --> 03:16:21,359
this off into the update function and

03:16:18,500 --> 03:16:25,950
what we can do theoretically is we can

03:16:21,359 --> 03:16:27,510
say like this start Sun dot innerhtml

03:16:25,950 --> 03:16:29,960
there's definitely better ways of doing

03:16:27,510 --> 03:16:32,670
this but like for the sake of simplicity

03:16:29,960 --> 03:16:36,390
this is fine

03:16:32,670 --> 03:16:39,170
it's like this the Sun because what

03:16:36,390 --> 03:16:40,470
should be happening now if I'm not oh

03:16:39,170 --> 03:16:44,370
wow

03:16:40,470 --> 03:16:45,960
what oh is it calling wait wait wait

03:16:44,370 --> 03:16:49,040
wait wait am i doing something stupid

03:16:45,960 --> 03:16:52,260
right now because I probably have I

03:16:49,040 --> 03:16:55,220
think actually it's wash it it might

03:16:52,260 --> 03:16:59,210
actually be my tab died

03:16:55,220 --> 03:17:02,420
at night it might actually call it when

03:16:59,210 --> 03:17:04,910
we are updating the the children but I'm

03:17:02,420 --> 03:17:09,739
not sure it shouldn't actually so let's

03:17:04,910 --> 03:17:10,640
see ha now it doesn't now works fine

03:17:09,739 --> 03:17:13,700
okay whatever

03:17:10,640 --> 03:17:17,410
whoa no this is the wrong nope

03:17:13,700 --> 03:17:22,399
still the wrong key hello ah there we go

03:17:17,410 --> 03:17:24,950
control our eye so if I now zoom zoom

03:17:22,399 --> 03:17:27,830
zoom if I now go in here and I say okay

03:17:24,950 --> 03:17:29,810
this thing here shall have three planets

03:17:27,830 --> 03:17:32,090
then I'm wondering what's happening oh

03:17:29,810 --> 03:17:34,010
there we go three planets surprise

03:17:32,090 --> 03:17:36,620
surprise and then we could do like all

03:17:34,010 --> 03:17:38,300
the animations and all that basically

03:17:36,620 --> 03:17:41,090
the tree can get more complicated then

03:17:38,300 --> 03:17:43,399
we could move it if moving is true so

03:17:41,090 --> 03:17:45,859
you can build these these components

03:17:43,399 --> 03:17:47,660
like that and I prefer it over the

03:17:45,859 --> 03:17:50,710
three.js way for most of the things

03:17:47,660 --> 03:17:54,170
because it's how components can easily

03:17:50,710 --> 03:17:56,090
kind of be composed together to build

03:17:54,170 --> 03:17:58,340
more complicated components but then

03:17:56,090 --> 03:17:59,930
again if you really need the 3js objects

03:17:58,340 --> 03:18:02,319
don't shy away from them it's not as

03:17:59,930 --> 03:18:07,189
complicated this is still a really nice

03:18:02,319 --> 03:18:08,479
abstraction over the raw WebGL also you

03:18:07,189 --> 03:18:10,670
can do things like you can actually

03:18:08,479 --> 03:18:12,710
query the children inside of your

03:18:10,670 --> 03:18:14,390
component so you can say like if you

03:18:12,710 --> 03:18:15,620
want to change the way that the Sun

03:18:14,390 --> 03:18:17,689
looks or if you want to give me a

03:18:15,620 --> 03:18:19,399
different entity for the Sun then just

03:18:17,689 --> 03:18:21,529
give it and i don't know class or

03:18:19,399 --> 03:18:23,689
something and then i can just load that

03:18:21,529 --> 03:18:26,420
from what you give me instead of

03:18:23,689 --> 03:18:28,520
creating myself yeah that's yeah it's

03:18:26,420 --> 03:18:30,410
possible there's also a callback in call

03:18:28,520 --> 03:18:33,290
components have a callback that is

03:18:30,410 --> 03:18:36,410
caught when the children change so you

03:18:33,290 --> 03:18:38,810
can even observe that so it's it's a

03:18:36,410 --> 03:18:40,640
really flexible system and the Dom makes

03:18:38,810 --> 03:18:43,359
this relatively easy to actually build

03:18:40,640 --> 03:18:43,359
this anything

03:18:45,130 --> 03:18:50,170
yes yes they're all represented in the

03:18:47,800 --> 03:18:51,580
Dom there's one exception so as I said

03:18:50,170 --> 03:18:56,319
like the a-frame does these

03:18:51,580 --> 03:18:57,970
optimizations for the attributes so they

03:18:56,319 --> 03:18:59,109
turn it turns the attributes the

03:18:57,970 --> 03:19:01,239
different component attributes into

03:18:59,109 --> 03:19:04,630
objects which the Dom does not support

03:19:01,239 --> 03:19:06,640
right so you have instead of position as

03:19:04,630 --> 03:19:10,529
a string 0 0 0 you actually have an

03:19:06,640 --> 03:19:12,880
object X Y Z 0 0 0

03:19:10,529 --> 03:19:15,399
it doesn't always update the Dom

03:19:12,880 --> 03:19:17,830
immediately so if you really really need

03:19:15,399 --> 03:19:19,960
to export that to the Dom there's a

03:19:17,830 --> 03:19:21,550
function call flush to Dom that you can

03:19:19,960 --> 03:19:23,350
call to actually get like the string

03:19:21,550 --> 03:19:25,449
versions back into the Dom that's

03:19:23,350 --> 03:19:27,970
causing a little bit of a frame rate

03:19:25,449 --> 03:19:30,159
rate dropped for us like for half a

03:19:27,970 --> 03:19:32,470
second or something whatever but if you

03:19:30,159 --> 03:19:33,880
really need to export it that's the way

03:19:32,470 --> 03:19:36,159
to go like I've seen people who have

03:19:33,880 --> 03:19:37,449
like an editor where you put something

03:19:36,159 --> 03:19:39,819
together and then you click a button and

03:19:37,449 --> 03:19:41,649
you get like a text field with the HTML

03:19:39,819 --> 03:19:43,359
inside and they're like oh it's missing

03:19:41,649 --> 03:19:45,430
all my information because it's not

03:19:43,359 --> 03:19:48,130
unless this goes like solar system

03:19:45,430 --> 03:19:50,050
equals empty string and it's like no

03:19:48,130 --> 03:19:52,210
there's information in here like number

03:19:50,050 --> 03:19:54,819
of planets should be 5 and it's moving

03:19:52,210 --> 03:19:56,830
should be false and you can use flush to

03:19:54,819 --> 03:20:00,340
Dom to make that happen like to make it

03:19:56,830 --> 03:20:03,550
flush it out as a string to fix that

03:20:00,340 --> 03:20:07,699
phone here we've been sitting like the

03:20:03,550 --> 03:20:11,609
whole position straight at once just yes

03:20:07,699 --> 03:20:14,129
you can do that by using the the

03:20:11,609 --> 03:20:16,499
JavaScript method that I used earlier on

03:20:14,129 --> 03:20:20,340
so basically what you would do is you

03:20:16,499 --> 03:20:23,209
would go like let's let's just do like

03:20:20,340 --> 03:20:28,229
pseudocode yeah entity components

03:20:23,209 --> 03:20:29,609
position data z equals 5 and then you

03:20:28,229 --> 03:20:32,069
would have to yes I know it's not an

03:20:29,609 --> 03:20:33,869
actual actual thing you would then have

03:20:32,069 --> 03:20:35,699
to call update manually to make sure

03:20:33,869 --> 03:20:40,829
that it's actually like reflected in the

03:20:35,699 --> 03:20:41,879
component but that's totally possible no

03:20:40,829 --> 03:20:49,050
I don't wanna what

03:20:41,879 --> 03:20:52,020
no go away so yes it's lunchtime I

03:20:49,050 --> 03:20:53,760
already know actually I did not steal

03:20:52,020 --> 03:20:55,979
any minutes yet it's like three we have

03:20:53,760 --> 03:20:57,300
three more minutes do you have any

03:20:55,979 --> 03:21:02,729
questions anything else that I should

03:20:57,300 --> 03:21:04,499
cover yeah for example for light just

03:21:02,729 --> 03:21:07,829
looking at the a-frame docks it doesn't

03:21:04,499 --> 03:21:11,850
describe the types of life are you sure

03:21:07,829 --> 03:21:14,419
about that when I went to like the light

03:21:11,850 --> 03:21:14,419
it said

03:21:15,180 --> 03:21:23,260
it should oh yeah right yeah right yeah

03:21:20,979 --> 03:21:28,329
we have like them here listed out in

03:21:23,260 --> 03:21:29,649
quite a bit of detail actually the FAA

03:21:28,329 --> 03:21:32,319
from documentation is really good

03:21:29,649 --> 03:21:35,260
there's a there's a slack for a-frame

03:21:32,319 --> 03:21:36,909
you find the links in in the a-frame on

03:21:35,260 --> 03:21:39,579
the a-frame site actually so like here's

03:21:36,909 --> 03:21:42,159
a community tab that has like the

03:21:39,579 --> 03:21:43,810
documentation github Stack Overflow

03:21:42,159 --> 03:21:47,669
Stack Overflow is also really really

03:21:43,810 --> 03:21:50,169
great too if you have actual questions

03:21:47,669 --> 03:21:51,909
but the slack is really really helpful

03:21:50,169 --> 03:21:56,169
as well if you have any questions you

03:21:51,909 --> 03:21:58,569
get quick help there yeah go to meetup

03:21:56,169 --> 03:22:00,129
groups that are doing stuff like that if

03:21:58,569 --> 03:22:01,270
you have some some nearby I don't

03:22:00,129 --> 03:22:03,850
actually know if there's that many

03:22:01,270 --> 03:22:05,289
meetup groups around a frame yet but I

03:22:03,850 --> 03:22:06,640
would I would recommend the slack if

03:22:05,289 --> 03:22:08,350
there's anything that's not clear in the

03:22:06,640 --> 03:22:10,959
documentation because to be honest like

03:22:08,350 --> 03:22:12,939
the the project is relatively young it's

03:22:10,959 --> 03:22:14,590
in like it's probably like Europe maybe

03:22:12,939 --> 03:22:16,180
now or main like one and a half or

03:22:14,590 --> 03:22:18,879
whatever there's it's not that old yet

03:22:16,180 --> 03:22:21,159
so there is holes here and there but

03:22:18,879 --> 03:22:22,419
everyone's like super helpful and making

03:22:21,159 --> 03:22:24,340
sure that you understand everything that

03:22:22,419 --> 03:22:32,199
it's a few Mozilla people at the back by

03:22:24,340 --> 03:22:34,090
the way hi long time no see and like

03:22:32,199 --> 03:22:36,189
everyone's like super helpful and if you

03:22:34,090 --> 03:22:37,720
find something that's missing all the

03:22:36,189 --> 03:22:39,430
documentation some github so you can

03:22:37,720 --> 03:22:41,439
literally just add edit the page and

03:22:39,430 --> 03:22:44,129
make a pull request and then make it

03:22:41,439 --> 03:22:44,129
better for everyone

03:22:48,209 --> 03:22:55,419
sorry you're exactly who's staying for

03:22:53,469 --> 03:22:59,169
the afternoon afternoon workshop it's a

03:22:55,419 --> 03:23:00,579
few people I think so theoretically they

03:22:59,169 --> 03:23:02,229
are all full but I highly recommend if

03:23:00,579 --> 03:23:04,119
you're really interested in just stay

03:23:02,229 --> 03:23:08,139
for the afternoon workshop you might get

03:23:04,119 --> 03:23:10,810
a seat if you're lucky just stay around

03:23:08,139 --> 03:23:12,520
and see if there's like spots left and

03:23:10,810 --> 03:23:13,959
then just you know hang out because it's

03:23:12,520 --> 03:23:16,119
gonna be super cool it's gonna be an

03:23:13,959 --> 03:23:20,459
advanced workshop and you're gonna do

03:23:16,119 --> 03:23:20,459
the the city thing right yes

03:23:30,500 --> 03:23:35,310
yeah I mean the reason why I'm super

03:23:33,810 --> 03:23:37,439
excited about a frame and why we are

03:23:35,310 --> 03:23:40,200
also actually excited about it at 3d i/o

03:23:37,439 --> 03:23:41,819
is that it's relatively easy with a few

03:23:40,200 --> 03:23:44,660
lines of code to actually build things

03:23:41,819 --> 03:23:47,220
like this for instance so we have like

03:23:44,660 --> 03:23:49,729
an application that loads this entire

03:23:47,220 --> 03:23:52,939
thing and you have like camera tours

03:23:49,729 --> 03:23:55,950
that take you to the different rooms

03:23:52,939 --> 03:23:56,970
let's go to like bedroom - I don't even

03:23:55,950 --> 03:24:00,330
know which one it is

03:23:56,970 --> 03:24:01,710
that one okay fair enough and if you

03:24:00,330 --> 03:24:05,970
look at the code it's actually not that

03:24:01,710 --> 03:24:08,520
complicated so you have a bunch of CSS

03:24:05,970 --> 03:24:11,939
okay cool yes sure

03:24:08,520 --> 03:24:15,840
and afterwards you have a bit of a bit

03:24:11,939 --> 03:24:18,390
of whoops what the hell is Mac know

03:24:15,840 --> 03:24:20,609
why is it navigating when I don't want

03:24:18,390 --> 03:24:22,500
to navigate and then you have like a

03:24:20,609 --> 03:24:25,080
bunch of buttons you have a logo here

03:24:22,500 --> 03:24:27,750
which is literally just an image you

03:24:25,080 --> 03:24:29,640
have a map which is like the the thing

03:24:27,750 --> 03:24:31,529
and then you have the buttons that that

03:24:29,640 --> 03:24:33,600
use a frame components you see exactly

03:24:31,529 --> 03:24:35,880
what I showed earlier on like component

03:24:33,600 --> 03:24:38,550
store it has a go-to method it goes to a

03:24:35,880 --> 03:24:41,040
certain bookmark and then it just does

03:24:38,550 --> 03:24:43,590
the magic in a frame and the a frame

03:24:41,040 --> 03:24:44,850
code itself is hot Jesus Christ my

03:24:43,590 --> 03:24:46,770
computer goes bananas

03:24:44,850 --> 03:24:50,210
no don't navigate away when I try to

03:24:46,770 --> 03:24:53,340
what the heck okay right

03:24:50,210 --> 03:24:55,859
the f-m code itself is basically you

03:24:53,340 --> 03:24:59,550
have the camera you have the different

03:24:55,859 --> 03:25:01,200
tool waypoints and you have like a light

03:24:59,550 --> 03:25:03,300
it's and you have here this is the

03:25:01,200 --> 03:25:07,020
apartment and that's it right it's like

03:25:03,300 --> 03:25:10,620
it starts here and the actual scene is

03:25:07,020 --> 03:25:13,950
done here and the rest is just like

03:25:10,620 --> 03:25:16,739
specific like like tweaks and nice nice

03:25:13,950 --> 03:25:18,870
T's so it's not that much code it's not

03:25:16,739 --> 03:25:20,520
that hard to get there and you can

03:25:18,870 --> 03:25:23,189
basically build like really really cool

03:25:20,520 --> 03:25:26,210
stuff really quickly and it's like super

03:25:23,189 --> 03:25:26,210
flexible huh

03:25:29,860 --> 03:25:37,780
yes so check out your local communities

03:25:34,550 --> 03:25:39,620
check out Meetup and just play around I

03:25:37,780 --> 03:25:42,370
think the most important thing is to

03:25:39,620 --> 03:25:50,360
just like start playing around with it

03:25:42,370 --> 03:25:52,130
you very much enjoy lunch and yeah if

03:25:50,360 --> 03:25:54,311
you have any questions I'll be around at

03:25:52,130 --> 03:25:54,311
