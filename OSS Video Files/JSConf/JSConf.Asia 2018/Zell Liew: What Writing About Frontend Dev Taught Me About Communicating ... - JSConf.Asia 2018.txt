Title: Zell Liew: What Writing About Frontend Dev Taught Me About Communicating ... - JSConf.Asia 2018
Publication date: 2018-02-10
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	If we want to make things work, we need to communicate with other people. We need to talk to our users, audiences, colleagues, clients or even our bosses. We want to share our ideas and make sure they get it, so we can produce work that we're proud of. And right now, in our world, we mainly communicate through text. We talk through 140 characters, chat messages, blog posts or even README documents. We write everyday. But how do you write better? How do you improve your communication so hopefully the other party listens (or reads) and performs the action you wish they do? 
In this talk, I'd like to share with you what I learned from writing about code for four years â€“ I'll share surprising things I discovered, and how you can improve your communication and get people to take action.

Zell is a freelance developer from Singapore. When he's not working on client projects, he digs deep into code and explains what he learned on his blog. He has written books and courses, which include Automate Your Workflow and Learn JavaScript.

	00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:19,920
[Music]

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:23,430
that's me I wrote a blog starter block

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,800
back in 2014 and I didn't really know I

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,400
was thinking about other than I wanted

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,489
to write about front-end development

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,710
today I helped over 40,000 developers a

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:38,040
month with their front-end related

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,960
questions I never thought that my

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,110
smaller block would be able to help so

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:47,039
many people so writing this blog and

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:48,629
helping people is an honor for me I also

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,329
didn't think that I would be able to

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,079
write books or courses but I did so

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:56,190
anyway

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,789
in 2015 I launched my first book that's

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,359
called learning Suzie in 2016 I launched

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,400
my second book automating a workflow in

00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:07,710
2017 my first course mastering

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,560
responsive typography and just two weeks

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:16,229
ago I launched the latest one learn

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:19,500
JavaScript in 2018 I never would have

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,380
gotten so far without writing writing

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:27,600
has taught me a lot about communication

00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:29,820
about talking to people about creating

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,820
relationships and even about selling the

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,100
things that I make and today I'd like to

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,259
share with you three things that I've

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,090
learned through the process of writing I

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,140
believe that these three things are

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:47,640
important for all of us so three lessons

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:51,509
here's the first one silence the inner

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,200
critic we all have a critic at the back

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,000
of our hitch

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,590
it's the voice that tells us not to

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,420
write the blog post that we wanted to

00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,280
write it's the voice that tells us not

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,040
to contribute to open source because we

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,570
are not good enough it is the voice that

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,219
tells you not to ask your boss for a

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,259
raise because you're going to get fired

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,500
instead of getting the race that you

00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,959
want and that's the voice that tells me

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,040
not to stand on stage today to share

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,810
with you about writing

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:24,780
because I'm gonna embarrass myself in

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:28,560
front of 400 people this voice goes by

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,769
many names Steven Pressfield calls it

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,109
the resistance Seth Godin calls it the

00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:36,209
lizard brain some of us will know it as

00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:39,750
the imposter syndrome I'm just gonna

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:42,480
call it the critic today the thing about

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,150
the critic is whenever you want to do

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,959
something important it will be there to

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:51,720
stop you it will say nasty things in

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,549
your face it will try to make you lose

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,540
confidence and you will probably lose

00:02:53,549 --> 00:03:00,329
confidence along the way it will and the

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,810
sucky part about this all is that the

00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:05,669
more important something is to you the

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:10,310
more you care about the results that you

00:03:05,669 --> 00:03:12,780
want to make the louder the critic gets

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,200
many people think that the critic will

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:19,049
go away when you become more experienced

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,150
unfortunately it doesn't the critic gets

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:23,629
louder as you become more experienced

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,699
because you're playing at bigger stakes

00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:29,010
sir Sweden who is a front-end developer

00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:32,310
there respect a lot still here security

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:34,500
and I'm sure that the speakers that have

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,239
gone before me have experienced the

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,060
critic and the speaker's they will go

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:45,510
after me will also experience the critic

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:48,900
as well so to overcome the critic your

00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,639
honor consider a question what is more

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,709
important is what you are doing more

00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,470
important or is the critic more

00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,689
important if what you are doing is more

00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,109
important than the critic are you

00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:06,720
willing to pull it above the critic if

00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:09,030
you are then start doing the work start

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,500
talking to people start designing start

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,629
making the thing that you want to make

00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,060
no matter whether it's for profit or for

00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:19,859
fun it doesn't matter just start doing

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,900
it do it over and over and over again

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,900
and you'll learn to tell the critic that

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,000
hey it's okay leave it to me

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,730
trust me to handle things and if it all

00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,470
goes to

00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:33,790
 the world probably wouldn't end I

00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:38,710
will probably be able to handle things

00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:41,710
and it's fine we leave the CNR they so

00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:44,020
do the work do it because it's important

00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:49,150
to you and do it because it's important

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:52,750
to all of us second lesson it's about

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:57,040
them there are many ways to take in this

00:04:52,750 --> 00:05:00,460
lesson so here's a few here's the first

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,730
way the work that you put into whatever

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:07,750
you want to do it's about them not you

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:09,520
not anyone else if you want a raise from

00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,710
your boss then you kind of have to think

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,050
about your boss it's not about you

00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,390
anymore if you want better relationship

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,570
with your family members it's about your

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:21,250
family members not about you if you want

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:24,550
to write a blog post and you want it to

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,560
be good you think about the readers who

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:30,670
are reading your blog posts not about

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:35,110
you not about anyone else if you put the

00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:36,760
focus on the work on them you release

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,640
the focus on yourself and when you

00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,370
release the focus on yourself there your

00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,230
critic weakens yes

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:47,470
the kriti will still tell you that you

00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,420
are lousy and what she teach what she

00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,790
teaches you got yourself into like what

00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,990
am i doing over here

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,620
and it will tell you how unfair the

00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:58,390
world is but it doesn't matter anymore

00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,860
because what's important is about them

00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,450
it's about the people you're trying to

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,530
help it's about the people who will read

00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:08,320
your work not anyone else so let's say

00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:11,530
you put a critic aside and you manage to

00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:14,590
put on some work what's the most scary

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:15,130
thing that's going to happen for all of

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,570
us

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,360
the most scary thing that's going to

00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:25,090
happen is that people will ignore you

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:28,420
and that is going to happen nobody will

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:33,990
see your work nobody will notice your

00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:36,430
existence and that is going to happen

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:41,350
and here's the second way to think about

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:44,470
this lesson because people are busy

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,300
their lives people don't care about you

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,760
they don't care about your work they

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,250
don't care about what you do all they

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,680
care about is themselves and the things

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,670
they want to care about so just think

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,560
about it this way

00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,090
you don't care about a person who is

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,350
sitting two seats away in front of you

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:07,060
in this conference don't you not unless

00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:09,570
you know them personally so don't worry

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:12,070
about what others think of your work and

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:14,220
don't worry if others don't pay

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:18,610
attention to what you are trying to say

00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:21,640
because if you focus on helping them if

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:25,210
you focus on them sooner or later they

00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:27,550
will notice you and when they do notice

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,860
you some of them will thank you for the

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,500
work that you do some of them will

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:36,570
encourage you to write more to do more

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:41,080
and some of them will on you and

00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:43,630
that comes to the third lesson you

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,930
further face haters gonna hate if they

00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:50,230
hate your work that is fine because it's

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:52,150
not about you it's about them what they

00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,640
are doing is underneath the who if you

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:58,240
think about it think about a person you

00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,070
hate or you dislike why do you dislike

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,710
this person or why do you hate this

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:04,450
person if you dive deep into the

00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,610
question you're going to come with an

00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,970
answer that feels somewhat similar to

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,570
this

00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:12,610
I hate or dislike this person because of

00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:17,140
a personal experience that I hate about

00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:19,030
this situation so that is what haters is

00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:22,630
actually doing they are not hating your

00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:24,900
work they are not hating you they are

00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:28,450
hating and experience that they have

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:31,630
about someone else or about themselves

00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:33,849
so don't let your protec smash you for

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:36,430
something that is not your fault

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:39,880
don't let your critic smash you for a

00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:42,219
problem that belongs to someone else go

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:47,050
in there put in the work because it is

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:51,730
important for all of us now is one I

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:55,080
have to say that sometimes reasonable

00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:59,520
people say hateful things to enjoy

00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:02,580
fifteen I wrote my first guest post for

00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,560
Smashing Magazine and you guys probably

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,120
know what Smashing Magus if not you

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,900
wouldn't be here so I will it shouldn't

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,600
explain in 2015 I wrote my first post I

00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:15,840
put it everything I got to make it the

00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,480
best post I have ever written so far the

00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,000
more the morning the guest post got

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,440
released I checked my Twitter feed and I

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,450
saw this I felt confused and bizarre

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,640
that this article was published in the

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:33,810
prestigious website like Smashing

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:37,380
Magazine and mind you this is a from a

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:46,410
hater this was from expert that I

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:49,590
respected it hurts it took me a while to

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:53,910
get over it emotionally and you can see

00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:56,100
that it's still hurting me right now but

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,340
bear in mind that whatever the expert

00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:03,000
said about you is his or her opinion as

00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:05,400
well whatever the experts say doesn't

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,860
mean that your work is it doesn't

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,630
mean that your work is not valid because

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,870
if you focus on the people you are

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:15,030
trying to help and the people get it

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,740
then it's all worth it I know the

00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:20,070
article was good because people came

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:26,430
back and thank me for it so remember

00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:31,370
it's all about them not about you not

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:33,900
about the experts not anyone else and

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:39,690
with that let me come to my third lesson

00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:43,740
and that is be human as humans we have a

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:45,870
gift we have the ability to put

00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:49,380
ourselves in someone else's shoes we can

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:52,110
empathize with people but we don't use

00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,150
it many of us don't I'm pretty sure the

00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,400
expert who wrote the tweet didn't care

00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,650
about my feelings as someone was trying

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,560
to contribute back to the community I'm

00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:04,880
pretty sure he didn't he or she didn't I

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,880
can't forget he or she

00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:20,770
but why why don't we empathize different

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:22,600
people more one reason maybe because we

00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:25,570
are so absorbed in our own worlds that

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:29,170
we completely forgot that anyone else

00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:35,440
exists and we don't care about them at

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:39,220
all and as I said another reason might

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,170
be because we are brought up that way we

00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,980
are brought up to treat people how you

00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:48,700
want others to treat you and to us that

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:52,570
is respect but there's a fatal flaw in

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:55,930
this statement because it assumes that

00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:58,180
you and I are the same it assumes that

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:02,770
you and I like the same things

00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:06,030
yep but I am NOT you and you are not me

00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:09,190
we like and dislike different things I

00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:11,770
don't want to be treated like you I want

00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:14,470
to be treated like me and that applies

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:17,920
to all of us in this room and everyone

00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:20,650
else in the world so instead of treating

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,700
people how you want them to treat you I

00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:29,920
say you treat them how they need you to

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:31,510
treat them need not want because

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,510
sometimes you need to treat people

00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:37,120
harshly for their own sake for example

00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:39,970
if your kids are naughty sometimes you

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,850
have to spoil them you one like that

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:47,890
they won't like that but you need to do

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:50,440
it for their sake but how do you treat

00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:52,690
people how do how do you know how to

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,920
treat people and how better duner need

00:12:52,690 --> 00:13:00,220
them or not and for that you need to put

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,860
yourself in their shoes you need to

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:07,290
figure out what they are feeling before

00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:10,930
you can find out but empathy is

00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:14,700
difficult it is tempting to say come

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:17,290
into the room and say that I know oh

00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,670
it's an it's tempting to come into the

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,240
room

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:23,580
say that I know exactly what you are

00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,790
feeling so that's why you should do this

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,980
and follow my instructions that is

00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,590
 my friend that is

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,240
because there is no way that you won't

00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,460
know how I feeling because you are not

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,100
me and you have not gone through my

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,350
experiences so you don't know that

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,470
magnitude of my fears of my anxieties of

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:47,910
my worries and of my pain there is no

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:51,300
way but if you are willing to you can

00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,020
come close and if you are being real

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,300
about it

00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,790
you can make a connection in that moment

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,820
and when you make a connection in that

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:02,520
moment that is when we open up people

00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,980
open up we open up because we know you

00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,760
understand us and we know you care and

00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,980
we trust you we trust your words this is

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:14,250
the golden moment where everything

00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,440
methods because what you say even though

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,150
if you don't know it what you say will

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,290
stay in their hearts for a long long

00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:24,720
time to come and if they don't act on

00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:28,050
what you say if they don't act on your

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,250
advice that is fine because what snakes

00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:35,910
is up to them you have done your work

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:38,430
what snakes is about them and with that

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:41,930
I would like to wrap up the top for

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:45,420
today I believe that these three lessons

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:48,960
silence a critique is about them not you

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,670
and being human are three lessons that

00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:54,330
are very important for all of us over

00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:57,690
here why let's imagine for a moment if

00:14:54,330 --> 00:15:00,270
all of us in this room and I mean just

00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:02,700
all of us in this room only not anyone

00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:05,640
else who is outside watching the stream

00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,910
not anyone else who is at home reading

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,970
watching the live stream if all of us in

00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:14,790
this room follow these three lessons if

00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:17,490
we all put aside our critics if we all

00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:21,290
focus on the people we want to help if

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:23,880
we encourage and help each other and

00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:27,780
understand each other and the people we

00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:31,139
want to help what can we build in 10

00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:37,559
years what kind of war will really

00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:41,190
in ten years now imagine if everyone in

00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:47,359
the world does the same thank you

00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:47,359
