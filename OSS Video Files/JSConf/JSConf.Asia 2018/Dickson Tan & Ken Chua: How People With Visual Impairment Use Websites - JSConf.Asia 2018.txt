Publication date: 2018-02-15
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	What does it take to navigate a website with your eyes closed? Let Dickson and Ken, pioneers of the Web Accessibility (A11Y) movement in Singapore, walk you through the daily challenges they face, what it means to them, and how their experiences interfacing with websites purely through audio can help you identify new experiences for your sighted users through case examples.

A true lifehacker at heart, Dickson is pursuing a degree in Computer Science in the NUS School of Computing and represents Singapore at accessibility conferences. He interned at Singtel IT and GovTech and is also the co-lead for (these)abilitiesâ€™ Web & Mobile Accessibility Initiative.

Ken is the founder of (these)abilities, Singapore's first accessibility consultancy and pushes Web & Mobile Accessibility in the region.

	00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,370
[Music]

00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,420
good morning everyone and you know

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,769
thanks for joining us in for this talk

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,289
today I'm Dixon I am currently a final

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:35,790
year student in NUS doing computer

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:39,410
science and we have sorry and I'm so we

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,930
was sort of there's and we also have

00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:46,770
along with me today is also contra he is

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,530
the founder of these abilities and we

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,820
are sort of working together on the

00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,300
accessibility initiative here in

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,379
Southeast Asia and also today

00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,879
unfortunately he couldn't join us is a

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:02,039
young from grad so he's on grabs

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:07,580
first-line coder so let me just start

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:11,100
off by talking about what is a 1 1 y or

00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,960
so even 1y you know stands for it's an

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,900
acronym for accessibility that is meant

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,939
to fit into four characters it's meant

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,630
to fit in more easily into a tweet and

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:25,500
it's used pretty widely in the

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,900
accessibility community so I'm also

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,210
pretty active on Twitter as well so

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,000
accessibility is like simply put it's

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,329
the practice of making your product or

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,909
service as usable by as many people as

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,759
possible so in the context of a website

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,250
it could be ensuring that it works well

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,290
for let's see someone who is visually

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,770
impaired using a screen reader software

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,470
which other soon demonstrate or someone

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,320
using or ensuring that this responsively

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,780
designed for someone using screen

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,799
magnification or someone using a mobile

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,500
device so to give you a better sense of

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,619
what this is about of demonstrate how I

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,560
will use a screen reader to access a

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,170
particular to look up information on

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,880
JavaScript or map function

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:20,790
so a screen reader is a software that

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:28,470
reads out the contents of the screen so

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:30,959
let me just demonstrate by Midway to be

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:35,090
written written regularly right

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,220
NVDA menu will not meet us and need

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:42,080
Google data Google Documents so this is

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:45,030
what right now what I want to do is to

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:49,080
use Google to search for information on

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:51,209
e on JavaScript map function and to add

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,190
the sort of bottom right is a printed

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:56,310
transcript of what it's speaking so this

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,650
is roughly what it sounds like and it

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:02,040
provides keystrokes that I can

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,600
efficiently use to move to various

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,040
structural elements of the page so in

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,480
this case I want to move immediately to

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,519
the search box

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,800
noting landmark search combo bar to the

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,239
left and autocomplete editable and then

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:19,310
I can just start typing

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:22,640
yay-hey-hey beauty okay

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,049
James clerk Maxwell's Oh incidentally

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,269
[Music]

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:29,340
it's started talking because the page

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:32,390
has finished loading so what I typically

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:37,170
do for increase like productivity is to

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:39,180
listen to at a faster rate so this is

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,850
all possible because it uses a

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,910
synthesized voice so you can get used to

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:49,110
how it pronounces certain sentences or

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:52,530
phrases or words with me alright so here

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:55,500
I am at the top of the page and here I

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:59,310
know that Google users the level

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,650
headings to sort it users that head

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,989
level headings as titles of each search

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:08,030
results so I can immediately go to the

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,030
first flat level hitting that I find

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:15,500
let's say I can also move to the next

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,500
one

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:23,269
right so I'm a fan of mdn so I'm just

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,269
going to go into this page

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:36,320
and let's see if his okay so it's it's

00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,030
finished loading and I can say what I

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,060
typically do on an unfamiliar web page

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:45,980
is to try to move to the first heading

00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:48,260
that I find so in this case I am here on

00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:57,400
the mean height of the piece so I can go

00:04:48,260 --> 00:05:00,290
down and start reading so this is the

00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:02,980
syntax of the map function and I can

00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:05,570
also have move slower using sort of

00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,760
moving by word you know because

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:13,850
sometimes the parameters can be a bit

00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:17,060
more complex so this is like roughly you

00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,610
know how a screen reader works so I hope

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:22,760
that this gives you a better idea of how

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:38,990
the screen video user would perceive or

00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:43,460
use your website right so why is you

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:47,590
know accessibility important so imagine

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:51,710
you're in your you know everyday life

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:54,410
not having convenient or easy access to

00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:57,260
information that you need or not being

00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:00,650
able to you know perform some activities

00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:04,190
for your daily life so some examples for

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:07,370
myself could be you know not being able

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:09,500
to conveniently use an i banking website

00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:13,010
because it doesn't work well or doesn't

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:15,830
use good HTML so I actually personally

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:20,120
experienced this problem on one of the

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:23,380
local banking websites you know some

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,420
other examples it would be not having

00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,820
sort of convenient access to integrated

00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:31,130
development environments which really I

00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:33,740
would love to use them because it really

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,240
improves your your productivity but it

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,070
doesn't work well with a screen reader

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,950
typically

00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:41,510
as well as you know not being able or as

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,560
well as perhaps you know booking and

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:47,480
uber or grab so some of these are

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:52,940
activities I find more challenging than

00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:54,350
others but but I'm you know s soft we

00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,919
have a great table like mainstream

00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:00,590
awareness of how people will use your

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,710
various products and services I do see

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,300
this changing so one thing is that when

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,639
I'm using a new product or service

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,530
especially if you are using some

00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,630
alternative interface to accept to

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,390
access it whether it sort of works for

00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:17,810
you is something that it's foremost in

00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:35,540
your mind so I would like to pass on the

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:37,430
remaining time to demo so I just wanted

00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,430
a quick poll at the same time

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:43,370
can you show can I have a show of hands

00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:46,729
who saw a screen reader you know in the

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:50,270
flesh for the first time all right keep

00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:52,850
your hands there who knows for those who

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,410
know what a 1 1 y or web accessibility

00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:57,590
is keep your hands raised the rest put

00:07:54,410 --> 00:08:00,729
it down all right sorry the lights -

00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:03,440
right okay and then keep your hands up

00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:06,640
only if you've worked on a web

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,560
accessibility project yourself before

00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,970
all right so that's only a really really

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:27,350
small helpful I'm gonna speak to you

00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:29,660
guys as well all right so I think you

00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,490
know I just wanted to share a little bit

00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:34,130
more the non-technical side for me it's

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,560
a little bit more than advocacy side to

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:38,300
really share why web accessibility is

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,370
really important and why we need it in

00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,310
the region because it's almost

00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,230
non-existent here so the first thing

00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,089
that I would like to talk about is you

00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:49,190
know screen readers or web accessibility

00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:51,050
is really beneficial for some

00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,990
like Dickson or gang who's not here

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:56,600
today so young is grabs first blind

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,980
quarter and Dixon is any rescue of

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,580
Computing's first visually impaired

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,170
student you know we clearly can see why

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,230
it will benefit them in terms of work

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:08,840
and studies but why we benefit us who

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:11,780
are not blind or visually impaired right

00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,160
and the this is concept I would like to

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:15,620
introduce which is also called inclusive

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,050
design which is that when we design are

00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,240
built for the extreme in you know in

00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:22,430
essence we can design for more because

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,650
when we take reference from such

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,330
different lives that daily leads to

00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:30,740
fresh experiences that we can build for

00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:32,660
our customers and even more so some of

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,300
the examples that I have here for

00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,850
example I think voice UI is a really big

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,470
one now and you know the likes of Amazon

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,150
and hippo and the rest have actually

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,440
looked towards how blind people actually

00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:47,420
live their lives and interact with with

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,780
audio cues in order to come up with

00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:53,210
fresh experiences on that and GPS on the

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,820
other hand maybe not so much the

00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:58,070
satellite imagery but the user interface

00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,610
and how we get navigated they were so so

00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:03,080
pioneered by someone who was blind and

00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:06,140
lastly of course you know OCR optical

00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,880
character recognition that benefits

00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:10,190
someone like Dixon when his professors

00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,560
just send out PDFs of scanned pages of

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,180
text books that he can't read or see a

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,550
benefits him but at the same time we are

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:21,620
also using it for a lot of you know

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:23,000
security applications as well so just to

00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,320
give you a little bit of a snapshot of

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,860
who does a 1:1 why or accessibility

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:33,550
these are some of the companies up there

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:38,420
Apple has been doing it for 27 years and

00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:40,610
ok so if you if you look at the the

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,200
first three rows they're all no original

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,000
they are not companies they were started

00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,220
in the region there's only one company

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,690
right at the bottom which is grab who

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,120
started in a region that actually

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,670
focuses on accessibility so how about

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,350
all the other startups the especially

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,300
the mature startups in the region are we

00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,830
looking at accessibility if Dixon wants

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,290
to buy groceries from Vermont can he do

00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,389
that you know or always be so on and so

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,519
forth

00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:09,199
so that's what we wanted to encourage at

00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:11,810
the same time so apart from companies if

00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:16,540
we look across geography geographical

00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:19,699
boundaries in the EU earlier last year

00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:23,000
it was made a legislative mandate that

00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:25,970
all governmental websites need to be web

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,560
accessible and because it was so

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,060
successful then they said you know why

00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,430
not let's just extend it to mobile apps

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,600
as well for governmental services and so

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:38,269
that's the law of the land at the moment

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:41,180
so in sorry yeah

00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:43,790
and in in the US I think it's also a

00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,889
little bit of a different take something

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,230
really interesting that that I would

00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:50,540
like to share is in the u.s. if you're a

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:52,370
person with a disability and you like a

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,139
particular service but it's not websites

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:56,329
about to you you can partner up with a

00:11:54,139 --> 00:11:58,250
lawyer to sue the company and the

00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:00,980
company cannot come to sue they can only

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,139
comply so this has been the story of how

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,850
companies like Airbnb and the rest have

00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,939
you know started on the accessibility

00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:09,949
journey about three months ago blind

00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:13,730
people's to mass comm because they say

00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:15,800
we want to find love as well so that's

00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:17,779
that's the level in which you know

00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,230
there's there's such support for web

00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:23,509
accessibility but how about in the

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:27,559
Southeast Asian region I think it is

00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:29,629
severely lacking if you go into the web

00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:32,180
sites of any company that started in

00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:33,439
this region and you try to learn how to

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,029
use a screen reader like Dickson does

00:12:33,439 --> 00:12:37,459
you realize that for people with visual

00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:40,339
impairment you can't access the

00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:42,709
information and in an age where some

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:45,610
people believe internet to be a basic

00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:51,110
human right that's just not fair to them

00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:54,529
right so what we've decided to do is

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:58,040
essentially start a a one on why I

00:12:54,529 --> 00:13:01,430
initiated in Southeast Asia where we are

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:04,100
looking to get web developers across the

00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:07,430
region starting in Singapore who would

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,980
express an interest to learn about web

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:12,199
accessibility how to do the audience how

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,050
to do the the fixtures for the

00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:15,810
accessibility

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:20,490
and to comply with the global standards

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:21,960
for the web accessibility initiative so

00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,120
if this is something that you'll be

00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,980
interested in essentially we would you

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,030
come in at zero experience we teach you

00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,620
you can take it back to your companies

00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,470
but at the same time we'll go a little

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,850
bit rope we will form little teams and

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,170
investigating all the different

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,970
companies and and help them with the

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,650
accessibility as well so if there's

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:41,040
something they are interested in you can

00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:44,880
come and speak to us and at the same

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,410
time with zero experience if you want to

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,120
learn how to do web accessibility we're

00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:52,050
also having a workshop tomorrow at 1:30

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,610
