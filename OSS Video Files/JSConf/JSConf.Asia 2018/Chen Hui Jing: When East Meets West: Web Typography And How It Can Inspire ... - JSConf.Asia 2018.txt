Title: Chen Hui Jing: When East Meets West: Web Typography And How It Can Inspire ... - JSConf.Asia 2018
Publication date: 2018-02-08
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	This talk traces the parallel history of western and eastern typography from handwriting to the internet age, setting the context for how the web is a brand new medium for typesetting. CSS allows us to implement advanced typographic features and multi-directional layouts, that not only benefits internationalisation, but opens up a myriad of options for creative and interesting layouts in general as well.

Hui Jing is a self-taught designer and developer with an inordinate love for CSS. Reducing lines of code in her web projects makes her extremely happy. She used to play basketball full-time and launched her web career during downtime between training sessions.
