Title: Chen Hui Jing: When East Meets West: Web Typography And How It Can Inspire ... - JSConf.Asia 2018
Publication date: 2018-02-08
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2018
Description: 
	This talk traces the parallel history of western and eastern typography from handwriting to the internet age, setting the context for how the web is a brand new medium for typesetting. CSS allows us to implement advanced typographic features and multi-directional layouts, that not only benefits internationalisation, but opens up a myriad of options for creative and interesting layouts in general as well.

Hui Jing is a self-taught designer and developer with an inordinate love for CSS. Reducing lines of code in her web projects makes her extremely happy. She used to play basketball full-time and launched her web career during downtime between training sessions.

[Music]

00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:18,480
everyone's how's everyone doing the

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,580
spotlight shining in my face I cannot

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,880
see any of your faces so I'm just gonna

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,529
pretend I'm talking to myself

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,400
spoiler alert what you're going to be

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:29,250
getting from me

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,439
over the next 30 minutes is exactly as

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,410
the title says you'll be hearing about

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,320
typography about layout and about design

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,750
all in the context of the web so there's

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,910
not a lot of JavaScript here I'm afraid

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,579
but I do hope you will stick around and

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,860
hear me out

00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:48,870
given this is Jay s con and all I think

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,840
it's safe to assume that everyone in

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,570
this room has had some experience with a

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,020
web so I'd like everyone to hold this

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:02,190
question in your minds for a little bit

00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:05,970
what does the web mean to you for me I

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,610
love the web it's the world wide web

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,619
right and I was a lucky kid in that even

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,470
though our family was far from rich I've

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,229
always had a computer in my house

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,570
I think my parents need to do it use it

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,700
for work or something but I was more

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,240
concerned about the games on there and

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:33,950
my first experience with the web if this

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:38,360
works sounds something like this this is

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,360
music to my ears

00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:46,539
and if you never heard this sound before

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:49,509
well you're obviously not from my

00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:52,299
generation and when I think about the

00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,369
web I think about how amazing it is that

00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:56,259
it can connect the world's population in

00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:58,750
fact without the web

00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:00,640
odds are we would never have crossed

00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:04,020
paths and I wouldn't be standing here on

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:10,750
this stage talking to you about the web

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:13,599
so Star Trek discovery anybody okay one

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:16,500
oh come on man so this beautiful woman

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,120
is Michelle Yeoh one of the greatest

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,500
female action stars of all time and

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,989
pride of Malaysians

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,780
everywhere now when she when she first

00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:28,480
got to Hollywood people were amazed that

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,790
she could speak English so well and she

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,190
in turn was equally amazed that people

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,260
in Hollywood had such a terrible grasp

00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:39,250
of world geography seeing as they did

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:42,099
not know where Malaysia was I'm sure

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:44,920
many people from America and Europe know

00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:47,049
exactly where Southeast Asia is I mean

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,170
look around you look at all the experts

00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:53,560
no offense if you are one but I have

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:58,420
also met people whose idea of Asia was

00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:01,180
limited to China India or Japan so this

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:04,030
is a very helpful map that I've created

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,400
to show people where exactly we are so

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,590
Southeast Asia is made up of 11

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,069
countries and every single one of them

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:13,959
has their own distinct culture English

00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:17,079
is taught in schools across the region

00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:20,049
but we have so many other languages as

00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:22,510
well and of the world's seven point six

00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:25,120
billion people only four point nine

00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,340
percent are native English speakers but

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,739
fifty one point two percent of websites

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,650
are in English so something isn't quite

00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:34,359
right about this ratio the world is

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,970
beautiful because of its cultural

00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:38,799
diversity language is a part of a

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,690
society's cultural heritage and is

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,290
especially important for the maintenance

00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:46,720
of it now the web is an informational

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,970
medium in that people go online to find

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,069
out about things even if you're going

00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,730
online to purchase something don't you

00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:54,010
need in from

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:57,010
about the product you're going to buy so

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,959
the priority is always content the web

00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,200
is only useful to the people who can

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,379
understand the content on it which is

00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,640
why I'm slightly comforted to know that

00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:09,910
internationalization is a priority at

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,739
the w3c it is crucial that a technology

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:14,080
meant to be ubiquitous supports the

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:16,570
creation of local content across the

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,850
world that every writing system in the

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:22,419
world can be correctly rendered on the

00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:24,610
web just to prove a point these are the

00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:26,740
various scripts in use in Southeast Asia

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,560
and they can all be displayed and laid

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,060
out correctly on the web today with

00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,710
better Unicode support and phone

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,070
technologies for the individual

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,450
characters as well as various CSS

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:40,330
properties for overall layout we now

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:42,870
have a means to carve out a space on the

00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:47,470
web that truly belongs to each of us

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,030
that truly feels like home before I go

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:51,340
any further I really should introduce

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,830
myself my name is quitting and I'm from

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,780
sorry I'm from Malaysia I used to play

00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,720
basketball full time and it was what

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:01,570
kick-started my web career I also has

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,450
asked the harm they've introduced I have

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,950
an inordinate love of CSS to the point

00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,560
where I'm compelled to write and speak

00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:12,789
about it including hijacking a J's

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,310
concession to sneak in some CSS talk now

00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:17,080
somebody once asked me this question do

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:21,190
developers even care about typography

00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,470
and I think they do but maybe I'm wrong

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:28,000
I usually am how many of you think

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:30,340
typography is important thank you now

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,889
typography has always been an integral

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,229
part of human-computer interaction and

00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:37,389
software design there's a very good

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:39,910
reason why Apple has an entire section

00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:41,320
dedicated to typography in the Apple

00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,840
developers human interface guidelines

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,190
and you may disagree with me but I feel

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,560
that as a front-end developer the

00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,660
copyright impacts how our sites or

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,669
applications look so we too have a share

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,700
of the responsibility in the design of

00:05:51,669 --> 00:05:56,289
our products

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,229
Oliver brightenstein said this in his

00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:01,900
article back in 2006 and he reiterated

00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:04,780
that the web as a medium is all about

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,620
information textual content is the most

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,110
straightforward

00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:09,880
of delivering information on the web and

00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:12,100
whether we like it or not

00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,910
topography is increasingly becoming what

00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:18,400
differentiates a good website from that

00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,590
let's be honest people are superficial

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,290
and they're really short attention spans

00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,990
these days the typography layout and

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,850
design of your site or application are

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,590
like the clothes you wear and people

00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:32,050
make judgments of their first

00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:35,350
impressions of you or your product based

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:37,389
on what they see there are many

00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,250
definitions of typography out there and

00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:42,160
I personally like this one by Garrett no

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,050
J letters are the building blocks of a

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,510
writing system regardless of language

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,030
now I believe there's a pretty diverse

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:51,580
mix of languages spoken by the audience

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:54,220
here today and while a large number of

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:57,630
these languages are alphabetic Chinese

00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:00,250
is not one of them Chinese is a

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:02,620
logographic writing system where each

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,050
character is composed with in a uniform

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,180
Square this allows Chinese to be very

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,970
efficiently regardless of whether it is

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,860
set horizontally or vertically and until

00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,840
proven otherwise it seems that the

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,610
Chinese script developed separately from

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:19,120
the proto-sinaitic script which were the

00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:21,100
origins of alphabetic languages this is

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,229
why the Western languages in Europe are

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,020
inherently different from the Eastern

00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:27,640
languages in Asia alphabetic languages

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,560
which originated from the Phoenician

00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,510
alphabet combine a small set of letters

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,080
to form all the words the language needs

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:36,789
for the purpose of communication Chinese

00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,400
characters on the other hand number in

00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:41,229
the tens of thousands each a unique

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,419
glyph that can express meaning on their

00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:47,680
own or be used in combination with other

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:49,660
glyphs for example hippopotamus this is

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,940
an English word that takes 12 letters to

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:57,130
spell in Chinese we only need two

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:59,620
characters per ma lubinski filter this

00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:04,620
is a German word that takes 14 letters

00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:04,620
to spell in Chinese we can say bunny

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:12,120
green - oi director this is an Irish

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:15,630
word of 21 letters and again in Chinese

00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,610
show you what can I say Chinese is a

00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:21,259
concise language

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:23,239
the appearance of the earliest letter

00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:25,279
forms was directly influenced by the

00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:27,529
tools that were used to create them and

00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,119
they continually involved in tandem with

00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:30,919
the limitations of the technologies of

00:08:29,119 --> 00:08:33,740
their time so take the Latin alphabet

00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:36,560
for example which is derived from Greek

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,560
the earliest letters were San serif when

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,879
writing was done with a heartbeat pen

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,649
service may have came about due to a

00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,110
transition to a square cut writing

00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:47,779
implement like a flat stiff brush later

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,750
scribes and copyists used quill pens and

00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:52,430
as demand for written matter grew they

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,560
developed more efficient styles of

00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:57,079
writing evolving the letter forms yet

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,389
again when it comes to classifying

00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,800
script styles Latin based scripts can

00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:03,970
broadly be placed into two big

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,230
categories of serifs and sans serifs a

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,939
Chinese characters also changed a lot

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,379
since their origins it's just that

00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:12,019
Chinese writing went through the entire

00:09:09,379 --> 00:09:15,290
process of development and evolution way

00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:18,259
earlier than Europe the key implement of

00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:20,959
Chinese writing is the brush calligraphy

00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:23,540
was and still is one of the most highly

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,370
regarded Chinese arts the works of

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,470
famous calligraphers were used as the

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,889
basis for carving wood blocks for

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:32,449
printing these days typefaces used for

00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:34,129
printing Chinese publications can

00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:36,500
broadly be classified into the following

00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:40,879
families we have some tea also known as

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:43,759
Ming tea kaity funk song tea and Haiti

00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:47,149
now the last two are 20th century

00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:49,550
creations so it's really recent Chinese

00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:51,620
typefaces are extremely challenging to

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,809
create simply due to the volume of

00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,670
glyphs required the average number of

00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:58,579
glyphs for a Chinese system font clocks

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:01,040
in and around 35,000 glyphs give or take

00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:02,779
a few thousand and typefaces that have

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,759
enough lift coverage to be used in body

00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:07,189
copy are usually made by foundries as

00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:10,610
very few independent type designers have

00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:12,290
the bandwidth for them now language and

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:14,750
writing have a lot human beings to

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:16,730
communicate ideas and record history for

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,620
thousands of years and we've written on

00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:21,529
almost anything we could get our hands

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,199
on but right now the medium of our time

00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:26,000
is the screen and the browser our types

00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:28,329
are our font files and we've replaced

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,399
typesetting with composing sticks with

00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:36,220
yes but remember this an electronic

00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,899
display is a proxy medium whatever we

00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,239
see displayed on a screen comes from

00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:42,459
data encoded as electronic signals and

00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:45,040
the heart of electronic displays is

00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:48,819
light it is transient we cannot reach

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:52,239
out and touch light now the web isn't

00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:53,529
even 38 and this young medium is nothing

00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:57,399
like we've seen before

00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:59,739
it is dynamic and interactive now some

00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,529
designers especially those who aren't

00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:04,899
used to especially those who are used to

00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:07,709
having absolute control over their final

00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:11,019
presentations tend to find this

00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:13,089
disturbing right and although it may be

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:15,279
tempting to view the web as simply print

00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:19,799
expressed on an electronic screen it is

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:22,329
not it is a unique medium of its own

00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:23,949
when we talk about typography on the web

00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:25,929
one of the first things that comes to

00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:30,459
mind is web fonts so let's start off

00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:32,319
with some basics what is a font now in

00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:35,230
the world of metal typesetting this is a

00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:36,819
font which refers to a complete set of

00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,999
metal types that were used to type two

00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:42,819
entire pages of text and if you can see

00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:45,399
the tiny text label this set being shown

00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:47,199
is four Caslon 12-point but in the

00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,949
digital world these are funds

00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:52,509
specifically font files for both analog

00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:55,209
and digital fonts you can think of them

00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:58,689
as collections of glyphs which begs the

00:11:55,209 --> 00:12:00,639
next question what are glyphs now a

00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:03,069
glyph is the specific shape of a letter

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,579
or character in a particular font so

00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:09,759
this is a glyph this is a blue that's

00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:12,489
also a glyph in the digital world

00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,919
everything is later so glyphs can be

00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:18,549
described as with an array of pixels or

00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:20,019
collections of vector images or parts of

00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:23,019
Bezier curves in straight lines

00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:25,480
different font formats store information

00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:28,119
about the font like the glyphs they're

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,829
encodings metadata about the font etc

00:12:28,119 --> 00:12:31,899
differently based on how their

00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:34,299
specifications were written because you

00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:36,129
know data formats right and if you've

00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:38,710
ever used web fonts before you'd have

00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:40,180
seen at least some of these formats

00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:42,610
and if you've ever wondered why there

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,530
was so many well this little bit of

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:46,570
history involved here so the earlier

00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,270
spawns were pixel based bitmaps which

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:51,670
didn't work out so well when it came to

00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:53,440
high-resolution printing so a lot of

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:56,530
smart people work to solve this problem

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,750
and one of the solutions came from Adobe

00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:01,090
founder John Warnock he created

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,910
PostScript in 1985 which was the very

00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,670
first vector font and it really took off

00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:09,180
so TrueType was Apple and Microsoft's

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,950
answer to Adobe's phone monopoly and

00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,330
eventually Microsoft turned to Adobe and

00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:16,480
together they came up with

00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:19,270
OpenType now Microsoft also came up with

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,490
e o T which is embedded open type a

00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,560
proprietary format for use on webpages

00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,750
and although they tried to submit this

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,050
to the w3c as a recommendation it was

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,650
rejected in favor of more web open font

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,020
format

00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,940
now what too is simply an improvement of

00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,790
a wolf with significantly better

00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:39,010
compression rates on the practical side

00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,870
of things we use the font phase rule to

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,910
declare a list of different font formats

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,010
in the hopes that our fonts will show up

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:48,100
correctly in as many browsers as

00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:50,080
possible the number of web formats that

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,790
we need to declare has decreased over

00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,400
the years and right now you can pretty

00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:58,750
much get away with declaring just woof

00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:01,990
and woof to the font face rule has more

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:04,600
descriptors but only these two the font

00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:07,090
family and source are mandatory so if

00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,240
either either one of them are absent the

00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:13,570
entire font face rule is ignored now the

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,790
font family descriptor is simply a label

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,950
that we reference in other CSS

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,620
declarations so even if you're using a

00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,930
font like Helvetica you can actually

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,780
call it dumplings and it would still

00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,370
work then the source descriptor is a

00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,560
comma separated list of external

00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:31,330
references or locally installed form

00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,640
phase names it is made up of a

00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:36,310
declaration of the font files location

00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,660
and an optional font hint so if the

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,640
browser doesn't support a particular

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,850
font format stated in the hint it won't

00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,440
even bother loading the font at all so

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,120
the next three descriptors for style

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,730
weight and stretch are used to match

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:51,120
styles to a particular typeface in later

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,820
declarations so technically

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,700
you could assign a black typeface to a

00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:59,160
font weight of 100 and proceed to

00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,050
confuse your entire team who cannot

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,300
figure out why setting a weight of 100

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:06,050
gives them this massively black typeface

00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:11,100
perhaps an idea for April Fool's Day

00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:13,500
hashtag don't get fired then we have the

00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,390
Unicode range descriptor which allows us

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,520
to create composite fonts that mix

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,920
glyphs from different fronts for

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,960
different scripts so sometimes the Latin

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,779
characters for Chinese ones don't look

00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,820
particularly nice this is more apparent

00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:29,430
on the older Windows systems to be

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,620
honest so the unicorn range descriptor

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:33,600
allows us to specify a specific font

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,580
file to be loaded for individual code

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,710
points or a range of code points so in

00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:40,500
this example I've created a font family

00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:43,140
called Haiti Plus because you know

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,420
naming things is hard but Haiti plus

00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:48,089
we'll use the Haiti SC font for

00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,680
everything but the second rule will tell

00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:52,770
the browser to use the mechanical font

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,930
for all Latin characters instead the

00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,610
Firefox dev tools has a font panel which

00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:59,940
shows which fonts are loaded on your

00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:02,400
page and although it's really small you

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,500
can try to squint and see that both hate

00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,080
ESC and Mechanica are loaded for my

00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,209
custom font family hating plus now the

00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,070
per page does not contain any Latin

00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:14,640
characters meccanica will not be loaded

00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:17,190
at all because it's not needed now fond

00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,020
descriptors and CSS properties look very

00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,690
similar but are two completely different

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,850
things Chris Lilley who chaired the

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,430
group that developed font face explained

00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,850
it very well in his CSS talk that

00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:31,080
properties are requests for styling and

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,450
descriptors and descriptions of

00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,810
capabilities so a font-weight:bold

00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:38,940
within a font face rule means that this

00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:42,000
font can do both while a

00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:45,029
font-weight:bold applied as a applied as

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,880
a property means pls style this element

00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:50,640
with a font that can do both it's kind

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:53,130
of a subtle difference so these here are

00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,810
CSS font properties so from what I've

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,610
seen properties like font size font

00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:59,280
weight and font style are pretty

00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,829
commonly used font stretch maybe a

00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:04,589
little bit less and the last two which

00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:06,419
are font size adjust and font synthesis

00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,009
almost never seen used in the wild

00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,779
before so let's talk a bit about those

00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:12,899
two which were newly added to the font

00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:14,879
level 3 specification font size adjust

00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:17,490
was put in to address legibility issues

00:17:14,879 --> 00:17:19,649
because faced us with low X Heights may

00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,059
sometimes be less legible especially

00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:23,549
when they're triggered as a fallback

00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:25,589
font we can set the value of this

00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:28,439
property to an aspect ratio of the

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:30,539
first-choice font so any fallback fonts

00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,929
trigger will have the font size adjusted

00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:35,669
to match this ratio font synthesis was

00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:38,100
put in to address the issue of four

00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:40,649
bolts and four italics because sometimes

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:43,049
the true italic or heavier version of a

00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:45,360
font doesn't exist or the browser can't

00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:48,149
find it and so the browser will try to

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,169
compensate unfortunately the end result

00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:51,389
often isn't pretty

00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:53,429
so with this property you can set it to

00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:55,379
a value of none to tell the browser you

00:17:53,429 --> 00:18:00,960
know it's fine appreciate the effort but

00:17:55,379 --> 00:18:03,419
no thank you now for the fun stuff font

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,210
feature properties which were introduced

00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,919
in fonts level 3 more than font

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,200
technologies allow fonts to contain a

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,999
lot more glyphs than before so we can

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,399
utilize a variety of typographic

00:18:11,999 --> 00:18:16,799
features like sorceress ligatures or

00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,389
start numerals and so on and perhaps

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,249
some of you might be wondering what's

00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:22,139
the point why why do we want to have all

00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:24,929
these typographic features as a waste of

00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:26,850
time but no they are part and parcel of

00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:29,039
good typography which is necessary to

00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:31,049
hold your readers attention now the

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,029
written word is a transference of speech

00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:35,580
which is hurt into something visual

00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:37,440
which is seen good speakers will vary

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,259
their cadence they will use gestures

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,669
they'll emphasize certain words

00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:43,740
typographic features like small caps and

00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:46,230
correct use of italics and punctuation

00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,090
they do the same for text now other

00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,340
features like old-style numerals and

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:52,049
ligatures they help maintain typographic

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,970
color to make reading more comfortable

00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:56,369
so these are the features you can turn

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,590
on via CSS but note that the font you're

00:18:56,369 --> 00:19:00,960
using must have these features to begin

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,759
with so this lot up here are the

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,269
features most often mentioned at web

00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:09,299
typography talks but almost nobody talks

00:19:06,269 --> 00:19:10,860
about font variant east-asian what this

00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,809
property does is allow for glyph

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,970
substitution and positioning in East

00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:17,580
Asian text if you're unfamiliar with

00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,330
harm characters it may seem like East

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,309
Asian

00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,460
just share the same glyphs but it

00:19:20,309 --> 00:19:24,960
actually depends Han unification

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,429
involves assigning the same code point

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,380
to different glyphs and has been quite a

00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:30,600
controversial issue which we will not

00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,909
get into but the point is that the same

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,289
code point can have variant lifts

00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:36,659
depending on the language being used

00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:39,000
like simplified Chinese Gliss versus

00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:40,649
traditional Chinese glyphs Japanese

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,140
glyphs have their own specification

00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:45,360
known as JIS or Japanese industrial

00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,159
standard and they too have alternate

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,230
glyphs for the same character so this

00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:52,649
property allows us to toggle these

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:55,230
variant glyphs and when I mentioned

00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:58,320
OpenType earlier I also want to point

00:19:55,230 --> 00:20:00,570
out that in September of 2016 version

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,809
1.8 of the specification introduced

00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:06,059
OpenType font variations it was in joint

00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:09,600
development by Microsoft Google Apple

00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:11,820
and Adobe an open type variable font is

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,700
one in which the equivalent of multiple

00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,710
individual fonts can be compactly

00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:19,950
packaged within a single font file and

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,230
this is potentially a big plus when it

00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,429
comes to performance especially

00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:27,090
significant for funds with large glyph

00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:29,309
sets like all the CJK fonts in addition

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:31,620
to that the dynamism of variable fonts

00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:33,690
is perfect for the web medium and opens

00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:37,260
up the possibility of new kinds of

00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:39,299
responsive typography if you're

00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,980
interested in seeing how variable fonts

00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,870
behave you'll have to check out access

00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,549
praxis by Lauren's penny which is

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,950
essentially a playground for the

00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:50,279
available very favorable fonts on the

00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:53,309
web so Taipei based type foundry avec

00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:55,710
technology aka wending cards II created

00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:57,899
the first Chinese variable font called

00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:02,429
one things in C hey and you can play

00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:05,250
with it on access praxis so vertical

00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:07,200
writing is traditionally East Asian for

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,809
Han characters which are used in Chinese

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,610
Japanese and Korean but when it comes to

00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:14,730
design we can lay up text in all

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:16,649
directions if we so choose so I want to

00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,289
introduce the writing mode property

00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:22,889
which deals specifically with vertical

00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:25,529
text you literally turn the browser on

00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:27,840
its side now some people might be saying

00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:30,330
that's no big deal we can already do

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,830
this with CSS transforms but it's kind

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,330
of different

00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,980
this is what happens to your text when

00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:38,860
the different values of writing mode are

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,690
applied the default is horizontal top to

00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,330
bottom to change the direction to

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:46,900
vertical we use vertical RL or vertical

00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:48,820
LR now when we rotate text it's not only

00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,040
the lines that change direction because

00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,960
each line contains individual letters or

00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,270
characters and they have an orientation

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,730
as well so for text orientation the

00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,190
initial value is mixed browsers are

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:02,050
smart enough to tell which languages can

00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,390
can be typeset both vertically and

00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:06,640
horizontally or in one direction only so

00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,860
Chinese characters for example will

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,720
always be displayed upright while

00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,910
horizontal only languages will have

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,220
their characters rotated when vertical

00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,470
the text orientation property lets you

00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:19,600
control this and you can always make all

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,540
the characters up right or sideways if

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,270
you want to one more relevant property

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:28,030
is text combined up right this addresses

00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:30,520
the issue of numerals or abbreviations

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:32,679
in vertical text so a very common use

00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,630
case is dates especially for Taiwan

00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:37,179
where they use the minke or calendar

00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,920
this property that says fit all the

00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:41,740
digits into the width of one character

00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,690
and display them upright no browser

00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,790
supports in the digits value yet which

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,470
allows us to dictate how many digits are

00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:49,870
acceptable to be squeezed into this

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,330
space the range allowed is supposed to

00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,640
be between two and four characters but

00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:57,309
for now with the old value there is no

00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,100
limit so you could sort of put a word

00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:04,270
like hippopotamus in there it will work

00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:06,070
but horribly squished now laying out

00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:08,380
content in a different direction does

00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,450
require a change in perspective and I

00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,429
gleaned quite a few insights from

00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,920
working with vertical layout for example

00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:16,690
the techniques I was so used to for

00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,480
centering items worked a bit differently

00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,790
when it came to vertical layout to

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,010
vertically send her a block setting the

00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,740
top and bottom margins to auto actually

00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,990
does work unlike in horizontal writing

00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,179
which is great but trying to Center

00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:36,429
something horizontally is an exercise in

00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:38,260
pain the directions of top right bottom

00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:41,110
left to start getting a bit confusing

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:43,270
when you have rotated Latin text so you

00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,100
have this header and you want some extra

00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:46,110
spacing

00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,669
between the header and the paragraph you

00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:51,600
set the margin on the bottom of the

00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:55,080
header or to the left it's actually the

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,390
left so it's kind of weird which is why

00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,610
we have a CSS logical property

00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:01,710
specification which introduces the new

00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:03,929
CSS properties that are flow relative

00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:05,669
equivalents of physical box model

00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:08,580
properties so these properties use

00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:10,559
things like block start and block end or

00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,900
inline start and inline end instead of

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,520
left and right the specification is in

00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,140
the thick of working draft status but

00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,870
I'm really eager to see developed and

00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:22,650
implement it but now support is kind of

00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:24,750
spotty now before I discovered the

00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,120
writing mode property I did wonder to

00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:30,179
myself if it was possible to do vertical

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,690
typesetting on the web and the answer is

00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:35,190
a resounding yes all three properties I

00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,610
covered earlier were used for this

00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:40,440
particular demo and this is a layout I

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:42,539
built for displaying Chinese text with a

00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,429
toggle that allowed readers to switch

00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:46,590
between vertical and horizontal layouts

00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:48,600
it wasn't as straightforward as I

00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:50,520
thought it would be because a tricky

00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,350
thing was getting the images to

00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,299
orientate correctly now it would have

00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,710
been nice to have a media query for

00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,659
writing mode so I could lay out my

00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,570
images accordingly with the picture

00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:02,220
element but that doesn't exist yet so I

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:05,820
ended up working around the image issue

00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,650
with you know CSS transforms instead so

00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,780
yes there is still work to be done to

00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:12,630
further develop Chinese typesetting on

00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:15,929
the web and for all non latin-based

00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:18,360
languages actually so the Chinese layout

00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:20,190
taskforce which I am a part of aims to

00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,809
document requirements for the layout and

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:24,120
presentation of text for the major

00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:27,390
languages of China when those languages

00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,220
are used by web standards the document

00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:32,490
will provide requirements for the

00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,230
development of w3c standards affected by

00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,559
languages in used in China including

00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:40,650
Hansel Mongolian Tibetan and Weger

00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:42,570
scripts now implementing vertical

00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,490
layouts has become much easier as

00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:46,350
browser vendors continue to improve the

00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:48,630
functionality of their products and this

00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:51,960
opens up an aspect of graphic design

00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:54,840
that isn't often seen on the web at the

00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,850
moment for example you can make a

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,520
bookshelf style list of Post

00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,620
just CSS something like this can be done

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,350
by applying vertical RL to each list

00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,940
item plus some padding and insert box

00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:08,730
shadows for the visual effect and

00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:10,710
another idea can be for headers because

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,540
for horizontal languages you wouldn't

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:14,190
lay out long chunks of text vertically

00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,310
because that just makes things hard to

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:19,770
read but using vertical text for short

00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:23,910
titles or headers can really break up

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:25,950
the monotony of a long page other subtle

00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,080
users of vertical text could be for tags

00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,880
on blog posts where the information is

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,470
not critical to the main content so

00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,310
laying it out vertically doesn't

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,360
adversely affect the reading experience

00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:38,310
for language is meant to be read

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:40,980
horizontally from top to bottom vertical

00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:42,300
textured largely be decorative we don't

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,550
want to compromise the reading

00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,770
experience for long-form passages so and

00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:48,840
smaller screens we can make use of media

00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:51,110
queries to revert to a horizontal layout

00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,120
that makes better use of limited space

00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:56,160
now conversely there are instances where

00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:58,920
text rotate it vertically can work on

00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,410
narrow screen sizes as well perhaps you

00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,840
realize that the hamburger menu is not

00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:06,480
the best mobile UI pattern that we came

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,770
up with so depending on the number of

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,110
links that you have in your navigation

00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,970
perhaps laying them out vertically on

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:14,280
the side edge could be a design worth

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,750
considering and I'm sure many of you can

00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:19,100
come up with even more interesting

00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:20,940
design that utilize vertical layouts

00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,830
statistically there aren't that many

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,230
sites that use the writing mode property

00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:27,240
and when I started building vertical

00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:30,210
layouts grit hadn't landed yet so I used

00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,400
Flex box for a lot of my layouts flex

00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:35,100
box support is great I mean it has wider

00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,250
coverage than border-radius right but

00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:40,350
flex box with writing mode doesn't play

00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:42,120
too well together I'll be honest there

00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:45,240
are quite a large number of cross

00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,160
browser issues like in Firefox if you

00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,570
don't specify a width on the element

00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,940
with a vertical writing mode it just

00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:53,340
gets kicked off the page there working

00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,800
on it by the way but that doesn't mean

00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,110
we should shy away from using vertical

00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,450
text altogether in fact there's never

00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:02,310
been a better time than now to live on

00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,860
the cutting edge because evergreen

00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:06,810
browsers are a thing now with bug fixes

00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,730
and new features being shipped faster

00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,210
than ever

00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:13,390
CSS bit I feel

00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:15,730
the best rollouts of a new major CSS

00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:17,860
feature ever with almost all the major

00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:20,290
browsers shipping it in March last year

00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:22,480
by now more than 70 percent of the

00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:25,330
market is using a browser that supports

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,570
grip and here's a little secret I

00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:30,340
discovered by raising bucks we find when

00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:32,020
trying out new features we're actually

00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,300
showing browser vendors that these

00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,580
features are in demand and this works

00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,530
both ways if we don't use features

00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:40,090
simply because they are buggy browser

00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:42,370
vendors will think that nobody really

00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,770
cares about that feature and choose to

00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:46,750
fix more pressing bugs instead now if

00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,700
more of us use those features and raise

00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:51,580
the bucks we discover it sends a signal

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,140
to browser vendors that people are using

00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,030
these features and encourage them to

00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,720
address related bucks sooner rather than

00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,960
later

00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,640
like what Yuna said this morning so

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,350
here's a long list of resources I

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,520
referred to when preparing this talk and

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,560
I'll share these slides for anybody

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,660
who's interested and if you need

00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,580
inspiration for vertical layouts the

00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:12,400
today yokel Weber wat site has a really

00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:14,260
nice showcase John Simmons also has an

00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,610
experimental layout lab where she

00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,210
showcases all the different things that

00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:21,910
are now possible with modern CSS and

00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:23,830
even if you don't end up using any of

00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,480
what I've covered today immediately in

00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:27,670
your next project I mean your jeaious

00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,920
guys aren't you I hope that you keep

00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:33,370
these techniques and properties in the

00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:35,560
back of your mind and maybe one day when

00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:38,350
you're tired of building the same old

00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:41,980
layouts again and again you'll reach for

00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:42,930
them and create something amazing thank

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:48,439
you
