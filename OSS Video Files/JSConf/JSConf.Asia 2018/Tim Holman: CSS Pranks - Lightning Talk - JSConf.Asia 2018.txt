[Music]

00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:18,930
do one more why not hi papoom I'm gonna

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,810
talk about CSS pranks J's Kampf I know

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,859
but CSS pranks you used to I don't even

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,500
know if I'll need the whole five minutes

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,699
here they used to be a really cool way

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,650
that you could do this in Chrome there

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,380
was a file called custom CSS and if you

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,030
open that file and you put CSS in it it

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,160
would apply that CSS to every single

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,480
website that this person went to which

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,430
was an awesome way to just kind of mess

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,579
with them and mangle with them but that

00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,320
was eventually deprecated but you can

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,539
now pretty much build a small extension

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,950
add to CSS into it install the extension

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,690
on anybody who's really kind of

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,129
unsuspecting and if they've just left

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,829
that computer open you can kind of do

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:54,390
that it used to be funnier because in

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,760
custom CSS it would apply to all the

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,870
settings and everything like that in the

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,840
browser so sometimes it was really

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,340
confusing to kind of turn things off but

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,840
yeah so once you kind of enter this

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,280
point where you can enter CSS into

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,740
anybody's page you can really start to

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,840
kind of mess with some people so here's

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,060
a really really simple example if you

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,979
put grayscale 100% on everything

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,140
everybody's websites are gonna be black

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,090
and white and it's just every single

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,290
thing you're looking at Google Images

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,270
anything like that it's black and white

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,830
and the key I think to messing with

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:30,030
people is subtle rather than

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,880
full-blown unusable 'ti if you rotate

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,350
the page just by a tiny tiny amount it's

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,759
gonna look normal at the start this is

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,829
my old website but as they start to

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,900
scroll down it's gonna start to get

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:44,159
weirder and weirder where here's my my

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,420
current website for example you can do

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,759
that to every single website that

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,049
somebody visits and they're just I guess

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,140
you just gotta kind of start to tilt

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,119
your head something like that this is

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,100
another kind of funny one is it's kind

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,630
of trying to take advantage of class

00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,939
names that are used by a lot of websites

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,869
so here's a keyframe animation that will

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:06,630
that will spin something if you apply

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:09,000
that to the class logo the ID logo logo

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,070
images logo image

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,020
every site is not gonna start to have a

00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,680
logo that kind of spins around here's

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,870
code pen

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,960
yeah there's Google if you do this to

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,670
somebody again it doesn't really give

00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,640
them enough reason to think what's going

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,490
on here I need to fix this so just say

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,700
have you notice the logo of spinning on

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:33,630
a lot of websites it's just a trend just

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:36,480
a design trend yeah you can change every

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,220
every link make it hot pink there's

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,209
there's TweetDeck another one odds for

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,070
breast cancer who doesn't even yeah

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:45,540
there we go this is this is something

00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,300
that you can do that's kind of really

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,780
messing is make a keyframe animation

00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:54,600
that rotates the hue of things so when

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,100
you do that this is just an image you

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,770
can kind of start to see that it really

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,290
slowly changes in tones and that'll be

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,820
every women on every website that these

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,070
people go to and if you really want to

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,590
mess with them cleverly you make it over

00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:10,860
a minute long the animation so it's just

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,200
really not something they kind of notice

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,019
but you you can tell it really messes

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,330
with their braids just make every

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,400
transition really really slow on every

00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,900
page make it important if they're doing

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,510
any animations everything that's going

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,250
to run for three seconds and then you

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,610
can mess with just like obnoxious just

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,350
CSS that I kind of showed in my talk you

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,850
can just have all their fonts kind of go

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,260
crazy but you will actually send

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,680
somebody insane by doing that that's all

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:43,460
I have to say thank you

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:43,460
