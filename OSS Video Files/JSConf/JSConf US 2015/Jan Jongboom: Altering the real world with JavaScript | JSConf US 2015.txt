Title: Jan Jongboom: Altering the real world with JavaScript | JSConf US 2015
Publication date: 2015-06-17
Playlist: JSConf US 2015
Description: 
	JavaScript is everywhere, but too often it's locked in computers and phones. We need to bridge the gap between the physical world and your computer... It's time to alter the world around us with JavaScript! In previous JSConf talks Jan Jongboom ripped mainboards out of phones; abused sensors; and juggled devices, but this session is going to be harder, deeper, higher and more crazy! How about procedural music generated by the sensor data of all members of the audience? Using bluetooth beacons to find out if the person next to you is worth talking to? Hardware hacking your Firefox OS phone to add more sensors? Geofencing your newborn with a phone mainboard? And all of that... with JavaScript! Loaded with demo's this talk will forever change the way you think about JavaScript in the real world. LET'S DO THIS!

	00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:20,699
Yes!

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:21,699
Hi!

00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:22,699
Welcome.

00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:23,699
So my name is Jan Jongboom.

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,699
I indeed live in the Netherlands.

00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:29,820
It took me 14 hours on an airplane without inflight entertainment

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,619
to get down here.

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,530
So sacrifices, you know?

00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,390
I work in Telenor, it's like AT&T.

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:43,480
We're a big Telco, and they pay me to work on Open Source.

00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,890
So yes.

00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,729
Thank you.

00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:51,070
So in the past two and a half years, I've been mostly working with Mozilla.

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:55,370
I've been a pair on the Firefox OS project, we've launched phones in Eastern

00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:02,309
Europe and southeast Asia, and lately I've been focusing my efforts on

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,759
anything related with the real world.

00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:08,380
Internet of things, robots, yesterday I even built a rocket.

00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,380
Come on.

00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,049
Yes, it went up extremely fast, and it went down

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,260
even faster.

00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,200
But...

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
You know, like...

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,680
The fact that we're in this incredible ballroom with

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,689
so many developers, that are all getting excited by playing with bots, playing

00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,700
with rockets, playing with ships -- that excites me, man.

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,700
Because...

00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,479
It is one of the best times to be in technology at this

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,479
moment.

00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:43,679
We are on the verge of a new era.

00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:49,319
When I learned to program, like, in the '90s, if you wrote an

00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:54,270
application, if you wrote a computer program, it essentially meant that, like,

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,610
it's running in this confined box.

00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:02,049
If there's input getting into the computer, you did it over your keyboard, and then when

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,029
it came out, it came out of this.

00:02:05,029 --> 00:02:07,899
This is no longer the case.

00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:13,750
Like, the new programmer is going to do this, like, having a button and then, like, hello,

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,390
Jan -- it's going to do it with a real breadboard and a button and an LED that

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,390
flashes.

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,880
You cannot imagine how incredibly happy I was, after I got my Arduino

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,280
starter kit, and I wrote some code that made an LED blink.

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,959
You know?

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,060
I was like this.

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,260
Like, showing my mom.

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,260
Like, hey, mom.

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,769
You can type in your name in a computer and it spits your name

00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:37,950
back out.

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,459
And I have not been as enthusiastic as this about computers in a

00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:43,829
long time.

00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:49,000
And finally, doing all these hardware things, that is what gets me totally

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
into this.

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,890
So we can take our code out of this confined box, and into the real

00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,920
world.

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:01,900
And this is a revolution that is just getting started.

00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,900
We're nowhere near yet.

00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,459
We don't know what is going on, or how it's going to end up.

00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,180
But, like, looking at all these extremely smart

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,739
people, one thing I know for sure -- that this revolution is going to be led

00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,540
by JavaScript.

00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,100
I can imagine you guys are also incredibly tired.

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:27,329
Like, three days of, like, full on action.

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:32,489
So today we're going to have, like, a fun, nice demo-full talk.

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:34,920
We're going to have audience participation.

00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,810
Yes, real audience participation.

00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,060
Isn't that cool?

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,140
And we're going to have a fuckton of GIFs.

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,890
So...

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,390
All right!

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,150
Okay.

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,010
So the first thing that I want to talk to you about

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,879
today is computer-generated music.

00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:01,329
A lot of the music that we listen to today is, for a smaller or bigger

00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:03,819
part, is really kind of coming out of a computer.

00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,760
Like, your drum loops might be recorded.

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,129
You might sing something in, and then add effects to it on your

00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:10,129
PC.

00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:14,590
There's, like, a group of people that take this one step further.

00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,570
And that's people that do Algoraves.

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:21,250
For me, this is the nerdiest thing, but it's like...

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,660
Nerds are taking over the world.

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,850
Like, really.

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:27,850
Like...

00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,360
A computer guy, standing in front of an audience, like, live

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,620
coding, and people start dancing towards that?

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,250
Man, shit, that's...

00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,250
Poom!

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,070
So three years ago, Alex McLean started this movement, and last year at JSConf

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:51,110
Asia, I met a PhD from UCSB, Charlie Roberts, who made JavaScript environments

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,340
for Algoravers.

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,710
And it's an online IDE with a DSL that allows you to write

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:03,190
code and, like, make people dance to that.

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,980
It's like for electronic music.

00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,570
So let's say I want to make a beat.

00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,540
All I need to do is -- A is drums.

00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,580
And then just a beat.

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,450
Put it a little bit up.

00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,650
That's basic.

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,650
Pretty cool.

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,570
It took me six years or something to get this out of a normal drum kit.

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,950
And I can do it with one line of JS.

00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,410
We can also add a little pitch to it.

00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,980
So you can play around with variables.

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,150
Pretty cool.

00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,430
There's a lot more you can do.

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,610
Like Vocoding.

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,960
For example, here is...

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,890
Like, our own JSConf song.

00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,890
JSConf.

00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,890
JSConf.

00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,890
JSConf.

00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:49,120
(robot voices saying JSConf in various pitches over and over again

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
rhythmically)

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,020
Now, if you look closely at this, you can see there is a whole number of

00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,340
variables in this code.

00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,870
And these are parameters that directly influence the

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,040
music.

00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,410
If you set the pitch of the drum, you get, like, an actual different

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,410
sound.

00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,490
Like, for programmers, this is amazing.

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,510
You know?

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,330
If you're standing there in front of an audience, you can play

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,330
around with the parameters.

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,780
Nothing is very static.

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,430
Once you pick one, that's basically it.

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,250
That's what it's going to be.

00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,220
Then I thought...

00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,780
What else do you see at concerts these days?

00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,720
Like, way too much...

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,160
Mobile phones.

00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,590
And mobile phones are now pretty good at, like, capturing what's happening

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:43,030
around you, because mobile phones have sensors, sensors, sensors, and sensors.

00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,030
So...

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,840
Today we're going to do a nice little experiment, where you guys are

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,100
going to help me produce some music.

00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,430
Because we're going to use the sensor data of all your phones...

00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,330
And I have no clue how many phones my computer is

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,050
going to be able to handle.

00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:05,840
It'll all get uploaded to a node.js server, and

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,710
then we feed the data from all of you together into a music generating

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,030
algorithm.

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:15,130
So you guys have influence over how the music is going to sound

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,690
today.

00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,560
If you want to play around with this later or if you are a cool Algoraver,

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,940
this code is on Github, so you can integrate it.

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:32,891
So instead of set variable for the pitch, we can get the yaw or the pitch

00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:35,780
of all your phones, and then feed that into the algorithm.

00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,400
So when people start moving around the phones, music will actually change.

00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,100
Here's a variable.

00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
Okay.

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,060
This is one of the demos we're going to do today.

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,840
Another one...

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,100
Because your mobile phone is still really confined by what the sensor can detect.

00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,850
Gyrometer or accelerometer.

00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:05,970
But Bluetooth beacons -- I have a few here.

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,900
They're tiny chips.

00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,050
They don't run JavaScript, but they just broadcast their

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,300
existence.

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,730
I can put one on the wall and for the next two years, it will just say...

00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,780
Hey, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,790
They're getting tiny.

00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,810
This is the new estimation.

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,300
They go for $10.

00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,910
Tiny, small, you can broadcast a value like a URL or sensor values.

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:37,130
Now, the cool thing is that the ability to detect beacons, to walk into a room

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,800
and see -- okay, there's ten around you in five meters -- is coming to

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,880
JavaScript.

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,240
We actually finished implementing this in Firefox OS and hope to

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,010
bring it to Firefox for Android on short notice.

00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,730
After June it's going to be accessible.

00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,620
So we have phones that run this and I'll do some demos for that.

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,020
How do you scan for beacons?

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,700
It's straightforward.

00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,800
The most Bluetooth thing is not standardized yet, but in the web Bluetooth

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,450
standards, we're talking about implementing low energy support for Bluetooth.

00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,810
So this is coming to the standards track.

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,030
We can get the adapter, start a low energy scan.

00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,910
We're not interested in all the devices around us.

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,690
And then when a device is found, we get an event.

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,370
A couple seconds later, we can stop.

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,010
The event you get contains a scan record.

00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,630
And that basically is all the data you send it.

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,280
Most things currently follow the iBeacon standards from Apple, and that gives

00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,150
you three IDs, essentially.

00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,600
A UUID for a manufacturer, a major, and a minor.

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,400
So that's how you can detect which beacon is what.

00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,170
Now, what are we going to do with this today?

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,150
The JavaScript baby monitor.

00:09:54,150 --> 00:10:00,650
So you're going to tag a baby with a phone.

00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:04,280
Then on the phone, we run some JavaScript that constantly

00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,940
searches around for the beacons.

00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,250
Then based on how strong the signal is, we're going to triangulate from the three beacons

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,120
with some math, and that way we know where in the room the baby is located.

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,440
Now, you might think...

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,290
Tagging a baby with a phone -- is that really necessary,

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,290
Jan?

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:28,460
At JSConf EU I presented a project called Jan OS that allows you to rip

00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,180
apart the main board of your phone and tag your baby with that.

00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,500
So you can make a child-friendly device.

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,070
I'm not going to talk about that today.

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,500
Let's see what this looks like.

00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,050
We have a baby.

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,820
We position three beacons around it.

00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:52,050
And then we tag the baby with the chipboard.

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,120
Now...

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,160
We basically know how far from the beacon we are, because we

00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,779
get signal strength.

00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:02,550
So if we combine the data from three beacons, we realize

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:08,230
that where these intersect, that is where the baby has to be.

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,880
And then, when the baby runs away, then we can start doing

00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,450
alarm.

00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,450
Pretty simple, right?

00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,230
All on JavaScript.

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,230
So...

00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,230
Demo time.

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:30,120
If you're on the JSConf track A Wi-Fi network, then get yourself over to 192.168.157.18,

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,480
port 9321.

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,660
Because that is where the magic is going to happen.

00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660
So...

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,100
What you're going to see on your screen is essentially a dot.

00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,720
And this dot is getting influenced by the way you rotate

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,350
your phone in physical space.

00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:59,080
So I'm going to go to my command center.

00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,660
So here we have all the people.

00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,570
We have ten people connected, and we're getting

00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,190
the data from all the phones.

00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,380
Averaging it.

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,570
(mid-tempo beat)

00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,210
And the way you pitch it.

00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,920
And we can make some music.

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,940
So if you hold your phone like this, we should be able to go exactly

00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,660
in the center.

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,330
And now I want to move it like to the left top corner.

00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:33,700
So change your phone in physical space to the left top corner.

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,120
(beat pitch distorts)

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,224
There's so many people connected now.

00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,470
One person is doing it.

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,600
Get over there, and see how the music changes.

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,830
(beat pitch bends downward)

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,130
You feel how the music changes a little bit?

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:55,520
Depending how high or how low the thing is, we have echoing and pitch.

00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:03,710
And it's always hard to do audience participation in this thing.

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,100
It's crazy, right?

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,080
So my server is completely going berserk on this.

00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,110
(drum machine beat continues)

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,830
I can show how to works with just one person.

00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,070
Because this is totally not how I thought it would work.

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,080
So I'm connecting myself to my own network.

00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,430
And...

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:31,430
Then go to the page.

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:32,430
Okay.

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:36,410
So now it's just me.

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,120
And when I move it...

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,540
(bass distorts)

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,440
You can get pretty rad effects out of this

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,390
(pitch of bass distorts)

00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:55,010
And at some point you can echo it so it starts beeping.

00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,050
It's not fun for anyone.

00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:03,720
Now, we can also do this with visuals.

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,950
So now, when I move it...

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,890
(erratic rhythm)

00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:16,070
So based on how high the thing is, the BPM is dependent.

00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,370
So now it's nice and relaxing.

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:24,730
If you move it all the way over here...

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,570
It changes how the music feels.

00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,890
(rhythm accelerates)

00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:33,980
With all these people, it would go better, but it was more than it could...

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
Now we have BPM.

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,400
But we can add some extra magic to it.

00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,080
So here's the code we have.

00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,540
Let's go full screen.

00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,620
Essentially what we can just write is...

00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,410
Like, get a drum sequence, then the amplitude is, like,

00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,710
based on data that we get from the phone, and the BPM is based on other data

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:00,480
that we get from the phone.

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,980
Now, I made a thing that parses a GIF and can dynamically

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,030
change the speed of the GIF based on how fast the music is playing.

00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:15,120
(mellow drum machine beat)

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,250
Now I like it a little slower.

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:26,470
Or we can go completely crazy.

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,850
(beat accelerates)

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,230
All right.

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,560
So that was the music.

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,060
I'm going to let the music play a bit.

00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,430
And then I'm going to set up...

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,680
My beacons.

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,680
So let's say that this is the area.

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,380
(stopping music)

00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,010
So let's say this is the area where the baby is allowed to go.

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,040
So I'm putting a light blue beacon here.

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,500
I measured this before.

00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,190
It's a bit over 3 meters, which is in United States measurements

00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:07,280
I think 81.4 stones.

00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,620
(laughter)

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,200
So we have three here.

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,420
And now...

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:26,959
Let's go to that page.

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,600
So this is where the data is going to come in.

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,640
So I'm going to put the phone here.

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,380
Just to make sure that we're getting the data.

00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,380
And...

00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,390
Zoom out a little.

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:47,540
Whenever the data is now coming in, it will redraw.

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,490
So we're connected.

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,830
And data should start flowing in.

00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,360
So as you can see, the...

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,250
How big the circle is depends on where I position the phone.

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,070
So now we're just waiting for the data from the main

00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,380
beacon, which is the one here.

00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,520
It really varies at this point.

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,490
And it's because we get, like, the raw value, and the

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,270
raw value is really dependent on a lot of factors.

00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,899
So we can buffer.

00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:19,150
And then it will slowly remove all the drift, and we get a better positioning.

00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,909
We can also draw the intersections.

00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:25,539
And based on that, we can get the average.

00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:29,559
So if I move the phone or baby...

00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,410
To, for example, here...

00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:38,179
You can see that, like, the actual position that we detect is

00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:40,380
actually getting there.

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,470
If I start moving the thing around, luckily enough, babies

00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,529
are not very fast.

00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:47,129
So it's okay if it takes a couple of seconds.

00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:49,809
So I'm moving it here.

00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:53,389
Then you'll see that the position of the orange dots will

00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:57,309
start to change.

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,730
We cannot do this -- if the baby gets out of the bounding box,

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:07,670
then if the baby gets out of the bounding box, we can sound an alarm or do

00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,580
something about it.

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,090
So we're here.

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,090
And now you see it like...

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,549
You see it moving towards the purple one.

00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:21,389
Now, I figured -- like, okay, that's pretty cool.

00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:26,039
But what if you could listen to baby-generated music?

00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,499
So...

00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:31,360
We're going to open the baby thing.

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,179
And we're going to apply the data that we get out of here, like, the position

00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:43,639
of the baby in physical space, and feed that into a music generating algorithm.

00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:49,909
(discordant beats)

00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:53,659
So the idea is that whenever the baby is in this space where it's allowed

00:18:53,659 --> 00:18:56,809
to go, everything is all right.

00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:01,419
We don't really have to play big-ass crazy music.

00:19:01,419 --> 00:19:07,610
Have we got a visual on the thing?

00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,610
Okay.

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,789
But now what if the baby starts to escape?

00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:11,789
You know?

00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:13,330
That would be disturbing.

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:14,630
For some reason it doesn't work yet.

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,879
So I'm going to restart the application with the phone.

00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:22,090
So when the baby escapes, we can change the BPM

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,610
of the music a lot.

00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,360
So we need to check out something.

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,509
Crazy stuff is happening.

00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,249
So here we go.

00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:35,629
(BPM gets slower)

00:19:35,629 --> 00:19:36,629
So relaxed...

00:19:36,629 --> 00:19:40,179
And...

00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:46,010
Let's see if I run away fast enough...

00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,909
If you can...

00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:50,429
Having technical...

00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:52,779
The mint one just stopped working.

00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:55,380
Go, go, go, go.

00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:06,659
If necessary, just go to the pizza guy.

00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:13,600
(BPM stays the same tempo) (BPM increases rapidly)

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Music!

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Fast!

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
We need to act on this shit now!

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Thank you!

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,519
(BPM continues to accelerate)

00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,710
All right.

00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,059
Let me close that thing off and get back to my slides.

00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,220
(music turns off)

00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,549
Now, we have ten more minutes, you know?

00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:40,640
And I figured I always wanted, like, a real one more thing moment.

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,559
Um...

00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:51,500
So, I mean, I've been working on Firefox OS on a variety of platforms.

00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,490
Now we're focusing on the internet of things.

00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,799
The thing is, Firefox OS is not just about phones anymore.

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,700
It's televisions.

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,989
Things that can run on it.

00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:05,619
We also want to bridge the gap to the physical space.

00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:14,360
And for that, we invested in a number of technologies, including Bluetooth low energy, virtual reality,

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,980
with Firefox VR, but also web CL, which allows you to get a video stream

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,889
and start detecting stuff on that.

00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:28,269
And from that premise, we started thinking about -- what if we would design a

00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:32,789
wearable running Mozilla technology?

00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:36,669
And we figured that the beacon stuff would be incredibly useful.

00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:43,240
Because if we -- for $3 can get, like, a beacon straight from the factory, and tag that at,

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,159
like, interesting places, or tag it to people, it would allow us to, like,

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,590
augment your reality, like, based on where you physically are in the world.

00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,419
Walking around.

00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:59,179
Of course, this also has to be built on open standards.

00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:06,039
And today you guys are going to see the very, very, very first wearable that Mozilla

00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,210
has been working on.

00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:09,850
Like, right here on JSConf, like, a couple minutes before

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,610
the end.

00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,379
Pretty exciting.

00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:16,720
So the first wearable that we together, like, with

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,470
Mozilla and a bunch of partners have built, is...

00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,249
Mozilla Glass.

00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:27,450
And I got it with me, actually, here today.

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,450
So...

00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,880
We looked at, like, what other wearables are around at this point.

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,960
And we had, like, a number of things that we required.

00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,799
So first of all, we wanted to work any type of glasses.

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:43,860
Prescription or sunglasses.

00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,610
It doesn't really matter.

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:49,230
The prototype that we have here is mounted on the glasses that you

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,669
got in your goodie bag.

00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:56,239
It's the Availity track?

00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:57,239
What the company is called?

00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:59,450
And the glasses were from the same brand.

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,200
We also want that to be a standalone product.

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,450
No extra device required.

00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:09,609
There's voice control to get, like, information without always looking at your

00:23:09,609 --> 00:23:10,609
screen.

00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:13,859
And the self-build kit is going for about $300 US.

00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,249
Are you ready?

00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:18,239
(cheering)

00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:22,220
All right.

00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,220
First thing.

00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,220
Mozilla Glass.

00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:36,139
Hand built by me.

00:23:36,139 --> 00:23:37,239
So what we see here...

00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:38,239
And I've got one with me.

00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:39,570
We're going to demonstrate in a sec.

00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,799
We have a camera module on top.

00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:48,639
On the left, we have the display and sensors.

00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:51,399
These two talk with each other over a web RTC connection

00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:55,269
to get the data from the camera into your corner.

00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:58,470
And then we have a small little mirror in the inner

00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,570
side of your glasses, so you can look a bit to the right and get your image

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,749
from the display on the left.

00:24:04,749 --> 00:24:07,450
All right.

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,809
So...

00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:12,749
For this, for this next segment, I need to have Steve, Jacob, and

00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:15,889
Chris on stage, because they're going to help me with this thing.

00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:25,139
So guys, run up, run up, run up.

00:24:25,139 --> 00:24:26,139
All right.

00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:27,890
Where the hell are my beacons?

00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,980
Oh, here.

00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,950
Oh, you're going to be Chris Williams.

00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,490
Okay.

00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,679
So I need you guys to, like, okay.

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,279
What we're going to do is...

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,369
It's like a party.

00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:41,450
You know?

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,539
Here.

00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,429
And I want to know who do I have to talk to at parties?

00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:46,429
You know?

00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:49,990
I want to be, like, the cool guy that always knows the subject to talk about and people

00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,039
think you're interesting.

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,720
What are we going to do today?

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,600
Let's say we tag all these people with beacons.

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,720
Steve gets ice, Jacob gets blueberry, and you get

00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,720
mint.

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,359
And I need you to be socially awkward and stand by yourself at

00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:07,909
a party.

00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:10,690
Not too close to each other, please.

00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,739
Yeah, a bit...

00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:16,489
Like, near the stage, please.

00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:19,660
I'm going to go to...

00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,660
So the beautiful thing is...

00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,249
Because of the web RTC that gets the camera, we can also

00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:27,479
get a live feed here of the screen.

00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:31,649
Go there.

00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:32,649
Mozilla Glass.

00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:35,340
As you can see, we're not connected to anything here.

00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,629
I am going to come here.

00:25:39,629 --> 00:25:42,130
This is going to be my camera client.

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,419
Huh?

00:25:43,419 --> 00:25:44,720
So...

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,600
Here we go.

00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,890
And...

00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:55,230
Here we've got the glasses.

00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:00,929
Let me just verify that we're still connected.

00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:01,929
Yeah.

00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:05,419
You know, hardware is a lot of fun.

00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:09,220
I'm so hoping that on Twitter people will go

00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,240
completely crazy.

00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,259
Like Mozilla introduces a wearable!

00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:16,259
So we're connected.

00:26:16,259 --> 00:26:18,169
I don't see any beacons yet, but that is going to come.

00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:21,299
I'm going to place this on my head.

00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:25,120
I'm going to connect to my camera module here.

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,539
So...

00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:28,970
I ran out of duct tape.

00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,530
So...

00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:35,500
The moment that I connect to this thing...

00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,159
We should start seeing a video stream here.

00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:38,159
Okay.

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,159
So here we are.

00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:42,350
Now, of course, we have voice controls as well.

00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,509
And for...

00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:45,659
Ah, wait.

00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:47,820
That is...

00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,899
So we have voice control as well.

00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:54,669
We partnered with Andreas Gal, the CTO of Mozilla, to do the voicing.

00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:58,330
I wanted Brendan Eyck, but he said ask Taylor Swift.

00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:01,529
Did you guys get a stream here?

00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:02,529
Okay.

00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:06,509
So let me full screen this thing.

00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:08,499
Yeah.

00:27:08,499 --> 00:27:18,590
That's pretty hard to see with these glasses on.

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,890
(laughter)

00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,190
Oh.

00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,490
Okay.

00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,789
So...

00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:27,419
Back to the thing.

00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,600
Okay.

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,909
So here we are.

00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:31,909
Back.

00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:33,130
On the stream.

00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,359
Need to have some sensor data out of here as well.

00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:39,259
That would be nice.

00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:43,220
Because now I can ask my voice assistant to come on stage.

00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,759
Hello, Andreas.

00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:47,409
Can you introduce yourself?

00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:49,470
Hello from Mozilla Glass.

00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:55,549
I am Andreas Gau, CTO of Mozilla.

00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:00,590
Because we of course also care about other companies that are working in

00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:05,919
the same space, like Google...

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,259
We have...

00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:08,599
Sorry.

00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:12,820
Now I really need to get some assistance.

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,169
I mean, I can say...

00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:18,609
Andreas, call me Google.

00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:20,570
Okay, Google.

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,289
Isn't that nice?

00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:24,470
All right.

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,830
Can you start the...

00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,919
Fuuu...

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,009
This...

00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:36,590
You know, this worked so well in my head.

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:40,730
(laughter)

00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:45,830
Need a hand?

00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,830
Yeah.

00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:47,830
Okay.

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,830
So...

00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,559
You can hold them yourself.

00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:55,190
So we're going to get the video stream back at this point.

00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,720
I mean, it looks pretty good on you, to be honest.

00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,730
Okay.

00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,739
So...

00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:05,059
Now, let's do the augmented reality thing.

00:29:05,059 --> 00:29:06,989
And I want you to walk over there.

00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:11,409
Where do you have the beacon?

00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:13,340
So...

00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,090
This is supposed to be...

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,090
Okay.

00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,389
So get a bit closer.

00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:20,229
You need to be in close proximity.

00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:26,049
We're at a party here.

00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:29,889
So whenever this works, this is, like, always a good thing, to

00:29:29,889 --> 00:29:31,539
have a backup Glass.

00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:32,539
Not mounted.

00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:41,080
Like real glasses.

00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,909
So here we go.

00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:45,859
Steve Kinney!

00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:47,340
Information!

00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,639
This is augmented reality, guys!

00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:51,909
Now...

00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:56,260
And as you can see, the moment that we walk away, immediately the information disappears

00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,359
as well, and we can do the same thing with Jacob here.

00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,549
I was hoping somebody would come talk to me.

00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:03,979
That would be nice.

00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:05,940
So what can we talk about with you today?

00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,179
Hey, man.

00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:10,010
How is it going with you?

00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,010
Hey, Jacob.

00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:15,229
We could talk about the Cure.

00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:17,090
Or if we can talk to Chris Williams...

00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,619
Everyone knows him.

00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:21,139
Hey, hey, Chris.

00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:26,690
What should I do with the drone battery?

00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:28,019
Oh, you know like...

00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:29,049
Oh, hey.

00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:31,639
Hi, it's me, Chris Williams.

00:30:31,639 --> 00:30:36,109
I just thought I should mention that you might want to not put that drone battery

00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:39,279
in your checked luggage.

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,830
Uh...

00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,390
(applause)

00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:49,499
All right!

00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:51,720
So it can also tell you based on the voice commands who you're

00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
near.

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,019
Will do.

00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:56,049
You're not near anyone.

00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:57,700
I'm not near anyone.

00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,700
And this is the coolest feature.

00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,889
It will also shoot laser beams.

00:31:00,889 --> 00:31:02,450
I'm sorry, Jan.

00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,549
I'm afraid I can't do that.

00:31:05,549 --> 00:31:07,110
Okay.

00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,669
So...

00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:13,359
Here's the thing.

00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:14,359
We cannot predict the future.

00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:16,019
You know?

00:31:16,019 --> 00:31:17,289
It's 2015.

00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:18,909
Where the hell is my hoverboard?

00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:23,989
Actually, after, like, yesterday's event with the nodecopters, we decided we

00:31:23,989 --> 00:31:25,440
no longer want hoverboards.

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,609
We want quad copters or drones that can carry people.

00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:32,590
We can't predict the future.

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,859
But one thing we know for sure.

00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,860
And I hope that today's demonstration, even though

00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:41,220
it was a bit flaky at times, is like a demonstration of that.

00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,789
And like the whole JSConf thing -- and this is the thing

00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:48,190
that you have to take home from all of this -- we can't predict the future.

00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:55,889
But we do know that a large part of that is going to be written in JavaScript.

00:31:55,889 --> 00:31:59,799
And with that, my 30 minutes are up, and I really, really want to thank you

00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,039
all for being here.

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,529
