Description: 
	Have you ever wanted to make those 8-bit sounding tunes from your childhood? What better way to do it than using the actual hardware to get that classic sound? Oh wait. I have to learn some archaic assembler? Not anymore! Now make those classic sounds from your childhood with JavaScript. This talk will go over the basics of how sound works on the NES, and how we can use JavaScript to make music on the NES.

so yeah let's have some fun with the

00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:28,689
Nintendo which is a fine piece of

00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:30,820
hardware even today so what are what is

00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:33,400
this thing that I'm going to be talking

00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:37,890
about I guess it's the latest in 1980s

00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:41,199
music technology this is controlling a

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,930
Nintendo sound like the sound stuff that

00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:46,239
the microprocessor works or the sound

00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:50,920
stuff that makes the or that sound stuff

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:53,890
that is in the microprocessor like right

00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,609
compiling down to the assembler through

00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:58,960
JavaScript so this piece of hardware

00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:01,989
right here is what we're going to be

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,640
running everything on and there's no

00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:06,060
trickery or involved or whatever its

00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,289
actual Nintendo programs like running

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,880
just want to make some people are like

00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:12,520
hey it's like you know you have some

00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,590
like crazy thing but no it's real um so

00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,580
like when I first started this project

00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:22,149
the goal was to make it easy to write

00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:24,130
music for a Nintendo and that that's

00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:27,009
been done a lot in the past also there's

00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:30,940
trackers which are basically sequencers

00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:33,130
that you can use to like sequence music

00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,619
on Nintendo itself or you could have

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:38,709
programs it will output like the actual

00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:40,959
sound like of the Nintendo or emulate

00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:42,610
the sound chip but I wanted to do it a

00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,099
little bit differently I wanted to do it

00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:49,869
using javascript because JavaScript and

00:01:45,099 --> 00:01:52,060
whatever right so why a lot of people

00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:56,310
you know why why you want to do this in

00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:59,709
JavaScript it's to me it's self-evident

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:03,610
the I mean JavaScript awesome rides a

00:01:59,709 --> 00:02:06,310
language that i really like but the

00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:08,830
whole project itself like i really like

00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:13,360
this sort of music this chip tunis sound

00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:15,910
the i grew up in the 80s playing a lot

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,810
of nintendo 45 year old like playing

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,849
super mario brothers all the time or

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,000
you know whatever Zelda and all those

00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:24,440
games I think over over that amount of

00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,700
time like there's a nostalgia factor

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,840
that like those tunes like I didn't pay

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,080
attention to the music but they're

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,090
ingrained in my brain now and so I love

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,250
it I don't know how else to explain it I

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,010
think that probably a lot of people have

00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,750
that nostalgia factor they look back to

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,640
their childhood and whatever they did a

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,250
lot or play it a lot it's far as like

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,720
video games or music or whatever they

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,620
gravitate towards that so I think that's

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,380
a big thing but the javascript part is

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,440
because of browsers now I knew that if I

00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:00,830
could if I could get something working

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,140
in JavaScript I would have a path to get

00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:06,890
to the browser and that's important

00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,930
because once once you do that if you

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:13,010
provide a low-level JavaScript API to

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:14,989
this sound engine you you can create or

00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:18,380
you can give the opportunity for people

00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:22,040
to create fancy you is for tracker

00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,299
sequencers that are all web based and I

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,640
think that's really cool and I actually

00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:28,760
want to do that but I think this is like

00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:31,040
the first step to that point so that's

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,750
that's primarily why and also because

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,829
it's a lot of fun to hack on a Nintendo

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:38,690
with JavaScript it's just it's crazy so

00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:41,870
the next the next question is like how

00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,430
is this working because it seemed sort

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:49,220
of magical to have a Nintendo and

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:51,139
JavaScript and stuff so to get this to

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,290
work I had to read a lot about how the

00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:57,109
microprocessor works about how the 6502

00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:02,299
assembler like is written because i have

00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:03,769
no I mean I did not go to school at or I

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,420
mean like I didn't graduate with the

00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:07,340
computer science degree so I have like

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,069
no idea how this stuff works like right

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,959
it's just all magical to me but I read a

00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:14,389
lot and like I learned a lot of

00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,789
assembler which is crazy like no one

00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:18,889
should ever have to do that right but

00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:20,840
then along the process like I wasn't

00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,370
just reading about like assembler and

00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,470
like how the Nintendo works like I read

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,510
a lot about music too because a lot of

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,430
that stuff Lee I had no idea how it

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,849
worked and then throughout the whole

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,919
process like I would go like

00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:34,569
right assembler or write JavaScript and

00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:37,149
figure out how this stuff was going to

00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:39,759
work and figure out the API and all that

00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:42,369
stuff and then what I would end up to do

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:48,039
doing was once I had something working I

00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:50,439
would write music and try to like figure

00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:52,749
out like does this make sense does this

00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:54,249
work does this API like no and then I'd

00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:57,099
go back and like be like oh that part

00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:58,599
stupid like get rid of it or and so I'm

00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:00,849
at a place now where it's like there's

00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:04,389
some stuff that I don't like but it's I

00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:08,619
think the API is decent enough to you

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:10,119
know present so what I have here that

00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:11,800
I'm going to demo in just a little bit

00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:15,219
after I kind of get through like the

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,379
basis of what this is is a assembler

00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:19,959
sound engine so what happened was I was

00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:24,639
like oh I want to make like this thing

00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:27,159
makes sound so I went and I read a lot

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,679
and figured out how to do that with an

00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:32,199
assembler I made a square channel like

00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:34,089
beep it it just kind of went be you know

00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,759
like square channel which I'll demo kind

00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:38,379
of in a second then after like I went

00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:41,110
through these tutorials on like these

00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,879
nez developer forums and at the end of

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,309
the tutorials you kind of have a basic

00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:48,069
working sound engine and assembler but

00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:50,919
assembler is really difficult to work

00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:53,229
with and you know it's not very fun to

00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:58,180
write music and assembler just doesn't

00:05:53,229 --> 00:06:00,279
like I don't know its assembler so take

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,009
once i had that though it was easy to

00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:06,009
write a javascript api to that so they

00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:09,639
could compile down to what the what I

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:14,439
saw would look like in assembler so

00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:17,369
really quickly this thing has see how

00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:21,849
many are there five yeah 5 5 channels

00:06:17,369 --> 00:06:24,069
two squares a triangle noise which is

00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:26,439
just random noise and a sampler which I

00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:28,649
did not do the sampler because it takes

00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:31,749
up a lot of memory and I didn't really

00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:34,649
figure out how it works so I'm just

00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:39,579
going to be working with these for now

00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:42,550
so the square channel the features that

00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:43,899
it have is a duty cycle which i'll show

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:44,420
a demo of it because a lot of this stuff

00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:47,660
like

00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,280
you don't like can't really visualize it

00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:52,340
I guess you can visualize i defied like

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,690
a nozzle scope but I don't but it's

00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:55,850
better just to listen to it so we'll

00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,890
listen to it in a second but these are

00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:02,000
the features didn't get frequency sweeps

00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:05,320
working but here we go and I'll demo the

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:11,960
square can we get the demo thing going

00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:15,410
okay so this is um this is the little

00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,570
file system thing on the Nintendo that I

00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,190
have going okay so here's a square this

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,190
is going to play a c-note and it's going

00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:31,580
to go through the octave range of a

00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:33,860
c-note on a square channel and that was

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:38,360
just doing like you know a for loop with

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:40,790
the number or something and just passing

00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,580
that into like you know song dot square

00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:49,040
and it's just an array of notes and it

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:53,720
plays it all right I got to reset this

00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:56,810
sucker to get back oh one other thing

00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,200
that I did I kind of skipped over duty

00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:04,550
cycle and volume envelopes so duty cycle

00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:09,230
um it kind of spaces out like or narrows

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:14,930
the the did we get this back oh sorry

00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:16,550
can we get this yeah back sorry um its

00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:19,640
faces out our narrows like the the

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:21,800
actual square how it looks and it

00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,680
creates a different sound so just to

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:27,020
kind of this is the same note same

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:31,990
octave just change just manipulating the

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,990
duty cycle of of the square channel

00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:40,440
okay so i got squared square stuff

00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:45,000
working and it was beeping um the next

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,620
thing I did was like uh actually like

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,330
once I got the square channel working I

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,820
made that beep then I went to the sound

00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:52,709
engine wrote the API to it and then I

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,200
wrote this thing which I don't it's just

00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:56,880
some some notes and changing octaves and

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,950
this is just what it sounds like this

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,110
was the literally like the first thing I

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:04,940
wrote besides the beep so it doesn't

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:04,940
sound awesome at all but

00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:21,199
Oh

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:34,560
all right ok cool so um so that yeah

00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,330
that was a like that was the first thing

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,810
I wrote and then I started implementing

00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:41,100
all these features volume envelopes if

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,590
you're not familiar with them like

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,950
imagine like a note is broken out into

00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:49,530
like a bunch of frames and you have the

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:54,330
ability to say like on frame one of the

00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:56,670
length of the note make the volume 0 and

00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,790
that on a scale of 0 to like say 10 0

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,890
being off 10 being the loudest so so 0

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:05,480
it's off and then you gradually increase

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:09,060
it like frame 11 and then keep going to

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,860
25 5 10 and then it's the loudest so

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,620
then you have like you have created a

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:18,390
fade in effect so you can you can

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,860
manipulate these these notes with volume

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:24,090
envelopes to create like blip effects

00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:28,020
like echo or staccato or fade ins fade

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:34,340
out all sorts of things um i don't think

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:34,340
i have a fade in demo but let's see oh

00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,690
one other note is like square channels

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,880
the only one that can do that so with

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,590
triangle you have the ability to turn

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,390
volume on or off so you're pretty

00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,370
limited I don't know why this is the

00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,500
case but you can either say like hey

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,480
this is on it's just binary on or off

00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,370
and you can use volume envelopes with

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,000
them but it'll just interpret any value

00:10:53,370 --> 00:11:02,850
that's not zero as a one so triangle

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,560
it's it's made for like bass sounds for

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,410
the like the lower octaves really high

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,560
octaves it's the like flute sounds you

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:12,270
hear in like Zelda and stuff so here's

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,440
an example of it I don't remember I

00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,310
think this is just the same as the

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:22,070
square it's just going through the

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:25,320
octaves of C so there we go triangle um

00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:28,400
knows I don't really know how to explain

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,930
this because it doesn't really matter

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,920
music very well it's it sounds like

00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:35,139
drums some

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,019
you can get like certain ones sound like

00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:41,050
hi hats or snares or like bass drums and

00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:43,060
stuff but for musical or for like

00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:45,190
musical notation I didn't know actually

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,079
how to represent this so this was one of

00:11:45,190 --> 00:12:02,889
the problems I had but here's like the

00:11:47,079 --> 00:12:04,480
full no noise range that you have so so

00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,370
then with like those sounds you can

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:18,660
create drums and this is kind of a

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:23,079
really dumb like simple drum beat okay

00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:25,720
okay so techniques so all the channels

00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:29,320
on here are monophonic so you can't you

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:32,260
can only play one note at a time you you

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:34,570
can't you can't make chords so what

00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:37,390
people would do composers of the 80's

00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:39,940
would they would fake it like they would

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,940
make arpeggios and speed them up super

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:46,630
fast like increased the the like the

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:50,829
timing of the note or or speed the tempo

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:52,870
up a lot of like the Japanese games and

00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:54,399
stuff they were just written like if you

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,620
listen to a lot of video game music it's

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,290
just written monophonic Lee some of the

00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:03,880
Commodore 64 people would would use the

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:05,890
arpeggio technique but let's let's go

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:09,730
through some some songs before I go

00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:13,089
forward so I was having trouble like uh

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:15,970
I was trying to like do 80 some 80's

00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:18,730
musics for jfcom given the theme so I

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,980
did Billie Jean just the baseline though

00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,959
because the square doesn't really sound

00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,730
that or I couldn't get it to sound super

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,970
good so this is just the baseline it's

00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:30,209
really simple let's see if it sounds

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,209
decent

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:32,610
you

00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:43,470
that's it that's that's the whole song

00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:46,729
pretty much and the the square channel

00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:50,489
would be like that burn burn but yeah

00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:52,109
okay so let's go so then I kind of went

00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:53,849
through like a bunch of songs like I

00:13:52,109 --> 00:13:55,470
tried a bunch of different types of

00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:57,599
music before I talked to like actual

00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:00,089
people that compose music and they gave

00:13:57,599 --> 00:14:02,429
me some pointers so I was like oh I like

00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:04,799
Slayer and I like raining blood that

00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:07,229
must be an awesome song to do but it's

00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:20,419
not really because it's actually really

00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:20,419
boring pretty much I like

00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,940
it's just dropped me over and over again

00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:32,009
there's that little part in the middle

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,009
but

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:43,990
okay so Slayer was boring like a lot of

00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:46,710
yeah I mean drop D over and over again

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:51,070
does not sound good on the Nintendo um

00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:55,270
so I was like okay I'm going to like

00:14:51,070 --> 00:15:30,850
take it take a crack at rewriting Super

00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:32,530
Mario track so I came up with this so

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,600
that one that one actually worked out

00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:39,220
really well I was much happier with that

00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,930
than Slayer and yeah so then after

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,490
talking to some people and showing them

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,660
what I had though I was I was kind of

00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:46,630
like yeah here's the problem i'm having

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:49,180
like all these songs have cords and it

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,490
doesn't like it usually doesn't sound

00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,850
good and there's a couple cases where I

00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:58,030
did get cords to kind of sound good but

00:15:53,850 --> 00:16:00,010
I don't know like what what I did

00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,630
instead of doing the arpeggio technique

00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,940
because I could almost never get that to

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,230
sound okay is I was actually talking to

00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,790
my brother and he's like just used power

00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,740
chords because you have to square

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,510
channels so you can just use the tune

00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,610
and that kind of worked but it still

00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:15,310
wasn't didn't seem right but then I was

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:18,130
talking to a composer friend of mine and

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,260
he was like you should check out the and

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:24,370
I forgot what they're called out but

00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:28,600
these bak pieces bwv 847 i think is the

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:30,850
prelude in c minor and 851 is d minor I

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,110
didn't finish these and they're kind of

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,970
long so i won't play them all but

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:36,130
they're really great because they're

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:38,860
mostly monophonic so they've mapped

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,620
really well with to the nintendo and i

00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,650
have volume envelopes so i can make them

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:48,480
play at staccato which is what like

00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,480
Glenn Gould and stuff plays a map

00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:19,449
member okay it's more of that it's just

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:21,400
yeah um so yeah here's really quickly

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:33,850
this is just the first couple bars of

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:35,470
the D minor one so those work really

00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,570
really well because they're monophonic

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:39,820
and there's the sense there's no cords

00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,799
it's it's just it makes sense right I

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,290
can use if you're like reading music you

00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:45,820
can use like for the bass clef you can

00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,610
just use a triangle channel and then for

00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,590
if you have like notes up top you can

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:57,280
use square or even mix them up or

00:17:50,590 --> 00:18:00,280
whatever um okay great so that's that's

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:04,150
kind of like what I have so moving

00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:06,730
forward though going back over I guess

00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:08,260
to here is the future like what do I

00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:12,820
want to do with this i have this API I

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:18,669
have this module that's on mpm that can

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:21,730
take JavaScript and produce these these

00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:23,860
songs in the in the end they're still

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:26,770
it's mostly JavaScript there's this last

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:31,570
piece the assembler itself is actually a

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:34,299
c++ assembler but I think that that

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,380
evening can be moved to JavaScript and

00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:38,500
there's already people that have

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:41,799
JavaScript assemblers for the Nintendo

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:46,030
so it's it's not that much of a jump to

00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:48,910
to get there so I think we can get a nes

00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:50,320
assembler in j/s that one module that

00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,450
you can just say hey here's some

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,850
assembler give me a Nintendo program

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:58,990
and that would that would be awesome and

00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:02,800
then I think also with this API we can

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:06,280
build web UI tools that since you have

00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:09,250
an assembler in Jas and you have this

00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,440
stuff that I wrote in j/s you can say

00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,360
here's like here's the sequence of

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,730
sounds like click a button or whatever

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:19,210
it builds it it outputs your assembler

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:21,250
it assembles it gives you a actual

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,340
Nintendo program and then you have

00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:25,900
things like people have written

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,580
emulators in JavaScript for Nintendo

00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,740
right i mean i'm sure we see these

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,750
things don't pop up on all of the new

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:35,410
sites and whatever over the last five

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:38,080
years so you have your whole like build

00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,970
environment in j s and you just need to

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,010
piece it together and get it in the

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:47,170
browser and we can have this really

00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:51,910
awesome like authentic sounding thing to

00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:54,370
make a bit music so yeah I don't even

00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,800
know how much time I have because this

00:19:54,370 --> 00:20:04,960
thing's not going but I can keep talking

00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:07,450
about this stuff okay cool so um so let

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,090
me go back to like why to the why of

00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:11,830
like how I got started into this stuff

00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:16,360
so I had previously written like

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:18,880
graphical stuff and it for this and I

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:23,140
gave some some talks like writing slides

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:26,200
and stuff on on the Nintendo itself and

00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,700
that was super hard and I didn't do a

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,110
very good job at like the graphical

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,850
stuff like I had a lot of problems with

00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:34,270
it it was a lot of like stuff that was

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:39,430
hacked together and then I can't

00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:44,350
remember where it was but I gave a I was

00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:48,430
giving a talk in the AV person came up

00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:50,890
to me and they said oh are you going to

00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,990
need sound to the Nintendo and I thought

00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:54,850
oh no I won't meet sound I don't have

00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,440
any sound and I was thinking about it a

00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,240
little bit later and I was like why

00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,310
don't i sound like why didn't i get it

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,600
why didn't i read that part about sound

00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:05,789
so I thought like I should go back and

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,289
figure out how sound

00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:09,690
works and it was just that curiosity

00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:11,759
like that in the back of my mind like oh

00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:14,789
how does this work and stuff so I went

00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:17,159
back and there's there's a lot of stuff

00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:18,889
that's written about the Nintendo that's

00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:24,029
out there but there's not a whole lot of

00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:26,220
practical examples so finding like this

00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:27,809
to this sound tutorial and kind of

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,419
standing on the shoulder of giants and

00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:32,879
like taking this the stuff that this

00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:35,220
these other people have have written and

00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:37,590
using that as a basis for like saying

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,479
hey like I could just write a JavaScript

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:41,849
API to this and I know JavaScript well

00:21:39,479 --> 00:21:45,529
enough that I can expose this so that

00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:50,099
other people can use use this stuff and

00:21:45,529 --> 00:21:53,879
and yeah so I got to that point and it

00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:55,529
it was actually way way easier than all

00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:57,570
the graphical stuff the sound stuff was

00:21:55,529 --> 00:22:00,269
a piece of cake compared to the

00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:03,090
graphical stuff and I think like a lot

00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:05,279
of this stuff is still relevant today I

00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:08,279
mean you have bands like autumn on

00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:12,210
Iguchi that actually use like a Nintendo

00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:14,249
in their set or like in their music they

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,169
use it as an instrument it's an

00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:18,330
instrument that has these channels that

00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:21,779
you're able to manipulate sound and get

00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:24,419
like a real authentic sound and there's

00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:25,950
actually a game that for Nintendo that

00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:29,070
was released like a couple months ago

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:31,349
called star versus and you can buy this

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:33,210
game for like 40 bucks or whatever and

00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:34,859
they give you a real cartridge like a

00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:36,690
real Nintendo cartridge and that is so

00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:38,399
cool that people are still hacking on it

00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,320
and selling games and stuff so I think

00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:44,580
this is like this stuff is really really

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,139
awesome and and so yeah I want um I want

00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,989
