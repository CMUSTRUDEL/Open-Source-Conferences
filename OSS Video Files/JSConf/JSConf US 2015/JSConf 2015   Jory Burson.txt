good morning everyone assu said my name

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,420
is Jory person and I am the chief

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,279
operating officer of Baku that's uh I

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,279
think probably the best job in the whole

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,070
wide world second to maybe open web

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,079
engineer at beaucoup and that's only

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,450
because maybe somebody maybe you don't

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,800
know exactly what a COO does and

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,739
practically speaking it means I do

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,250
really important things like approved

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,520
book whose sticker budget laughs at Adam

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:50,130
Sontag's puns I pick up after Rick's

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,620
robots as I did yesterday and go to

00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:57,750
really important business meetings like

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:59,970
that of the beaucoup diorama club it

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,800
also means that I run an open-source

00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,110
software company and which entails

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,659
thinking a lot about how to operate

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,970
beaucoup so that it operates in service

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,030
of our mission which is to move the open

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:15,150
web forward that's kind of an abstract

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,820
idea though so to do this part of my job

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,190
I ask a lot of operational questions

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:23,430
which is some essentially boiled down to

00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:26,070
the same three themes do we have an

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:29,250
objective or goal identified to execute

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,070
in service of our mission I asked what

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:34,530
combinations of teams people projects

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,229
resources that sort of thing we need in

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,510
order to reach our goal and I asked

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,409
probably the most important question how

00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:45,510
do those entities exchange information

00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:49,560
in order to create change and generate

00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:51,540
volume and my bet is that you're part of

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,310
some open source project or some

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,170
organization where you wear and you

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,560
probably ask yourself very similar

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,880
questions you ask things like what are

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,400
the big picture goals you want to reach

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,760
and what milestones might you need to

00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,990
create and hit in order to meet them

00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,310
maybe you're asking what some of the

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,470
dependencies are that you'll need to

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,530
manage or major issues you'll need to

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,810
close first or what your code review

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,670
process should look like or how you

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,390
might handle issue tracking or merging

00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,580
PRS as our projects and goals get bigger

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,600
those operational questions get

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,700
increasingly difficult to answer

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,560
problems that were once really easy to

00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,900
solve on a small scale become

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,200
exponentially more difficult and also a

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,330
little bit more abstract we start asking

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,730
questions like how do we get more

00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:42,340
collaborators on our projects how do we

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,100
get more users how do we pay for servers

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,260
how do we allocate our time commitments

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,300
to maybe work and then maybe also your

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,610
open source project how are you going to

00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:56,170
handle issues of IP or trademark

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:58,780
infringement as open source developers

00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,940
we operate in a pretty complex system

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,810
and the fact that it's an open one

00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,610
doesn't necessarily make it any easier

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,770
this week at jas comp we've talked

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,690
mostly about the technical elements of

00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:12,790
software production systems like the

00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,530
code the architecture but for the

00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,720
duration of this talk when I'm referring

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:20,140
to systems I'll be focusing on the human

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,660
element and humanity is again kind of an

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,340
abstract idea so since this is a

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:25,900
JavaScript conference I decided to

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,530
create an MVC framework for thinking

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,120
about that kind of abstraction if you're

00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,800
in a position with your project or

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,010
company wherein you need to create a

00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,500
system for humans remember MVC which is

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,530
mission value and change it boils down

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:44,800
to this simple philosophy that every

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:46,630
operator in the system a person a team

00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,750
you know project of protocol whatever

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:52,120
all of those things have the same job to

00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,730
execute change that creates value and

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,810
service of the mission so let's take a

00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:01,300
look really quick at what that means

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,490
from NPM modules to boku each component

00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,740
in our open web system was created for

00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,860
some reason there's some core objective

00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,940
or some problem is trying to solve an

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,820
entity's mission doesn't really change

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,790
over time it's the impotence for change

00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:18,070
and not the change itself missions

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,930
motivate so in designing systems for

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,270
humans make sure you can identify the

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:26,760
mission for every person project and

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:26,760
team in your project or organization

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,260
value be a harder thing to nail down

00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,760
generally when we think of value we

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,370
think of quantitative things such as

00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,979
points scored in a game or like dollars

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:39,370
raised for cancer research quantitative

00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:41,410
value

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,630
tend to be easier to measure and also

00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:46,210
names milestones or metrics for success

00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:49,479
like getting to version 1 point 0 or

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,610
maybe getting 10,000 users but for

00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:54,070
humans you need a mix of quantitative

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:57,460
and qualitative value in order to

00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:00,630
evaluate your system success qualitative

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:03,729
value is sort of like the intangible

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,340
genesee qua that you gain from an effort

00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:08,290
that you can't really pinpoint but often

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,380
relates to some new knowledge you gained

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,780
or some subtle shift in opinion you may

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,520
not be quite sure how far it Lance's you

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:21,039
toward your mission but you do know that

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:23,560
it at least moved forward the components

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,900
in our ecosystem don't exactly exist in

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,940
a vacuum they don't spontaneously become

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,800
they don't keep evolving on their own

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,919
without some sort of process of change

00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,260
if we think of the mission as an end

00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,060
we'd like to see brought about changes

00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,910
the means we're executing toward that

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,130
end and sometimes it's big and sometimes

00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:47,710
it's small but either way our system

00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:49,930
should always be changing for the whole

00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,150
system to be effective our components

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,940
need to work together harmoniously even

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:57,160
as they're changing but they also exist

00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,860
inside of cultural political and

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,720
technical contexts and those things can

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,750
have real competing motivations

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:08,070
sometimes so it's nearly impossible for

00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:11,710
one system change and not affect others

00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,820
it's hard to know where or when all of

00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,610
those changes are going to end up

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,770
manifesting like how a positive change

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,320
on the technical spectrum might actually

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:25,169
spark a negative change and the

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:28,120
political our JavaScript community

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:30,340
obviously cares very much about its

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,800
direction and wants to see us move

00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,449
forward our projects are operating more

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,240
transparently and collaborated

00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,099
collaboratively our companies and

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,710
organizations are operating in a more

00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,780
socially responsible way we're paying

00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,389
more attention now than ever before to

00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:49,570
how we address issues of diversity

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:51,729
inclusion and accessibility but complex

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,110
systems like ours don't necessarily

00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:55,060
scale well

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,010
they tend to fail far more consistently

00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:03,630
on the human element rather than a

00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:03,630
technical I think we can simplify this

00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:08,710
from open source engineer to open source

00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,930
c-suite I think we all have the same job

00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,940
which is to support the creation and

00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:16,510
exchange of value for the JavaScript

00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:18,400
community I do this today at Baku

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,560
through identifying and executing

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,510
organizational change that ensures we're

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,970
living our mission and everything we do

00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:26,770
and today I'll try to do that a little

00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,200
bit by sharing what i've learned about

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,480
organizational design as a means to help

00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,100
you create and scale your progress your

00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:37,990
project or organization in whatever

00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:39,250
forward way suits your goals experience

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,410
has taught me that if we give more

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,390
thought to how we organize ourselves we

00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,390
can do more for our projects and for the

00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:48,370
open web community using organizational

00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:50,560
design principles will be better able to

00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:52,360
adapt to change will be better able to

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,040
communicate our mission will be better

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,690
able to exchange value with one another

00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,930
and we'll be able to do all of this

00:07:55,690 --> 00:08:02,440
together in a more proactive and

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:03,670
coordinated fashion for those of you who

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,370
are still not sure exactly why this

00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:08,770
matters let's take a look at a case

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,850
study because business people love case

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:15,280
studies this is from an article by

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:17,680
michael rogers on the nodejs and medium

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,490
blog from earlier this month he writes

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,410
in 2012 things were going really well we

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,510
had a thriving community solid core

00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,370
contributions and it was really clear

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,010
that we were the fastest growing

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:32,350
ecosystem in the world so in 2012

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,930
michael says the system was pretty

00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:36,610
efficient all of our cultural technical

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,350
and political variables all of the

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:42,270
projects and people were operating

00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:44,800
harmoniously and things were going good

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,770
the growth and change of the project

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,750
ended up signaling a future imbalance of

00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:51,700
the system though is around this time

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:55,690
people notice some concerns in the

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:57,520
project with the ownership and we end up

00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:00,310
seeing some people note that there are

00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:02,470
more there's more value being created

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,450
for the political spectrum then there is

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,140
along the cultural or technical and

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:10,420
people in the system

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:12,980
failing to act on that we can we cut to

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,050
2014 everybody agrees that there's a

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,580
problem but now the operators in our

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,640
human system don't know how to change

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,530
and change it growth and change in the

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,180
system is slowing becoming less

00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,550
efficient to the point that the project

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:31,310
becomes forked and now there's no clear

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:33,530
way for them to generate a value if we

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:36,650
cut to today that system is being

00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:38,660
restored our no denial projects are both

00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,850
joining the node foundation with support

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:43,180
from the Linux Foundation and there are

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:45,380
plans for these projects to reintegrate

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,270
that's all happening because a lot of

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,550
people recognize the imbalance of the

00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,680
system and set to the very hard work of

00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,840
restoring it they were organizing in

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,490
designing systems through really formal

00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,770
channels like that of the node advisory

00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,180
board the IO technical committee and a

00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,340
bunch of other informal channels like

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,320
you know github and IRC they put in

00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,570
thousands of hours of work had probably

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,730
untold numbers of debates and arguments

00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:10,820
and so on and so forth all of which to

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:13,130
restore harmony in our human open web

00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,840
ecosystem and so on behalf of beaucoup

00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:19,970
I'd like to say thank you to those folks

00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:23,180
including Chris for doing that because

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:28,400
it's really hard the thing is their

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:30,440
problems are not unique and another post

00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,670
on the node blog Michael Dolan was a

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,950
director and attorney for the

00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:35,930
collaborative projects at Linux

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,030
Foundation said that they found that the

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,040
challenges of node and i/o communities

00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,930
are not unique many of the open source

00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,360
projects that they have also struggle

00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,940
with the same challenges and went on to

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,490
these lists five key features of an open

00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:51,050
collaboration project it's clear that

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,910
the node foundation is going to be

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,400
relying on and learning a lot from this

00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,300
and there's lots of early indication

00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,400
that they're going to end up being very

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,230
successful with this but an open

00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:05,660
governance model doesn't necessarily

00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:07,760
guarantee success or growth I think

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,610
that's because openness is a soul ideal

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,530
is really tricky to nail down the

00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,270
rhetoric of openness is to meant to

00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,490
communicate a favorable set of values

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:19,790
and those values often depend on the

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,830
speaker and on the audience and the absa

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:25,160
of a single definition that suits all of

00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:28,730
those parties we tend to take open to

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,380
mean inclusive of everything so if we

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,080
want to be successful with our open

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:35,120
collaboration projects we're going to

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:39,560
have to get more specific about our

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:42,080
ideals and our values thoughtful

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,030
organizational design helps us balance

00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,580
the fear of chaos and the fear of

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:48,490
structure inherent in an open system so

00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,990
that the whole thing can move forward

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:53,840
it's a combination of abstract

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,340
philosophy like why we're even here and

00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,100
what's the meaning of life that kind of

00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:00,650
philosophy and concrete structures to

00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,350
help we humans do things together more

00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:05,780
effectively or perhaps put in terms of

00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:07,520
the MVC model of earlier it helps us

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:11,780
frame our decisions about change and

00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:14,030
value in terms of our mission but I've

00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:16,100
certainly talked about abstractions long

00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:21,130
enough so it's time to get a little bit

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:22,700
more specific purpose it's part of

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,440
organizational design and that's

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,260
something that you supply for yourself

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,480
and your projects if you're doing a

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:32,390
thing you should probably probably know

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,860
why you're doing it if you're thinking

00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,140
about growing your project or

00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,060
organization probably you should go

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,400
through the process of discussing it and

00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,930
writing it down right right those

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,540
purpose and values down with your core

00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:46,580
team so you all understand them and

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,310
reread that together fairly regularly

00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:52,820
this is going to help you keep that top

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:55,100
of mind as you make decisions and share

00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,680
it outside of your core team maybe put

00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,630
it on your website or your read me it

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,370
will help you attract other users and

00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,320
collaborators who identify with your

00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,670
project who maybe didn't understand it

00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,470
in the first place but they connect with

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:09,280
you on the purpose level and that's

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,280
really important

00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:16,680
governance is a more tangible idea than

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,570
purpose so as a result we tend to solve

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,389
problems using the realm of governance

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:23,610
over the realm of purpose governance

00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:25,800
also means a lot of things so as an idea

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:27,959
can get really confusing but generally

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,720
speaking governance structures provide

00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,610
the trellis upon which we can grow our

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,029
purpose and and those some of some of

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:37,470
those structures include corporate form

00:13:35,029 --> 00:13:41,639
decision-making structures and decision

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:43,949
enforcement structures so what's

00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:47,940
corporate form corporate form is any

00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:50,940
group of persons treated as treated by

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,550
law as an a single entity having riots

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:57,029
or liabilities that are distinct from

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:58,949
the persons composing it and it's very

00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:01,019
necessary for a lot of components in our

00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:03,000
system including like the open source

00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:05,639
foundations or standards bodies or

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,860
companies and maybe even one day your

00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:13,440
project or your business corporate forms

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,880
things like C corpse LLC's they follow

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,370
different rules and they have different

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,570
rights depending also on the government

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,699
the government under which they were

00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,680
incorporated and the government's under

00:14:20,699 --> 00:14:24,890
which they operate and this starts to

00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:28,380
make a difference as your project scales

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:30,750
if you think you might want to take your

00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,890
project to a foundation or perhaps see

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,470
it through some sort of official

00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:36,390
standardization process definitely take

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,130
a look at the corporate form of that

00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:43,920
entity first because it might end up

00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:46,620
making a difference decision-making

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,160
structures that's the who makes

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:52,230
decisions and how they do it in our open

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,959
source world this is generally all over

00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:57,209
the map we have everything from like

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,699
that oh yeah whatever laws a fair kind

00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:02,819
of decision making that happens to some

00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:05,779
form of democratic process to you know

00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:07,920
maybe a benevolent dictatorship and

00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:10,260
foundations and standards bodies though

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,199
tend to operate a form of collaborative

00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,389
governance and we're in all of those

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,120
stakeholders are collectively empowered

00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:20,760
to make a decision through consensus and

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,270
or as is the case with equi

00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,300
International that standardizes

00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:27,610
and becca strip script to make

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,650
recommendations to an appointed final

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,870
decision body who does not substantially

00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,500
change consensus recommendations from

00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:37,360
the group they are judicious and nature

00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,760
keep in mind that how you make decisions

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,070
for your project will change over time

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,600
depending largely on the stakeholders

00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:45,430
you have and also what those

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,110
stakeholders value as those people

00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:50,170
change the values are going to change

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:52,690
and that's ok if you think you'll move

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,730
forward towards the nonprofit or

00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:58,090
standards track with your project and

00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:00,190
then plan now for your transition to a

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,010
collaborative decision making a model

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:08,200
because that's actually along and and

00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:10,600
you know can be a tricky Road no matter

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,910
how you make them degens don't really

00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,310
mean anything unless you have some means

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,830
to enforce them and that though and

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:19,570
those means are actually useful there

00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,120
are proactive decision enforcement

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,740
structures like testing suites and code

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,740
review protocols and things like that

00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:29,100
and they help reinforce the decision and

00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,480
mitigate risk before something happens

00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,370
there are also reactive decision

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,790
enforcement structures that reinforce

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:38,590
decision at decisions after exposure has

00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,630
already occurred so after something has

00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:44,020
happened and these are things like clas

00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:46,570
or codes of conduct you'll need to

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,970
consider your use of both forms

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:51,370
depending on the risks you think you

00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:53,110
might be exposed to and if you think a

00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:55,240
risk is really high you're probably

00:16:53,110 --> 00:17:00,150
going to want to use more substantial

00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,150
forms of both in order to mitigate it

00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:10,120
successful systems can be attributed to

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,560
the skill we exercise and designing them

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,200
which is all that governance stuff we

00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:15,700
were just talking about and making those

00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,610
right government of choices in the first

00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:22,810
place and also to the quality of the

00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:25,540
operations of that system so here are a

00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:27,790
few principles for us to consider as you

00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:33,280
think about the operation of your human

00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:34,220
system the first is simplicity as we

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,530
covered previous

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,450
complexity is not viral problems of

00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,550
process and communication multiplied

00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,950
with each successive stage of complexity

00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:47,010
that you add so when operating your

00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:50,040
organization and i like to say don't

00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:52,080
play chess when you can play checkers be

00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,870
precise with your definitions and tasks

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,600
people like that and don't try to build

00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,160
a system or set policies and things like

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,930
that that solve a hundred percent of

00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,110
your problems up front but rather

00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:06,600
optimize your organization for one that

00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:14,510
throws good errors over one that throws

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:17,190
bad errors the second is flexibility

00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:19,980
organizations should have structure but

00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:22,410
not be entirely rigid your organization

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,810
should let people in it make adjustments

00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:27,090
based on new information from how

00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:28,650
they're operating it that doesn't mean

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,660
that you're letting them like totally

00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,700
change the goals or objectives here but

00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,950
rather letting them change how they're

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:38,420
approaching that goal or objective based

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:40,440
on the new data that they have and

00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,110
remember that there are also many

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,140
motivations for change why they might be

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:49,110
making a change in approach and you may

00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,830
be tempted to only allow those changes

00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:54,170
that align with your own motivations but

00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:56,370
organizations are not personal things

00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,380
and they're going to operate at times

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:03,650
with different motivations from yours

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,650
that's also a okay that's actually good

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:12,210
the third principle here is reliability

00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:14,250
err I'm sorry yep reliability any system

00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:16,770
is actually no more reliable than its

00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,450
weakest component and reliability is

00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,540
maintaining consistency in your

00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,910
operations and also in your output of

00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:27,660
both the human sort and the technical

00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:30,270
sort it essentially means that it there

00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,610
should be no surprises for people in an

00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:37,890
organization or for the people who rely

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:40,160
on it reliability is also as important

00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:43,380
for organizational growth as in as

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,260
innovation and software development

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,890
there can be some tension between

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,170
reliability and

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,330
vation in the system so you're going to

00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:53,850
want to plan upfront for how you think

00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,070
about balancing that in your

00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,140
organization and as you would on your

00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:02,180
project how you think about balancing

00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,180
the stability and balancing the growth

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,370
our fourth principle which is probably

00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:12,660
one of the most important is

00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:15,090
acceptability any organization no matter

00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,610
how well-designed it is is not going to

00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:20,070
function properly unless it is accepted

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:22,200
by the people who operate it if

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,580
participants don't believe that the

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,830
organizational system is going to

00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,080
benefit them if they are opposed to it

00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,340
if they are pressured into using it or

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,620
if they think it's generally a bad

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,540
system and it's not going to work as

00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,180
things and as you intended and two

00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,860
things are going to happen either it's

00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,660
going to be modified gradually over time

00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,730
by the people who are using it which is

00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:46,170
you know good but you know slow and

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:49,920
arduous or it will be used overall

00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:52,040
ineffectively and ultimately fail so

00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:54,900
make sure you're getting clear buy-in

00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,660
from others in your organization and pay

00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,190
close attention to resistance any

00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,380
resistance that you feel that

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,930
organizational resistance and push back

00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:10,470
is a human error message pay attention

00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:13,320
to it if anything I've said today sounds

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:15,180
familiar it's probably because there is

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,190
a lot of similar thinking when it comes

00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:21,120
to designing systems for software and

00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:23,960
designing systems for people in both

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,480
forms of system architecture simplicity

00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,680
reliability and flexibility are

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,990
frequently at tension with one another

00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,540
and the general belief is that you

00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,520
really can only have two of the three at

00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,690
any given point and if you've happened

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,950
to figure out how to get all three in

00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:43,200
your system I would really like to talk

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:45,570
to you in either case remember that

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,940
organizational design is the means and

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,410
not the end it's the framework through

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,080
which we will try and live our core

00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,600
values and qualities and not how we try

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,520
and measure our success no matter what

00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,830
stage you're at in your project it's

00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,920
really never too early to think about

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:05,820
organizational design speaking of which

00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:08,100
I think we can organize ourselves for a

00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:10,530
better open web community and that we

00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:13,020
can and should start doing that right

00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:14,820
now because changes outside of our

00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,130
control are impacting us there's a lot

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,630
of external and environmental and market

00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:21,720
changes going on that we can't really

00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:24,240
control things like big projects merging

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,940
we have a lot of new software

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,430
foundation's forming and old ones are

00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,800
changing as well and companies are

00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:34,950
investing is never before in open source

00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,960
software all this means that there's a

00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,300
lot of interest attention and money

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,730
being paid to how organizations interact

00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:44,040
intersect and engage with open source

00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,540
projects and we need to be able to

00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:50,940
communicate and we have for our

00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:52,650
community to these companies I chose to

00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,710
speak today because I'm often asked how

00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:57,690
we do things at boku those specifics

00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,820
don't necessarily apply to everyone here

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:03,030
so I chose to bring you all a framework

00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:05,310
we use to make those decisions I think

00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:06,750
rising tide lifts all boats and I

00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,150
believe that we can help each other more

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:12,360
efficiently and reliably using the tools

00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,340
of organizational design i'm jory person

00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,890
thank you very much for listening to me

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,620
