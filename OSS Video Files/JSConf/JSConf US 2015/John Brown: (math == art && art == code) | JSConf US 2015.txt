Title: John Brown: (math == art && art == code) | JSConf US 2015
Publication date: 2015-06-17
Playlist: JSConf US 2015
Description: 
	The formula for a Bezier curve is beautiful. Using sine and cosine to create orbiting objects is dazzling. L-systems create fractals through elegant simplicity. Developers, as a group, may be losing site of the beauty that code can create. Designers by the bunch are picking up a keyboard and creating amazing pieces, but it's happening the other way very slowly. That's a shame, because the computer lets otherwise unexpressed ideas go unexplored. Developers have the ability to embrace the art of programming and the art of art because of the myriad frameworks available. Use the language of your choice to make some art, whether itâ€™s in the browser or in the physical realm. Walk away with the confidence and the inspiration to put down the work for a minute and pick up a digital paintbrush.

Hello.

00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,860
Oh, there we go.

00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,860
Hi, everybody.

00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,860
I'm going to refresh this real quick.

00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:19,880
Going to go back to my title slide.

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,910
This is actually really great, because it's a little bit of glitch art right

00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,380
in the middle of my presentation that's completely unplanned.

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,400
I love it.

00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,400
So here's the agenda.

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,400
Here's what we're going to talk about.

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,110
I also have a lot of cords up here.

00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,440
I'm going to talk to you guys about math, art,

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,719
and code.

00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,200
And one of those things may not seem like the others, but hopefully

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,890
by the end of this talk you'll understand where I'm coming from with

00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,970
this weird transitive property equation.

00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,650
If you think about color palettes -- math == art is pretty

00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,650
great.

00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:56,410
There's a lot of math inside of art and a lot of math made of art.

00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,420
Color palettes.

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,130
If you want to make something visually pleasing, you

00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:07,320
usually have to follow a mathematical principle for a split complementary

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,670
or compound or triads -- there's a lot of math that goes into just color.

00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,670
And you think about music.

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,670
Music is really amazing.

00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,010
It can make you feel sorrowful or triumphant.

00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,250
But when you get down to it, it's just data.

00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,060
It's a time signature and a scale and it's points on that scale, which are

00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,360
data points or notes.

00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,660
Gang a bunch of those up, and you have a chord.

00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,770
And you can give that to everybody.

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,590
And if they can render that, i.e.,, play an instrument, they get to actually recreate

00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,690
that music anywhere.

00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,950
And it's the same thing with code art.

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,100
You can make it in JavaScript, share it with the world, 7 billion people can look at it.

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,640
Different medium, but same general principle.

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,790
Hello, everybody.

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,220
It's echo-y.

00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,240
I'm John Brown and I'm from Portland, Oregon, about as far away as you can get on the continental

00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,240
United States.

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,520
So I've had a long plane ride.

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:11,860
I work with a firm that works on tech in interesting ways and interacting retail experiences.

00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,620
I do a lot of stuff.

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,310
Front end, back end, hardware, software, and I do a lot of cool

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,760
stuff, and more and more I'm doing it with just JavaScript.

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,010
And I'm going to talk to you guys about a few projects that

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,170
are essentially 100% JavaScript that I think are really rad and I'm really

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,170
proud of.

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,849
But at night, I work with a group in Portland that does all kinds

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:36,090
of code art and generative art.

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,730
And I'm one of the leaders of that community that put on events that are

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:48,010
community art projects, I take part in those, I put on smaller projects,

00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,290
and I'm a digital artist.

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,680
And I'm really proud to say that.

00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,129
And I have the pedigree.

00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,680
I really feel like I can say this.

00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,840
Because like all great artists, I dropped out of

00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,340
art school.

00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,090
Two times.

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,910
My mom is not happy with that slide.

00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,959
So these are a few selected math works -- I play a lot with

00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:08,959
math.

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,590
And this is an exploration of sine and cosine, perfectly said.

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:22,430
It's rotation, circular movement, and you can create amazing things just by layering.

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,180
And I'm actually really proud to be here today.

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,200
I'm kind of bummed that I'm not in Portland right now,

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:32,630
because there's an art show going on, Visions of Tomorrows.

00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,349
It actually starts tomorrow.

00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:36,709
But I have a piece in there, and it's a generative art

00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:37,879
piece.

00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:45,080
And it's hanging up alongside sculptures, oil paintings, mixed media.

00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,000
I just wanted to point it out, because a lot of times people think digital

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,870
art is not true art, but it really is.

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,080
It's recognized by all the important people, in my opinion.

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,709
So why am I here, at a JavaScript conference, talking about art?

00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:00,980
It seems a little weird.

00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,580
Well, if we go back to the title of the talk, we talked a little bit about

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,580
math and art.

00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,970
Art and code.

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,380
I feel like these two things are very intertwined.

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,129
If you want to explore them, if you want to try being an artist

00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,760
or if you are an artist.

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,829
Learning is way more fun if you're making art.

00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:20,970
If you think about -- if you have a dream in

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,810
the middle of the night and you want to create it, and it involves web sockets,

00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,090
it's this rad artistic...

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:31,550
Project, and you think -- I should use web sockets for this -- unlike at work,

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,629
where it's a mandate, like -- now we're using web sockets, and you have to

00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:38,629
learn those.

00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:40,610
You have to go read tech docs, you have to read some

00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,610
tutorials.

00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,280
Now you get to explore and try a bunch of new things.

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,479
And the outcome doesn't really matter, because it's

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,360
your project, and you're just trying things.

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,919
And even along the way, even if things are broken, just a

00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:55,349
glitchy screen -- you can still create beautiful things with art.

00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:58,310
So that leads me to also -- freedom of personal projects.

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,710
If you're making art, you're very rarely, unfortunately, going

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,469
to be making it for a paying client.

00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,990
So you get to do anything you want.

00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,199
Anything you can dream, you can try and recreate.

00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,119
There's any kind of analog from the fine art world or

00:05:11,119 --> 00:05:15,990
the traditional art world in digital art, you can do 3D printing for

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,259
sculptures, watercolor light canvas work, and then there's things that you

00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:29,780
can't do in the fine art traditional world that you can do in digital art.

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,879
There's also a lot of new problems that come up, when you're making things

00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,960
creatively.

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:43,369
And one really rad, like, segment of that is that when you go to work -- and

00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:44,409
let's take a different example.

00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:47,349
Let's say you're working on an ecommerce platform.

00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:50,520
If the payment goes through the payment portal, cool.

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,520
Done.

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,509
If it doesn't, that's the other answer.

00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:54,509
It's binary.

00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:57,539
But if you're making art, you can explore and try all kinds of different

00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:58,539
things.

00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:00,430
Is the line weight good?

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,659
How do the colors make me feel?

00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:04,020
Are there too many color particles on this stage?

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,349
It's a problem you have to solve and use a different part of your

00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:09,349
brain.

00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:11,879
I don't buy into the left brain, right brain idea.

00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,550
That's been debunked, but you definitely get to flex creative

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,149
skills and problem solving when you're making art.

00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:23,639
So I want to walk you through a few projects.

00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,069
This first one...

00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:27,069
Real nervous about this.

00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:32,279
Anyone who's seen me talk knows I go a little bit overboard on demos.

00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:38,310
So this is the 7th thing I have plugged into my computer right now.

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,310
And it's upside down.

00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,069
It's not even USB, either.

00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:45,219
So here's what we're going to do.

00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:48,330
Work in progress, number 233.

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:54,689
Deep breath, everybody.

00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,929
Mostly me.

00:06:58,929 --> 00:07:05,279
There it is.

00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:07,399
Okay.

00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:11,639
All right.

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,330
If we look up yonder, look up here, as I'm going over this

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,990
color palette, right, we're getting different things on here.

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:21,899
And you probably can't see them very well.

00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,979
But here's the thing.

00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,939
I'm running around in this -- this is a node project.

00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:29,210
Node server, node client, it's picking up what pixels I'm sort of

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,419
going over with my mouse.

00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,459
Think of this as a really weird aspect ratio screen.

00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:38,259
But then if I go outside of the browser, it's still working.

00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:40,770
And that's the power of node, man.

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,399
It's amazing.

00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:49,159
You can run it on the lowest server in operations on your computer.

00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,909
So the reason why I want to do this is because I actually -- don't tell anybody

00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:56,189
from my work -- but I want to take this, I want to hang it up at work

00:07:56,189 --> 00:08:01,099
over the weekend, and give everybody on my team the client software for

00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:02,099
this.

00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:06,119
So hopefully it'll look a little something like this.

00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:13,229
Again, some fingers crossed.

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:15,009
Okay.

00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:17,289
So this is like five...

00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,620
This is a recording session of like five different mouse points.

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,669
I knew that wasn't going to work.

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:26,319
You son of a bee.

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,369
So imagine a lot of different...

00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:31,029
Oh, I'm up on stage.

00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:32,029
Whoa.

00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:34,729
Imagine all these flying around, and this really amazing

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,469
piece of art that's being created accidentally in the background over time that

00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:41,200
nobody is really...

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,670
Working towards, but there's an amazing...

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,670
There's an amazing piece of art that's going on in the background, and it's community-driven.

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,690
Okay.

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:56,910
Going to start unplugging some of these things.

00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,910
So here's the thing.

00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,910
This is a work in progress.

00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,240
So why show you guys this?

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
A couple reasons.

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,930
So one...

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,320
I think it's important to show things, like, as you're

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,779
working on them.

00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:10,940
Anybody can go on and post a highlight reel on their

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:14,420
Instagram, but I think it's really cool to do small incremental pieces,

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,079
because when you're making art, even the steps towards the final product

00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:23,639
are all -- presumably -- all beautiful and they're worth sharing.

00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:26,019
And this is a true work in progress.

00:09:26,019 --> 00:09:29,899
This is at 3:30 p.m. Monday, the day before I left.

00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:34,519
This is it in a suitcase, at 5:45 p.m., and this is me working on it

00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,829
that day, and this is me, earlier this morning, running around in my

00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:40,680
hotel room, putting this together, and over here.

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,910
So I just want to show you -- don't be afraid when

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:48,160
you're doing art to show it to people and get opinions and to share it

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,260
with the world.

00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,589
All artists have sketchbooks.

00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:54,440
This is a Van Gogh sketchbook that was recently uncovered.

00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,449
Even these are beautiful.

00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:58,060
Even these are amazing.

00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,610
Artists used to have sketchbooks like this.

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,300
Now we have sketchbooks like your code pen sketchbook, or just a giant messy folder

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,269
on your computer.

00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:09,360
So when I posited at the beginning...

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,769
I like to use art to learn more code.

00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:17,079
What I want to do is, as I show you these projects,

00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:20,800
talk about the things I learned that I wouldn't have normally gotten to learn

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,240
in my day-to-day work life.

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,370
First things first.

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,649
Bitwise operators.

00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:30,860
I sort of used them by copy-pasting them out of Stack Overflow, but now I sort

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,089
of understand them.

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:37,990
And being able to push pixels down this strip required

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,589
me to understand bitwise operators better than I used to.

00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:43,230
LED dithering.

00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,230
Our eyes are amazing.

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,680
They evolutionarily evolved to notice the smallest

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
light changes.

00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,970
So when you turn it on to 1%, it makes it look like 17%.

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,839
So I had to look up tables and inverse function to level that out, so that

00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,870
LEDs look like the brightness grows and shrinks properly.

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:12,410
I learned all about RAM swaps on Raspberry Pi.

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,610
Because you run out of memory real quick, so I had to learn a whole bunch of

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,610
stuff.

00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,939
There's a lot of these learning slides.

00:11:18,939 --> 00:11:22,350
So I apologize to everybody over here.

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:27,019
Also, I want to say thank you, because I came in this morning, not sure if

00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,410
this project was going to work, but I had some amazing help today.

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,120
So thanks.

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,310
So that's a project that's a work in progress.

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,910
And the next couple of sort of finished products.

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,410
This is from a year ago...

00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,690
Probably about six months ago.

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,470
So this is my buddy, Chris Harth.

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,260
He's a print designer, and obviously I'm a developer.

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,270
And he and I were hanging out.

00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,270
We were like...

00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:54,259
Let's make something this weekend.

00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:55,259
Let's...

00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:57,730
Do something creative and artistic.

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,750
That he's never done before, which is basically most things, because, again, he's just getting

00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,569
into the creative code side.

00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:04,649
So we decided...

00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:07,980
I had had glitch art on the mind for a lot of reasons.

00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,290
XOXO had just passed, and that was the theme.

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:13,300
And so I thought...

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,680
Let's make something glitchy.

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,320
So when you think about glitch art, you can do one of two things.

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,440
You can take the actual rendered image, and take chunks

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,120
of it, and smear it or move it around or whatever, or you can do the deep

00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
dive.

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,850
Getting into the actual guts of the image, and start messing around

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,850
with it.

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,959
So this is the path that we chose.

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:33,959
Okay.

00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:35,680
Demo number two.

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,860
Let's corrupt some data.

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,860
Okay.

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,649
So if we look at this mostnervousspeakerever.jpg,

00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:43,800
you guys may recognize him...

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,520
So we take this and we open it up in our favorite text editor.

00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,040
This is what a jpeg looks like, everybody.

00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,850
What happens if you just start changing some of these numbers?

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,230
Now, I hope some people will take a breath.

00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,959
Give me a hex value.

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,079
A. I heard...

00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,079
U?

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,560
Who said...

00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,920
Somebody needs to go to the JavaScript introduction.

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,570
Somebody give me another hex value.

00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,570
1?

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,259
2 to a 1?

00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,259
All right.

00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,259
We'll do it.

00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,430
8 to a...

00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,569
I heard B. Let's see what this looks like.

00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:20,569
Okay.

00:13:20,569 --> 00:13:21,569
All right.

00:13:21,569 --> 00:13:22,569
Cool.

00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:23,810
Starting to get a little interesting.

00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,939
What happens if we take...

00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:26,939
Let's see.

00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,499
This chunk down here...

00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:29,499
Let's say this is...

00:13:29,499 --> 00:13:30,499
I don't know.

00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:31,499
This is probably beard area.

00:13:31,499 --> 00:13:34,740
Let's run it up here.

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,649
Let's drop it in yonder.

00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:39,339
Okay.

00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:42,089
We broke that one.

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:43,749
We'll talk about that.

00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:44,860
So...

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,819
What Chris Harth and I did was we decided to take

00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:51,689
this idea of corrupting the underlying information of jpgs and turn it

00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:59,610
into a bot that listens for your tweet at it, and then not only takes your

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:05,589
avatar and glitches it out, but glitches it out stylistically over time and

00:14:05,589 --> 00:14:06,829
makes an animation of it.

00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:07,829
That's weird.

00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:09,990
What does that look like?

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,790
Glad you all asked.

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:16,829
So if we look at some of these, if you tweet @avatarglitch, here's one,

00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:19,730
here's a couple here that are fun.

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,529
Here's a little bit more subtle.

00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,290
Here's a little bit...

00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,410
This one is a little crazy.

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,410
So...

00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,720
If anybody wants to test out the old avatarglitch, feel free to, after

00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,980
the talk.

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,249
Pay attention.

00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:40,209
So since I was with Chris, he said -- let me

00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:42,820
design the way these glitches work.

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,040
We came up with some that were very subtle and some that were crazy.

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,029
And I had a really good time working with Chris Harth.

00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:53,499
So what did I learn?

00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:56,490
As you can see, if you just start messing around with jpgs, you can corrupt

00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,870
them really quickly.

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,540
So I had to open up a tech manual, read about how

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:05,600
jpegs work, read about the headers, and what you can and can't change, so we

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,899
knew we could get decent-looking glitch art generatively, as it came

00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:12,899
back.

00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,259
I would never have had to do that in my regular job.

00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:17,750
So that's a real awesome win.

00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,449
I also learned about buffers and actually how to make

00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:21,520
animated GIFs.

00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,899
So this is something I learned since then.

00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:29,309
It's part of the process of doing something fun and being

00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:32,819
excited about it and using it going forward.

00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:36,000
Chris learned how to make bots.

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,160
He had done a little bit of creative coding but never had done anything

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,470
that sat there and waited and responded based on input.

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,430
It was a fun thing to do.

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,069
And then we took these learnings.

00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,259
We flipped it.

00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:48,730
We turned it to a teachable moment.

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:52,720
So we went to a local meetup and talked about the project.

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,819
And we actually launched it live there.

00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:55,959
It failed completely.

00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:59,209
I took a couple of hours at night and retooled it and pushed

00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,140
it up.

00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,389
But we ended up talking about it -- me from a developer standpoint,

00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:07,660
him from a designer standpoint.

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,529
Where we came on that spectrum, and the things he learned and the things I

00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:11,529
learned.

00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:15,100
And speaking of which, I am the...

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,360
I am a co-organizer of that meetup group.

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,300
PDX Creative Coders, along with these three gentlemen, and we're a

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,440
group of now almost 500 artists and developers and hackers and designers that

00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,470
get together and make cool art generatively, we make music, we make all

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,490
kinds of really cool things.

00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,190
And these are a few projects from whatever hack

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,389
days.

00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:40,600
And I encourage you all to find one of these near you.

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,540
I love that one.

00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,540
pixie.js.

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,540
Cool.

00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,619
So that's a small weekend project.

00:16:47,619 --> 00:16:49,180
Let's talk about a big project.

00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,189
A big, long, long project.

00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:54,819
How many of you guys -- nope, wrong slide.

00:16:54,819 --> 00:16:55,819
This is...

00:16:55,819 --> 00:16:56,819
How many of you guys know Ben Perdy?

00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:59,019
That's a weird question.

00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,019
He's a friend of mine.

00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,589
I used to work with him at Instrument.

00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:07,910
He left and started his own studio called Glowbox, in Portland, and we get together

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:14,900
and jam, make cool art, cool projects, creative code, hack with some hardware,

00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,329
and Cascadia.JS was coming up last year, and they were having an interactive

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,980
JavaScript art gallery, so I thought...

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:28,189
Let's make something cool with this.

00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:31,230
So we knew there was going to be a lot of in the browser projects.

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,429
Me, I wanted to make something physical and outside of the browser.

00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:39,000
So we sat there and we brainstormed, and we came up with this idea.

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Plinko.

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,270
Do you guys know Plinko?

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,010
From the Price is Right?

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,350
This is my favorite.

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,940
This is probably everybody's favorite.

00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:52,390
We decided to take this game and use the nostalgia and physics of it, combine it with

00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,730
JavaScript, and turn it into a digital canvas for generative art.

00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,330
It sounds weird and it was, and it was hard.

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,580
You can't just go and find on the internet how to make a

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,300
generative pixel Plinko board.

00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,350
There's no steps for that.

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,779
So it was a lot of exploration, had to learn a lot of things,

00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:16,080
a lot of stumbling blocks, but we ended up making it.

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,870
It took a lot longer than we thought it was going to.

00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,540
And that's one of the things with the weird creative code

00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,690
projects -- they often take a lot longer than you think, because there's a

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:25,500
lot of gotchas along the way.

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,500
A lot of repetition.

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,870
85 pegs, so we had to do a lot of things 85 times.

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,730
A ton of stop motion.

00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,000
This is photography.

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,060
Video.

00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,720
And we finally got it done and actually put it

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,570
in a couple galleries in the last couple months, and the response has been

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,899
amazing.

00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:44,899
People love it.

00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:49,001
Kids, adults, they don't understand what it is, read the instructions, take

00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:53,150
one of the pucks and walk up and drop it and see them turn around and go...

00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,190
Oh, yes, this is awesome.

00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:57,809
And they pick up another one, usually two or three,

00:18:57,809 --> 00:19:00,800
and drop all three to see what happens.

00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,250
So this is another one of those things about making art.

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,919
Is that if you do it in the physical space, you actually

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,539
get to see people enjoying it and interacting with it.

00:19:10,539 --> 00:19:13,120
And even if you make something beautiful on a

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,190
website, you don't get to see that one to one relationship with the

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,330
person who's actually consuming that art.

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,320
So what did I learn here?

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,400
Well, I didn't have to learn about rendering GIFs.

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,520
We already talked about that.

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,700
Learned that from avatarglitch.

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,140
But I learned a whole lot of other stuff.

00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,529
A lot of hardware stuff, a little bit of software

00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:36,380
stuff.

00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,870
Ben packaged up what we did for the projection mapping, which is

00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:45,250
all done in JavaScript, and he released it as a standalone library, which

00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,380
is amazing, so if anybody does project mapping, you should check that out.

00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,750
But this whole project was JavaScript.

00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,120
If we go back, this was all JavaScript.

00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,670
This was mostly node, but this was all JavaScript.

00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,590
Avatarglitch, 100% JavaScript.

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,590
This was about 99.7% JavaScript.

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,590
And you wouldn't think...

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,590
If we go back...

00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,360
Looking at this, you wouldn't think that this would be

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,799
JavaScript.

00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:12,560
But it's a full screen Chrome browser with canvas, it's a

00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,669
node back-end that's running inside of a little kiosk.

00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:17,080
It tweets you.

00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,880
If you put your Twitter handle in, it'll tweet you an animation of your run.

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,510
99.7% JavaScript.

00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,970
So all of you can make art.

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,680
Because hopefully you understand JavaScript.

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,780
Because you're at a JavaScript conference.

00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,780
Okay.

00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,600
We're going to wrap this up.

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,600
My timer went out.

00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,059
So I don't actually know how much time I have.

00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:38,730
We're going to assume 27 more minutes?

00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,730
I don't know.

00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,760
I'm just going to start rambling.

00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,990
So again, anybody that's seen my talks before know that this final part is

00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:47,549
always a little rough, because this is homework.

00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:48,580
Homework?

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,610
What?

00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,640
Yes.

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,680
Homework.

00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,450
You guys have to do this.

00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,450
Not really.

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,450
Not contractually.

00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,270
So I'm going to give you guys a couple options for making homework.

00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,539
Or for making some things.

00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:02,240
And the reason I want to give you guys these options is -- each one

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,290
of these should take you one to two hours.

00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:07,429
I would love for you guys to carve off a little bit of time

00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:11,000
from your day-to-day and just try something new and try flexing a different

00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,370
part of your brain and try just exploring a creative path.

00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,909
We think of this stuff as expressive, instead of functional

00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:18,909
programming.

00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:19,909
We...

00:21:19,909 --> 00:21:21,880
I don't know, we the greater community.

00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,830
So the first project is context.

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,710
This is a project that I run, that is publicly accessible

00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,649
web sockets that you can connect to.

00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:34,760
And none of these parameters really tell you what they are.

00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,210
A, B, C, D, E, F. And the point here is -- these

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,600
change over time.

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,490
They change according to rules and they change

00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:44,600
in certain patterns.

00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,910
But none of these tell you what to do with the data.

00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,019
You could use D to control color for something, or speed, or rotation, or

00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,810
number of particles.

00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,520
Same thing with any of these different parameters.

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,950
It doesn't matter.

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,400
Whatever you make with this is 100% your personality coming out in this.

00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,300
So whatever you have in your head -- whatever your

00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:09,250
identity is, your politics, your personal beliefs, all that -- comes out as

00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,720
art.

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,600
Just like traditional...

00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Just like fine art.

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,179
I want to give you guys a couple of examples from this.

00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:23,570
So these are two Portland-centric artists.

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,390
So this is Libby.

00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,570
Libby White.

00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,130
And this is one thing she did.

00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,700
I don't know which of these parameters are controlling

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
what.

00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,919
Like, whether they're looking at each other or how wide they are

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,970
or how tall they are, but something in those parameters moving around

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,830
is creating this.

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,110
And this is Lucas's.

00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:46,159
Can I get some sounds?

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,600
Oh, there we go.

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,039
Oh, what's happening here?

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,559
There's a lot of sine and cosine happening here.

00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:54,559
Web API.

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,559
All JavaScript.

00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:56,750
Can you guys see this?

00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:01,049
So these are two people with entirely different backgrounds, entirely different

00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:05,019
personalities, that are creating art with the same code.

00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:10,730
Or the same, like, underlying heartbeat.

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:15,450
That's option number one.

00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,590
Make something.

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,490
Option number two is code pen.

00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,200
Who here knows code pen?

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,350
Yes.

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,549
There's a woo over there.

00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:25,549
It's great.

00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:26,549
Code pen is rad.

00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:28,200
We talked about sketchbooks earlier.

00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,679
Now, artists have sketchbooks.

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:36,470
Code pen is basically a global digital open collection of sketchbooks.

00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,470
And that's great.

00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,021
You can go in and look and see what people are doing, how

00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:43,399
they're getting things to look and move a certain way, and if you go to the

00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:48,200
homepage of code pen, if you don't know, they elevate all kinds of rad

00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,730
projects -- some are functional, like button rollovers, but some are

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,120
really weird.

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,870
JavaScript or CSS experimentations.

00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,029
You can go in there and learn the math and see how they're sort of

00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:04,000
twisting the things that you normally think of in one way, and making

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,559
them into something completely different.

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,450
Go to code pen, fork something, play with it, find something

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,990
that is visually interesting, and play with it.

00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,990
That's option two.

00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,389
Option number three is find a code group.

00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:15,820
They're everywhere, mostly.

00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:19,649
Except for a lot of Asia and all of Africa and most

00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:20,980
of South America.

00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,980
Okay.

00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,529
Bad example.

00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:24,529
But anyway...

00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,529
They're everywhere.

00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:29,730
And you guys are all from all over the United States.

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,419
And all over the world.

00:24:31,419 --> 00:24:33,980
Go and find a creative code group.

00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,820
Preferably a language agnostic one, because it could be great if you could get

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:44,299
in a room and talk to people who did Cinder and Open Frameworks and cross pollinate

00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:45,299
ideas.

00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:48,519
And not just developers, but also artists.

00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:51,529
Go to your local JavaScript meetups and talk about art.

00:24:51,529 --> 00:24:55,169
I guarantee you, from personal experience, if you go to a

00:24:55,169 --> 00:24:57,612
local JavaScript meetup, and you start talking about art, people are going

00:24:57,612 --> 00:25:03,190
to want to talk to you and want to make art with you.

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:05,110
That's how I've made friends with some of my favorite people in

00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,400
Portland.

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,500
And if you can't find one, start one.

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,880
It's really easy.

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,649
Meetup.com is free.

00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:16,600
You need you and just you, and you go find a place and you

00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,350
just start making art.

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,850
Tell people about it, and they'll come.

00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,850
Probably.

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,210
Again, no guarantees.

00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,980
Oh, that's backwards.

00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,159
Hold on.

00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:30,150
How much time do I have?

00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,639
We'll just assume this is the end.

00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:32,639
Five minutes?

00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:34,019
I don't have any more.

00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:35,029
I don't have any more wisdom to share.

00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:36,470
I'm just going to wrap this up.

00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,299
Thank you, guys.

00:25:38,299 --> 00:25:39,299
This is me.

00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:40,299
I'm John Brown.

00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:42,929
And I'm making art here and here and here.

00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:44,200
I have an SEO problem.

00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,460
John Brown is rough.

00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,840
There's a lot of us.

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,380
Did you guys know Inspector Gadget's real name is John Brown?

00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,899
That's a fun fact.

00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:55,740
So I'm making art here all the time.

00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,290
We just saw CSS in JavaScript, and I just want

00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:04,039
to do a terrible plug for myself, but I'm actually working on this hundred day

00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:09,730
project right now, where I'm exploring CSS in just raw divs.

00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:14,510
No nesting, no associated styling, no IDs and everything,

00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,960
and just seeing what I can do with those, over 100 days.

00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,549
And I've done some really cool stuff.

00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:20,779
I'm doing one a day.

00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,450
Some are great, some are terrible, but you should

00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,740
check them out, and they're all posted all along here.

00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,860
#makearteveryday.

00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,860
And that's all.

00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,479
