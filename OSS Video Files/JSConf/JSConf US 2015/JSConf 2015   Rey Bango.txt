as a those into my name is Ray vengo and

00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,390
I'm a developer advocate for Microsoft I

00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,580
focus specifically on Internet explorer

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,070
and Microsoft edge have you have you

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,500
guys heard of those two browsers anybody

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,380
yeah how many guys have had pain points

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,970
with those two brothers all right I

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,380
understand actually i'm going to assume

00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,270
you've had more pain points with the

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,829
previous version internet explorer than

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,030
microsoft edge but how many of you

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,030
actually tested out Microsoft edge

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,290
already okay a couple you well hopefully

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm gonna help you guys get into

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,260
Microsoft edge and feel a little bit

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,570
better about Microsoft's browser

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,220
strategy that's kind of my focus at

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,870
Microsoft I came back to Microsoft

00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,120
because of that because I was really

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,370
excited by what I saw with the new

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,350
browser you know Internet Explorer's had

00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,700
a very long history sometimes it was

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,680
really great and sometimes it wasn't so

00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,180
great but Microsoft's made a very

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,559
different effort and concerted effort to

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,720
improve the browser experience and

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,689
that's where Microsoft edge comes in now

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,220
one of the things that I wanted to do

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,220
when I came back to Microsoft was make

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,070
sure that I truly understood the the

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,780
day-to-day work flow of the modern web

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,390
developer and it's interesting because

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,010
when I rejoined Microsoft back last July

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,570
the one thing I told them was all right

00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:28,200
well if I'm going to go come back one

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,510
thing I need is a macbook so just like

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,220
you guys you guys a lot of you use that

00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:36,990
well this is my work machine seriously

00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,130
this is what they gave me to start off

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,380
with and the reason I did this is

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,390
because it's how can I have a genuine

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,130
conversation with any of you guys if I

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,130
don't know how you're doing your

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,240
day-to-day work how can I know the pain

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,210
points that you guys are going through

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,100
if I don't know how you're testing our

00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,750
browser product you guys have you've

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,330
expressed over the many years that I've

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,619
been doing this that Internet Explorer

00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,090
has been tough and now we have a brand

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,610
new browser but how can I help you guys

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,380
be able to effectively test this out if

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,630
I'm not using the same equipment that

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,939
you guys are and that's why I ended up

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,649
with a mac and you know the mac is a

00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:13,590
great machine and some of you are on

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,120
linux but ultimately i think what

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,819
everybody wants is to be at a code cross

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,069
browser and that's end but in many cases

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,770
what ends up happening is that because

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:25,590
you're on a on a oh s 10 or linux you

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,800
end up actually targeting this and part

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,990
of the

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,550
because you're like well how do i test

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,590
out internet explorer how do i test out

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,810
Microsoft edge when I don't have a

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,460
windows pc and that's part of this

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,200
conversation and we have a brand new

00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,820
browser Microsoft edge which is

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,760
fantastic standards-based stuff like

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,830
that and I don't want you guys to go

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,510
through what this poor guy did this is

00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,730
actually a web developer who is trying

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,070
to test out area explore in a mac all

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,780
right I don't let you guys to go through

00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,930
that type of stuff I want you to feel

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,120
good about doing your day-to-day work I

00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,650
don't want you to struggle now some of

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,610
the common questions I get is well why

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,830
can't you kill off IE all right I I hear

00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,400
that all the time and you know I I quit

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,960
this is something called old IE PTSD all

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,540
right how many of you are feeling that

00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,920
yeah pretty much the whole entire room I

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,200
get it okay well what ends up happening

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,000
is you go to this feeling of all man I

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,880
had to support these older versions of

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,830
Internet Explorer and start making

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,450
cartoons like this all right where

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:25,770
Internet Explorer is eating paste on the

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,070
side while the other two browsers are

00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,840
duking it out all right and one of the

00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,750
things that realized over the years that

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,250
this is really because it's a lack of

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:38,070
feature knowledge in the community and

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,330
this is not something that I don't blame

00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,090
the developer community I blame

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,140
microsoft I blame myself for not doing a

00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,630
good enough job of getting the

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,739
information out of educating you guys

00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,900
about the things that we're doing

00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,790
because I feel pretty good about even

00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,080
internet explorer 11 how many of you

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,510
have actually used internet explorer 11

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,489
during your testing or even usage well

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,750
you've if you've done that then you

00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:59,970
probably know that we have a pretty good

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,820
level of support of standards-based

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,320
features and this is it's amazing what I

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,840
encounter developers that don't know

00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,850
this or that we have some really really

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,860
good toolings using the f12 developer

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,170
tools where you can do everything from

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,239
obviously script debugging to profiling

00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,400
to all types of emulations across

00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,109
different form factors it's really

00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,090
important now one of the bigger reasons

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:23,760
that I'm an advocate of not killing off

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,500
internet explorer's because the w3c and

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,750
having multiple reference

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,390
implementations of browsers you want

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,890
multiple browser vendors out there

00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,380
vetting these features to ensure that

00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:36,000
the features are ready for production

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,370
you don't want to go back to the old

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,539
days remember how all these features

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,689
were coming out and they were just part

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:42,119
of

00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:44,580
I six and they became standards because

00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:45,749
one vendor was dominant we don't want to

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,159
go back to those days we want to have

00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:49,409
multiple vendors that are venting all

00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:51,479
these features so we have multiple touch

00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:53,519
points and multiple thought processes

00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,439
going on about why these features

00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,819
matters and how they should be

00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,829
implemented we want a thoughtful

00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,419
approach having multiple vendors going

00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:02,039
out there and thinking about that makes

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:05,189
a lot of sense and improves the process

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,419
and knowledge is power I want to share

00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:07,769
that knowledge with you guys I want to

00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,629
make sure that you guys have the

00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:10,589
information you need to be successful so

00:05:09,629 --> 00:05:12,809
I'm going to ask all of you right now

00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:14,009
real quick just to write down some links

00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:15,929
that are going to be really important to

00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:18,269
you guys okay first one is called Deb

00:05:15,929 --> 00:05:20,909
modern-day eat some of you murder may

00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:22,800
already know about modern-day e this is

00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:24,629
the tooling site that we produced a

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,129
while back that gives a bunch of

00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:27,300
information a bunch of tools that makes

00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:30,329
your development cycle a little bit

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,189
easier so please just jot down dev

00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:34,079
modern IE put it into your browser if

00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:35,610
you have something open and the reason

00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,039
is because we are trying to be a lot

00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,689
more transparent about information we

00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:41,399
have our road map out in there this is

00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:43,889
called the status dashboard it's really

00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,269
important so if you want to see what

00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:47,639
type of features we're looking at

00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:49,649
producing let me spark this up I'll go

00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,249
here this is by the way this is

00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:54,659
Microsoft edge all right some of you

00:05:53,249 --> 00:05:56,399
admit this may be the first look you can

00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:57,719
see it's a very different chrome that

00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,149
you what you've traditionally been used

00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:02,099
to an Internet Explorer it's very

00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:03,929
streamlined but i'm not going to focus

00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,179
on that right now what I am focused on

00:06:03,929 --> 00:06:08,009
is Deb modern-day eat and this is where

00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:09,719
you want to go to it's going to be this

00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:11,759
when you want to get the most relevant

00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:14,219
information about Microsoft edge and

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,839
internet explorer eventually but the key

00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:18,539
one is this right here the plot and step

00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,129
of platform status because this is where

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,809
our road maps at if you want to know

00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,939
what type of status we're at in a

00:06:21,809 --> 00:06:25,889
specific feature this is where you go so

00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:28,139
for example if we want to talk about I

00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,300
don't know the battery status API what's

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,829
under consideration but if you wanted to

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,379
know whether we're going to include

00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:35,939
canvas was already an edge this is where

00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:37,919
you can understand what we're thinking

00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,509
about and the great thing is that you

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,759
have an opportunity now to vote these

00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:45,209
features up we if you go to user voice

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,379
modern day e you have a choice now you

00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:47,489
can look for the features that are

00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:49,409
important to you and you can vote those

00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:51,749
up and the features that get the highest

00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:53,999
votes get the attention I think that's a

00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:54,270
pretty fair approach to it all right so

00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:55,650
I want

00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:01,470
make sure that you have that link let me

00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:03,360
go back to my slides real quick now I'm

00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,040
going to ask you to just kind of write

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,810
these down these are bit ly links now

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,280
the IE developer guides every time we

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,140
release a version of internet explorer

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,640
we've also put in developer guys that

00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,500
outline the new features that are in

00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,940
internet explorer and we're going to

00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,560
continue to do that with Microsoft edge

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,090
but it's interesting because it a lot of

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,110
developers didn't know about this and

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,110
this is really important when you're

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:25,850
trying to think about future features so

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,570
bit ly / IE deb guides the I

00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,400
compatibility cookbook which is

00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,420
incredibly important because we outline

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,310
things that we know are going to be

00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:34,170
compatibility issues and we try to make

00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,910
your lives easier by giving giving you a

00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,930
heads up of what's happening that way

00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,600
you can plan your development

00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,330
accordingly so in this case IE compat

00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,520
cookbook and then lastly we do have

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,220
really good to developer tools this is

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,720
not the you know ie8 debug toolbar

00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,180
thingy majiggy that you had to install

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,730
the plugin now these are real developer

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,220
tools guys so check it out go to bit ly

00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,990
f12 dev tools and check it out now why

00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,910
should I test IE that's another common

00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:02,070
question I get you know ultimate is

00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,300
going to be up to you and your user base

00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:05,340
but I wanted to point out a couple

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,860
graphs and this is one that always

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,360
strikes home fifty-five percent of the

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,190
Internet is using Internet Explorer in

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,720
some fashion this is based on net market

00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,890
share now some of you may say well

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,780
that's net marking sure what about

00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,420
statcounter well even with statcounter

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,160
22% is still a pretty high figure that's

00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,010
twenty-two percent desktop market share

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,500
worldwide again ultimately you have to

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,880
use your own analytics to determine what

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,420
you want to test for but these are still

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,420
compelling stats all right now the other

00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,310
question I get is why can't I push

00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:36,870
corporations to upgrade how many of you

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,410
use any of these services these

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,030
companies for services okay look pretty

00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,250
large number of you okay some of you may

00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,750
be overseas you may not use this

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:48,390
ultimately these companies have a

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,520
responsibility to you guys using chase

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,720
of using fidelity all these guys want to

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,800
make sure that they manage your

00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,300
investments they want to manage your

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,220
money they want to manage your services

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,590
the right way so they have to go through

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,540
specific internal auditing services that

00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:01,920
are critical to making sure that the

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,690
information they're processing is

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,120
accurate some of that is government

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,480
mandated and some of those are auditing

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,880
and certification

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,480
on specific software versions how many

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,550
of you knew that okay only a maybe a

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,050
couple okay this is something that's

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:19,000
really important so when you ask that

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,740
question why can't we push companies to

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,350
upgrade because some of them actually

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,529
have to certify their software to

00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:28,930
specific software versions so they

00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:31,120
certify to Internet Explorer 8 at a cost

00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,949
of 10 million dollars they're not going

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,829
to want to do that every six weeks or

00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:37,779
every 12 weeks the large large

00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:39,579
investment that they have to make they

00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:41,769
have to make sure that they their

00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:43,720
software worked accurately so I think if

00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:45,459
you make a trade on fidelity you want to

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,019
make sure that trade is accurate or when

00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,339
you make a deposit into chase you want

00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,170
to make sure your money is in that bank

00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:51,610
account right well chase wants to make

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,930
sure they can do that same thing and

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,880
they depend on software that we produce

00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,010
as well for that so that's why we can't

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,750
push them but what we are trying to do

00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,089
is give them tools that allow them to

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,010
migrate to modern technologies in a

00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:04,779
little bit more methodical fashion so

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,610
for example Enterprise mode Internet

00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:09,490
Explorer comes in internet explorer 11

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,019
it's a high fidelity emulation of

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:13,209
Internet Explorer 8 that allows

00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:16,180
enterprises to be to run their legacy

00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:18,069
stuff while still focusing on modern

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,899
technologies this gives them that

00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:22,480
migration path they can test out their

00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:24,550
old legacy stuff using Internet Explorer

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,380
and if it works great that means it's

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,300
only one browser running both scenarios

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,800
so we're providing that and the other

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,899
thing we provide is enterprise site

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,269
discovery tool kit which is a tool that

00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:36,519
lets them analyze all their applications

00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:38,019
and figure out which are the sites that

00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,550
they use the most in which of the sites

00:10:38,019 --> 00:10:41,110
that they'd have to migrate to modern

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,850
technologies based on what they're

00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,740
implementing they might use active xba

00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,569
chose or whatever and that way they have

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,680
some kind of visibility into what it

00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:51,790
takes to get them to move forward now

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,199
one of the great things i see here and i

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,760
want to kind of highlight this graph is

00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:57,149
that i'm seeing an upward trend on

00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,380
internet explorer 11 and that's great

00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,510
because all the other browser shares are

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,010
going down and we want that we actually

00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,180
want all the older versions of a near

00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,889
explorer to go down while the more

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,230
modern versions go up that means that

00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:09,940
it's one less two less browsers that you

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,860
have to focus on and i'm sitting that a

00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,209
net mark share and i'm also seeing on

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,769
statcounter so whether you're using

00:11:13,209 --> 00:11:16,779
doesn't matter which analytic you're

00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:19,120
using we're still seeing an upward trend

00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:20,260
on internet explorer 11 that's really

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,160
important because that means that you

00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,680
guys are gonna get the most

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,000
modern version soon enough and one of

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,300
the things that we're doing to help that

00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:32,079
is we're giving a Windows 10 away to

00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:34,269
anybody with windows 7 8 or 8.1 that's a

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,470
free upgrade that's that's a pretty

00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:37,540
impressive thing you're talking millions

00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:39,939
of users are going to be prompted to get

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,949
a free version of Windows this is

00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:43,810
unprecedented we've never done that all

00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:47,649
right what that means is I expect to see

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:50,920
a very high usage of Microsoft edge

00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:53,019
which is what you guys want edge is our

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,339
new browser that's going to be standards

00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:57,279
compliant there's going to be on a much

00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,930
faster release cycle and hopefully that

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:03,389
will end up sun setting internet

00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:07,029
explorer very soon my fingers breadth

00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:08,920
okay now enough of that soapbox talk

00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:10,389
what I do want to do is actually dive

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,250
into this because I know that we only

00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:13,329
have a short amount of time I want to

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,089
make sure I highlight how do you test

00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:18,610
Internet Explorer and edge again the

00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:20,620
microsoft edge deb portal is your home

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,569
there ok and i'm going to dive into that

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,490
real quick and the reason it's your home

00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:26,050
is because basically here is where we

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,579
have a couple of options we have

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,050
something called remote IE which lets

00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:30,639
you virtualize internet explorer within

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,350
the context of your mac i'm going to

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,060
show you how that looks we have virtual

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,420
machines for every version of internet

00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,980
explorer across multiple OS versions we

00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,660
can also generate screenshots and we can

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:42,550
also generate a quick side scan that

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,439
shows different compatibility issues so

00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,329
if i bring up remote IE which is

00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:48,250
actually a really cool feature you can

00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:50,050
go ahead and i'll double-click on ray

00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,610
bangles internet explorer what it does

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:54,040
is it actually goes ahead and hoping the

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:57,300
internet works connects out to our

00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:02,880
remote as our services hopefully login

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:05,139
let's see bear with me one second

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,389
connects to our remote Azeris services

00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:09,490
this works and what will get is a

00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:11,500
virtualized version of internet explorer

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,490
sitting on my desktop I didn't work that

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:21,930
time let me try this one here with me

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:21,930
there we go come on

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,319
this one work okay great all right so

00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:31,749
here if you look it looks basically like

00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:32,920
I have a true native app and what the

00:13:31,749 --> 00:13:34,359
cool thing about this is this is

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,100
internet explorer 11 it gives me the

00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:37,989
tooling that I want so here's the f12

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,350
developer tools and of course i can

00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:43,209
bring up any site i won in this case is

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:49,239
bringing up modern IE maybe i want to go

00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:51,220
to blog that Ray bango calm it'll go out

00:13:49,239 --> 00:13:52,419
there and bring up my blog now this is

00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,619
very useful obviously if you're in a

00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:55,600
staging or in a production environment

00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:57,609
not very useful if you're trying to test

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,480
out a site on your local pc so one of

00:13:57,609 --> 00:14:00,160
the things that I've actually been

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,689
noodling on quite a bit is how do you

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,549
actually do that well the great thing is

00:14:01,689 --> 00:14:05,350
i stumbled upon a tool called n grok

00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:07,359
which is freaking awesome so here's a

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,309
little site i have it's called rep chord

00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,989
i'm going to launch this HTTP server

00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:13,449
they're launched a little web server

00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:15,819
here and when i go here to localhost

00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:18,669
bear with me one second i go back to my

00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:21,249
browser's you can see it localhost 8080

00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:23,049
so this is a little CrossFit site that a

00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:25,209
buddy of mine let me borrow so i can

00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:26,410
count demo for you guys and this is

00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:28,509
great on my local machine but i actually

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,970
want to see it on remote IE so i'm going

00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:34,379
to go back here and let me bring up

00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:38,379
another tab and I'll go to end rock and

00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:41,410
n grok should be in Greco it's say HTTP

00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:42,999
i believe is HTTP 8080 and what it's

00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:44,829
going to do is going to create a secure

00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:47,139
tunnel for me that i can then use to

00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:49,119
actually bring up the site within any

00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:50,499
type of remote scenario so in this case

00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:53,709
notice that it's bringing up this whole

00:14:50,499 --> 00:14:57,220
URL here now i take this i'll go back to

00:14:53,709 --> 00:15:01,989
remote i eat and poop and i'll paste

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:03,399
this right in here and bring it up now

00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:05,980
what I'm doing is I'm leveraging remote

00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,679
ie which normally would not allow me to

00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:10,779
hit my local server and now I can

00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:13,689
actually test it out this is actually

00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:16,179
rep cord running on my local box but now

00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:17,709
I can use it within remote I eat that's

00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:19,239
a big deal that's actually pretty hot

00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,759
this was something that we couldn't do

00:15:19,239 --> 00:15:23,139
before but i like i said i want the

00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,850
noodle i was really frustrating that we

00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:26,470
had this great service but you couldn't

00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,269
ping your local you know your local

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,009
resources why would we put that out

00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:31,720
there so now with n groc you can

00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:33,639
actually do that and the cool thing is

00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,540
you can use this also for any virtual

00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,550
machines that you

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,860
decide to install on your Mac as well so

00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:43,920
we terminate that so you guys you guys

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:49,030
don't hack my machine all right and now

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:51,820
so going back to go back here bear with

00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,560
no second alright so angaraag is awesome

00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,850
is to go to anger are calm you can

00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,050
install it if you have homebrew you can

00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,330
actually install it via homebrew as well

00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,340
now the other thing is and we again

00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,320
remote IE the cool thing about is you go

00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,480
here you sign in you do have to have a

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,070
Microsoft Live ID but you select your

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,570
region if you select your region you

00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,860
have different ones make sure you select

00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:10,480
the one that's closest to you so that

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,860
way you get the best performance but the

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,960
good thing is again you don't have to

00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,700
install anything its except for the

00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,230
microsoft remote desktop app once it

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,300
comes up it creates a virtualized

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,100
version of that kind of cool stuff now

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,600
the one thing that you guys definitely

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,670
have used quite a bit and we've actually

00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,720
seen a lot of stats on this is the

00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,800
virtual machines how many of you guys

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,780
have taken advantage of virtual machines

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,850
off of modern done a lot of you and

00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,730
they're awesome so you know we do have

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,800
for Windows Mac and Linux so whichever

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,510
operating system is is yours go for it

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,340
and the great thing is again we have all

00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,720
different types of versions this is the

00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,610
key part of it we wanted to make sure

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,710
that you guys can test across any type

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,570
of internet explorer version and

00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:48,370
operating system version as well because

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,840
of course there's nuances depending on

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,400
which one you're at so make sure you

00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,800
select the one you want so let's say

00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,570
it's a tie 11 on Windows 10 and you can

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,640
select your platform parallels

00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:59,260
VirtualBox or VMware totally up to you

00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,730
guys the one thing we don't have right

00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,200
now is Microsoft edge on there because

00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,220
it's still not out in production we're

00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,690
still working on that but there's a

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:06,940
different way of grabbing that so i'll

00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,880
make sure i show that before we kind of

00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,770
run out now we also have a screenshot

00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,420
service i went ahead and ran this ahead

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,580
of time so you can see it would it look

00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,410
like because it does take a little while

00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,390
to generate the screenshots but here's

00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,190
the miami herald of course my hometown

00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:22,600
paper all right but notice it does give

00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:24,550
you screenshots across different types

00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,470
of browsers different types of OSS and

00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,480
browsers so it's a nice little service

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:31,600
that against it's free for you use and

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,520
also we have a site scanning report so

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,860
you put in a URL and it gives you

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,510
feedback on what we know are certain

00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,890
compatibility issues that might cause

00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,120
you guys problems so in this case for

00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:42,370
example notice that they're using

00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,320
underscore one point oh well we've known

00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,880
we know just based on information

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,100
telemetry we've collected that

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,080
underscore one point 0 will

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,700
some compat is you go up in different

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,230
versions of Internet Explorer so what we

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:56,140
recommend is to go to the next most

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:58,750
compatible version which is 1.7 we also

00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:00,850
look for other things like been there

00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,890
prefixes which we all know if you don't

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,210
prefix correctly if you don't go ahead

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,610
and do it across from all the browser

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,380
versions and browser vendors you're

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,179
going to have some quirks some rendering

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,280
quirks so we try to give you as much

00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:13,750
compatibility information as possible so

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,150
you guys can make informed decisions

00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,820
about your development process all right

00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:20,530
now the other service that I recommend

00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,750
is a service called browser stack how

00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:24,850
many of you have used that a couple you

00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,080
this is a paid service but you know what

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,850
its incredible is it's actually

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,039
phenomenal the great thing about it is

00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,870
it's not windows specific it's not

00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:33,970
internet explorer specific works across

00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:36,850
any type of OS and it's within your

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,679
browser itself so if i wanted to test

00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:41,500
out windows 10 using internet explorer

00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:44,049
11 i can go here it actually sparks up a

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,419
session and the cool thing is if i go

00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:49,630
ahead and start up a local server and

00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:53,169
i'll start it up again i can actually go

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:55,480
here back to my browser and i want to

00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:59,200
bring up localhost and now within within

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:02,260
google chrome i am testing out internet

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,409
explorer 11 running the local site

00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,940
that's on my peace my macbook all right

00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:08,980
that's a little inception type of stuff

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,780
there all right so this is pretty cool

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,950
and the great thing is this is just

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,559
through a browser extension that you

00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,570
install and basically does the local

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,909
tunneling for you again it's a little

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:20,260
bit of a you know it's a little pricing

00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,549
service that you have to pay for but you

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,929
know what sometimes you got to pay for

00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:24,580
the good stuff and I'm a firm believer

00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:26,559
that you pay for software that solves

00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,000
you solves problems for you guys so I

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,200
think browser sack is a great piece of

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,549
software and it's definitely worth the

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,549
investment all right

00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,720
we also have webdriver support in the

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,070
internet explorer 11 I'm not an expert

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,660
in webdriver but if you guys need

00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:43,890
information on that let me know and I

00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,420
can get your information and put you in

00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:48,030
contact with the team now how do you

00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:50,610
test out Microsoft edge well the easiest

00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:53,550
way is to download the ISO from insider

00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:58,230
windows com so take a moment and write

00:19:53,550 --> 00:20:00,660
that down insider that windows com all

00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,640
right this version that the version of

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,170
Windows 10 that you saw me running is

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,820
the same version that you guys would

00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,100
download it already includes Microsoft

00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,780
edge on it so you get all the features

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,790
and you can start seeing how Microsoft

00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,200
edge works on your site you can check

00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,580
out the rendering the great thing about

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,260
Microsoft edge is that we are shooting

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,090
for ninety-nine percent compatibility it

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,610
compatibility interoperability with

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,620
other browsers so your sites should work

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,560
okay we want to make sure that they work

00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,420
and also I have a limited number of USB

00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,190
sticks that actually have Windows 10 on

00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,230
it where you can just pop it into your

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,430
macbook that's macbook only you pop it

00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,990
into your macbook you restart your

00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,720
macbook and it actually brings it up for

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:39,150
you so before the end of the session or

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,190
before you guys run out come over and

00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:43,020
see me and I'll hand them out I only

00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:44,340
have a limited number though okay so I

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,400
just want to keep it everybody aware

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,720
that now what about mobile mobile is

00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,330
another challenge obviously for testing

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,290
across any type of mobile browser one of

00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:53,670
the things that we're doing is we're

00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:57,200
coming up with a project called borlänge

00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:59,490
s and Vorlon was a project that actually

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,100
it's a JavaScript library that allows

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,260
for remote communication with specific

00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,490
individual devices if you've used winery

00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,260
before for example which I'm going to

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:08,910
talk about here as well it's very

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,230
similar winery in that sense the

00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,000
interesting thing about this is of

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,530
course it's Microsoft so you'd be

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,750
surprised that we actually releases as

00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:19,140
open source and we are accepting

00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:20,700
contributions in tint all right but the

00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,980
cool thing is that it's also has a plug

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,080
in a plug-in scenario where you guys can

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,960
contribute plugins to the actual

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,820
framework itself to extend it out and is

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,190
powered by node and socket i/o so

00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,420
definitely join us in kind of extending

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,520
that out I'm going to demo it so you can

00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,570
see it the other one is winery these are

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,010
the two libraries that I've used the

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:40,830
most how many of you use winery in the

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:43,320
pin past ok klipsch a couple you and

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:46,950
winery is another very very awesome

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,230
remote testing library which it solves

00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,030
that remote that remote device

00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:56,580
type of scenario let me show you real

00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:59,340
quick so what I'll do is I'm going to

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:02,280
actually close these down here and I'm

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:04,830
going to bring up the spark of or lon

00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,080
first so i got my locals here so i'm

00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:08,549
going to go here and then Vorlon is just

00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,770
a matter of typing in Borland it's an

00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:13,679
MPN module so i just installed it boom

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:15,809
it comes up and it's listening on port

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,809
1337 it's basically a little web server

00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:20,070
that just listens on port 1337 and one

00:22:18,809 --> 00:22:21,240
of the things that you need to do is in

00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:24,480
your code you need to add this

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,179
javascript script tag in here ok this is

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,100
what actually allows for lon to read

00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,900
your dom understand what's going on

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,880
within your page analyze it and

00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:36,150
represent it so now when i go here and

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,900
I'll go back to my browser and i go

00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:42,059
local hosts 1337 vorlons going to bring

00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,320
me up a dashboard ok the dashboard

00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:46,470
doesn't show anything right now but as

00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:49,679
soon as I go into my my app localhost

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:54,510
8080 and let me actually break this part

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:56,790
here boom and bring us here you'll see

00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,980
that basically I have now a new app here

00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:00,570
and it's expects if I click on that it

00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:01,770
expands out it shows me my whole DOM and

00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,630
the good thing is that I can actually

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:05,700
click through here and actually inspect

00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:08,549
the individual elements and get feedback

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,760
on what's happening so I can't go to the

00:23:08,549 --> 00:23:12,750
level of doing like script debugging yet

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,660
this is something that we're actually

00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,549
working on as a plug-in but you can go

00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,620
ahead and have a cab access to the

00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:27,840
console so if i go here i guess say

00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:29,910
something like inner HTML equals foo and

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,590
i do that and changes immediately there

00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,690
so you have immediate response and

00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,059
feedback to understand what the what

00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:38,280
changes would happen and you can change

00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:40,200
attributes on your CSS as well property

00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:43,080
values so if I said margin bottom is I

00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,000
don't know 50 pixels then it affects it

00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:46,590
as well in real time so from a mobile

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,630
device perspective this makes a lot of

00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,790
sense again this is an evolving library

00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,679
so I definitely ask you guys to jump in

00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,510
get involved and contribute the plugins

00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:58,470
now the other one that I want to show

00:23:54,510 --> 00:24:03,140
you is winery so I'll go here and let me

00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:12,240
terminate a for lawn and I'll go winery

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:17,880
HTTP port and 80 81 all right so I'll

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:21,150
bring up winery now winery is very

00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,860
similar to this and it's based on webkit

00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:24,420
so a lot of the stuff is going to be

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,280
very familiar to you guys if you use the

00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,960
chrome developer tools notice that

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,460
nothing shows up now winery has a really

00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,840
cool little bookmarklet so if I click on

00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,210
this bookmarklet here notice that all

00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:35,640
the Dom shows up now there's a little

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,700
bit more of a feature filled type of

00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,040
scenario so you have access to resources

00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,780
network timings timelines console the

00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,700
whole thing it's actually a really slick

00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,680
thing it's again it's a little bit more

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,820
mature but you know we're working on

00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,740
board on we're trying to make it much

00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,380
better so I expand this out I can go

00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:55,140
here and change different things let's

00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,270
say I want to go down here and I'll

00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:00,950
expand this div out and we're says the

00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:06,840
rep cord I can change this out to the

00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:09,180
record and up its down here someplace

00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,250
but basically shows real time updating

00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,650
of the page as well again a little bit

00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,450
more mature app it's been around for a

00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:16,830
long time but this is where you're going

00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:18,810
to what you're going to use primarily

00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,070
for your mobile testing all right this

00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,780
is what's going to allow you to inspect

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,520
the Dom elements check all the

00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,650
attributes change them in real time and

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,960
work with them so Vorlon and winery are

00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:29,100
your two choices there's also and I'm

00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,330
sorry if I'm speaking fast as you so I

00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,870
know I'm limited on time and I want to

00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:35,370
get through this there's also a couple

00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:36,810
of other ones Adobe Edge inspect which

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,210
is a great tool I haven't used this I

00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:42,180
know Brian lose here so Brian maybe you

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,860
can help them out later on or not and

00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,960
ghost lab which is another one that I've

00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,640
just that I've just recently found it's

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,980
a paid service but it also looks pretty

00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,350
impressive as well the one thing that we

00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,430
have been pushing for extensively within

00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,140
the developer relations team is a

00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,540
headless version of ie how many you guys

00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,620
want to have this version of ie

00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,790
everybody and the reason is we want to

00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,960
include that into your development

00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:03,480
workflow your continuous integration

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,760
workflow we've been pushing on it it is

00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,160
in process we are working on that okay

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,870
it is something that's really critically

00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,830
important when we know that once we do

00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,780
that is going to make your lives easier

00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:15,000
all right so basically we are

00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,500
continuously improving we are working on

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,800
giving you the tools that you need and

00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,750
lower

00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,490
friction to testing Internet Explorer

00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:22,200
Microsoft edge but ultimately we need

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:23,910
your feedback we need you guys to be

00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,980
continuously involved we need you guys

00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:28,470
to be testing we need to read that

00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,820
feedback to know what are the one of the

00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:30,870
friction points you're encountering what

00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,670
are the problems that you're seeing in

00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,710
the browser and we need you guys testing

00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:36,420
Internet Explorer and Microsoft edge

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:37,650
there's still a lot of customers out

00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:39,810
there using the older version of browser

00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:41,130
but we also want your feedback on new

00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,300
stuff because that's the stuff that's

00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:45,120
going to be the new shiny toys for you

00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:47,610
guys all right also remember that we do

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,350
have good tools that tooling stuff that

00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,300
the tools team wants your feedback as

00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:53,070
