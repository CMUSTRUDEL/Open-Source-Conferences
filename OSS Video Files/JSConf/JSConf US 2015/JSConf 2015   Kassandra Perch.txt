thank you so much in it great this is

00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,680
like one of the best problems to have

00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,300
our community is getting so big that

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,369
people are meeting each other for real

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,470
and like then recognizing who each other

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,700
are we actually have too much content

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,430
for 30 minutes so we're going to move

00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,650
pretty fast the first thing I'd like to

00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,590
talk about is there is a JavaScript

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,750
robotics book out now this is the amazon

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,200
page for it it's available in kindle two

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,060
and most of the authors are here raise

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,320
your hand if you reach a peer for make

00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:48,330
JavaScript robotics yeah I think nine or

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,450
ten and authors are here I need just try

00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:53,550
to move this up a little bit but yeah so

00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,140
check it out it's on amazon and it's a

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:57,720
great book and if you have a paper copy

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,220
um most of us will find it i think if

00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,910
you walk up and ask I mean none of us

00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:06,360
are that mean we don't bite do we no no

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,009
so one or two people asked and it was

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,479
kind of weird it was like a weird moment

00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:12,420
I never thought that anyone would ever

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,070
ask me for an autograph for a book that

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,900
was kind of cool yeah that was

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,210
definitely that was simply a culture

00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,800
shock for me too so the first thing we

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,320
talk about is the stuff that happened

00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,390
yesterday so one of the questions have

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,000
got a few times is I didn't sign up for

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,040
node BOTS but I want to build what was

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,860
at the node BOTS workshop so what do I

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,800
need the main thing you need is one of

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,680
these runt Rovers kits we use the PE at

00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,000
the workshop yesterday it's less than

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,190
twenty dollars for the kit you do need

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,630
an Arduino Uno to go with that Rick

00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,510
can't I'll a little more about that

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,830
while I show some photos of so um I'm

00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:51,260
super stoked that you brought that up

00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:55,409
because after robots con I published a

00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:59,400
five four or five part blog post series

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:01,380
on Bo kuz a company blog that was how to

00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,100
assemble the robot that you got at

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,409
robots cough so as it turns out i plan

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,500
on doing exactly the same follow-up for

00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:13,080
this project in the coming couple of

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,739
weeks it'll be an article on boku that

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,620
is how to build the the peewee runt

00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,950
rover that you may or may not have

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,080
acquired at jsmith warsaw somebody else

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,740
had and would like to build the same

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,500
thing yourself

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:32,850
of parts list of course instructions

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:35,700
videos pictures all the above it'll be

00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:40,020
reviewed and revised thoroughly and look

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,550
forward to that yep so how also have

00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:43,530
some really great photos of the node

00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,240
boats event and while Sarah talks a

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,490
little about what happened there Rick if

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,110
you want to get set up with your your

00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,690
setup awesome then all at Sarah taken

00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:53,910
away and then we'll go to your demo yeah

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:57,030
yesterday we had the second annual node

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:59,340
boots event here at jay's comp it was

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:03,390
pretty awesome we had about 60 people I

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:08,070
think here building boats with us and I

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,480
think every team except for one and it

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,130
gained their boats in the water sailing

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,430
around at the end of the day and the one

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:17,580
was because they were trying to be very

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:21,060
ambitious and like hack digital cameras

00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,280
to include them in the boat somehow or

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,270
disposable cameras or something it was

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,590
pretty cool but very ambitious uh and uh

00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:31,200
yeah we actually saw a couple of new

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,540
designs come out of this year's i know'd

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,060
boats we had someone build a sailboat

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,920
which was really awesome that was like a

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,570
really cool design we haven't had sell

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,130
boats before we've had motor boats and

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,290
paddle boats but this was the first

00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,150
sailboat and it worked which is cool so

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,430
I'll put the Ducks I heard there were

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,800
ducks oh yeah so at the end of the day

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,500
that's the best at the end of the day we

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,140
went down to the big hotel swimming pool

00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,030
and we had a race across the pool with

00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,890
boats or you know just boots what you

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:03,480
know going around in circles when the

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:06,930
Wi-Fi cut out and stuff like that um and

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,080
so to get around the Wi-Fi issues a

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,180
couple of Road attendees just hardwired

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,280
the motors directly to the battery so

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,290
they could go on and forwards and and

00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,480
like didn't have much other control but

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,670
that was fine and while these boats were

00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,980
zooming around the pool a duck came and

00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:25,850
landed in the pool because it wanted to

00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:28,950
win the best new book award obviously

00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:30,600
and so the boat or the duck was was just

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:32,520
kind of swimming around checking things

00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,380
out and then one of these out of control

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,840
node boats just like started going

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,669
straight at the duck just full speed

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,420
ahead and the dexter swimming out of the

00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,890
way it was like no

00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,410
this book is getting too close for

00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:45,600
comfort and took off and flew away but

00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,160
we also had some really dedicated

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,050
attendees this year we had one team

00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,080
where they went to Walmart to get like

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,210
pool noodle noodles to use to like prop

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,900
their boat up better and they actually

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,760
like got uh yeah they got a Barbie doll

00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:04,050
and shaved her head to turn her into

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:06,960
like the the girl from Mad Max yeah yeah

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:08,700
Louie was helping with that members I

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,620
was delivering coffee to the members and

00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:15,150
carrying items around it was all them

00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:24,270
okay it was pretty awesome coma doofen

00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:25,860
furiosa at the same time arioso uoy all

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,070
that movie oh that movie I want to be

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,880
imperative figure so what I grow up oh

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:35,370
alright so Rick you have a demo for us

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:38,610
sort of for a before it before I talk

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,880
about this I want to mention that Sarah

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:45,450
is actually the author of a chapter in

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,690
the JavaScript robotics book and her

00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:51,240
chapter is about building a node boat so

00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,660
if you want to build a node boat you

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,550
purchased the book and get instructions

00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:02,160
directly from the experts so that's

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:06,500
pretty exciting also second thing a lot

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:10,140
of times a robotics research uses

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:14,130
animals in the wild as models obviously

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:16,170
for new types of robot designs and it

00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:19,230
just occurred to me that if we strapped

00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:23,670
a node boat to a node copter you would

00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:27,510
have a duck bot that might have to be a

00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:32,910
workshop next year duck quacks oh no no

00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:34,530
ducks no no doc bot a team building a

00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,180
boat where the way it was constructed

00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,180
when it got to the side of the pool we

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,970
climb out of the pool Oh amphibious node

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,340
boats oh how did it do that like these

00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,690
folks with paddles on the ends and so

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,580
the spokes would end up doubling as

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:51,660
wheels one thing oh my gosh amazing okay

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,360
we can do it out on that for like the

00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,360
next 30 minutes

00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:01,320
yep so this I don't know if I'll hold it

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,730
up so this is a thank you Francis that

00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,390
I've been working on this for a few

00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:10,320
months now and it was inspired by a blog

00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:13,170
post that I saw by dr. esther kim she

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,660
had done a little demo where she was

00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:18,870
doing video streaming from an Intel

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:22,140
Edison I was like that is so cool I want

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,580
to try that so I decided to do that

00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,010
might notice you might actually

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,560
recognize the chassis this is like the

00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,230
older sibling of the Pee Wee it's called

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,240
the Scout I believe these chassis czar

00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,880
awesome it's like snapped together it

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,380
was so easy to build and drill holes

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,410
into to customize there's actually a

00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,570
bunch of them up there yep it is wait

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,690
which one are we yeah oh no I'm sorry I

00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:48,150
lied it's the whipper snapper yeah why

00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:51,720
per se this is whippersnapper I get

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:53,970
scout from anyway so what makes this fun

00:07:51,720 --> 00:08:00,300
and interesting and special to me is

00:07:53,970 --> 00:08:04,200
that I can stream 128k 30 frames per

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:10,410
second over sockets to a browser and get

00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:12,500
full like real-time video stream and to

00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:15,570
a browser with a set of controls

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,690
actually a video that I took with my

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:23,790
phone at my computer of me driving this

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:25,410
thing around from my couch on the floor

00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,630
of my apartment and crashing into my

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:31,110
french bulldog who seemed to not care at

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:34,290
all and of course this is running

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,360
entirely independently on the Intel

00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:39,780
Edison board so the javascript is

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,599
running a node on the board so you just

00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,820
plug it in and wait for it to boot up

00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,670
and there it is it's a robot being

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:52,310
programmed by JavaScript running a node

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:56,010
that can also stream amazing video

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:59,250
beautifully over web / sockets to a

00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,930
browser and it allows for this control

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,660
interface that's just buttons in a

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,100
browser that allow me to you know click

00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,450
buttons like it's like a you know

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,580
command center control

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:12,360
ol center or whatever in my browser and

00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:15,990
drive it around completely remotely and

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:19,320
it's a lot of fun oh did I mention also

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:21,510
that it's completely like standalone

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,490
like how incredible is that so this has

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,700
been like a passion project of mine for

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:28,590
past couple of months right now I'm

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,880
struggling a little bit with supplying

00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:34,260
the right amount of power just to the

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,540
board everything else has the right

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,820
amount of power but the board i'm having

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,580
problems getting it right once i sort

00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:44,010
that out i will be really excited and of

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,350
course publish some kind of article on

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:49,650
the boku blog about how to build it

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:51,510
yourself and i guess i'm looking forward

00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:54,120
to when that day happens it might be a

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,030
couple maybe a couple months on from now

00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,640
but but yeah it's what's super cool

00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:02,880
about it to me is that it is all

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,250
JavaScript running on this board so it's

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,350
it's embedded JavaScript on an embedded

00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,210
device so i have a bad joke for you tell

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:13,500
me about Reggie say this bot does

00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:16,080
reconnaissance here's not uh I mean I'm

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,690
gonna thwart your joke yeah guess what

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,490
this robot is called what recon ball so

00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,860
it's really funny that recon bought was

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:26,870
holding your recon vine yeah absolutely

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,770
so I I named it after Francis yeah very

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,450
significant a really funny when Francis

00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,160
picked it up because it's Marie con

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,240
bought holding the Recon but the other

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,400
thing is for those of you who've never

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,220
adult with an Intel Edison what it is

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,500
it's a stamp-sized computer it's got

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,120
just hubli bluetooth all he built into

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,230
it or is it just know it's Wi-Fi it's

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,670
got Wi-Fi but let's undo it and it's

00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:46,670
stamp-sized and it's got several

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,960
different shields that you can put it on

00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,700
sparkfun has some shields that are

00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,320
actually really tiny and so you can

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,420
build what looks like a smart watch out

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,310
of an Intel Edison and an OLED and we

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,490
actually oh we do have a heart care oh

00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:01,410
yeah there you go so his the Edison is

00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:03,750
on a larger shield you could also get

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:07,160
shields like this that are and this is a

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:09,690
full computer right there pretty great

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:16,140
yes because it runs linux how much do

00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:18,180
they run okay modulo sorry he didn't

00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,100
make module itself is 50 bucks and then

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,600
the shields are anywhere from like 22 42

00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,310
what you get like the old LED ones like

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,470
about 40 because it got a little wet on

00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,110
it I asked it seems like maybe there

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,480
should be a cheaper single chip computer

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:34,019
that is a fantastic Segway indoor first

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,870
hey isn't that cool segment so our first

00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,040
hey isn't that cool segment is a I

00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,230
actually found out about this when I

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,790
asked Twitter hey what should we talk

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,569
about it no BOTS live this is called The

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:48,839
Onion Omega it is a nine dollar computer

00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:51,149
yeah yeah what exactly um it's got Wi-Fi

00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,579
it's Wi-Fi enabled you can install note

00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:55,410
on it it's it's not available yet they

00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:57,149
are currently still making it they have

00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:59,220
docs much that remind me a lot of like

00:11:57,149 --> 00:12:01,470
this marks the spark I Oh she'll do have

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,329
an Arduino shield doc so if you want to

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,220
use our do we know shields with it but

00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:07,380
yeah it's apparently nine dollars for

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,980
this little Omega onion and it's got

00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:13,050
Wi-Fi built-in and it's amazing how the

00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,480
price points are dropping on these Wi-Fi

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,690
enabled microcontrollers they're also

00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,509
happy to run JavaScript this is amazing

00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:23,160
we have one more demo well one more demo

00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:28,350
and then a small talk so we've got a

00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:30,569
video demo from Donovan of what is yes

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,009
this is donovan and you didn't explain

00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:34,380
the demo because it's seriously one of

00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:37,560
the coolest things i've i've ever seen

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:40,139
so about a year ago maybe it's been less

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,079
we added an animation library to Johnny

00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:45,480
Five which allows you to instead of just

00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:47,579
saying servo dot to to send a server to

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,310
a particular position you can script a

00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:54,180
servo over time think it's a lot like

00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:56,130
animating something in flash so you're

00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,800
able to set a servo to go to a certain

00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:01,079
position at a certain point in time and

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,209
you can set up as many cue points as you

00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,589
want and we support easing and different

00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:07,529
kinds of functions so that gives us the

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:10,050
ability to do pretty complex scripted

00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:11,490
movements with the robot that's how this

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,709
hexapoda it's not what you're saying

00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:16,110
here actually that's how the text apod

00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:18,000
walks is with these scripted movements

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,600
using the animation class but it's also

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,519
possible to override the the rendering

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,990
method that we use in in the animation

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,850
class when you override the rendering

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:28,620
method on a servo and we can apply a

00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:32,279
rendering method to an array of servos

00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,699
Johnny Five has a servos class and you

00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,939
can override the rendering math

00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:38,739
and pass it through an inverse

00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:41,230
kinematics solver that's what we're

00:13:38,739 --> 00:13:43,779
seeing here it's responding in real time

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,059
to my movements my hand movements over

00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:48,549
elite motion controller and it's solving

00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:50,980
the angles for each of the legs in real

00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:52,179
time and rendering that leg to the to

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,609
the proper position so that everything

00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:55,629
stays in the right place you know

00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:58,899
everything's in contact with the ground

00:13:55,629 --> 00:14:01,359
and that's going to be an add-on module

00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:03,429
for Johnny 5 called Tharp and it should

00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:04,899
be out hopefully in a week or so so what

00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:07,209
we're looking at here is that you

00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:09,009
controlling the hexapod with your hands

00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:10,329
that is me controlling the hexapod with

00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:13,149
my hand with a leap motion controller

00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:14,529
yes so funny story I remember when you

00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:17,049
first sent me this video I was at home

00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:19,209
and I was watching that and my sister

00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:22,029
was behind me and she immediately asked

00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:24,609
me that's CGI right she she oh she

00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:26,049
seriously thought that someone had CGI'd

00:14:24,609 --> 00:14:27,399
your hexapod in there because she's like

00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:30,220
wait he's controlling it with his hand

00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:32,290
I'm so scared right now and I said why

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,910
and she goes I could just imagine my new

00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,649
robot overlord like with a guy just

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:39,100
standing on a balcony doing this and

00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:40,660
robots to start attacking like one thing

00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,489
I've learned is that we don't really

00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:49,480
have much to fear because they fall down

00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:50,649
and break a lot that's comforting did

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,329
you tell us a bit about inverse

00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:56,289
kinematics and like what that does for

00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:59,319
you so I'm totally unqualified to talk

00:14:56,289 --> 00:15:01,829
about this but here goes kinematics is

00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:04,209
the you know the art I guess of finding

00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:05,529
the position of an end of the in

00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:07,269
defector being the part of the robot

00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,369
that interacts with the real world in my

00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:11,079
case it's it's the feet of the robot a

00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:13,749
lot of robots it's the hand the serial

00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:15,970
manipulator kind of thing but it's the

00:15:13,749 --> 00:15:17,799
the art of finding where forward

00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,319
kinematics is the art of finding where

00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:22,389
that in defector is in space given the

00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:25,389
length of all your joints and the angle

00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:26,949
I'm sorry the length of all your limbs

00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:29,379
and then the angles of each of the

00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:31,569
joints inverse kinematics is doing that

00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:33,669
in Reverse you're giving a point in 3d

00:15:31,569 --> 00:15:35,470
space and an origin point and you're

00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:37,269
solving all the angles and links that

00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,410
you need in order to get your foot where

00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,919
it needs to be or you're into vector

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,919
where it needs to be

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:48,490
something to add is that for every joint

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:50,640
you add to the chain the calculation

00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:54,100
becomes exponentially more complicated

00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:57,430
so you can imagine a hexapod with 18

00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:00,220
servos on board how so that's through

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:03,399
wait how many prim like I'm brain dead

00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:06,670
right now three per leg yeah so that's

00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:09,880
not trivial and as a reminder that's

00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:13,540
JavaScript from the top down it's

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:15,100
totally JavaScript totally Johnny 5 but

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,350
actually will have to solve three servos

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:22,450
we like to solve one leg at a time but

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:24,070
still it made my head hurt yeah but now

00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,720
everybody can do that well you know it

00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:27,550
takes a lot less math because of the

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,589
animation library and this is also a

00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:33,250
good segue into Johnny 5 has a new

00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:35,560
website at Johnny vaio it is no longer

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,930
just a wiki page we have nice styling

00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:39,370
this was developed at beaucoup not not

00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:42,459
that the wiki page wasn't awesome this

00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,980
is just awesome Merc so you can now look

00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:47,020
at the API documentation the other thing

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,760
that I worked on yesterday is if you

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,709
used at the dash documentation

00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,240
application the one that downloads all

00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,940
the doctors for you and shows have been

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,980
offered i launched yesterday a doc set

00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,510
for Johnny Five that is now in beta and

00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,610
so soon i'm going to actually get back

00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,230
tributed in the dash so that then no

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,000
more switching between browsers to like

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,100
write your court oh don't applaud me

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,030
applaud Donovan like that was that demo

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:16,110
is amazing um well so that is so our

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:18,220
next really cool topic yes sure uh just

00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:21,640
real quick note about the website all

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,620
the content on the web site comes from

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:26,140
the Johnny Five the existing Johnny Five

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:29,290
wiki and the existing Johnny Five repos

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:33,010
example programs so if you edit the wiki

00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:35,110
and like updated and improve it somehow

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,150
or whatever the next time i deploy the

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:39,309
site your changes just automatically are

00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,650
included with that you guys open source

00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:44,679
for the win right so if you also want to

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,450
write like new examples for for anything

00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,550
you're like oh this is some cool use

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,200
case that I came up with you can

00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,690
contribute that and it will be

00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,650
automatically included in the website on

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:56,910
the next deployment

00:17:53,650 --> 00:18:00,160
so your work for all to see and share

00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:02,620
which is like my favorite part about the

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,810
website so sorry you can move on now and

00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,430
if you're new to electronics this is one

00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,050
of the things I'm super proud of with

00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:09,820
Johnny photos documentation there are

00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:12,010
Fritzing diagrams for just about every

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:14,200
example in every API page so if you've

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,610
never done electronics before and you

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:17,050
need to know how to wire something or

00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,720
you're afraid you'll you know you don't

00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:21,760
know how Johnny Five docks are very very

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,860
good about having Fritzing diagram for

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,080
just about every example we write so

00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,600
that you can replicate our projects

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,810
fairly easily so our next really cool

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,240
topic / product is Bluetooth le is

00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:36,880
getting really easy to get a hold of and

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,520
it's get we have a node module that

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,040
makes Bluetooth le a lot easier to use

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,810
is called noble the maintainer is

00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,360
actually at the conference I don't know

00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:49,540
if he's here at the taping but Sandeep

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:51,940
is here at the conference and yeah it's

00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,490
really easy to use Bluetooth le and with

00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,920
with node now and one of the really cool

00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:59,920
products is a light blue beam which is

00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:03,150
pretty cool $30 little it's tiny it's

00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,890
it's a about actually about that big and

00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:08,200
so it's got bluetooth LE on it's got its

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:11,230
own battery which is pretty neat and it

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,600
wirelessly synced and you can use node

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:17,370
with it via Louie you actually wrote the

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:20,800
Bluetooth the Johnny Five plug-in right

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:23,470
there's a bean dash I Oh Johnny Five

00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,990
plugin so yeah if you put a specific

00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:29,170
fremada sketch on the beam and connect

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:31,450
to it with will have your bean io

00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,490
instance connect to that bean you're

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,840
doing Johnny Five on all the gpio is on

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,120
it and then the other way you can run

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,440
node is it does a sport no dread out of

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,630
the box which is a it's more of a

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,980
point-and-click programming language

00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:43,750
that will allow you to do stuff with it

00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,490
in the cloud so if you're dealing with

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,930
kids or people who are new to coding in

00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,150
general no bread is also a really good

00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:51,370
way to use that with it and Bluetooth

00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,900
modules that we can attach make we mean

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,520
we can have more wireless Johnny Five

00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,020
bots because you can do a serial port

00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,700
over Bluetooth just like you do with

00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,140
your USB cable and so if you have a

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,750
bluetooth module working either on your

00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:05,910
arduino or with a microcontroller you

00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,910
can have wireless no bots because and

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:13,590
yes so node blue and octo blue these

00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:17,190
flow designers they actually reach down

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:20,310
into a way of some sort or no dread

00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:24,570
itself and they can talk to to bluetooth

00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:26,340
sideways across in the local area an

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,650
interesting thing also about this

00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:31,440
awesomeness being all JavaScript that

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:34,070
that Rick wrote here with Johnny Five is

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,710
that we are able to do things like have

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:40,170
bean dash I Oh Johnny Five running on

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:42,570
say a tablet or a mobile phone because

00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:46,380
we could just shim may be using Cordova

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:48,600
the same noble libraries and then you

00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:50,340
can make a phone UI using Johnny Five

00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,870
code talking to a light blue clean

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,510
connecting to GP I was controlling

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:56,790
something like this and it's all just

00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:59,670
one set of JavaScript code from the

00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:01,290
Johnny Five API standpoint we've been

00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,000
really quiet so far so who likes

00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:06,540
javascript in here audience that has

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,790
been super quiet like it all right there

00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:11,490
we go there we go it's been really quiet

00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:14,480
in here today um so I just have a

00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:18,150
question though so can I do this today

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,680
you can do this today so there is it's

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,300
actually uh it was one of the things

00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,880
that octuple would put together they

00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:27,420
commissioned me to write a shim for

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:30,480
Cordova to do a to do a noble a noble

00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:32,370
shim for Cordova right so you you can I

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,130
actually have an example on the ice dev

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,860
blog of how to do that so you can use a

00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:39,510
beam from yeah from an Android and iOS

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,410
device whatever so that's a cool segue

00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,630
we were talk about stuff we could you

00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:45,240
today I want to use a node bot in my

00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:49,770
browser can I do that say that funny you

00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:52,170
ask yeah you can't so there's actually a

00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:54,570
few projects going on so in the

00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:58,110
education space you know Chromebooks are

00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:59,340
you know 150 bucks really cheap tablets

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:01,080
you know are getting really cheap so

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,000
we'd like to do all this stuff because

00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,310
it's written in javascript in in

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,380
browsers because you might not have the

00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,490
ability to easily install node on one of

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,550
these things that's really just running

00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:15,530
a browser so Pavel over there David

00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:18,600
everybody involved with the Robotnik

00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:23,850
application really cool this is browser

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:26,760
base it is blockley so using blocks to

00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:28,770
create johnny five objects and run those

00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,080
really awesome check that out on

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:34,740
Robotnik I believe it's on Pablo's repo

00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,660
on github also so what I said was doing

00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,880
we're taking approach of having Johnny

00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:43,950
Five code specifically and we've got a

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,900
an IDE called chrome bots we haven't we

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,429
had an early version we demoed at robots

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,530
comp it was it was really just a proof

00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:51,600
of concept Blaine over there has been

00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:53,940
putting a ton of work into this and it's

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,880
actually becoming a good IDE now in a

00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,950
browser for Johnny Five or for robotics

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,140
in general but with file management and

00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:03,090
and everything and so keep an eye on

00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,799
that because it's it's going to be

00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,080
really good no so we're getting to the

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,659
point now where someone could pick up an

00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,340
Arduino or a board and not even after

00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,860
install node they could just open Chrome

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,179
your Firefox or a browser right some

00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,860
JavaScript and controller robot

00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,970
absolutely you're getting and which

00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,650
really close you don't even need the

00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,539
Arduino IDE or command line or do we

00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,309
know anything because of work at Jacob

00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:27,299
Rosenthal may or may not be in here um

00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:29,909
that's done so that it actually will

00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:31,830
write be from autosketch so yeah grab

00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,299
Arduino plug it in and go I'll be great

00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,530
for the Johnny Five website that way

00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,520
like you wouldn't use Johnny Five with

00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,020
node you wouldn't have to install the

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,780
Arduino IDE we can just put a button on

00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:44,429
the website absolutely oh I see a pull

00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:47,039
request got work to do I just want to

00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:48,990
say about Robotnik last year at node

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,090
BOTS day which is july 25th this year so

00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,370
right last year at node BOTS day my son

00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:56,280
used Robotnik to build a pablo BOTS and

00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:58,710
get it running all by himself he's just

00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,120
he was 9 years old at the time no

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,130
scratch pretty well and the whole

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,169
interface is very much like scratch so

00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,090
if you have kids it's a great tool so

00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:07,409
that segues into our last two topics we

00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:10,919
only have a couple of a couple minutes

00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:12,510
left one is node BOTS day coming up in

00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,840
July 25th so it was kind of a cool segue

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:19,020
um who here has been to a node BOTS day

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,480
before in their City or anywhere ok cool

00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,820
this year I want all those hands to go

00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,370
up node BOTS day is an amazing event its

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:27,990
worldwide so basically check your home

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:30,240
city if there's not an event run one

00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:32,010
it's way easier than you think um so

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,429
well actually I got someone to do all

00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,840
the work

00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:36,419
for me in Austin so maybe I shouldn't

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,460
say that but it's so worth it um so

00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:39,830
anyway uh you should definitely

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,789
participate in nodebots day

00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:44,009
international event really great way

00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:46,919
even if you just to barely started doing

00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:48,119
no bots or are brand new to it a great

00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:50,179
way to go sir I think most of us have

00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:55,440
run a node wats the event at this table

00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:59,759
most yeah yukino did it one and yes yeah

00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,369
so the last topic i have is node bots

00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,769
live the podcast so this has been cool

00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:06,330
like doing it every six months on video

00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,009
chris williams has been super great

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,049
about letting us use track be to record

00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:13,019
a podcast which seemed really weird but

00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:15,480
it worked out i actually want to take

00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:18,330
this to a monthly podcast so i am

00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,070
starting a patreon to get funding

00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:22,139
because i do not have any podcast

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,879
equipment i do not have any editing

00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:26,549
experience and so i'm going to try to

00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:27,779
like get this going for y'all so check

00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:29,879
the note box live twitter if you're

00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:33,360
interested in helping out there will be

00:25:29,879 --> 00:25:35,039
a patreon up soon and we have a couple

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,909
more oh yeah we have like two or three

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:42,330
more minutes so what out one more really

00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:45,330
cool product that is coming out the

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:47,309
Esper e no pico is pretty cool if you

00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,720
haven't seen it yet so if you never the

00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:50,970
S Perino that's actually what's powering

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,409
this it's a controller that it doesn't

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:55,409
run note it runs like a modified version

00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:57,240
of java script but it's very simply

00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:58,470
writing it you don't really notice so

00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,019
much of a difference from javascript and

00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:03,960

00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:05,309

having trouble playing there we go this

00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:08,879
is about like like three quarters of

00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:11,399
this long at about half an inch wide and

00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:14,100
it fits in a USB socket and very

00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:15,539
interesting project so any other cool

00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:19,379
stuff that you all have thought of

00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:21,480
before we run well i just want to give a

00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:23,460
shout out to this team of developers a

00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,409
year ago I was sitting in the audience

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,269
thinking I would like to contribute the

00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:28,769
open source and I was nervous and scared

00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:29,850
about doing it and I got involved with

00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:32,070
Johnny Five and they have been

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:34,200
incredibly supportive and I have learned

00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:36,179
so much so much more than I ever would

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,740
have just doing my work every day it's

00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:39,899

00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,590
better developer so thank you guys all

00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,590
the field

00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:49,990
I I'd like to add it Donovan is also

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:53,350
like my right-hand man now on the Johnny

00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:55,090
Five project like code wise like I go to

00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,830
him for advice about every single thing

00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:00,280
like every major decision we have to

00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:01,780
make I seek his advice and also David

00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,650
Reza gay who is in the crowd as well

00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:07,990
these two have become sort of like my I

00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,520
don't know what you call it like I can't

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:11,920
run the project without them so it's

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,260
become less of an eye and definitely

00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:16,920
much more of a wii and it continues to

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:19,930
