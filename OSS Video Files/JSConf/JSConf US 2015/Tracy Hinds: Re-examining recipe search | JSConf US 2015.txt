Title: Tracy Hinds: Re-examining recipe search | JSConf US 2015
Publication date: 2015-06-17
Playlist: JSConf US 2015
Description: 
	I’m starvin’. I throw open my laptop, and search by what I've got in the house to minimize me running to the store. I'm craving a flavor, not necessarily a cuisine. Some southern food has its origins in West African food. How do recipe searches address this? How do we combine curation of good recipe content with better search to avoid having to build a recommendation engine? In this talk, we’ll take a look at the current state of web recipe discovery and how I naively tried to come up with an alternative with brute JavaScript force and graph-databasing; like baking a souffle for a dinner party and doing a no-fall dance before it comes out of the oven. Plan for the worst and be delighted when it doesn’t happen(or chuckle when it does)!

hi I'm Tracy I'm a web engineer at urban

00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:24,009
airship by day I'm also a conference

00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,470
organizer and self-confessed sugar fiend

00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:28,929
I've worn many hats and one of them

00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,640
being a baker also the conference

00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:33,900
organizer an addictions program

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,820
coordinator and a restaurant manager

00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:39,820
that is not an exhaustive list so

00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:43,150
because I love making whether it's via

00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,820
code or cookies I long considered

00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:48,579
culinary schools means to fulfillment so

00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,280
I know da nerd out on cooking and baking

00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:53,710
and recipes as much as I like to nerd

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,629
out on JavaScript and learning things

00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:59,890
very quickly and kind of taking notes on

00:00:55,629 --> 00:01:01,420
what I need to keep up on so in one of

00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,449
my younger fits of courage I was

00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,940
determined to run my own bakery and the

00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:09,280
idea of being able to take recipes I'd

00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,710
crafted to perfection over many years

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,830
and build a successful business was

00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:17,369
intoxicating in hindsight I could chalk

00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:25,660
this up to maybe being on a fairly

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:27,340
pervasive sugar high yeah so I've got

00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,500
this huge collection of recipes at this

00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,880
point and this this is something that I

00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,880
thought was absolutely beautiful this is

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,030
a collection of recipes from a pillsbury

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,030
used to be able to mail in for I believe

00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:43,179
it was a dollar that was back in the 50s

00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:46,869
and it's kind of incredible that you've

00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:48,520
got this this book that when you plow

00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:51,369
through it you can find these in vintage

00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,890
shops and flea markets they've got this

00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:57,789
you know handwritten notes all along the

00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:00,489
way and this is you know it's a

00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:02,860
beautiful way to collect collect recipes

00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:07,209
and collect memories but it's terrible

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:10,899
if you want to be able to search for it

00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:14,140
down the road if you lose a page if you

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:16,510
spill something on it so that's that's

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,610
kind of where I got started with this so

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,680
on any given night when I get finished

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,349
working I'm starving because I'm pretty

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,840
obsessed with food all the time and I'll

00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,580
throw up in my laptop and search

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,430
what I've got in the house and that's

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,280
just to minimize me running to the store

00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:34,980
so I'm craving a flavor not necessarily

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,810
a cuisine you know how does how does

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,910
recipe search address this every time I

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,370
would Google something one of my

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,440
favorite recipe search sites all recipes

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,989
it's sort of like they're giving me this

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,790
huge amount of information back and I

00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:49,769
don't want to have to plow through all

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,959
these recipes that have way too many

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,450
ingredients that I just don't care what

00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,420
I have to go by so you know how do we

00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:01,079
combine curation of good recipe content

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,130
with better search to avoid having to do

00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:04,049
something like build a recommendation

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,230
engine because I'm lazy and I don't want

00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:09,120
to see a thousand results so again once

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:15,030
you know in my prior life I was a baker

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:18,030
and I i love researching recipes i love

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,370
modifying them and I delight in the Y as

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,230
much as the how following the methods

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,959
repeating experiments seeing what I've

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,450
done wrong my methodology for making

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,030
something new begins with recipe

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,670
compilation in paper and digital formats

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,319
I read the comments lots and lots of

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:38,880
them this is one of the few times I

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,709
think it's a very unhappy and I find I

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,260
kind of find where cultural habits have

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,090
crept in I try and hone in on the recipe

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,450
for what I believe to be the most honest

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:50,250
to history and honest to my experiences

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,819
with baking and cooking already and then

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,790
I run with it so to do this where do you

00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:59,910
go books and magazine articles I've

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:02,400
hoarded over the years but this this

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,859
ended up in very recent years becoming a

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,160
sort of obsolete method for me I've

00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:11,130
moved quite a bit and in that I've

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,790
downsized and even prioritizing my

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:16,829
recipe books you can only box full of

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,660
professional culinary books around have

00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,310
a few flight of stairs so many times

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,220
before you realize like you just need to

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,229
digitize things and you know the other

00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:28,680
method that I use now more than ever is

00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:33,900
the internet so recipe search and that's

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,820
where we're at it turns out search is

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,139
done pretty well by this this place

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,439
called Google

00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:42,569
and I have my favorite sources and most

00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,779
of them have been revealed by that its

00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:48,029
food bloggers who can be trusted to have

00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:50,129
sort of my style of cooking they test

00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:52,169
recipes out they make comments about it

00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:54,210
they modify it they might even do a

00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:57,389
follow-up a year later on a project that

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,370
they'd already done and they accept

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:02,400
feedback for improvement which is

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:05,039
incredible those ones tend to be the

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,860
best recipes for me but you know again

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,650
how you find them Google and that's not

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,270
easy for discovery purposes you know I

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,939
can make arguments about curated web

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,800
with blog posts and writing verses

00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:19,979
something like social web which is what

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,110
i consider all recipes it's a super

00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:25,050
interesting rabbit hole that i would

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:30,449
love to do another project on but not

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:33,089
yet so from a Content perspective what's

00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:36,900
the current state of recipe search there

00:05:33,089 --> 00:05:41,909
are tons of recipe api's most of them

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:43,529
are paid and they provide really an

00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:46,050
insane amount of recipes but the idea is

00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:48,240
that you're wanting to provide that

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,339
information to something a project that

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,810
you're already building and I guess

00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:53,250
they're assuming that you're not going

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,819
to be making that many requests because

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,349
the price really adds up quickly then

00:05:56,819 --> 00:05:59,969
the question is like what do you do if

00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:01,500
the data that they're offering is is

00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:04,379
limited or they're not offering

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,139
something that you find really

00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:09,839
interesting and you want to include I

00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:13,310
wanted a cross-reference reviews I

00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:17,189
wanted ingredient lists types of food

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:20,899
timer preparation of cooking it's not

00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:22,860
that I think of all of these resources

00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:24,330
that have been provided to us even

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,610
something like all recipes which is I'm

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,860
really appreciative of and they've been

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,839
in existence for years I don't think

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,639
that they're broken it's that I want to

00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,839
play with the idea of another way and I

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,389
wanted more i wanted to be able to

00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:41,430
explore so again the bright side is I'm

00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:44,310
not pooh-poohing all recipe is there an

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,019
incredible website and I believe that

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:49,529
they were the most robust for collection

00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:50,760
and discovering it labels itself as a

00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:52,620
food focused social

00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,470
a website and I would say that that's

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,060
very on point what's been so interesting

00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,040
about all recipes over the years is that

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,640
as they've added features and even

00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,140
trying to clean up the UI the user added

00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,560
comments has still remained the most

00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:10,530
valuable piece of that website for me

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,510
and really across the internet it's it

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,610
helps me learn and helps me spot out

00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,080
when there's issues in a recipe you know

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,090
you'll look at something in the comments

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,280
for instance we'll have something like

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,740
this recipe had way too much baking soda

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,860
in it or I prefer less salt and they

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:27,630
even have user ratings on how helpful

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,790
these comments have been in the past and

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:34,070
how helpful these users have been in the

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:36,570
past with giving good comments and um I

00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,250
was sort of flabbergasted when i was

00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,810
working through this project and how

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,180
valuable that could be and sort of like

00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,070
how you can harness that you know it's

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,170
sort of like you've got I've got my mom

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,920
standing in the kitchen helping me and

00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:51,060
telling me not to use that much salt and

00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,580
you know blogs generally have lower

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,130
traffic most of the commenters are

00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,800
appreciating the art of food photography

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,900
and maybe the the beautiful descriptive

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,670
writing but they haven't tested the

00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:10,140
recipes so that's not really helpful and

00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:11,850
it's frustrating so it might seem like a

00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,020
silly question but what is a recipe when

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,450
it comes down to it like what are we

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,600
talking about when I'm talking about you

00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,580
know working on what this means and they

00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,500
can be you know essentially it's a

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,230
fairly standard formula of how to cook

00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,760
or bake something that you want they can

00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,560
be an experiment to try flavors you're

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,900
curious about they can be a family

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,599
legacy passed down and recreated from

00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,490
generation generation the nights I

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,990
chased my mom around the kitchen asking

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,050
questions to understand what's going

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,220
where and why you know those the kind of

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,800
things that you end up writing in the

00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,380
little corner notes there's a series

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,930
that I obsessed over for a little while

00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,270
called mind of a chef and it features a

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,700
few chefs celebrating cooking and travel

00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:56,340
history science all kind of wrapped up

00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,840
into this rich study of past heritage

00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,640
and the line it carries from the

00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,000
delicious food that they prepare and

00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:04,170
their world-class restaurants now chef

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,690
sean brock

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,389
of Charleston South Carolina and his

00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,399
famed restaurant husk I was known for

00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:13,680
his passion in sharing southern

00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,050
preservation techniques as well as

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,029
elevating generations old graham and

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,810
heirloom seeds he used in his own

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:23,880
kitchen he's converted many a skeptic

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,769
into appreciating southern food for more

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,019
than its sweet tea and it's greats in

00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:31,250
tracing the roots of the flavors he was

00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:34,110
so familiar with he traveled to Senegal

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,750
to explore the West African influences

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,070
on Southern cuisine there's a point

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,399
where he starts to notice this

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:44,310
remarkable familiarity in flavors and

00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:47,300
techniques such as gumbo broths and rice

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:50,430
dishes despite the vast geographical

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:57,510
differences in availability of similar

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:59,610
raw ingredients so you know like where

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,699
am I going with this you've got these

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:04,019
beautiful connections that you can find

00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:10,320
but how are you going to discover them

00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:12,480
and I was at a talk at Brooklyn Jas and

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,040
I got to see John Resig talk about this

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,839
awesome new thing that he's been working

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,459
on sort of branching off of an older

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,890
project he's been working on for years

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:22,769
and it was building an art history

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,240
database using computer vision with the

00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:26,640
Frick library and he had actually

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,990
announced that he upped his funding he

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,449
got more funding for this project it's

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:34,470
really exciting he showed how clear and

00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:39,870
concise the queries were for you know

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:43,170
being able to use neo4j in making these

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,130
connections with unattributed italian

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,220
artwork and i thought that that was

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:50,370
really incredible so you know it's sort

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,180
of like of all the technologies I could

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:56,069
use when it comes to trying to discover

00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:58,140
cool relationships in recipe search from

00:10:56,069 --> 00:11:01,500
ingredients to cuisine you know why not

00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,620
graph databases so common uses for graph

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,480
databases include geospatial problems

00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,829
recommendation engines network analysis

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,220
which is definitely a lot of social

00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:12,360
network type work and bioinformatics

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,519
anywhere that the relationship between

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,260
the data is as important as the data

00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,150
itself so what if you could see

00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,340
if there are any interesting histories

00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,350
or similarities you could surface by

00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,300
doing large scale comparisons of

00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:31,720
ingredients and cooking preparation

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:33,340
across millions of recipes so we're

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,290
going to dive into a little graph theory

00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,090
just so that we can make sure that

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:42,000
everyone's kind of grasping the concepts

00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:46,180
of where neo4j graph database takes you

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,520
so let's get started a graph theory at

00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,170
its core is the study of graphs in this

00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:53,440
case it's a mathematical structure used

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,880
to model relations between objects so

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,530
they can be slightly different from the

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,780
use of word graphs we might be familiar

00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:01,930
with but are a powerful way to visually

00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,730
represent relationships so here you know

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,660
we have graph for the initial concept of

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:09,940
my recipe exploration the fundamental

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:13,540
units that form a graph are nodes and

00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:17,230
relationships the nodes are here are

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:20,050
represented as the circles I indicates

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,390
ingredient are is indicative of recipe

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,730
and the dashed circles that I've got our

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,500
ingredients that don't actually are not

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,540
contained within these recipes so they

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:33,100
have no link to these other these other

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:35,830
nodes so a property graph is made up of

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,190
nodes relationships which are these

00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,140
edges these lines that are connecting

00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,870
and properties so nodes contain

00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,320
properties some great insight provided

00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:49,390
by online docs I thought it was great

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,120
was that you should think of these nodes

00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:55,330
as documents that store properties in

00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,370
the form of arbitrary key value pairs so

00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,680
the most common graph model application

00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:02,110
is is this and it's referred to as the

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,760
property graph model the keys are

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:07,270
strings and the values are arbitrary

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,310
data types I an neo4j both nodes and

00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,600
relationships can contain properties and

00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,710
that's not common across all graph

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,730
database types relationships can

00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,950
relationships connect and structure

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,870
notes getting a little excited there a

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:22,990
relationship always has a direction a

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,600
label a start node and a Ned node there

00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:28,510
are no dangling relationships together

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,250
relations a relationships direction and

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,059
label add semantic clarity to the

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,969
structuring of

00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:35,979
notes the ability to add properties to

00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:39,959
relationships is particularly useful for

00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:39,959
providing additional metadata for graph

00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:49,689
so cipher is the query language that we

00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:51,309
use in neo4j these primitives are all we

00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:53,919
need to create sophisticated and

00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:55,179
semantically rich models so far all of

00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:57,159
our models have been in the form of

00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:58,869
diagrams diagrams are great for

00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:01,119
describing grass outside of any

00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:03,069
technology context but when it comes to

00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:05,169
using a database you need some other

00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:08,709
mechanism for creating manipulating and

00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:11,939
querying data and cipher is it so I

00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:14,409
immediately appreciated how intuitive

00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:17,709
cipher was when it took advantage of

00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:20,469
ASCII art to represent graph patterns

00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:23,699
I'd still uses sequel like clauses and

00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:26,199
keywords such as like match where delete

00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:30,039
to combine these patterns and specify

00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:32,349
desired actions if you so choose so the

00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:34,749
first example with the node syntax is

00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:36,729
that cipher uses a pair of parentheses

00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:40,899
to indicate the nodes which is the

00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:43,749
ingredient a pair of dashes under my

00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:45,969
relationship syntax will represent an

00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:48,669
undirected relationship so there I've

00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:50,559
got a directed relationship laptop with

00:14:48,669 --> 00:14:52,419
the arrowhead at one point and you can

00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,929
end up having bracketed expressions as

00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:57,579
well to be used for details so combining

00:14:55,929 --> 00:15:02,409
the syntax for nodes and relationships

00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:04,899
we can express the patterns below so

00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:06,909
treating relationships the edges of the

00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:08,949
graph the connections as a first class

00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:12,159
object is the fundamental innovation of

00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:14,379
graph databases the database doesn't

00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,449
only just storm information about

00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:19,119
individual things it also stores those

00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:21,669
relationships between things and that

00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:24,219
capability makes it much easier to

00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:25,959
express sophisticated questions and get

00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:27,879
answers in a small fraction of the time

00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:29,949
it takes a traditional database those

00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:31,359
queries corner of those discoveries can

00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:33,789
stack on each other and end up giving

00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:35,349
you a much richer context the

00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:38,129
relationships in the database can

00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:41,409
express the nature of each connection a

00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:43,520
parent-child owns friend and capture any

00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:46,130
number a qualitative or quantitative

00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:49,430
facts about that relationship so waiting

00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,410
start and end date because of this you

00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,110
can write queries that are expressed

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,940
constraints I consider this exploratory

00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:58,460
modeling it's all in what you're

00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,140
interested in I can hop pass SI as a

00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:05,020
connection and very quickly be delighted

00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:08,270
we're disappointed with my results so

00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,920
small lessons I've learned so far I'd

00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:12,080
had a couple of recommendations and seen

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,230
some talks influencing what database

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,460
would be a good try so it turns out I

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,650
don't have a lot of friends that are

00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,300
attempting to mess around with graph

00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,680
databases right now so the

00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,110
recommendations weren't as strong as I

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,510
had hoped I initially wanted to use

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,180
level graph which is built off of

00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:32,120
leveldb and it has a great community of

00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,880
developers working on it but still what

00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,390
I considered fairly small group and when

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,040
I read the docs I found you know I

00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,290
looked at the docks and then I compared

00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,730
them to the other option I had been

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,660
recommended to and is also the most

00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:50,960
popular right now which is neo4j and

00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:54,230
that battle was quickly won by neo4j so

00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:57,320
it turned out that neo4j not only had a

00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:00,890
huge a wide breadth of developers who

00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,230
had written projects around it and had

00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:06,410
written posts on problems that they had

00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:09,320
it had a whole manual a manual of

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,390
documentation that included examples

00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,790
tutorials and links to other community

00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:16,459
projects so at that point it was for

00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:19,670
someone who was attempting to learn more

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:21,770
about databases by diving into graph

00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:25,850
theory and graph databases this was

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:27,650
extremely helpful so the next choice I

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,420
had to make and exploring this work was

00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,640
how the heck would I find a hardy

00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,560
collection of digitized recipes so

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,170
there's no library of congress for

00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:39,770
recipes nobody's really working at this

00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:42,890
point that i can tell on building an

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:46,550
archive that is open and there's no

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:49,600
central repository for baking yet so we

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:52,220
all make mistakes this is part of mine

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,130
and it's a bit silly how quickly it can

00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,049
pile up but I ended up choosing to

00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:00,049
attempt API

00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:03,049
a calls instead of the down and dirty

00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:04,759
job of web scraping the glorious amount

00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:08,419
of cooking that is spread across the the

00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:09,769
far reaches of the Internet so we're

00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:11,539
going to take a look at some of the API

00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:19,580
a response structures that I had

00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:24,080
examined as part of this so that's me

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:26,629
trying to get it all of my AP s so all

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,480
of these had a decent start for

00:18:26,629 --> 00:18:31,100
documentation they were nice to approach

00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,779
this first one that's going to be

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,960
scrolling why a buy for quite some time

00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:38,330
is big oven they're super developer

00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,509
friendly but they give me way too much

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:43,460
information the next 1 i've got is at a

00:18:41,509 --> 00:18:45,259
mom and edamame is a really great i

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,529
thought that there are design choices

00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:50,330
around the structures that they chose

00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:53,269
they were clear they made sense and it

00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,649
was a nice way to to approach getting at

00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:56,509
information without nesting it too

00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:59,149
deeply and it also didn't give me the

00:18:56,509 --> 00:19:01,220
entire kitchen sink like big oven did

00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:03,200
big oven tries to give you the

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,739
nutritional information for every single

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,690
ingredient as well and also tries to

00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:11,419
convert all of the weights to grams

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:16,309
regardless of whether you want it food

00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:19,039
to fork is another great API in terms of

00:19:16,309 --> 00:19:21,230
its accessibility it'll it's affordable

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:25,609
it's free for a lot a larger number of

00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:28,070
requests than the other AP is but it

00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:32,149
gives you no information I think that

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:35,690
there were maybe 12 12 properties it was

00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:37,399
just terrible so then I got to my my

00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:41,570
dream structure the structure that I

00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:44,570
wanted to see out of my project let's

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:49,399
still go like such a useless amount of

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:52,220
information to me so this is this is my

00:19:49,399 --> 00:19:56,600
dreamy dreamy structure of an API for

00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:58,879
normalizing these api calls so what I

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,619
ended up doing with this was trying to

00:19:58,879 --> 00:20:02,690
figure out what I wanted for now and

00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:05,049
what I wanted to build sort of future

00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,879
proof so I wouldn't have too many holes

00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:11,240
moving forward when i'm trying to make

00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:14,300
comparisons and i tried to

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,860
I tried to be kind with how I built out

00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,390
the structure so that I wouldn't have to

00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,670
do too much work and if other people

00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:23,660
wanted to use it as well they wouldn't

00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:25,940
either but there's still there's still

00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,800
work to be done and unfortunately none

00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:32,780
of the api's I was working with provided

00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:35,690
me with all of these things so the

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:39,200
ultimate goal of this stage one of this

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:41,809
project was to lock down the ingredient

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,870
to recipe relationships if I have a

00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:46,429
couple of vitamins in my pantry

00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:48,080
optimized for the recipes that will

00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:50,210
acquire the minimum amount of purchasing

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,690
when I stop by the grocery store after

00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:56,840
work for this one can give weight to the

00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,820
recipes and that are a perfect match but

00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,520
this might not be a very exciting recipe

00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:03,080
if I've put in five ingredients so my

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,780
exact research results is going to come

00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:11,540
up with something like pita flour oil

00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:14,179
salt yeast water that's not dinner so I

00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,890
need to do things like being able to

00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:18,170
expand the search maybe add a few more

00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,790
ingredients and add in matches such as

00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:22,790
something like a category for dinner or

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:27,530
a cuisine like southern food which makes

00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:31,400
for our far more delicious results so

00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:33,020
stage two of this project is still being

00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,450
implemented unfortunately so the

00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:38,630
limitations of the API is I chose over

00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:41,059
web scraping left me with too small of a

00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,730
data set around cuisine for me to be

00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:47,000
able to play with it and that also turns

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:48,920
into sort of a layer of the project that

00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,040
i would have to approach where i might

00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,960
have to take in large datasets and apply

00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:56,570
these tags manually go through and

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,190
actually label the cuisine and i don't

00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:01,520
know how scientific that would be or if

00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:03,020
there's some sort of a recipe science

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,679
body that would be angry with me for

00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:09,710
applying an inaccurate label of some

00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:11,900
sort so again this notion of being able

00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:13,640
to discover culinary connections between

00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,910
cultures could mean I could get to

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,770
explore the world through eating instead

00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:21,050
of sitting in a library poring over

00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,669
culinary history you know both are

00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,710
really interesting but i prefer food

00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:28,039
experiences that fire on more sense

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:30,380
owners so currently this project is all

00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:32,750
command line and neo4j interface which

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:35,299
is a gorgeous web admin by the way a

00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,580
bunch of fun to work with so what this

00:22:35,299 --> 00:22:39,110
project isn't is a business it's an

00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,299
exploration I'm not particularly

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,100
interested in starting my own company to

00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:46,010
compete against the likes of all recipe

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:48,529
yummly I've mentioned prior you know who

00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,059
have contributed to too much of what you

00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:52,340
can find on the internet nowadays like

00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:54,049
I'm very appreciative of that I am

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,279
interested in encourage these projects

00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:57,440
to rethink the way that they've

00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:01,460
approached the rich data that they have

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:05,090
at their fingertips so what this project

00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,980
will be moving forward first I need to

00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:08,330
open source it so it's currently a

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:15,200
private repo that will be turned over

00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:16,970
this week to that github URL and I think

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,919
I may end up having some NPM packages

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,330
out of that as well and then secondly

00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:22,549
we've got you know the web interface

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:27,440
that I was really excited to do but took

00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:31,850
second you know second place to diving

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:35,029
into these gnarly api api call issues so

00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:37,460
you can do fun things like throw a few

00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:40,429
ingredients into a box and it should

00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:43,669
just work you know let let me let my

00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:46,399
site do the hard work and provide you

00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:48,830
with some really neat discoveries on

00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:51,679
things that you would like to cook and

00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,390
then thirdly i want to convert to

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:58,460
scraping and that's going to be i

00:23:53,390 --> 00:24:00,409
imagine a very long project so i would

00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,440
argue that web scraping might end up

00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:06,340
giving me some legal trouble but the api

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,880
call is expensive and i'm not

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:13,850
particularly interested in giving anyone

00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,679
recipe api all of my money so they're

00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:18,649
still limited they still only have

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:22,520
hundreds of thousands of recipes which i

00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:25,130
find not enough and that's you know

00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,830
that's just focusing on my my previous

00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:30,230
regrets in the choices so you know let's

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,750
let's review we've learned a little bit

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:35,570
about graph theory and you know how

00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:38,269
nodes and relationships you know

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:40,929
coincide with recipes ingredients

00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:43,729
we've talked a little bit about neo4j

00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:45,889
we've got gaps in the current recipe

00:24:43,729 --> 00:24:49,999
discovery and how helpful documentation

00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:52,729
can be we've got an idea of approaching

00:24:49,999 --> 00:24:54,259
a kinder data structure and all of the

00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:56,119
mistakes that can go into building an

00:24:54,259 --> 00:25:00,979
idea that many people have already

00:24:56,119 --> 00:25:03,109
interrupted or attempted erupted in this

00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:05,269
is how I got to be a better program and

00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:06,619
you can too so there's a pervasive

00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:08,839
notion in in many programming

00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:10,879
communities that trying these sorts of

00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:13,639
things can be a waste of effort that

00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:16,009
they've already been done well or can be

00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:19,099
done better in another language while

00:25:16,009 --> 00:25:21,109
this might be true and that you know at

00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:24,259
the time of this discouraging whining

00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:26,209
when someone says that it's it's each

00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:28,129
person attempting you know these

00:25:26,209 --> 00:25:30,619
projects a bit out of their reach and

00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:32,149
potentially yours are you know they're

00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:35,539
forging a path that contribute in a much

00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:37,099
larger way in the future so practicing

00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:40,519
failure by taking bigger and bigger

00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:42,799
risks prepares you for eventual look at

00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:44,389
even more often endeavors I'd first

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,089
considered many of my choices in this

00:25:44,389 --> 00:25:49,909
project as failures experiencing failure

00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:51,859
is universal so you know we can we can

00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:53,269
go on that together I tried to start a

00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:54,829
bakery when I was younger and I had a

00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:57,079
long table an adventure and having to

00:25:54,829 --> 00:26:01,389
let that go I know I can start a bakery

00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:04,940
I can feel a little more there you go so

00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:06,109
why do you care sharing projects that

00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,759
help us explore and learn to be better

00:26:06,109 --> 00:26:09,889
programmers through the intersection of

00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,599
passions is a powerful means of

00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:14,149
including people from many facets of

00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,700
life and gather you know getting others

00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:19,129
to try it so you know do you like graph

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,529
theory I don't know I didn't know before

00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:23,479
this project how about being able to

00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:25,489
explore unique connections between

00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:27,889
ingredients or recipe cuisine yes like

00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:30,440
that's how I got here so I don't have a

00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:33,379
formal CS background I'm always reaching

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,200
for projects that will help push you

00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:38,119
know fill in these gaps for me I'd seen

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,559
some really cool grata graph database

00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:41,629
projects over the years but hadn't

00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:43,249
considered myself interested until I

00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:46,309
found this connection that was

00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:48,529
meaningful so you know if you do have a

00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:50,149
passion in this please come chat me up

00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:51,810
with resources you've been excited about

00:26:50,149 --> 00:26:55,740
I've got a long way to go

00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:57,780
and you know you wanna any way that you

00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,490
can help communicate data structures and

00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:03,030
algorithms better is a great thing to

00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:07,350
share so these are this is a very short

00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:09,570
list of the resources that that were

00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:13,680
available to me and why I approached

00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:18,420
this project in the first place and then

00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:21,290
most importantly I have to thank so many

00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:24,150
people so my co-workers at urban airship

00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:26,700
my past mentor Chris Dickinson has been

00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:29,910
a huge support Charlie Robbins nerded

00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,980
out with graph databases far too much

00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:35,790
