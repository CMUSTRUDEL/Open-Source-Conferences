hi everyone so again this is polymer the

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,539
future of web components a little bit

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,699
about myself I've been at comcast for

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,890
about eight years now this is my family

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,869
we got my wife Sondra in the middle my

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,500
son feel and then we also have to

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:34,739
international students Max and Abby

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,980
they're great so at my eight years at

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:42,120
comcast I've worked on Xfinity TV which

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,949
is bringing premium content onto the web

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,039
and I say premium content so HBO

00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:48,839
Showtime stars Cinemax we were the first

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,679
to actually allow you to watch that on

00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:52,289
the web because there's a lot of

00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,649
security that's involved and more than

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,210
that just getting permission from the

00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:00,089
HBO and Showtime to be able to do that

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,219
is a pain in the butt I've also made a

00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:03,899
TV grid twice you know you got to put

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,830
the twice in there once for xfinity TV

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,979
and once for X tv.com cast net which is

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,750
the future site of xfinity TV and I

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,820
currently work on Xfinity home for

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,200
comcast which is the security product

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,520
and we'll talk about that more towards

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,840
the end so quick survey how many people

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,480
in the audience raise your hand if

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,710
you've heard of web components before

00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:28,800
great how many people have used web

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:31,380
components okay how many people have

00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,910
heard of polymer probably because of the

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,800
talk you know how many people have used

00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:39,120
polymer okay quite a few so again my

00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,220
talk is polymer the future of web

00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,360
components and I italicized the word

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,310
future because in order to talk about

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,800
the future you first have to talk about

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,410
the past that's kind of like the rule so

00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:53,520
HTML was originally created by Sir Tim

00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:57,180
berners-lee in 1989 and yes that

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,250
searcher Tim berners-lee not al gore and

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,610
the original purpose for HTML was to

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,080
share research documents as quickly as

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,630
possible right they wanted to publish

00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,940
information to as many scientists and

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,120
get it out in the rest of the world as

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,030
soon as they could and it worked great

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,310
for that reason and for anybody who

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,370
didn't do the math 1989 that's 80s

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,050
themed the convention here that's over

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,420
25 years ago so if you were born in the

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,319
80s you are probably about 25 years old

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,079
or older

00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,150
this was the oldest screenshot that I

00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:33,480
could find online that was available for

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,969
commercial use and this was in 2004 this

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,579
photo and this shows Mozilla before it

00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:41,099
was Firefox going down memory lane and

00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:44,040
next door next to it is netscape

00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:47,340
navigator and if we look back at what

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,200
the web was like this is 11 years ago it

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,719
was very flat it was just sharing

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,209
information and it had links and simple

00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,780
images and just leave you more reference

00:02:54,209 --> 00:03:00,299
Java appeared in 1995 so that's like

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,689
five years later java's pretty old HTML

00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:05,250
is much older and if you look at the

00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:07,739
last couple years what we've been trying

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:12,299
to do with HTML is build rich Internet

00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:14,579
applications at comcast we've been

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:16,799
building xfinity TV like show this

00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:18,900
earlier today but this is a place that

00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,510
you can actually go online and view what

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,090
has been recorded on your set-top box so

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,859
we have this new x1 platform you record

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,480
a show you can go online you can

00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:29,819
actually view that show that you record

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,419
on your box on your web browser on your

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:35,400
android on your iOS on whatever device

00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:40,949
this is actual shows that are on my sec

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,269
top box mostly my wife's stuff so but

00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:44,340
you know what we want to do is we want

00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:46,290
to take a closer look at this and if we

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,310
look at the mark-up of this it's still

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:53,579
using HTML html5 tags sections your divs

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,989
you know everything is just divs and if

00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:57,150
we look a little closer this is what we

00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:59,479
call an ex TV poster or poster art and

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,549
it's just the picture of the show and

00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:04,949
there's a list item which describes the

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:07,019
carousel that's here and then we have a

00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:09,060
button the main image poster I believe

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,889
is the button so that you can click on

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,699
it and it zooms in and then you can

00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:16,199
watch it or you could click options and

00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:18,829
it's just using your HTML markup that

00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,719
was originally written for articles and

00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,460
the problem is like even with html5 the

00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:27,360
new tags that we got were headers

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,070
footers asides and it's still base for

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,110
like WordPress and publishing

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,199
information and not really for rich

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,789
Internet applications so this was a term

00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,830
divin itÃ­s which I've actually heard

00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:38,790
like five years ago actually maybe even

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,200
older than that

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,730
which is in order to solve things you

00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:46,380
just basically add more and more divs to

00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:48,030
the page and it gets confusing and the

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,760
question that we want to ask is what if

00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:54,120
we could change our markup to be X TV

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,100
carousel and we create an X TV poster

00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,840
and we just give it the program ID we

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:00,690
put the relevant information into there

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,400
and that would become our markup and

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,160
what you get is you get a lot simpler

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,560
markup easier to read through and you

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,210
get reuse you know rather than having L

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,700
eyes buttons divs and all this

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:16,110
additional markup it's much smaller

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,940
Dom's too and essentially you're

00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,470
creating building blocks you're creating

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,100
your own HTML markup that you can create

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:24,630
just a tangent whenever you do

00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,120
presentations you actually have to use

00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,740
commercially available pictures and I

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
had all these other photos in there and

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,320
I sent it to the review board and they

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,410
were like you can't use any of those

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,270
photos so my wife she's really great

00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:39,510
with a camera and we have these blocks

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:42,660
that my son uses now so we got to use

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:46,440
those and so this leads us into web

00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,330
components web components are they don't

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,740
really there's no spec for web

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,570
components is actually four different

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,780
specs that make up web components and

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,160
that's templates HTML imports shadow DOM

00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,430
and custom elements and we're going to

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,780
look into them each individually in

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,120
order to do that I have enlisted a

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,510
helper this is my son again I'm proud

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,610
father he's one he's really adorable

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,700
she's painting the bud at bedtime other

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,810
than bedtime he's the cutest thing ever

00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:16,560
so the first thing we want to look at is

00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:19,200
templates this is jsfiddle for anybody

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,590
who's not familiar with it you put HTML

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,940
here you put JavaScript here any CSS

00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:28,280
that you want here and this is the

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:31,650
output on the bottom right template tags

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:37,170
let you put mark up into the Dom which

00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:39,840
is parsed by the browser oh yeah so it's

00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:42,830
put into the browser wait I'm back in

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,570
full screen go back into full screen

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,760
it's put in the browser but the browser

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,140
parses it but ignores it so any image

00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,310
tags that you have in a template any

00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,780
script tags that you have in their

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,130
browser completely ignores it except

00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,020
it parses it so that it knows what the

00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,570
Dom content is and the only way to

00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:01,060
access it is through JavaScript so you

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,830
have to select the template you get the

00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,980
content from the template tag and then

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:11,889
you can put it into the DOM and when we

00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:13,180
do that we get a pitcher so that's

00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:15,940
templates and right now you're probably

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,980
thinking well that's great like what do

00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,900
you do with templates and it's just

00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,380
another building block that is really

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,210
not that awesome by itself but when you

00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:28,390
put all the specs together you get

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:32,710
something awesome from it so looking at

00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:34,570
HTML imports again by itself not that

00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,760
great but it's the same thing as like

00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:39,100
including a remote java script tag or a

00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,650
CSS tag you do the same thing with HTML

00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,000
you create an HTML file which just has

00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,820
this template tag in there that I

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,180
commented out and now I imported it I

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,669
can get that link tag I can find the

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,500
content in that link tag I can select it

00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:57,370
and I can put on the page the same way I

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,680
did before and leading into the next

00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,890
slide we're going to talk about in the

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,860
page here I have a style color red for

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:08,320
my h3 tags and the template tag has

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,360
color blue and when I imported this into

00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,950
the Dom the problem is that it overrode

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,919
the styles that I currently have on the

00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:17,140
page so this h3 tag should actually read

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,539
but since the template i got inserted

00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:23,490
into the dom it then read that style and

00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:28,360
applied it so it made it everything blue

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:33,310
beige this one which leads us into the

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:35,500
shadow Dom shadow Dom gives you the

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:38,370
ability to take an element on the page

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:42,130
such as this div tag select it and then

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:46,120
create a shadow root on that Dom element

00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:48,820
and the shadow root the shadow root is

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,500
basically its own little world inside of

00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,420
that Dom element that you can add

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,600
content into that shadow root and the

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,550
styles will not bleed out to the rest of

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,990
the page this is really great for

00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:04,020
reusing HTML snippets so here we see

00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:06,760
that the blue tag that was in that

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:16,000
template is applied just to this

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:18,400
tag and finally to bring it all together

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:27,640
we have custom elements this allows you

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:33,040
to create the Theo rocks HTML tag that

00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:36,070
better I'll leave make it super huge so

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,170
here what we did is we use the template

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,510
tag but we're going to create a custom

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,730
element in order to do that you call

00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:45,210
object.create with the HTML prototype

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:48,070
that's standard and then you get these

00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,890
created callbacks attached call backs

00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:53,920
detach callbacks and attribute change

00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:56,200
callbacks that's all part of the spec so

00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,130
as soon as this tag is read by the

00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,230
browser or on the dominant and yeah read

00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:06,250
by the browser it calls the created

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:08,500
callback which will create a shadow root

00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,740
for it and insert the template onto the

00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,660
page and now we have our markup here and

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,630
just to show you this working we can

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:19,420
take the Theo rocks tag we can put it on

00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:21,670
there multiple times Run it now we have

00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:28,600
an exact duplicate of the Theo rocks tag

00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:31,540
pretty cool so I actually have a couple

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,120
examples of this which is great to make

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,250
it a little bit more useful you know now

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,870
I'm going to do the Theo rocks tag I'm

00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:40,600
going to add a source attribute to it

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:43,660
and so what will happen now I think I'm

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,600
big enough right is on the created call

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,280
back I'm going to get the image tag I'm

00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,010
going to set the source equal to the

00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,480
attribute on the Theo rocks element and

00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,150
then I'm going to append it to the Dom

00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:00,400
so now for each Theo rocks I can have a

00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:01,840
different image on that tag yeah I

00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:09,910
really like to show off the oh he's a

00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:12,100
really cute helps a lot and lastly you

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:14,170
know this is just showing that custom

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,270
elements are just like any other HTML

00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:18,760
elements out there you can add

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,499
attributes to them you can put content

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,709
inside of the custom L

00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:27,729
moments and then any anything that you

00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:29,529
put inside of the tag is available in

00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:32,049
the template tag and you can select it

00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:35,799
using this content selector so this will

00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:37,959
actually look for the HTH to tag here

00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:40,329
and actually add it in in that specific

00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:42,419
spot and anything that's not selected

00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:47,049
will go to this fallback content tagged

00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:47,949
and this again is just showing the

00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:50,019
different stuff that you can do with

00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:52,589
custom elements as far as here's our h2

00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:55,779
will be put at the top my P tag will go

00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:57,819
down the bottom here and then the rest

00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:08,349
of the content that's not there goes

00:11:57,819 --> 00:12:11,919
down the bottom so that's awesome this

00:12:08,349 --> 00:12:13,749
was created by w3c specs Google's been

00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,999
pushing heavy for this Mozilla has been

00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:18,549
pushing for this I hope everybody likes

00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:21,489
so far what custom elements can do it's

00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:23,199
really great but now you're probably

00:12:21,489 --> 00:12:27,009
asking i thought this talk was about

00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:28,989
polymer and it is we've been using

00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:31,149
polymer project for the last eight

00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:34,479
months at comcast we're going to go into

00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:37,149
a little bit of what polymer is and I

00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:39,369
asked my coworker what is polymer and he

00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:42,699
he coined the phrase syntactic sugar

00:12:39,369 --> 00:12:44,709
basically on top of custom elements it's

00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:48,009
not really trademark but it was pretty

00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:51,999
cool and essentially it allows you to do

00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:55,269
the same thing just another tangent this

00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:57,669
was done in polymer point 5 6 not the

00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:59,439
latest point 8 and point 9 which you

00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:01,959
have to use a little bit of JavaScript

00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:04,029
to define the element but here we're

00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:07,209
going to do the same theorist AG create

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:09,879
a polymer element same template tag

00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:11,649
inside and now the browser just does it

00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,349
automatically this is what the polymer

00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:15,909
library is doing for us it makes it very

00:13:14,349 --> 00:13:21,549
easy to create custom elements with

00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:26,259
shadow routes automatically but it also

00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:28,720
gives us a lot more than this it gives

00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:31,389
us the ability to do data binding so

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,249
here I created an array of objects with

00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:34,120
just have a different source and a title

00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:41,020
tag

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:43,750
and we have a template repeat which will

00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,240
take the model the Theo array loop

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,630
through it and this is automatically

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,550
data bound to the source attribute and

00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:53,920
the title attribute is databound down

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:57,460
here so it will loop through the array

00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:04,920
and print them out one at a time with

00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:06,970
the information that I have here and the

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,850
other thing that you can do with the

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:13,810
polymer is interaction so here I

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:19,870
combined all the elements into one image

00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:25,000
and i set the model equal to just one

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:27,730
Theo here it is here's my polymer

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,210
element definition for Theo rocks and i

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:34,089
set the Theo to be data bound to one

00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,980
index of the array just the first one

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:38,260
and every time we click all it's doing

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,750
is updating what the model is pointed to

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,600
which since its data bound it's just

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:47,260
going to update the h3 tag here and the

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,630
image and every time you click it will

00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:52,540
switch the image just by switching the

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:56,110
index in the array which is pretty

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:58,300
simple and here's how you do one click

00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,410
handlers in polymer so you just tell it

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:04,300
on dash click or one dash tap or on dash

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:06,240
whatever event you want to handle what

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,250
function it should call to handle it and

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:13,500
then in the polymer element it will call

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,500
this on click function and execute it

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,310
and so this X TV carousel is definitely

00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:28,050
possible today with web components it's

00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:30,240
definitely something that we should be

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:34,320
doing because it's a lot easier to reuse

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,540
pieces and it gives us a lot of great

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,180
benefits when you can reuse markup in

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,430
HTML a lot of things that other

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:44,220
languages take for granted if you've

00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:45,840
been using Ruby or node you have package

00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,930
managers you could just download some

00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,150
code and rerun it sure we use JavaScript

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:53,010
and CSS all the time one thing that

00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,660
we're asked all the time at comcast is

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:57,000
hey I want to create a new carousel

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,250
right so you want to take carousel from

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,810
one site and put on another site and so

00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,940
the first thing we do as developers is

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,400
we go look for that carousel on that

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,470
other site we copy the JavaScript for it

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,390
and we look at the CSS we try to copy

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:10,590
some of the CSS then we look at the

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,300
markup and then we miss one of the

00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:15,870
markup and then it's like it's such a

00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:18,150
pain in the butt and the big piece here

00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,250
is the reusability right is that we can

00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:22,410
now take something like xdd carousel

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,030
drop it on another site and it will just

00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,360
work the exact same way as it does in

00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:29,070
the first site and it's great because

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,070
before there was no way to really

00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:34,830
repackage HTML Javascript and CSS all

00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:39,270
together you could do it one but not all

00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:41,820
three together and now there is and why

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:43,650
is this important so the main reason why

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,480
it's important that comcast is worried

00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,780
like I said I worked on the Xfinity home

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,030
project and we're building these pieces

00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,820
this is your arm ability in your home

00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:56,130
Xfinity home is a security system so if

00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,900
anybody has like Brinks home security or

00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:00,240
if anybody here has comcast home

00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,339
security you arm your house when you

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,630
leave it has door sensors which sets off

00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:09,810
an alarm home security system so what we

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,850
built is this is a polymer web component

00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:14,520
and we want to be able to take this web

00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:17,640
component and drop it onto another site

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,230
in the comcast sphere of websites so we

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,910
have xfinity com which is the main

00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,010
portal that a lot of our subscribers go

00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,390
to we want to be able to take the custom

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,829
elements that we built and just put it

00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,750
right into our website and allow our

00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,010
customers to use it so wouldn't it be

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,360
nice if you just went to the portal and

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,220
you can see whether your house is secure

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:37,169
what lights are on

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:41,669
and so that really leads us to rethink

00:17:37,169 --> 00:17:43,020
how we do web development and if we take

00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:45,350
a look at what Google's been doing

00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,179
anybody see their material design

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:51,059
they've been spending a lot of time

00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:52,440
thinking how do we make responsive web

00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:54,840
that looks the same on all different

00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,320
platforms and on iOS and Android and

00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,900
even like they're new in box replacement

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,970
for gmail has the same header that you

00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:06,360
see on your web as you see on your

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,679
mobile platform and its really great how

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,490
they're they're challenging to be able

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,970
to reuse components and at comcast we're

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:19,799
doing the same thing with Xfinity home

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:21,210
so here's my session timeout we'll see

00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:27,809
how many people are using Wi-Fi right

00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:29,309
now give that a second like I said we

00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:31,230
started this project about eight months

00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,789
ago I'm going to be more than happy to

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:34,140
talk to any bit about this after the

00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:37,590
talk if anybody wants to know more about

00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:40,559
this project every element on this page

00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:43,440
is a polymer element so if we just

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:48,419
inspect this it's kind of interesting to

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:51,080
rethink how we do web development when

00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:53,909
everything is a web component or a

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,620
polymer element so we have an X H over

00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:58,320
your tile arm and the great thing is we

00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,970
can write this once and if we wanted to

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,140
put it on another piece of the site we

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,210
could just do it we could just drop that

00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,500
tag in and it exists and you could use

00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:11,250
it in the same way that you could hear

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:13,980
so what we learned we really have to

00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:16,110
rethink how we do web development we had

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,580
a lot of interesting problems that we

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:20,429
had to solve starting this eight months

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,650
ago first thing is like what should be a

00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:26,669
web component when you build a whole

00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:29,159
site from scratch you're like okay each

00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:33,210
page is now a web component so when you

00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:34,940
click on overview that actually loads XH

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:38,940
page overview which is a web component

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:41,159
into XH app so this whole app is just X

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,840
a chap you can actually drop that tag on

00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,409
another page and it will render the same

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,409
way this does

00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,560
interesting we had a lot of

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,970
philosophical talks about what web

00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,740
components should be what shouldn't be

00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,390
there are other problems that you run

00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,760
into there's no native support for

00:19:54,390 --> 00:20:01,650
shadow Dom yet except in chrome and

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:03,210
opera firefox has somewhat native

00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,460
support for tour I think they're just

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,140
putting it in now but then there's all

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,450
kinds of bugs with like the host element

00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:12,270
and deep selector you're actually able

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:15,660
to set CSS styles to change what the

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,370
looks of web components are another

00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,560
problem we ran into was testing when we

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:22,290
first started this web component tester

00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,570
did not exist for the polymer library

00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,820
sweet yet so we were like how do you

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,890
test this we tried looking in selenium

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,870
and selenium didn't have any support for

00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,100
shadow Dom yet so we were trying to

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:37,500
click on elements and you just couldn't

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:39,450
access them a lot of fun including a

00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,340
JavaScript library was a big one moment

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:43,200
jsuis were not using required guess

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,640
everybody today just users required yes

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,980
and you're going to have a library just

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,320
import it and reuse everywhere with this

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,080
you actually have to take script tag you

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,480
put it in an HTML document that you HTML

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,490
import that document it gets loaded once

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,530
by the browser and it's in the global

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,770
window space so then it can be used by

00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:03,960
all web components yet another fun

00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:06,270
problem another problem we had was a

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,010
logger how do you have one function

00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:12,060
shared across all the web components

00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:14,040
that exist find interesting solutions

00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,540
for that and then the vulcanized build

00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,550
process also wasn't there when we

00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:19,530
started and that's just the ability to

00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:21,600
take all the web components and the HTML

00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,850
imports and it parses through all them

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,220
and build it into one package so our

00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:28,200
whole web site is now like 250 kilobytes

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,390
and you download one single file and

00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,920
that's the whole app it's a single page

00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:38,010
app there are a few limitations with

00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,770
using polymer it's IA 10 and above it

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,810
does not work in IE 9 which was fine for

00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:45,060
us because we use web sockets and 99

00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,170
does not natively support web sockets so

00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,800
we were happy with that that we didn't

00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:52,680
have to support IE 9 when we start it

00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,930
was 0 point 5 6 so our whole app is

00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,880
written in point 5 6 and since then

00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:58,440
their nail at point nine which is a

00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,800
complete rewrite that we're going to

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,830
have to

00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,380
to migrate over 2.9 because the API is a

00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:05,840
lot different but it's ten times faster

00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:10,080
or something like that which is great

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:12,690
and we had a lot of fun doing it so

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,070
that's it I think I'm out of time I'm

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:15,960
going to be around if anybody wants to

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:18,420
talk more in depth about polymer I hope

00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:20,540
you guys enjoyed everything and thank

00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,540
