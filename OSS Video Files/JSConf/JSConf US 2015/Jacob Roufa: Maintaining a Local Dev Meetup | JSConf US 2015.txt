Title: Jacob Roufa: Maintaining a Local Dev Meetup | JSConf US 2015
Publication date: 2015-06-17
Playlist: JSConf US 2015
Description: 
	What do you do when you only have a few regular attendees? Is your own schedule so crammed you can't sustainably present every topic every month? Do you still want a local user group? Some hard won experience from a local web developer meetup co-organizer. Or, how we kept the user group going and helped foster continued growth in attendance and participation.

I'd like to give a shout out to the jas

00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:21,009
kana organizers because this has been

00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:23,380
just an absolute dream I've had the time

00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:28,770
of my life and I've never felt this way

00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,770
before it's so true I owe it all to you

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,989
so hi I'm Jacob and I'm here to talk to

00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:37,000
you all about community about finding

00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:38,829
agency within your own communities and

00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,409
about maintaining a service-oriented

00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:43,030
mindset in your community I'm from

00:00:41,409 --> 00:00:44,860
Rockford Illinois for those of you who

00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,899
don't know Rockford is about an hour and

00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,890
a half west of Chicago which means that

00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:49,329
we're like an hour and a half from

00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,480
anything we're an hour and a half from

00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:56,260
Chicago Milwaukee Madison Quad Cities

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,440
and we're yeah it's an interesting place

00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,850
to be I've got a two-year-old so that's

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,559
a constant adventure in my life I'm a

00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,600
recent homeowner I do things outside of

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,539
the JavaScript community and the

00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,929
development community because yeah don't

00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:13,270
we all and I also happen to run a

00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:17,890
developer meetup group in rockford there

00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:21,099
are about 150 developers about half of

00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:25,720
those qualify under the general like web

00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:27,190
technologies umbrella so I can't really

00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,119
talk to you all about community without

00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:33,280
talking about my first community

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,619
pictured here is my mom and and and my

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,869
family on her 65th birthday we bought

00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:39,340
her 65 roses because it seems like the

00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:41,259
sort of extravagant thing that my father

00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,679
would have done he passed a couple of

00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:47,020
years ago and when I was younger he

00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:49,000
taught me all about being of service and

00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,110
doing small kindnesses for people

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,300
without expecting anything in return

00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,509
because that's just how we make our

00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:58,780
lives better we improve our situation by

00:01:55,509 --> 00:02:00,729
impressing on to it the the things that

00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,229
really make it great so think little

00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:03,489
things like holding doors for people and

00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:05,259
saying please and thank you like you

00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:08,379
wouldn't believe how much that improves

00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:09,759
your life right and that really that

00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:12,730
service-oriented mindset really

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,800
continues on today in doing things for

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,690
my mother when I was really young my

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,330
father I was raised Jewish and my father

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:21,219
taught me about in Judaism we had these

00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,980
principles these these laws of Sedaka

00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:25,240
which roughly translates to charity but

00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,040
it's really about more than that

00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,290
and there are there are eight different

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,680
levels but the the highest attainment is

00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:35,380
being able to serve somebody in order to

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,330
give them the tools that they need to

00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,100
continue on serving themselves making

00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,650
somebody self-reliant and so that's

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:45,580
really a principle that I've taken to

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,780
heart in everything that I do I can't

00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,830
really talk to you all about community

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,320
without talking about a community I

00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,210
spent 40 plus hours a week with I work

00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,670
for a small marketing agency called

00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:58,330
Quiet like communications or 20 people

00:02:54,670 --> 00:03:01,180
strong and four of us are Deb's and we

00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:07,540
build client websites for for food

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:09,970
industry or with for bida reset we work

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,860
in business-to-business within the food

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,360
industry mainly with like food

00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,570
ingredients manufacturers food equipment

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,180
manufacturers things like that and so

00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,100
the devs acquire light just like build

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,070
websites all day and it's pretty great

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:25,630
even though we build a product we're

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,030
still in a service-oriented industry

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,890
where the client really comes first as

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,770
you can see the place that I work really

00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,710
hires for culture we like to do fun

00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:39,940
things in addition to to really learning

00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:41,170
about our craft together I can't really

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,190
talk to you about community without

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,040
telling you a little bit about the

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,800
community that I live in I really try

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,110
and share my values about community in

00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,780
the place that I live and I try to do so

00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,360
in running a meet-up like I said there

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,030
are about 150 devs locally at our meetup

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,840
we get between 10 and 15 on a good night

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,460
so if any of you out there from the

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,350
meetup in a small town you know exactly

00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,820
what I'm talking about Rockford is an

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,310
interesting place it has a very proud

00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:10,510
past it was a furniture manufacturing

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,580
town and then an industrial

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,220
manufacturing town and then like a lot

00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,960
of nothing and then over the last few

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,150
decades there's been a lot of racial and

00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,549
class segregation which has just been

00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:24,100
expounded since the market collapsed in

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:28,510
2008 and as such people are really a

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:31,960
pathetic and its really like climbing a

00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,820
pill to get people to act I put the

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,320
slide up here taco bell Rockford's

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,810
number one Mexican restaurant a little

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,330
tongue-in-cheek because I really do love

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,050
the play

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:43,970
that I live and and it this is not

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,409
representative of the type of people

00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,599
that I try and surround myself with

00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:48,830
which is really like everybody I talked

00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:50,810
to because everybody's got an

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,310
interesting story to tell but with such

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,710
a social apathy it's really hard

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,090
sometimes it's like climbing uphill

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,969
pulling teeth to get people to do

00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,800
anything but I'm really here to talk

00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:03,620
about developers developers developers

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:10,129
developers developers developers

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:12,409
developers you guys you all so that

00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:13,610
being said how many meetup order

00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:17,000
organizers do we have in the audience

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:19,340
just so I can get a awesome people

00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,190
sitting next to meetup organizers turn

00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,849
to them and thank them because they do

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:28,490
wonderful things for you I also have to

00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:30,139
give a shout-out to the ongoing Twitter

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,909
battle between two people whose names I

00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:34,870
have totally forgotten that has resulted

00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:37,069
in a karaoke kamikaze karaoke

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,110
competition between meetup organizers

00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:42,379
that was fantastic I'm glad I didn't go

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:44,900
last night so I have a voice today right

00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:46,729
here pictured is my co organizer Michael

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,250
Hopkins he also happens to be a

00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:50,900
co-worker of mine you can follow him on

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,860
Twitter here and totally surprised them

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,870
because I didn't tell him his Twitter

00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,759
handle was going in this talk he's

00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,289
really my better half and if any of you

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,199
have a co-organizer you know exactly

00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:04,370
what I'm talking about so really what's

00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:07,129
what's a meetup really you all are at

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:11,419
jas conf you should know this a meetup

00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:12,889
is for me a place that I can have an

00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:14,930
outlet professionally because when I

00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:16,729
talk to my nan dev friends about what I

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,099
do it's like talking to a brick wall

00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:20,210
when I talk to other developers they

00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:22,159
understand exactly what I'm talking

00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,629
about i said--that's script hung and it

00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:25,069
kept me there until seven o'clock and

00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:27,830
i'm just i really want to break

00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:30,080
something right now you all know exactly

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,400
what that's like I meet up for me is a

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,050
place where I can go and I can learn

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,789
things from other people that know cool

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,259
stuff and hopefully integrate that into

00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:38,029
my workflow and its place where I can

00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:40,930
share some of the things that I've

00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:45,289
learned throughout throughout my time

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:48,259
programming but what makes a good meet

00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:51,740
up I would say that it's about the users

00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:53,000
period on any of you are a fan of

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,330
attire and art you might already know

00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,610
jen jen Schiffer brings communities of

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,590
art and code together in a really

00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,590
wonderful way and a couple weeks ago was

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:06,979
talking about our code being really

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,720
ephemeral and the the thing that's

00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:11,000
important in a developer community is

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,370
the people not the code the code just

00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,440
doesn't matter so I would say success is

00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:17,240
really in the eye of the beholder if you

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,509
have happy people at your meetup you're

00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:24,250
going to have a healthy meet up so to

00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:24,250
that end or your users staying engaged

00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:32,240
that is really what matters most so

00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,449
where do I fit in all of this how did I

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,580
come to to run a meetup and try and

00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:39,770
organize communities when I was a kid I

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,569
read a lot of sci-fi and I dreamed of

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,580
these these gorgeous places these

00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:46,340
utopians cities where everything was

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:50,840
beautiful and like everybody had a place

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:53,750
and it was all great and then I grew up

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:58,669
I realized that maybe my expectations

00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:02,240
were a bit unrealistic overinflated and

00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:04,340
the takeaway from this is that just

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,620
because not everybody doesn't abide by

00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,570
these same utopian ideals doesn't mean

00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:13,370
that I can't try and bring some of that

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:15,440
to my day-to-day life when I was younger

00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,180
I played a lot of music and in playing

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,219
music I learned a lot about patience for

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,259
others because everybody learns at a

00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:23,270
different pace and everybody does things

00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:25,280
slightly differently and just because

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,509
it's a little bit different some a

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,159
little bit slower some a little bit

00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,830
faster that doesn't make it bad that

00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:32,899
makes it you know full of personality

00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,250
right which is what we seek out of our

00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:36,579
communities if everybody were the same

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,810
it'd be no fun I learned a lot about

00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:40,190
collaboration when I played music

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:42,589
because I played in ensembles and

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,360
orchestras I played with my peers from

00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:46,820
the time I was like knee high to a duck

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,829
until I graduated high school if any of

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,329
you out there are musicians or other

00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:52,100
collaborative other otherwise

00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:54,220
collaborative artists I hope all of you

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,870
now that you've seen Steve Kenny's talk

00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,570
you can really appreciate where I'm

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:02,420
coming from here some of you might say

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,250
it's a little bit low-tech but I I would

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,400
submit that most of the communities that

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,650
were a part of our not

00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,020
focused so this is really important

00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,540
everywhere all of the communities that

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,640
were part of from our families to the

00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,890
people we might ride the bus with or

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,630
share a car with to our co-workers

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:21,990
regardless of whether they're Deb's are

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,460
not communication community patients for

00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:27,360
others being of service to others these

00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:29,250
are important things everywhere when I

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,500
got out of high school I moved to

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:33,000
Chicago and I started working for this

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:38,700
company called the Chicago technology

00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:41,160
cooperative and I learned how to build

00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:44,010
websites for our clients which were

00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:47,250
typically nonprofit organizations one of

00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:51,150
my mentors that I met here by the name

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:54,270
of David EADS he also helped found a

00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:55,500
place called free geek Chicago if any of

00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,150
you are familiar with the free geek

00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,660
organization I heard I yes over there

00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,950
it's a fantastic place and free geek

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,400
Chicago is an autonomous organization

00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:07,140
that takes its structure from what they

00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,910
call the mothership free deke Portland

00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,650
which was the original foundational

00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:13,200
place but it's a place where everybody

00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,640
can go and they can learn how to tear

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,750
apart a computer how to rebuild a

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,730
computer how to install some software

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,230
and it's a really empowering place

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,610
because it really serves a need in the

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,680
community there's a lot of people out

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,110
there who just can't afford a computer

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,090
and so if they can go to this place and

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,030
they can learn not just about computers

00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,760
but about computing in a much larger

00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:36,270
sense it's it's really an opportunity

00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,130
for them and after I think it is now 25

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:41,040
hours of service to this organization

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:43,950
they get to leave with a computer so how

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,040
cool this at while I was there I learned

00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:50,040
a lot about open source software and

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,250
some of these open source ideals that I

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,050
think we all tend to take for granted I

00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,790
read this book called the cathedral and

00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:58,590
the bazaar if some of you haven't read

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:02,040
it you really should because it's

00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:04,670
incredible it tells the story of how

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,260
traditional software development kind of

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,730
birthed the open source movement that's

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,560
written by a man named eric raymond

00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,710
who's a self-described open-source

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,600
historian and in it eric says that open

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,880
source development breaks this bind

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,170
talking about the traditional roles that

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,910
people inhabit and software

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,899
making it easier for tester and

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,790
developer to develop a shared

00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:27,209
representation to communicate

00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:29,550
effectively about it this quote talks

00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:32,339
about open source development but it's

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,589
relevant in to communication models in

00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:36,540
all communities so to this i would say

00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:38,310
break down your pre defined role

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,380
definitions and serve in the capacity

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,389
that you decide if you want to teach

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,339
something teach something if you want to

00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:46,110
learn something learn something if you

00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:49,350
want to participate participate in

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,490
whatever way it fits you best and do it

00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:55,440
to the best of your ability because

00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:57,589
that's really where you shine so given

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,899
what you know about my background I

00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:04,110
would say now that meetups are a

00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:06,899
wonderful way to learn meetups are an

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,250
opportunity to teach and meetups are a

00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:15,680
chance to become a better version of

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:18,029
ourselves a wonderful way to learn an

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,930
opportunity to teach and a chance to

00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:22,709
become a better version of ourselves

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:26,029
think about that sounds a lot like open

00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:32,550
source but you know in the meat space

00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:34,079
it's pretty cool so you know learning we

00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,240
hope that's what the takeaway is every

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,519
time I go to a meetup I leave with

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,680
something new and that inspires me to

00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,750
continue going to the meetups because I

00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,079
learned something and it's cool and I

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:48,269
get to integrate that into my life

00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:50,579
meetups for teaching just because

00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:52,170
there's somebody talking about something

00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:54,149
at a meetup and that's like the focus of

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:57,000
the meetup doesn't mean that you can't

00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:59,910
teach something even as somebody that is

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,110
just there participating because when

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,839
you're sitting at the table and you're

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,699
having a conversation with somebody

00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:08,250
whether it's about the topic of the

00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:09,870
meetup that night or it's about you know

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,670
whatever chances are you're teaching

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,769
them something and chances are they're

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,240
learning something from you so i would

00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:17,569
say that teaching is really about being

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:22,110
involved and about having a conversation

00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:24,060
and who feels better after me up I know

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,390
like when I leave a meetup I'm just

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,570
jazzed about like everything

00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,070
and similarly with conferences like

00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:32,800
there's this like great feeling after a

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:37,190
conference when you're like yeah

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:38,810
javascript all the things and and then

00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,070
you go back to reality but that doesn't

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:43,460
mean that you didn't take something away

00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,840
from it and hopefully start to do

00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,070
something you know maybe a little bit

00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,050
different do something that you haven't

00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:49,430
done before try something out and you

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,980
know just have fun with what you do

00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:53,690
because it's what you do I think that

00:13:51,980 --> 00:14:02,050
self-improvement is really intrinsically

00:13:53,690 --> 00:14:05,540
motivating so what do you do every day

00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:08,680
sit on Stack Overflow you consult the

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,880
docs of MTN you google a lot of stuff

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,590
hopefully you're on IRC doing more than

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:16,130
just lurking I'm totally guilty of that

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:18,470
I could make an entire presentation like

00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,120
way more than 30 minutes with the list

00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,850
of resources that we have available to

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,160
us on line through this technology that

00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:27,590
we've created the list really goes on on

00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,690
and on but wouldn't you rather talk

00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:32,180
about it in person when you rather hear

00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:35,420
how somebody used a certain tool then oh

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,650
hey that tool exists i would say that

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:39,320
our colleagues are a most valuable

00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:40,820
resource and their experience is the

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:45,050
most important thing that they have to

00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:47,180
offer so remember before how we talked

00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:52,490
about user engagement what did your

00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:55,160
users need when I so I moved away from

00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:57,620
Rockford for a little bit and then I

00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,600
moved back about three years ago three

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,870
and a half years ago and I started going

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,750
to meet up in the area and at the time

00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:08,480
we had a PHP meet up we had a javascript

00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:10,160
meetup there was a dotnet meet up Coco

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,960
me too but linux meet up and I tried to

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,460
get to as many of those as possible but

00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,250
I'm really going to focus on PHP and

00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,840
JavaScript because that's what I use so

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,640
I went to these PHP and javascript

00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,500
meetup sand and they were struggling a

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:24,560
little bit because in a town as you can

00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:26,870
imagine with 150 developers or so and

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,630
like half of them use web technologies

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:32,450
that's a pool of about 70 people to try

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:34,700
and drag out every month and not

00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,290
everybody has the time to do that and at

00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,960
the time that I was starting to attend

00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,259
meetups in the Rockford area the PHP

00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,989
group was really lagging behind

00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:45,269
the organizer had gotten really busy

00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:47,429
with work and had moved out of town and

00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:49,290
really kind of just like left it up in

00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:50,939
the air and there were maybe three to

00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,309
five people in average attendance and

00:15:50,939 --> 00:15:54,569
the JavaScript group well JavaScript a

00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:57,119
scary thing that some people i don't

00:15:54,569 --> 00:16:00,059
know why but it was similarly poorly

00:15:57,119 --> 00:16:01,919
attended and at the javascript group we

00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,299
happened to have this this wonderful

00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,220
personality i don't know if any of you

00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:08,699
know Cory Frank you should also follow

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,679
him Cory is the kind of person that can

00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:12,779
can like riff off the cuff about like

00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,669
anything javascript and it will sound

00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:16,889
interesting and cool and it will be

00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:19,769
engaging and and then Corey moved away

00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:23,429
and so similarly the JavaScript group

00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:25,199
was left without a leader and so Michael

00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:28,589
my co-organizer who I showed earlier and

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:30,269
myself we kind of took on these two

00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:32,669
groups and we decided that hey we really

00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:35,369
needed to combine our focus and our

00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:39,089
efforts because we would better serve

00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:44,639
our community if we had more resources

00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:46,679
at our disposal ie each other so meetups

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,499
are really about doing what's best for

00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:52,079
your community it's about sharing

00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:54,989
interest you know there are overlaps in

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,759
all programming technologies and you

00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:58,079
know just because a JavaScript

00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,419
conference doesn't mean I can't talk

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,829
about you know PHP or net or whatever

00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:04,919
I've talked to so many of you who use

00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:09,480
these technologies meetups are about

00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:11,789
professional networking and support so

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:16,409
now that we've qualified a meet-up how

00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:17,819
do we run one so remember when I was

00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:20,209
talking about my co-organizer I keep

00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,769
mentioning my co-organizer this guy

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:24,629
share the load if you can another

00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:26,970
perspective and another set of hands can

00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:28,769
really help a lot of meetup organizers I

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,870
talked to actually have anywhere from

00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:33,629
three to five people that kind of take

00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:36,210
up this mantle of bringing good meetup

00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:37,950
content to the area and the more people

00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,139
you have the more you can share the load

00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,419
and the more consistent your meetup will

00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:46,919
be as a result and people love

00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:48,779
consistency to run a meetup you need a

00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,399
code of conduct you all had better know

00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:51,910
what this is because you agreed to one

00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:56,900
in attending today

00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:59,930
so in talking with David EADS a mentor

00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:03,290
that I had mentioned before so when he

00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,940
was organizing freak Chicago for a while

00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:07,730
they ran without a code of conduct and

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,620
there were situations in which people

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:12,710
felt unsafe and they decided that they

00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,990
couldn't come back because they just

00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:18,530
didn't have any guarantees that they

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:20,180
would be safe there so I'm code of

00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,550
conduct is really about solving that

00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,400
problem it's about defining harassment

00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:28,430
explicitly and defining consequences for

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,110
harassment explicitly because people are

00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,420
going to be people and not everybody

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,520
knows how to act right after

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,350
implementing a code of conduct at free

00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,810
geek Chicago there were many many more

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:41,330
situations obviously we're personalities

00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:43,970
conflicted and and people were able to

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:47,360
learn how to act properly among each

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:49,490
other and maintain their presence in

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,840
that space because again even if

00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,640
somebody doesn't know how to act right

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,380
doesn't mean they don't have something

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,280
valuable to contribute so we really want

00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:01,010
to avoid that problem and really nobody

00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:04,760
is above reproach so these things this

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:08,750
is a really necessary thing to lead a

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:11,360
meet-up you need space no this kind of

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,130
space you need a table and chairs you

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,900
need hopefully a projector if you've got

00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:17,570
more than a couple people to be able to

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:21,650
share what you're talking about you know

00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:23,300
some pizza really helps personally we

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:27,110
have a space that's sponsored by a

00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:29,360
business that some of our attendees are

00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,620
a part of and that's wonderful if you

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,420
can get a business to sponsor your

00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,950
meetup most businesses have conference

00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,720
rooms with things like a table and

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,040
chairs and projectors and some of them

00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:40,400
might even be willing to sponsor some

00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,470
pizza if you don't have an opportunity

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,020
for that i would suggest contacting

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:46,820
local universities or colleges if you

00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,560
have any nearby because they love

00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,930
learning opportunities that's what's

00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,530
there about right and chances are

00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:57,590
they'll give you plenty of free advice

00:19:54,530 --> 00:20:01,040
and they will spread your name like

00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:02,480
wildfire and hopefully with you know

00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,440
students attending universities and

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,990
colleges you'll get a couple more people

00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,930
also I would say that if you're small

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:12,900
enough coffee shop or a brewery or

00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:15,270
whatever happens to work go with that

00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,860
because you do need a space but as you

00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:20,220
grow you will notice that you will need

00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:24,300
a more defined intentional space for

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:26,100
this I would say you also need internet

00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,810
I mean how many times have you gone to a

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,580
conference or a meetup and the internet

00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,870
is just crap and you notice it right

00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,010
away it's the first thing you notice

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,970
because you pull out your laptops or

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:38,640
your phone you're like what but when it

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:43,170
works it works and it's great so have

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:46,740
internet at your meetup I would say that

00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:48,570
you need some tools specifically shared

00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,860
calendars and documents are wonderful

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,820
you know when you're running a meet-up

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,440
and you're trying to have some

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,500
consistency it's nice to schedule things

00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:57,030
out maybe if you're you know writing a

00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,780
code of conduct it's nice to be able to

00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:02,640
collaborate on that you also should

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,290
probably use some social media we build

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,910
these tools where we can type something

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,710
in or take a picture or whatever and

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:10,860
blast it out to hundreds and thousands

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,930
of people and you know so use that to

00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,610
your advantage don't be afraid to go old

00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,690
school though because email lists are

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,840
something that a lot of people

00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:20,070
appreciate I know when I say okay I'm

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,660
going to go to this meetup I appreciate

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,910
getting an email with the ical

00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,980
attachment and like putting it on my

00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:28,550
calendar then it's everywhere so don't

00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:31,380
discount the older technologies

00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:33,180
personally we use meetup com because

00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,360
again it's a business sponsored solution

00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:39,290
it's free to a certain point but the the

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,550
paid version does extra stuff I think

00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:44,580
it's by no means an end-all be-all

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:47,280
solution but it does a lot of these

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,680
things pretty well and it works for me

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,750
so take that with a grain of salt there

00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,850
might be some potential detractors like

00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,010
I've heard things heard some negativity

00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,720
about recruiters finding out about

00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:59,010
meetups and then coming to like suck the

00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,300
life out of your meetup because they

00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,400
don't really recruiters don't really

00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,190
seek to contribute they just want to

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,720
pull resource right and you ideally

00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,720
don't want that at your meetup

00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:17,840
so in keeping it going remember to focus

00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:20,420
on your users it's all about the users

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,070
all the time if you're serving your

00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,750
users if you're engaging your users if

00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,190
you're keeping them happy they will keep

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:29,240
coming back they will bring people back

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:32,120
and your meetup will grow and don't be

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,190
afraid to do something different our

00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,890
industry is no stranger to this concept

00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:39,020
of pivoting some of us in like the most

00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:40,730
radical obscene ways and this is really

00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,080
about a tactic for topics not the

00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:46,640
entirety of a meetup I wouldn't suggest

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:51,230
pivoting from like JavaScript to fortran

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,970
you know it might not work but for a

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:54,680
while Michael and I were coming up with

00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:57,170
after we had combined efforts we were

00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,300
coming up with topics and after a couple

00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,070
months that gets exhausting it's really

00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,470
difficult to come up with content month

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,210
after month after month and that's not

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,070
to say that we hadn't accomplished

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,960
anything that month but you know we're

00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:11,360
busy people we have lives outside of

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,230
this text stuff and we want to be able

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,690
to participate in them so we started

00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,210
doing these geek dinners and it was

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,470
fantastic for a little while because

00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,090
everybody was like hey let's go to this

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,530
brewery and we'll eat some good food and

00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,020
drink some good beer and it'll be like

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:28,490
great it'll be awesome and then like

00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:31,040
after a few months of that we kind of

00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:33,710
got in a rut and realized that it wasn't

00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,890
working so don't do that maybe like once

00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:39,050
a year twice at max but I would schedule

00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:41,630
it separately from the traditional

00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:43,160
meetup format because people don't want

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,750
to go to a meetup to just like go to

00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,250
dinner with a bunch of people like it's

00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:50,480
cool to talk shop every once in a while

00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:53,240
but people really crave new things at

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,160
amita people really crave ideas and when

00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,250
you're talking about technology in

00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:02,060
specific ways those ideas tend to flow

00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:04,850
so I think our last geek dinner was like

00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,680
three people showed up it was abysmal it

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,140
was really terrible and and this was

00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,750
after we had gone through all the effort

00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,090
of you know combining our two meet ups

00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,430
to to this Rockford web devs thing and

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,780
we were starting to reengage people and

00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,240
it was going really well and it felt

00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,770
like we had fallen off of a cliff excuse

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,620
me

00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:26,510
so then we decided that we were going to

00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:29,240
build something collaboratively as a

00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:32,480
group we put it up on github it's at

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:36,890
github com / Rockford web / paste bin

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:40,520
too I think they wanted to name it v7

00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:42,890
underscore final dash dash but you know

00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,810
that fell through so over the course of

00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:47,390
like six or seven months we

00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:51,080
collaboratively built a paste bin clone

00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:53,180
and we basically just went to the group

00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,460
and every other month Michael and I

00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,200
would switch off coding while we

00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,150
solicited input from everybody we're

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,190
like so we want to build this thing what

00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:02,780
would be the first step and we like went

00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,510
through this whole creative process

00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,520
together taking input so that everybody

00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:09,950
felt like they had something to offer

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,680
they felt like they were engaged by this

00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,990
process and they really contributed some

00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,900
of them even contributed after hours and

00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:20,680
like made commits to the github which

00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:23,270
was great you know that's what it's for

00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,640
so through this project we've

00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:28,490
essentially tripled our engagement for

00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:32,420
us that means we're up to a steady 12 to

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:34,100
15 on a good night like 20-25 but when

00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,870
you think about that in terms of the

00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,830
overall community size talking about a

00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:41,720
pool of like 70 web technologies

00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:44,620
developers you know that that is pretty

00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,970
fantastic it has been for us anyway so

00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:51,110
really don't be afraid to do something

00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:53,210
different and I would say also that you

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:55,490
should use your resources at hand and by

00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,080
this I mean human resources from the

00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,300
most personal the ones you're in contact

00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,940
with every day to those that are semi

00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,620
local regional or even like if you're a

00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,690
java or j s conf and you're like hey

00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,210
would you maybe want to talk at my meet

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:10,790
up and somebody might say yes you know

00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,530
you never know i would say talk to your

00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:15,010
friends be like hey i know you're not

00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:17,570
really into this whole development thing

00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:19,580
but could you like show up because

00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:22,220
having warm bodies in the room means

00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,080
that people will perceive it as being a

00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,580
successful thing where people share and

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,840
integrate and it works i mean for a

00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,690
little bit while it really helps to

00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,330
boost attendance and they might learn

00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,680
something i hope they would don't be

00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,210
afraid to talk to your co-workers and

00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,420
say hey there's this meetup thing that

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,100
I'm

00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,930
doing and you should really come because

00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:41,960
it's totally relevant to what we do

00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,940
every day but do that with some caution

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,130
because remember that not everybody has

00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,830
time to commit to a meetup and that's

00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:52,220
okay so don't harass them about it

00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:53,690
please talk to your fellow meetup

00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,690
attendees if you see somebody that's

00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:59,660
their week or a month after month and

00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:01,280
they just sit and patiently observe ask

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,900
them if they would like to share

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:07,970
something that they've learned I know

00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:11,420
that for me when I am in that mode where

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:13,520
I'm just like observing I don't often

00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,800
think that I have something relevant to

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,190
contribute but things that might seem

00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,990
totally mundane to me are maybe

00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:22,730
mind-blowing to the rest of you and vice

00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,730
versa like that's how this community

00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:28,310
works so if you help somebody else get

00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:31,430
out of their shell they will repay you

00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:34,610
with the the most amazing talk you've

00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:38,480
ever heard don't be afraid to go to

00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,860
regional meetups you know it's not too

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,750
big of a deal for a lot of people to

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,190
jump in the car drive an hour hour and a

00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:45,290
half if you don't have access to a car

00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,450
don't feel bad about that but you know

00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:49,040
if you if you look like within a 50-mile

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:51,110
radius of where you're at chances are

00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,700
there's other meetups around and even if

00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,530
they're not directly related to the

00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,810
technology stack that you happen to be a

00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,520
super big fan of like chances are you'll

00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:00,470
learn something there and at those

00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,000
places you can interact with people who

00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,130
might be able to bring something back to

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,320
your meet up and say hey you know check

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,540
this out you come and visit us you know

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,370
maybe share something I have to give a

00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,490
shout out to the Madison PHP user group

00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:16,430
who has been especially helpful to us

00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:21,320
yeah they've been great and most

00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:22,940
importantly I mean this to say be of

00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,350
service to each other this this

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,240
particular phrase be excellent to each

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,310
other has had some some terrible

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,410
failings in our industry unfortunately

00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:33,200
hence the talk about codes of conduct

00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:35,440
and why that's important but if you if

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,600
you maintain a service-oriented mindset

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,550
then you know that's really what it's

00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,450
about we're here to help each other it's

00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:45,890
how we grow it's how we learn so i

00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,750
really hope I've helped to impart a

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:51,790
thing or two about community here today

00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:54,340
remember to be of service to your users

00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:58,270
above all without users there is no meet

00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:00,820
up period so do what they want to a

00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:02,860
point know that you have complete

00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,880
control over your participation I was

00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,740
talking about open source software

00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:09,790
redefining role definitions you know

00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:12,910

be afraid to do something drastically

00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:23,970
different the results will surprise you

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,970
