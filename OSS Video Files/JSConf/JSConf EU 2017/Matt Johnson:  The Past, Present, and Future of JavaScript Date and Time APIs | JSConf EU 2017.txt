JavaScript is notoriously bad when it comes to date and time problems. The built-in Date object has so many quirks and implementation differences that many developers have abandoned it, in favor of libraries. How did we get here, and what can be done about this? This talk is in three parts, and led by maintainers of the Moment.js library. First, you’ll understand how the Date object came to be, what parts of it are useful, and where the problems are. Next, you’ll learn about the present-day alternatives. We’ll cover three modern JavaScript libraries: Moment, date-fns, and js-joda, all of which are viable solutions. Lastly, you’ll hear about how we are working through the ECMAScript technical committee to get better support for dates, times and time zones built-in to the language.
