Every time I have to check the “Male” or “Female” boxes, it feels :poop emoji:. By building and shipping expanded gender options at my $DAYJOB, I learned how to convince folks that gender options in product matter, how to get time and resourcing for social justice projects at work, and how to measure the success of a feature that only a small portion of users interact with.

Live captioning by White Coat Captioning >> Hi, welcome back everybody.

00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,170
Hope you have been checking out the amazing things here at JSConf.

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,170
There has been some absolutely brilliant stuff out there.

00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,170
This is the best conference I have been to, the food, there's yoghurt trucks, everything,

00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,170
I'm absolutely adoring it.

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,170
So we've got our next speaker coming up.

00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:09,170
They've come all the way over from San Francisco.

00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,630
I'm hoping they've got over the jet lag by now.

00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:19,940
Their Twitter file introduced me to the word engi-queer which I'm loving and I am going

00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:29,810
to take as a job title from now, so please give a warm round of applause for Tilde Ann

00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,810
Thurium.

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,810
TILDE: Hi.

00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:37,859
My name is Tilde, and I'm here to tell the story of how I built and shipped expanded

00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:39,659
gender options at Pinterest.

00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:48,920
Some things I am going to cover are: why do expanded gender options in product matter;

00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:55,719
how we design the future and measure its effectiveness; and what I learned.

00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,969
So gender forms.

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,560
Whenever I'm signing up for a new app or service, and I come across those not so fun radio buttons

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,500
that only have male or female, I feel a lot of feelings.

00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,369
Most of them are not good ones.

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,420
I have a lot of thoughts like: why?

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,070
Why are you asking me for this information?

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,369
There are a lot of reasons why genders get baked into product.

00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:34,869
There are maybe medical reasons, there might be legal or compliance reasons, but mostly

00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:40,450
it's demographics or marketing, like ad targeting.

00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:47,499
I'm not saying these are good reasons, I'm just saying this is why it happened.

00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:54,109
When I first signed up for Pinterest, way before I started working there, I noticed

00:01:54,109 --> 00:02:01,830
those fun radio buttons that reinforced the gender binary and little did I know that I

00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:07,549
would soon be in a position to change that.

00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:09,759
But how did I get there?

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,150
Software engineering is not my first career.

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:20,200
I have a degree in gender studies and then I spent about five years working [sound problem]

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:28,549
... but then I got tired of working emotional labour on behalf of a major corporation so

00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:36,190
I quit my job, learned to code and got my very first engineer job at Pinterest.

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,890
I was shit terrified.

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:46,530
I had no idea what I was doing and basically was convinced I would be fired at any moment.

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,930
Somehow I managed to work through all that pain, confusion, fear and terror, and learned

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,250
a bunch of stuff, and now it has been three years and I haven't been fired yet.

00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,550
So yay!

00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:06,980
Anyway, after I first got hired about a year passed and then I started to feel more confident,

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:13,410
not just in my technical skills but in my inner personal understanding of politics that

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,790
were going on around and above me and how people actually worked together to build and

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,439
ship products.

00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,940
Being the kind of stirring it up sort of person that I am, I started some conversations about

00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,590
the gender thing.

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,560
I wouldn't say those conversations were great, but neither were they awful.

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,239
People were like: yeah, I mean this isn't going to move our core metrics, we should

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,980
just focus on things that are.

00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,830
Now, don't get me wrong, I was never under the impression that expanded gender options

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,670
are going to move core metrics.

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,489
That's not the point.

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,989
It's the kind of feature you build because it's the right thing to do if you want your

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:08,000
product to be inclusive of everybody, so ... [sound problem] ... if I wanted this feature to exist

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,939
I was going to have to make it happen, and I was pretty sure I can figure it out.

00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:19,690
Also I realised that I could leverage lack of co-ownership which was actually a big problem

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,280
across the whole organisation - code ownership.

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,110
I didn't have to ask permission because no one owned that code.

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,350
I could just build it.

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:41,570
Here are back end changes I made so before I started work on it we had this enum that

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,750
represented gender.

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,810
Someone had run an AB experiment and discovered that if you don't force people to put in their

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,010
gender, you get more signups.

00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,140
Surprise, surprise.

00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:02,080
So what I did, I added an optional string to the user struct to present a user's custom

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
gender value.

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,920
It is my firm belief that gender should be represented by a string, not a binary value,

00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,710
so that way people could put in whatever they want, including an emoji.

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,020
What is the plural of emoji, is it emojis?

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,560
Emoji?

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,650
Anyway, emoji are getting more and more important because as technology becomes more ubiquitous,

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:34,350
so does text-based communication and emoji are a great way of adding subtext to text.

00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,690
Making emoji and hell all Unicode representative of the full spectrum of human diversity that

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:46,340
exists is a little outside of the scope of my talk today but I will say that the emoji

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,460
I am showing on screen don't officially exist yet.

00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,550
Although I hope they do soon.

00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:01,830
We are getting a non-binary emoji though in the 2017 spec which is pretty rad.

00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:10,430
Anyway, let's talk about internationalisation and localisation and how they relate to gender.

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:16,410
People use these terms interchangeably but they are not exactly the same.

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,970
Localisation is a process of adapting your product, the text, the design, to work in

00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:28,160
one specific market, so this picture here is from the movie Inside Out.

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,660
In it, the protagonist, Reilly, she is a little girl and she just hates broccoli, except for

00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:39,800
in Japan where she hates green peppers, because green peppers are a vegetable that are more

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,370
hated by children in Japan than broccoli.

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:48,020
Since Inside Out is a movie about feelings and empathy it was important to get the little

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:54,370
details right so the movie would work cross-culturally.

00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:01,270
So internationalisation is the more generally used case, like let's say you kept having

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:08,970
this vegetable problem and you decided to build like a vegetable injector and ship it

00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,240
so that you could show users a different vegetable base somewhere in the world and that would

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,740
be an example of internationalisation, kind of the tools and framework that enable you

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,310
to localise in multiple languages.

00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:28,830
A base use case for localisation, okay you have an English string and it represents some

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,080
user face in copy.

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:37,190
The string has a placeholder value in it that represents the user name.

00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,330
At run time we look up the user's language setting and then replace the string with the

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,080
string in their language, and then also replace the placeholder value.

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:55,660
So if I'm a German user and my name is Tilde, hello user name becomes hello Tilde.

00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,060
Why does this matter for expanded gender options?

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:07,090
Well, I'm not a linguist, so bear with me, but there's this concept of grammatical gender

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,550
that about a quarter of the world's languages have.

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:17,170
Grammatically gender languages have - the nouns have genders and you have to match the

00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:24,560
other parts of speech in the sentence, like verbs and so forth, with the noun.

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,360
English is not grammatically gendered but it does still have gender baked into it in

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:38,180
all kinds of little places like third person pronouns and titles, so when I first decided

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:43,829
to build expanded gender options for Pinterest, I wanted to allow users to supply their preferred

00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:46,750
pronoun too.

00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,519
It's more inclusive to not only allow people to say what their gender is but to specify

00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,490
how they would like to be referred to.

00:08:53,490 --> 00:09:00,000
Unfortunately, that didn't really work out because the localisation provider that we

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:09,380
were using didn't handle gender in placeholder strings so we had to kind of work around that.

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:15,180
On the plus side, the translation provider not using gender and placeholder strings meant

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,240
that all of our user interface and copy was already gender neutral as it refers to users.

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,900
The writing team hates it because you end up with awkwardly worded sentences where you

00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:42,630
are avoiding pronouns but at the same time I did not have to do any extra work.

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:52,779
Oh.

00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:56,920
This is awkward.

00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,360
[Laughter] Thank you.

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,639
I didn't have to do any extra work to make our text work for users who don't identify

00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,420
as male or female.

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,089
Who cares what the writing team thinks?

00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:13,589
That's pretty cool.

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:18,769
So if you are not like Pinterest and you are not like locked into a contract with a certain

00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:21,819
localisation provider you have options.

00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:27,730
I found a bunch of software packages that support localisation of gender and placeholder

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,010
strings out of the box.

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,600
Caveat.

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,872
I have not used any of these personally, so if you have I would love to know what your

00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:37,250
experience is like.

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,380
Come find me after the talk or tweet at me or something.

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,709
But man, can we talk about pronouns for a second?

00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,160
Pronouns are complicated.

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:55,180
I wanted to shout out for having the preferred gender pronoun buttons, that makes my heart

00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:01,579
warm, I hope every conference is doing that, but anyway a lot of people who don't identify

00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:08,690
as male or female use "they" as their preference but there are so many pronouns out there.

00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:22,379
A website is trying to list all the different pronouns but how do 

00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:28,160
these concepts translate cross-culturally and cross languages?

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,860
Some languages don't have gender pronouns at all.

00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:40,480
Some languages like Farsi have pronouns for if an object is animate versus inanimate,

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,319
for example.

00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:50,550
So make sure your copy writers and translators are working with linguists who end the best

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,329
gender preferences in that language.

00:11:54,329 --> 00:12:01,730
So talked about the back end, talked about localisation stuff, then I did the front end

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:08,070
or the middleware and API changes, blah blah blah, and then I made the front end changes.

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:13,250
The first thing I did was put user gender on the settings page.

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,200
Politically speaking, it's pretty easy to put user gender on the settings page.

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,899
It's like the junk draw of any application and no one gives a shit.

00:12:22,899 --> 00:12:27,450
A funny thing happened after I did this though.

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:32,850
People, even though the conversation I had started earlier had been a little lukewarm,

00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:37,720
people came out of the woodwork to support me and they were like: oh, this is so cool,

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,629
what can I do to help?

00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:50,629
I was like: well, it sure would be great if we supported this feature on iOS and Android

00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:57,040
as well so I was able to help people make that happen.

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,399
It didn't solve the original problem though.

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,660
Users still had to put in their gender when they signed up for Pinterest and I wanted

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,540
to fix that.

00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:22,980
Unlike the - oh no - unlike the settings page the sign-up form is very political and people

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,959
really care about every pixel on that page, and it impacts top line metrics, so I knew

00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:33,180
that we would need to take a more data-driven approach.

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,610
Here are a few design iterations we went through on the way to shipping expanded gender options

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:41,819
on sign-up.

00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:45,209
The first thing I tried was putting a simple radio button in.

00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:52,740
When a user checks the radio button, another text box pops up where they can put in their

00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,939
gender value.

00:13:55,939 --> 00:14:05,290
The problem with this is the sign-up code is used in many places, which is a good thing,

00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,290
right?

00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,290
Don't repeat yourself.

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:14,300
But one of those places was this narrow little skinny little model, and when you internationalise

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:19,019
text or when text is localised into longer languages such as French or German, you need

00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:25,040
to account for about 30% more room for that text.

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,080
So the text didn't fit in French and German in the skinny model.

00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:37,050
They could have just made it wider but I didn't want this feature coupled with a certain specific

00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,120
design.

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,459
I wanted it to be more robust because I knew I wouldn't have a lot of time to maintain

00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:45,889
it.

00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:50,730
I asked a design friend for his feedback or suggestions.

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,139
This is what he came up with.

00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:57,010
There are a couple of problems with this.

00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:04,189
Number one, there's no universal signal or no universal symbol that represents all users

00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:06,899
who don't identify as male or female.

00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,939
Except maybe the Prince symbol.

00:15:09,939 --> 00:15:16,029
[Laughter] Number two, a lot of people just straight

00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:21,100
up can't remember which symbol means male and which symbol means female.

00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:29,890
And number three, this is meant to get us around the localisation or the text length

00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,930
problem, but these symbols don't work all that well cross-culturally.

00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:43,740
Not so fun fact: symbols of homosexuality are illegal in Russia and a symbol for non-binary

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,240
people could fall into that category.

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,430
So really this just wasn't going to fly with anybody.

00:15:50,430 --> 00:16:04,480
All right, fine, I will just do the hackie thing and move on with my life, but nope.

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,870
I was blocked.

00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:12,920
The person who was responsible for the metrics of the sign-up form strongly felt like this

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,480
was going to cause problems.

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,480
He was really worried that Pinterest made demographic of conservative mid-western moms

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,019
would object.

00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:28,100
For a little while the project stalled and I was frustrated.

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,940
I didn't know what to do and then in the way of tech companies, there is a re-org.

00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:39,720
[Laughter] Suddenly I was reporting to this person who

00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:47,579
had blocked me before, so my first line, I was like: look, if you want me to trust you

00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:54,949
and be on your team then you need to get me some face time with a designer who can help

00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:58,720
me get this form to meet your arbitrary standards.

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,569
And you know what, he came through for me.

00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:07,700
It's a little bit of a tricky design problem, right, like how do you make a feature visible

00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,760
for the small minority of users who really care about it but not so visible that the

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:20,440
majority who might not understand or be upset won't notice it and get pissed off?

00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,330
This is what we came up with.

00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,080
There's a little info icon.

00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,150
When you hover over it we show a tool tip.

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:35,500
On the tool tip we explain why we want this information, which is kind of important, and

00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,210
then allow you to put in your custom gender string.

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:46,750
After a user clicks save, we replace male or female with the text that they typed in.

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,410
So we rolled this out as an AB experiment.

00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:56,190
Unfortunately, signups were down about 1%.

00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:02,680
Wamp-wamp, back to the drawing board.

00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:08,620
I hypothesised that maybe users were unintentionally triggering the hover interaction, getting

00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:14,520
confused, so I said: let's make this a click interaction.

00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:21,160
When we tried it with a click interaction, signups were flat, so we shipped it.

00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,990
Yay!

00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:30,290
[Applause] Thank you, finally.

00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:36,530
We also - I measured that people were actually using the custom gender part because, if signups

00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,760
were flat but if no one is actually using it, then what's the point, right?

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,420
But then we took things even a step further.

00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,900
I was approached by a designer on the mobile team and she was like: hey, I'm re-doing the

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,990
whole mobile sign-up flow and why is custom gender on web so hidden?

00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,170
Can't we just put it in there with the other options?

00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:05,900
And I was like: you are not going to get any argument from me about that.

00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,890
This was wrapped in an AB experiment too, of course.

00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,880
It's not exactly an apples to apples comparison because the new sign-up flow is visually very

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,760
different but the metrics are better for it so that's what we went with.

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,010
Of course, quantitative metrics never tell the whole story so we did qualitative user

00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:29,840
research as well.

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,590
Sentiment towards custom gender options in this research was positive.

00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,530
People said things like: custom gender is an awesome idea for our progressive social

00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,690
climate.

00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:45,630
We got some love on social media as well.

00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,750
But the whole process got me thinking, like why?

00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:53,350
Why is this feature so important to me?

00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,920
Why do I care so much?

00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:04,330
Yes, so on this slide there's a movie which some of you have clearly seen called But I'm

00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:12,260
a Cheerleader and in this movie Megan, the main character, has a realisation that not

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,160
everybody struggles with same sex attraction.

00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,000
She is different, she is a lesbian.

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,320
Building this feature, I realised not everybody has - feels about it, having to put gender

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,230
into their box.

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,950
But I do, I'm different, I am non-binary.

00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,360
What does this mean for me?

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,650
Still figuring that out, TBH.

00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:46,860
So just to recap, building this feature taught me that you can leverage the chaos that will

00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:57,090
inevitably be present in your organisation to advance your social justice warrior agenda.

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:10,090
[Laughter] [Applause] After I got the ball rolling, people came

00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,630
out of the woodwork to help me.

00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:19,510
Finally, the process of writing software, building stuff, getting it right, getting

00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,540
it wrong, can teach you about yourself in ways that you might not expect.

00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
Thank you.

00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,540
[Applause] >> Wasn't that absolutely fantastic?

00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,540
That one gave me so many feels right here in my heart organ.

00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:26,544
