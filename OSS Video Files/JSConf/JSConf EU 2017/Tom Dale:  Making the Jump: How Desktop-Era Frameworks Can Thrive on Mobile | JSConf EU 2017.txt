Today’s most popular frameworks come from a time when the world was a different place. Ember’s first rendering engine, for example, was optimized around the performance gotchas of Internet Explorer 6. IE6 has since faded into history, and smartphones with spotty connectivity and occasionally dodgy hardware have become the lowest common denominator that we must optimize for.

In this talk, we’ll discuss how smartphones fundamentally change the assumptions we make about architecting applications for the web. Then, we’ll cover how we can embrace these new mobile constraints to build even better apps—for everyone. Finally, we’ll look at the techniques used by desktop-era libraries and what they’re doing to become great for the mobile web.
