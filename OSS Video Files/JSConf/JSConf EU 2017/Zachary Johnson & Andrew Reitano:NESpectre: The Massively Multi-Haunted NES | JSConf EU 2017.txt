00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,420
[ Applause ] >> Hi.

00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,680
Thanks, everybody.

00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,600
I'm really, really excited to be speaking to this audience.

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,050
Thanks so much to the committee and the volunteers for inviting us and for putting on this event.

00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:40,250
So I'm Zach Johnson, or Zachary Johnson.

00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:45,890
Andrew Reitano who is supposed to be here, he is back at our flat, sick.

00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:52,880
He got in and like got a� lost his voice and got a horrible cough and a fever.

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,100
He's totally knocked out.

00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,960
I told him, you know, I got this.

00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,090
Sleep until 7:30.

00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:04,380
We have another thing at 7:30 tonight on the other stage with more interactive demos.

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,240
This is more the "How" talk, and more play tonight at 7:30.

00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,889
I'm hoping he can sleep and join us.

00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:16,220
I was going to tell you he got eaten by a shark or something.

00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,349
That's more exciting.

00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:26,609
Andy is an electrical engineer by trade so, you know, he worked on like summary navigation

00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:28,719
systems and electrical engineering stuff.

00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,849
And he got into chip tunes and the electronic music scenes and started doing visualizations

00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,549
with Nintendo and Sega.

00:02:35,549 --> 00:02:38,730
To tell you about him.

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,440
And because he's not here, Andy wanted to be a game genie when he grew up.

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,319
This project gets him close.

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,569
Me, Zach Johnson, common name.

00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,489
Except the Zach part.

00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:56,549
Zachstronaut.com, you can find it there.

00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:00,499
That pixel art astronaut is my character.

00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:07,830
Some of the things I worked on, if you're familiar with adventure time on Cartoon Network.

00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,170
Did programming for the Beemo app.

00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:17,709
That entire app, number one in the app store four or five years ago, the whole app was

00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:19,430
done in Foam Gap.

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,100
It was HTML and JavaScript.

00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,099
It was number one and did really well for Cartoon Network.

00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,060
A couple other things I have done.

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:34,950
In the United States, there was legislation, SOPA, a big Internet blackout.

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:42,250
I did a template for that with animated spotlight effect and many Websites used.

00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,519
And I'm a game developer.

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,969
And there's a game, Juggernauts, I have been working on it.

00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:56,639
I have been into games and interactive stuff.

00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,230
Tell you about NESpectre.

00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,920
I have 25 minutes to do this.

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,489
Find me in the community area if you want to talk shop, get into the nitty gritty.

00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:13,890
And if you want to play demos, we have a bunch of things you can do with the tool.

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,010
Tonight at 7:30 on the main stage during dinner.

00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,960
This is going to go audience interactive.

00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,330
So you can see that in the back.

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:31,380
Get out your smartphones, and if you have data, if you have LTE, have a better time

00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,970
with that, actually, than WiFi, I think.

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,750
So pull up your smartphone.

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,290
You're going to be able to control an NES from your smartphone.

00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,320
Go to NESectre.com, should forward you to the address you want to be at.

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,350
Crank up the volume on your phone.

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:52,440
Leave this up for just a moment.

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,850
Anybody gotten that to work?

00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,850
One thumbs up could be awesome.

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,400
We're going to do a live demo of what this thing is.

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,840
Open a couple browser windows.

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,570
This is� actually� tonight, hopefully, if Andy is well, we're going to have a physical

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,420
Nintendo.

00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:17,030
This is machine Mscript and compiled emulator, running JavaScript.

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:23,520
And pull it out, and I will have to play.

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,730
Whoo.

00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,580
That's good and loud.

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,020
Okay.

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,340
Go over here.

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,890
And then be real nice to me.

00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:38,890
Okay.

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,890
Okay.

00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,650
Looking behind the curtain here.

00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,990
Okay, Mario mode.

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,990
All right.

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,330
That's a good sound.

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,330
Okay.

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,030
So on your smartphones, you should start to see� there you go.

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:54,300
People already� there you go.

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,229
So I'll just play this completely normal game of Mario.

00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:00,720
[ Laughter ] This is an unmodified ROM.

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,750
This is the original game.

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,190
I'll explain what's going on.

00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,750
Oh, my.

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,750
Okay.

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,480
It's completely the original ROM.

00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,170
This is devolving quickly.

00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:25,830
People keep doing the get ripped and it's totally making me freeze.

00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:35,310
We like to do this with inviting somebody up to play a normal game of Mario.

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,620
But I don't have a Game Pad, so I'm doing the keyboard here.

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,780
I don't know.

00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,720
You guys haven't managed to kill me yet.

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,170
Whoa.

00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,520
What was that?

00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,600
I'm a little scared by the flying Bowser.

00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,820
Hey.

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:02,270
I survived!

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:06,710
[ Applause ] Okay.

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:12,710
Let's pause all of this to not completely kill my server.

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:18,720
We have wrong domain.

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,220
Okay.

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,720
Pause.

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,220
Cool.

00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,730
Okay.

00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,730
Thank you very much.

00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:31,380
So there's going to be a bunch more different games and different play modes tonight.

00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,440
So let's get in a little bit into how all of this happens.

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,100
Okay.

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,490
There's an event in Austin, Texas, it's an interactive art and video game festival, Fantastic

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,970
Arcade.

00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:51,120
I went to the event two years ago and never met Andy before.

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,750
He was showing a brand-new NES game on a physical, plastic cart.

00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:02,810
A new game, it's called super Russian roulette.

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:05,060
You play with a zapper against a cowboy.

00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:13,600
And this game, despite being a real 8bit NES game has full screen animations and a beautiful

00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,810
country western sound track and pushes the limits of what's possible.

00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,810
I was amazed.

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:27,580
So I talked to him, never talked to him before, and we hit it off about the NES.

00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:38,880
I wrote a WebGL shader in JavaScript and GSL that emulates like the dying sprite system.

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,229
If you remember playing NES you would have to blow on the card and the graphics get scrambled.

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:44,810
This is emulating that.

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,279
We hit it off.

00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:52,550
And I told him about the massively multiplayer name stuff I was doing.

00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,550
I did Apestronauts.

00:08:53,550 --> 00:09:01,370
And Starwhal, a narwhal joust.

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:05,740
You use the tusk to joust.

00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:14,240
He was like, wait a minute, take your massively multiplayer stuff and my NES stuff and mash

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
them together.

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,320
This is the first day I met him at the festival.

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,900
And I said, absolutely let's do that.

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,640
So I went back to my flat at the conference and started coding this thing.

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,830
And the next morning I came to Andy's booth, where he's starting this game.

00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,320
And this is the original version of the UI.

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,070
And I said, hey, you know, let's� I coded it last night.

00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,900
Let's try it.

00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,279
And, you know, this is like� so this is Andy, you guys.

00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,570
This is another photo of him.

00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:52,231
And despite, like, both of us playing video games and partying the entire festival, we

00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:54,670
managed to put this thing together.

00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:00,860
And this is like, now, like less than 48 hours from the idea we see this happen in contra.

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
If you remember contra.

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,730
That's the level one boss.

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:10,120
And we jumped up and over the end boss in contra into uncharted territory in the game.

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,760
This was the moment where I was like, this is a thing.

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,440
This is special.

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,610
And so this is, then, that same day, Andy had a talk.

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,839
Invited me on to the talk to show the thing we just collaborated on.

00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:25,910
He's like, coding.

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,970
Like before he speaks like on stage like last minute stuff and I'm right next to him on

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,340
the far left there.

00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,630
There's me in a Duck Hunt Tshirt.

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:37,300
So� yeah.

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,420
That was how it came to be.

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,420
Which is really cool.

00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,640
It's like the magic of festivals like in.

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,490
You meet someone and you want to collaborate.

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,390
So a little bit about the NES, and this is the part that Andy would tell you about.

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,530
He's the hardware guy.

00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:53,550
I'll do my best without him.

00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:59,650
The crazy thing� one very crazy thing about the NES is the entire RAM of the NES was 2

00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,650
kilobytes.

00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,430
Like 2048 bytes, that's like 15 Tweets.

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,620
Entire� all of program RAM.

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:16,870
So what Andy did� when we do this off the physical hardware, what Andy did was he used

00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,470
what's called dual port RAM.

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,589
Which is RAM that two different CPUs can read and write at the same time.

00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:28,120
So he actually desoldered the RAM off of the NES mother board and put on his own custom

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,589
daughter board to talk to the dual port RAM over serial.

00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:38,940
He modded the boss to have a serial plug that looks like a headphone jack and goes into

00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,150
the back of the NES me.

00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,650
Otherwise you can't tell it's an NES.

00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,010
This is the game genie.

00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,250
It's important to distinguish this.

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,170
So the game genie modified ROM.

00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,850
It sat between the cart and the NES and changed the values that are being read off the readonly

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,640
memory on the plastic card.

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:08,190
But our modification is directly into the RAM, the working memory of the Nintendo, which

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,900
lets you do things you could never do with a game genie.

00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,640
Here are some examples what have you can do with this.

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:22,100
So Andy made a giant hockey buzzer for Blades of Steel and a scoreboard.

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,380
And it's reading RAM off of the console.

00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,540
And, you know, you get a goal and it fires off this thing.

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,260
He did a mod for Contra with a strobe.

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:35,980
Every time you fire the gun, you get a strobe.

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,650
And then this is something that I can show you more of later.

00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:41,370
But like you could Hex at it and do crazy things.

00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:47,940
There he's Hex editing the whip in Castlevania and whipping different sprites that are no

00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,040
longer the whip.

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,810
So what's going on in the stack?

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,320
There's the physical NES console.

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,050
In this case, you saw an emulator.

00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:01,630
And there's a script that talks serial to the NES.

00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:08,170
There was a node server that all of you connected with realtime communication with Socket.IO.

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,300
And definitely there's some actual ghosts in the mix here.

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,260
The backend is actually really simple.

00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:17,970
We first made this two years ago and I wanted to show my package.JSON.

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,491
It's silly how little is in here and how old some of the versions� which I thought, you

00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:29,710
know, in the age of tons and tons of libraries and stuff like that, I kind of appreciate

00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,840
the old school.

00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,470
And so back to the diagram a little bit.

00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,720
So I'm just using express to basically serve up the client to you.

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,320
The� all of the UI is in that first HTML push.

00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,140
And then it's JavaScript after that all speaks Socket.IO to the server.

00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:54,230
You have a peek at our backend admin gateway to switch the game modes.

00:13:54,230 --> 00:14:01,230
And the Socket.IO server that sits between you and the NES, is basically maintaining

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,140
the state of whatever, like, meta game you are all playing.

00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:13,450
And it's mapping your button presses to physical RAM addresses in that 2048 bytes of memory

00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,200
and creating a� basically a delta change file that's saying the audience has changed

00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,770
these bytes to these values and that's what gets sent off to a script to write those values

00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,990
to serial to the NES.

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:30,960
Frontend is also, you know, pretty standard stuff.

00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,720
I'm not even using like a� I mean, the UI's not supercomplicated.

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,529
It's just like jQuery replacing stuff.

00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:40,790
It's not even React or anything like that.

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,529
Socket.IO for the realtime communication.

00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:47,310
And I grabbed fast click for backwards compatibility with devices.

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:53,040
So there's not a 300-millisecond lag when you're pushing buttons you might know from

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,020
mobile.

00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,820
You didn't see this, but you'll see it tonight.

00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:05,399
When you're playing a game, when you're playing Mario, in realtime I can instantly change

00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,810
to another game.

00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,480
You don't have to reload or anything.

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
It just switches.

00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:16,370
All of a sudden, all your phones are in Tetris mote, all of your phones are in Contra mode.

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,980
The client is waiting for the server to say, hey, we're now playing Tetris.

00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,160
And all of your UIs flip over.

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:30,040
And there's a simple JavaScript controller for each different game that then takes over

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:36,740
listening for UI events and sending data over the Socket.IO stream.

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,420
This is kind of like random, but, you know, in case, you know, any of you weren't familiar

00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:49,149
with this, there's like the long-time restriction of only being able to play audio on the web

00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:53,260
if you� in a click event.

00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:57,310
Like you have to� you have to, like, touch something and then you can load and play an

00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,600
audio file.

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,120
And we wanted it so that we had that creepy, like almost bells were ringing when it activated.

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,400
And that wasn't on click.

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,880
So this is like a hack where you basically, the first time someone touches the screen,

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,149
you set the volume really low and put an on-time update listener.

00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:16,250
And as soon as it starts playing, you pause it.

00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,920
And you can use it every time later procedurally.

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,750
You don't have to use it later.

00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,480
I'm assuming lots of you can't read the code in the back.

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,190
The client socket code is way less than 64 lines to do all of that back and forth.

00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,690
It's really pretty simple.

00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:40,110
JavaScript is kind of amazing for prototyping and for rapidly doing stuff as I'm sure a

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,710
lot of you know.

00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:47,240
To be able to build something like this in a day really speaks, I think, to the power

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,410
of JavaScript.

00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:55,330
So the emulator that you saw, to tell you a little bit more about that, there's a C++

00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:00,720
emulator, FCE wax, a great NES emulator.

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,730
And N script N, compiles to JS.

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:10,300
And my finish is not great.

00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,850
But valtteri�hekula.

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:15,939
There's a URL, bucket.org/ts1.

00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:28,650
They were the ones to do the M script in compile of SE UX and did amazing work optimizing the

00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,290
WebGL and web audio APIs being used.

00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:38,620
Not only does it run at 50 frames a second, but has far and away the best audio and music

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,690
reproduction of any of the JavaScript NES emulators.

00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:41,690
There are a few.

00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:50,610
It's great you can transpile C++ to JavaScript and get such an awesome result.

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:57,290
What I did was took the code, grabbed the original C++ code and put in new hooks to

00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:02,179
access the ram and expose those to JavaScript and then recompiled.

00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:06,390
And then that lets me use an emulator like you saw today.

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:11,890
And that was really important, because I'm from Minneapolis, and Andy is out in Brooklyn,

00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:12,929
in New York City.

00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:15,760
And so, we're in two completely different parts of the United States.

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,900
And basically, we need to be able to do research with each other.

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,549
Like find these RAM values that are interesting.

00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:26,000
What's the RAM value that makes Mario swim?

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,920
What's the RAM value that makes Mario shrink or change the colors?

00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:41,900
We did peer to peer Hex editing of the 2048 bytes of RAM.

00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,790
And I can actually show that.

00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,400
Let's see.

00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,090
So let's go to another demo.

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:56,590
Let's maybe do� let's do, why not Contra, I guess?

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,610
So now I can find my Hex editor.

00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:03,779
Oh, yeah.

00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:05,960
So this is a live Hex editor of the ram.

00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,390
This is one page of RAM.

00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,390
So 256 bytes.

00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:15,250
And I can kind of page through memory and see everything that's going on.

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:22,130
And this lets you essentially do like both archaeology on what's going on in these games,

00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,830
and also find out where you can do these hacks.

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,660
And some of the stuff is really interesting.

00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,370
Like here� like this looks like something, right?

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:37,160
And it turns out like this matches some values with the color cycling that's going on.

00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:42,740
And you can also tend to find music in the engine too.

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,570
You can see where like the music is playing.

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:50,370
This one doesn't have a lot of music.

00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,960
So I can actually go through here.

00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,100
And Andy in New York can do this too.

00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,330
We have two little cursors and we can start playing with values.

00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,400
So I can do that.

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,250
I can just start changing RAM value here is.

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,950
And it's amazing how resilient these old games were.

00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,679
See?

00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,400
Like I'm corrupting a bunch of RAM and bytes, and it's actually not crashing it.

00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,720
So let me go into play mode here.

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,450
Okay.

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:28,880
And the first 256 bytes of RAM are by far the most kind of interesting.

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,130
They have there.

00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,130
See?

00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,999
Yeah, that killed me right away.

00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:38,010
[ Laughter ] But it's mostly this kind of first page that

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,010
really is� whoa.

00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,650
It's still toast.

00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:41,650
Okay.

00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,230
That's normal.

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,809
That sounds normal.

00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:53,350
Let's see if I can find something else fun real quick?

00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,520
Okay.

00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:00,370
This has to reload too.

00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,540
Okay.

00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,820
So let's see what this byte does.

00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,470
Or maybe this one.�oh!

00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,470
See that?

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,840
[ Laughter ] Yeah?

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,410
So I know there's a bug in here somewhere that you will instantly win the game.

00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,730
And I want to see if I can just happen upon that one.

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:17,920
That would be great.

00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
Let's see.

00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
Yes!

00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,870
[ Laughter ] Oh, this is� that won a level, not the game.

00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,850
There's another one where literally like the helicopter comes in and the credits roll wherever

00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,940
you are.

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,520
It's great.

00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,900
[ Laughter ] So� yeah.

00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:40,090
So the way� I could go back to the talk� yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,240
Sorry, everybody.

00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
Okay.

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,390
So the way that that works is I use peer JS.

00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:54,730
Which is a really slick and easy to use web RTC wrapper.

00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,660
It's different than what Socket.IO and web sockets had been.

00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,570
It's peer to peer, allowing Andy and my computer to connect.

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,990
It's nice when you're 60 frames a second sharing 256 bytes.

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,210
Peer to peer and binary.

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,970
And I think web sockets support binary, it was always strings.

00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:23,130
So there's the tremendous overhead of having to send two characters for a single value

00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,130
or more.

00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,900
So the binary data over the pipe and peer to peer, which is really slick.

00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,130
I was really happy with that.

00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:35,530
It was pretty easy to put together this Hex editor.

00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:43,030
So this is an example of like archaeology in an NES game.

00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,620
This is Dragon Warrior 2.

00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,560
An RPG for NES.

00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:52,410
And I decided to enumerate every possible value for inventory.

00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:58,679
I originally did this in the English language version of the game and went just 1 to 255.

00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,050
What's everything you can have in inventory?

00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,360
The swords and armor and potions.

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,350
And I found this thing that showed up as perilous.

00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:09,830
Which is an English word that means "Danger."

00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,660
And you could equip it and use it and nothing would happen.

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,730
It doesn't appear in the game, I'm Googling, I don't find anything.

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:23,750
And hop over to the Japanese version of Dragon Warrior 2.

00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,550
I enumerate the values.

00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,970
I have to compare them one to one with English.

00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,980
What if they're ordered different in English.

00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,510
I don't know any Japanese.

00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:41,620
And from the bit maps, trying to figure out the characters and then use the unicode and

00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,960
paste into Google translate.

00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,960
Sure enough.

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,670
This is an herb, this is the great sword, this is so and so's armor.

00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,880
And everything is lining up.

00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:57,440
And turns out that Perilous in the Japanese version is music box of death.

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,870
[ Laughter ] And I originally� because I don't speak

00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:04,309
any Japanese, I originally translated it as music box of teeth.

00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:08,669
And wasn't until the first time presenting to a crowd like that this someone who knows

00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:14,679
Japanese was like, that doesn't say that.

00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:16,490
And so then I did some more searching.

00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,419
Like music box of death.

00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:19,419
That didn't turn anything up.

00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:24,070
Then I copied and pasted the unicode Japanese characters, did a search for that.

00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:33,130
And I found one single forum post� like old forum post� that was like a Dragon Quest

00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,130
Con or something.

00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:39,330
Somebody had asked about this to one of the creators and they said that it was a debugging

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:43,870
item that they used to kill the entire party at will.

00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:48,710
They needed to test death and they just disabled it for the production release.

00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:51,030
And in kind of thing is actually really common.

00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:56,950
Like Andy found a twoplayer mode in the shipped Tetris.

00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:01,970
The retail version of Tetris� one of the two� for the NES� has a hidden twoplayer

00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:02,970
mode that's half baked.

00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,830
They turned it off.

00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,830
You can play it.

00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,740
You can find the byte in memory and flick it and now you're playing twoplayer Tetris.

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,440
There's stuff like this in these old games and it's really fascinating.

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,440
Okay.

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,180
Let's see.

00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:24,440
Well, actually� so rather than do questions, do we want to do another demo?

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,700
Yeah?

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,970
Okay.

00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,040
And I have like five minutes, right?

00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
Yeah.

00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Okay.

00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,360
Let's do a demo.

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
Okay.

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,200
Let's do� let's do Tetris.

00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:48,850
Because it has great music.

00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:53,580
Okay.

00:25:53,580 --> 00:26:00,490
One second here.

00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,490
Nice clown emoji.

00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,250
Whoever's name was clown emoji.

00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:13,100
So, again, the URL, if you don't have it in your history, was NESpectre.com.

00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,320
Or go to that one.

00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,990
Tetris mode.

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,100
Resume.

00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,200
Okay.

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,520
Here we go.

00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:31,360
So you are corrupting Tetris while also voting on what my next piece is going to be.

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,309
And there are a lot of you in here.

00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:37,039
Holy cow.

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:44,480
So if you all were nice, and all pushed the same button, then I would get that piece.

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,210
Or you can continue to just be really mean.

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,430
So what's going on is you're voting on what the next piece is going to be.

00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,799
But some of the pieces� like here.

00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:58,799
Look.

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,549
[ Laughter ] Are actually out of range.

00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:08,549
So like you're basically picking a piece that doesn't exist, and the game is trying to compensate.

00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:13,150
And you can hear what you're doing to the music engine when you press that music button.

00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:20,940
I'm doing all right.

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,110
And then you're also corrupting that stats panel.

00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,110
Basically, every time you vote it gets more distorted.

00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:30,660
Because all of this� the whole stats panel, those pieces in the numbers, are all represented

00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,790
in RAM as values what should show.

00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:41,150
So we're just corrupting that.

00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:44,559
So I can show you, now, how� let's do this.

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:45,970
I can go over here.

00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,240
And I can send you all back to conjuring.

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:58,049
And we can go to� back to Mario, let's say.

00:27:58,049 --> 00:28:07,409
And now I can come over here and I�can put you all into Mario mode again.

00:28:07,409 --> 00:28:08,409
Love that sound.

00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:10,340
There you go.

00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:19,919
And then we also have this, like, extra dangerous mode where you're literally corrupting a completely

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,930
random byte that could horribly crash the game.

00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,290
Or do nothing.

00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,640
Oh, my god.

00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,000
[ Laughter ] That's fine.

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,570
All right.

00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:34,710
Is that a vine?

00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,630
What do those even� what?

00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:42,740
Yeah� that's� I'm sure that's fine.

00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:48,780
Oh, I can't even� no.

00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,910
I'm stuck.

00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,039
I'm stuck.

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,100
Okay.

00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,160
Yikes.

00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,220
Okay.

00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,220
Pause all.

00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:03,669
So what I'd like to end with here is� oh, oh, oh.

00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:04,992
Back to my slides.

00:29:04,992 --> 00:29:10,110
End with a little teaser.

00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:14,520
We're going to have more games� [ Laughter ]

00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:18,020
Such as 200 player track and field and that kind of thing.

00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,789
Lots of crazy things you can do.

00:29:21,789 --> 00:29:27,760
You just� beat a level by crashing.

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,299
And here, let's quick show you� oh, man.

00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:35,919
Glass Joe, if I can get it started.

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,240
No� there we go.

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,309
Wait for it.

00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:45,190
That's funny if you know PunchOut.

00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,240
Okay.

00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,790
So come see us tonight.

00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,790
7:30.

00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,790
Play more games.

00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,419
Thank you so much.

00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:53,890
I appreciate it.

00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,390
