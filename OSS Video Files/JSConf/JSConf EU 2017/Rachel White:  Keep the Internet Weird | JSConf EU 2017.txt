The early 2000s bred a new generation of web developers and designers out of the pure need of creative expression. Teens didn’t have access to StackOverflow, and couldn’t easily Google their coding problems—so they turned to each other. Through collaboration and inspiration from others that were blazing their own way, they created their own unique personal sites without any regard for standards. Let’s explore the world of CSS via ‘filter: dropshadow’, JavaScript snippets, 8 pixel fonts and take a look back at what the web looked like before we followed the rules.

"Keep the Internet Weird" Rachel White

00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:31,339
RACHEL: Hello, everyone.

00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:37,050
My talk today is called Keep the Internet Weird and you'll figure out why a little bit

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,130
later on.

00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,930
My name is Rachel White, I'm a self-taught developer, artist, technologist, creative,

00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:50,489
cyborg, ask me why later, techie evangelist at Microsoft, nice person and I'm also really

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,220
bad an at descriptors talking about myself is weird.

00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:00,950
I'm also @oho on Twitter if you're interested in more things that I have to say.

00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,880
So this is going to be my love letter to the Internet.

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,930
I'm going to tell you a story about the things that I've done, the people that I've met and

00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:15,290
the things that have led me to be here on this stage today.

00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:17,560
We're going to start at the beginning.

00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:25,549
This, right here, is the VTech Socrates and it came out in 1998 and it was technically

00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:26,549
my first computer.

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:30,530
And it was a video game device that was educational.

00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:37,990
You were able to do math problems, interior design and just decorated houses which has

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:47,540
forever ruined me from playing The Sims, it was my first tangible experience with connecting

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:53,560
to technology and from then on, I was pretty much ruined.

00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,700
This thing, right here, is Are You Afraid of the Dark, it tail of Orpheus' curse, and

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,370
was a tale adventure game that was released in 1994.

00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:09,060
And this is, you're doing typical are you afraid of the dark stuff, like, searching

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:18,239
for mummies, and I didn't have a computer, but I had friends who did, like, I was super

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,769
hooked to anything that I could get my hands on.

00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:23,629
And then I did got my own computer.

00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:35,209
And if you know what this is, this is AOHell and it's a wares tool.

00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:41,230
Now when I get a PC, I was like, now I have knowledge at my fingertips.

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:53,889
Unfortunately, my dad had AOL, so it was -- but once I got AOHell I was able to manipulate

00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:58,879
some of the code that was in the programs and do horrible things like post linguistics

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,290
into chatrooms that if somebody clicked it, it would kick them off of their dial-up modem

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:10,620
and then from there I went on to IRC, and this was when I first really started interacting

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,639
with people.

00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,269
And I chose this screenshot because it's the first way that I ever pirated things on the

00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:18,269
Internet.

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,459
These are XDCC bots if anybody remembers what those were.

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,760
Basically an album would be so large so you would have to send a message to a bot that

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:35,079
had a bunch of compressed files that you would get it piece-by-piece so if your dial-up got

00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:38,659
disconnected because your sister picked up the phone or whatever, you would be able to

00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:41,709
pick it up and abstract it later.

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,639
So these were my first experiences communicating with Apple on the Internet.

00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:52,829
Some of it is nice, some of it is illegal, but basically I was like, yeah, this is rad,

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:55,150
I need to do more.

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:00,659
And then I discovered GeoCities and angel fire.

00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:12,419
I made

00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:16,340
sights for Blink 182 because I was super obsessed with them and thought they were really cool.

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:23,199
And I also thought I was super punk so I had animated dolls and stuff.

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,460
And one of them was a site when I started learning how to program.

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,110
And I didn't start learning how to program because I love programming, and I'm going

00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:32,780
to go to school, and I want to make a lot of money.

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,570
I just did it out of necessity because I wanted my voice to be heard, and I wanted to be out

00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,340
there.

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,500
And then I found Web Rings.

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:48,710
So when I started thinking about my journey and connections with the Internet, I realize

00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,340
so much of it was the result of exploration and discovery and it was pretty much because

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,330
I was not happy with the life that I had in rural Florida, the people that were around

00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,770
me, I didn't get along with.

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,490
They didn't have common interests?

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,320
But people on the Internet did and I could find anybody that was interested in any of

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,509
the same things that I was.

00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:12,590
And I could talk to them and we could exchange ideas and it was really inspiring.

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,770
It was a type of escapism that opened me up to new ideas.

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,940
And when I started making sites on GeoCities and AngelFire, I realized how fun it was to

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,789
learn and share that information.

00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:34,069
But then, through Web Rings in about earlyish 2000, I discovered personal sites.

00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:39,980
So I saw these networks of extremely well curated sites, impeccably designed with attention

00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,850
to detail, carefully written entries and crafted lists for other people to follow and check

00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,850
out.

00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,229
And they weren't just sites like we have personal sites now.

00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:50,410
I'm sure we all have personal sites.

00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,870
We all have blogs.

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,539
This is pre-WordPress.

00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:58,110
This is actually a software called Gray Matter which was in perl and just saved your entries

00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,289
locally.

00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:06,400
But we were educating and helping each other share knowledge and I wasn't because they

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,389
were trying to boost their ego about how much stuff they knew, or how many things they could,

00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:13,199
you know, share out there.

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,699
It was people who were self-taught and learning how their own design, learning how to do their

00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,419
own scrollable divs and their own link changes.

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:24,349
And it was mostly younger women.

00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:25,590
And it was really cool.

00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:30,190
And it was really welcoming that you could be able to find out how to, you know, size

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,599
your font the best way so that eight pixels, or ten pixels looked the coolest.

00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:40,020
You could learn how to use grunge brushes on Photoshop which were, like, the coolest

00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,969
things ever.

00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:45,069
So I found all these other teenagers and I knew that I really wanted to be a part of

00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:46,939
it.

00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:52,050
So I still remember the first site that I came across when I was, like, cool, this is

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,050
awesome.

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,610
I found this woman, her name is Melissa.

00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,629
This is gleeb.com and she was the first person that I really found where I was, like, wow

00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,440
I really like her entries.

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,060
I really, really like the music she likes, all the things that are really cool.

00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:13,590
Also, content warning, this is 2002, 2010, there might be some bad things in all of these

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,500
entries that you will see, fair warning.

00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,009
I didn't proofread.

00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:20,280
I loved all the other sites that she hosted.

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,930
A host/hostee relationship is when someone has their own domain name and then they gave

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,270
their space to other people, and you can share.

00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,900
And usually it's people who would have similar interests and so I could go to all these other

00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:38,669
sites and find people like Melissa that I identified with, and I wanted to be like Mel,

00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,530
and I wanted to put my voice out there and so I did.

00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:47,210
This is one of my very first personal sites.

00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:52,689
My AIM name was BamAndPontiusChick because I really loved Jackass.

00:07:52,689 --> 00:08:02,389
And I loved throwing things at crowd surfers and they would kick me in the head.

00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:08,030
But this was the first place that I got to express myself and find other information

00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:15,100
and dive into Allyssa explains, and find all the HTML help they're wanted.

00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:21,259
There was people who were willing to just help people out with their link buttons.

00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:28,759
And I eventually grew out of having a hostee site and I wanted my own domain name.

00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,960
So I got this one, well, these two.

00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,200
I finally convinced my parents to let me have some hosting.

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,909
It was probably one and one, or GoDaddy or something like that.

00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:47,760
And then finally I was on my way, I got obsessed with grunge brushes, as you can see and I

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,940
had domain names where things I was inspired by my favorite lyrics.

00:08:51,940 --> 00:09:00,470
So a lot of the domain names were like screamo, or punk band stuff, or that's unlike M-83

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,180
and they're not punk.

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:10,339
It's like the scrollable divs, and the stat counts, which was the pre-Twitter thing of

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,690
how to count how popular you were.

00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:23,550
And I was thinking the environment, and how good it felt to code through the process of

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,550
discovery.

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:31,149
And asking questions was encouraged and people really loved to help.

00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:34,350
And I knew that I wasn't the only one.

00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,130
So, of course, I do everyone does when they have an idea on the Internet, and I had decided

00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:44,730
to write a medium think piece on it.

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:50,060
And I was like, hey, friends, did you have personal domains, or were you writing HTML

00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:55,000
and CSS not for a job in the late '90s, early 2000s?

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,820
Talk to me about it!

00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,329
And they totally did.

00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:04,570
And I found a bunch of people had the same path as me, or a little bit different through

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:13,110
Myspace, Neopets, CSS for Lifejournal, age he will fire, Geocities, other people who

00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:22,990
know the quality of a good paintbrush and put it was like, cool, all these people similar

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,550
to me did the same thing.

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,130
I wonder if they learned the same thing.

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,660
So I asked, were you doing HTML/CSS/JS in the early 2000s?

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,210
Where did you get your coding info from online?

00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,230
For me, it was Allyssa Explains and DynamicDrive.

00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:51,570
And, again, the explanations were all over using CSS and a Zen Garden, Webmonkey, Allyssa

00:10:51,570 --> 00:11:01,860
explained, DynamicDrive, and View Sore, and it was still exploratory and fun.

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:09,670
And it made me realize that, obviously, when communities are nice, more people want to

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,470
be a part of them and don't we all want our communities to be nice because we enjoy the

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,440
things that we make, hopefully and we want other people to contribute to that, too?

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,259
I would like to think so.

00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:27,790
Which then led me to think, when did communities stop being nice?

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:34,050
And I found a certain trend in the areas that I thought it might have been.

00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:41,540
And it was about 2007 and 2008 and it's something that happened, some websites that came out

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,350
then.

00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,080
It's the gameification of knowledge sharing.

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,840
And it sucks.

00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:55,050
Sure, it's helpful but people aren't necessarily being helpful because they care about you

00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,800
and they want to help you; they're helping you because they want points.

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,589
Arbitrary point out on the Internet.

00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:09,560
So I know that people make jQuery jokes a lot and there's nothing wrong with jQuery.

00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,839
I've written a lot of it.

00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,160
It's great for people that are learning but I think people that make these types of jokes,

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,710
myself included directly because of the gameification of sharing.

00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,880
We're asking for vanilla JavaScript answers and we're getting jQuery answers not because

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,829
somebody cares about us, or wants to help us.

00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:30,920
They just want to be heard.

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:37,302
And yeah, while the jQuery solves the problem, it doesn't solve my problem and while I think

00:12:37,302 --> 00:12:41,839
this is a problem, we can fix it.

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,970
What I want is more ideas and more people is more knowledge sharing.

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,600
So yeah, people are getting involved in communities means more knowledge sharing but when you

00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,130
add in the gamification, you're taking away the passion and I think that's pretty bad.

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:03,259
We need more ideas and less echo chambers.

00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:09,360
We need more people sharing ideas freely and encouraging code exploration and less gate-keepered

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,730
echo chambers.

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:17,330
So now that we know why things could have maybe went so horrible.

00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:25,279
Let's take a fun little stroll back between the Internet of then and the Internet of now.

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:32,050
So I'm going to give you some cool site how-toes for the early 2000s, starting with the coolest

00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:36,310
techniques, slices and tables.

00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,500
Has anybody made a website like this?

00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,410
Is anybody happy that they never had to do this again?

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,519
So if you're not familiar, basically what you would do is your designer would lay out

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,670
your design in Photoshop.

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,459
Responsive design didn't exist, to it didn't matter.

00:13:55,459 --> 00:14:00,390
And then take this slice tool and draw out the sections that were important.

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:04,990
And you could even have a rollover for each of these sections.

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:12,351
Who needs CSS because we've got images and tables.

00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,670
So there were a lot of sites that looked like this at the time.

00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,029
And thanks goodness most of that is over.

00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:25,529
The other things that we did, which, obviously, this is my site with my cool haircut from

00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:30,470
2003, lots of absolutely-positioned divs.

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,519
It didn't because, you know, we didn't care about responsive design then.

00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,780
It wasn't really a thing.

00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:40,550
So I could lay out this whole entire site and throw my grunge brushes all over it and

00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:48,700
say, okay, cool, I know where this scrollable div should go, and xy (0, 0) makes sense because

00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:59,449
who's going to maximize the div anyway?

00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:03,470
And a lot of people making websites that were personal, spent a lot of time making really

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:11,370
elaborate websites so you would still have that image techniques because obviously that

00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:16,029
font over on the left side isn't any kind of web font in 2003.

00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:18,069
But it was popular.

00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:20,510
But luckily today is better.

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,540
We have way more things.

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:30,430
We have way more things than back then with more people trying to get specs integrated

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,500
into browsers.

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:43,860
So if you're starting out, you can start with things like CSS Grid, Flexbox, Tachyons, because

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,290
it makes everything good without even having to try.

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,370
And Base CSS.

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:54,699
So now that we have the layouts covered, we're going to talk about some really cool fancy

00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:56,139
things.

00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:01,040
Fancy things like DHTML.

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,200
So the application of DHTML was actually introduced by Microsoft but I swear that's not like,

00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,560
hey, I work there.

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,829
It's just a thing.

00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:17,389
And if you have heard the term static site before, a static site is being just HTML and

00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:21,350
CSS, you throw some JavaScript in there and it manipulates the DOM, guess what, you've

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,920
got DHTML.

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:29,321
So difference basically a way for Microsoft with Internet Explorer 4 to be like, look

00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:33,509
how fancy this is, it's so cool!

00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:37,370
So you could do fancy things like cursor effects.

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:44,860
So, so while you're mousing around on the browser, you have these plus signs, or ASCII

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,870
characters, or bubbles, or stars, or whatever.

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:51,600
Because you're cool, and you want people visiting on your site.

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:59,329
But the cool thing is, this is still on DynamicDrive and so you can go back and look at the old

00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,180
code and I've put some new code over here.

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:10,230
You know, we're the last talk and I don't have all day to tell you about how we got

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:18,400
cool star effects but I do have an extremely cool demo from 2003.

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,250
I gotta find which way the browser is.

00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,530
Cool.

00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,530
All right.

00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,840
New York City no.

00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,860
One sec.

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:40,030
Very busy so here's a really nice one in case you want to make a site about a celebrity

00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,370
that you have a crush on, and you want to let them how how much you want to kiss them.

00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:47,650
You can put that cool kissing trail on there.

00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:53,820
And here's another one, maybe it's winter and you want to celebrate the cold weather.

00:17:53,820 --> 00:18:00,510
You're going to have maybe some snow falling and then, you know, maybe you are a really

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,870
big fan of scuba diving and you want bubbles on your site.

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:12,380
So you can do this and more with DHTML and DynamicDrive which was all just copy and paste

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,500
snippets and ridiculousness.

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:26,400
So you're in luck, too, because not only is today better for DHTML stuff, too, and we're

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,740
going to talk about why, literally everything is better than what you were able to do in

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,900
2001 and JavaScript.

00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,750
Everything that changes the DOM, 3JS is great.

00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,940
P5, you can do VR in the browser now.

00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,100
If you told me that in 2005, I would have been like, sure, okay.

00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,820
You can even control hardware with JavaScript.

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,260
The limits are endless.

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,600
So while we've made so many steps with technology, we still have so much work to do.

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,880
The code is changed, but the people haven't.

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,570
For the most part, the ways that we communicate has changed and we have a lot of work to do

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:14,440
to fix the damage that the gamification of knowledge has shaped some of our dev communities.

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,840
There's still the good people who are trying to help out and create a good community.

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,390
So support your communities.

00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,680
Your local communities, global communities, other communities that you're not part of,

00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,500
support them all.

00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,020
When I started the journey of writing this talk from the Medium article, to being here

00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:40,420
on this stage today, I realized something, and that's that never in my life have I felt

00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:46,910
more supported than I did in the early 2000s as I do right now.

00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:54,590
So I went to JSConf 2014, as my first conference ever.

00:19:54,590 --> 00:20:03,170
I didn't know who Tom Dale was, I didn't know who they were.

00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,810
I was just pumped to be there and to learn and I kept to myself.

00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:12,600
This was me lurking behind the dunk tank where I had dunked everyone.

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:21,040
And I learned so much, and, honestly, this conference changed my life.

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:27,940
I met this friendly guy and I'm lucky enough to -- I'm going to get emotional.

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,440
He took the time to be nice to me.

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:38,600
And he told me about Brooklyn JS and when I got back to New York, I went and I met so

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:44,350
many good people that were friendly to me, and nice to me and they were just like people

00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,880
that cared.

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,770
And they're people that put people before code.

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,190
And I think that's important.

00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,990
They inspired me.

00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,150
Whoa!

00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,970
They inspired me and motivated me that I could do whatever I wanted as long as I just tried.

00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,550
And that's really important.

00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,480
And you can have that, too.

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,770
If you don't have the communities available to you in your area, make them.

00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,950
There are people out there that are willing to help make whatever you want to be a welcoming,

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,150
and inclusive space.

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,150
Trust me.

00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,150
Reach out to me.

00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,160
Reach out to the organizers, they're willing to help.

00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,420
They'll be more than happy to give that to you.

00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,580
And in case you don't know, here are some helpful communities.

00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:36,220
There's WeAllJS which is a really fantastic organization that is JavaScript focused and

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,810
it's inclusive to everyone and it's just really helpful and nice, and they have a Slack, and

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,050
a Twitter, and they have conversations.

00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:50,010
And then there's CodeNewbie, which is welcoming for everyone, every language.

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,170
They have chats every week to talk about what you're learning about programming.

00:21:54,170 --> 00:22:00,680
And Chiron just had their first conference which was called Codelands and it was the

00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,490
most inclusive event that I've ever been to in my life and they were applauding people

00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:10,430
as they were leaving and it made me feel good about development.

00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:18,040
And there's also First PR, and that's made with Charlotte and it's encouraging organizations

00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:24,170
to encourage tagging on issue cues for things that people might be able to help out with,

00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:28,890
and then there's NodeTogether which Ashley Williams have started which has taught people

00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,230
from under-represented minorities, to learn how to program all over the world and I'm

00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:39,980
lucky that she was able to take control of it, and be able to do that.

00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:46,720
So I guess the whole point of keep the Internet weird to me is don't stifle creativity.

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,550
Code exploration is important.

00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:52,200
Not being afraid of trying new things is extremely important.

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,110
We need to foster growth in our communities instead of making people be afraid to be a

00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,440
part of them.

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:05,450
We need to have people try new things because they want to try them.

00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:10,080
And I have this stickers so if you want them, keep bother me later.

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,910
I have a lot of them.

00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,740
I actually commissioned these from an amazing designer called Skull Face because I wanted

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,430
some really cool slides and stickers for you.

00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:27,660
So in case you want to talk to me after this, I'm @oho on Twitter, and my GitHub where I

00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:33,370
open source everything that I could possibly be able to open source and comment it if I

00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,930
can is there.

00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:41,080
And then my extremely narcissistic domain name, Rachelisawesome, and I'm cool online.

00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,310
Thank you.

00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:46,420
