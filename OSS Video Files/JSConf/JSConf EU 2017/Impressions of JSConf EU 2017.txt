00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,160
my name is Ruth I'm from the UK I'm also

00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,600
here with my milk collective which is

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,640
over in the corner there which is life -

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,930
I think the web platform is a really

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,090
really interesting platform for making

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,940
art it's because of its openness its

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,180
ease of use its consumer ability by

00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:17,550
everybody its connectivity like the web

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,000
is everywhere and for everybody which i

00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:23,079
think is exactly what artists

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,079
[Music]

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:45,640
[Music]

00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:48,700
so my talk was about maintaining bowel

00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,260
and it was kind of just like my story of

00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,810
how I got involved in the project and

00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:54,400
then kind of like I shared a few stories

00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,680
about what it's like to be a maintainer

00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,170
keep the internet weird is a talk that

00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,360
I'm giving to let people know that there

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,520
are communities available now that we

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,710
have that will be able to help you

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,590
foster that kind of growth and feeling

00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,200
of inclusivity and code exploration and

00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:13,959
that you just have to know where to find

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,330
them my talk was about compression and

00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:19,050
were specifically about HTTP compression

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,820
so I was talking about being able to

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,390
kind of compress out your bundles before

00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,390
you serve them up

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:34,700
[Music]

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:47,180
I saw this tweet earlier that kind of

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,500
summarizes really well whose was the Jay

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,200
s come for you feels more like a

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,970
festival than maybe the classical tech

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,409
conference and I think this is really

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,930
really nice to see because that's kind

00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:58,489
of what we were trying to do I think

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,890
technology and the tech industry can be

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,780
only about engineering and frameworks we

00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,760
really have to focus on the human aspect

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,650
of it and that's why we will never stop

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,810
having the stocks and we will never

00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,970
never stop challenging the industry in

00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,859
the way we do and that upsets some

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,079
people but I think that's good because

00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,500
that creates a certain discomfort and

00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:36,110
that drives change

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:36,110
