Making art on the web is easy, if you got the right tools. HTML has styled divs. JavaScript has canvas. I have an emoji keyboard. But what if our tools were better, and making art was easier? What if there was a magical widget that transformed any word into emoji word art? Or an image into pixels, which you can then style with CSS? What if it was easy to build these tools, embed them on any sites, and give them out to people, so that they can make art? Spoilers: it is, and Iâ€™m going to tell you about it.
