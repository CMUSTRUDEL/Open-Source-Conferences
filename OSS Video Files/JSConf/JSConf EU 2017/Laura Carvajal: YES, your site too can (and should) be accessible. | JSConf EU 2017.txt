In 2016, we at The Financial Times launched a new version of our website to great success. It broke ground on key areas in which we’d set out to excel and measured very closely, like performance, resilience and usability. But one day, and rather serendipitously, we realized we had largely forgotten to measure one thing: accessibility. And you can’t improve what you don’t measure.

In this talk I will go over how we went from being generally oblivious about accessibility to making it a core part of our process across multiple divisions. I will share the roadblocks we found and the lessons we learned, along with tangible solutions you can integrate them into your own project today, regardless of available time, budget or support.

"YES, your site too can (and should) be accessible.

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:26,190
Lessons learned from building FT.com" Laura Carvajal

00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,970
LAURA: Good morning, everyone.

00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:38,050
I was in the audience for a talk on accessibility a few years back much like you are right now,

00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:43,589
and I was sitting with some colleagues from a previous job and I remember feeling stuff

00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:49,489
like, well, this is really nice, really cool, but does it really apply to the thing that

00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:50,489
I'm building?

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,929
I was working on a mobile site at a time and I kept hearing about all this keyboard stuff

00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,210
that I had to look into.

00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,799
So that didn't really matter to me.

00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,199
And I thought, well, maybe we were starting a new project, so it felt, like, there was

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,860
this huge gap between the thing that I was building and accessibility.

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,110
And looking back, I'm honestly a little bit embarrassed to admit this, but I also like

00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:18,890
to full own having been there because it helps me appreciate just how easy it is to feel

00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:24,439
that way, and just how far accessibility can be from the thing that you're doing.

00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:30,450
So fast forward to 2016, I was working at the Financial Times, we were building the

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,689
fastest, greatest new site out there.

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,549
We released that October.

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,689
We replaced our old monolithic website and it was a great success.

00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:42,369
We were winning all these awards.

00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,240
We were excelling at performance, security.

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,600
So basically every metric that we set out to excel at, we were.

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,159
So one thing we decided to look at was accessibility, thinking, well, we're great at all these things,

00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,890
maybe we're great at accessibility, too, just magically.

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:06,240
But unlike performance and security, we hadn't really put a collective effort into accessibility

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,580
so no surprise, we weren't very good.

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,920
And well, since this talk is about the lessons we learned, that was really our first lesson.

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,940
Accessibility doesn't just happen; you have to make it happen.

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,470
So my name is Laura Carahal.

00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:30,610
And I work at the Financial Times.

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,300
And today I want to tell you about the lessons we learned once we realized we had built this

00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,500
beautiful performant thing that couldn't really be used by everyone.

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,190
And so today, if you're in that clays you're wondering if accessibility applies to your

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:51,120
project, I hope you walk away convinced that it does and that's really easy to get started.

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,320
So what is accessibility?

00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,610
Many definition out there but there's one that I really, really like because it strips

00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,090
it down to its core.

00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,130
It says: Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the web.

00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,130
That's it.

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,700
It just boils it down to not denying anyone access to the thing that you're building.

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,080
To go beyond this a little bit, I want to tell you a quick story.

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,680
I was in that shopping mall with my daughter a few weeks back.

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,220
It's a modern shopping mall in London, Wimbley, and we were going down that escalator down

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,220
there.

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,690
And she asked me, while we were going up, how does someone in a wheelchair get to do

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,690
what we're doing?

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:37,200
And I told her, there's an elevator somewhere, and as we're going up, she says, where is

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
it?

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,760
And to be honest, I couldn't see it.

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,270
It was only when we got to the top, that I could see at the very long end of that hallway,

00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,190
I pointed it out.

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,450
And she said, well, a person in a wheelchair would have to go all the way there, and back,

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,590
that's not fair.

00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,760
And children have a way of seeing things for the way they are.

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,040
And so even though I explained regulations and minimum things that you have to comply

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,190
with, she was totally not buying it, it was not fair.

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,190
And that's the truth.

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,660
I mean, this was a modern building that met all the requirements but you had that unfair

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,140
situation there.

00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:20,070
So I'd like to say that accessibility goes beyond not denying access; it's about ensuring

00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:24,450
that the access that you provide is fair for everyone and I'm giving my daughter full credit

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,880
for that quote.

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,750
So we've covered what accessibility is.

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:37,030
In terms of disability, it can be divided into four categories: Physical, visual, hearing,

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,540
or cognitive.

00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:45,220
These could be permanent disabilities but we also have temporary and situational disabilities.

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:51,930
So, for example, if a permanent disability is deaf and hard of hearing, a temporary disability

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,180
could be, in the dotted orange box there, having an inner ear infection.

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:02,210
So for a period of time, you can't hear very well, or a situational disability is, you're

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:07,430
in a noisy place, and you can't hear things because there's noise preventing you from

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,440
hearing.

00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:16,420
So we designed something for someone deaf in mind by adding, for example, closed captioning

00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:22,260
to your videos, that benefits anyone else that falls anywhere on that spectrum.

00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,200
So getting back to permanent disabilities, as far as permanent disabilities go, there's

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:37,410
about 1 billion people in the world with disabilities, and when you factor in your own userbase and

00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:42,050
their demographics, you can get a clearer picture of what that number looks like for

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,670
your business.

00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:48,389
So we did that at the Financial Times and that worked out to be about 20% of our users

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:55,260
because when you factor in the age distribution of our readership, that tends to skew a little

00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,260
bit older.

00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,169
So we got a higher number there.

00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:02,460
So if you're anything like the FD, they have a wide audience, consuming the products and

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,800
the services that you put out.

00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,660
You probably go through great lengths, too, to support all the members of that audience.

00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,919
So, for example, you have people on IE 8 and that only makes up about 5% of your userbase,

00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:18,370
you're probably making sure that they get a good experience, or at least an acceptable

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:24,410
experience so all of a sudden, we have about 20% of our userbase that we're ignoring.

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,139
And that tends to get things moving.

00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,880
So that's a good motivation to get things started.

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,900
So let's say I've convinced you now and you were gonna do this.

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,400
You're determined to get accessibility into your project, and it's hard, and it's overwhelming,

00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,320
and you don't really know where to start.

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,400
Our suggestion is to just start small.

00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,560
For us, starting small meant doing that.

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,930
We installed pa11y into our project.

00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:02,490
Pa11y is an open source tool that will check your markup against some regulations I'll

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,570
show you in a little bit and it can detect some accessibility errors.

00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,610
It doesn't detect everything but it's a good place to start.

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,860
There are other open source tools that do the same thing but we've found pa11y to be

00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:22,900
a great thing for our project, and it has a great community of members and developers

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,900
around it.

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,150
So this was the way that we started.

00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:34,150
So the way pa11y works is it goes through the web content accessibility guidelines.

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,190
We won't go very deep into this today but you can go and check it out.

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,620
It's a list of criteria that your site should meet if it is to be accessible.

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,010
So it checks your markup against that, and then it gives you a report of what's broken.

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:53,590
And so we ran pa11y against ft.com, and we got a whole list of errors that was a lot

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,640
more than two at the time.

00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:00,840
And at that moment, we could just go and fix the errors, and run this every now and then

00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,291
manually, and then fix things that come up, but unless we had something that we could

00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:10,050
automate into our build process, this wasn't going to be very efficient.

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:16,979
So pa11y has sort of a wrapper that's called pa11y-ci, that just helps you to wrap pa11y

00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,740
into your continual process.

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,229
So this is what we did in FT.

00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:31,300
This is an overall simplified version of our Node process.

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,659
So one app would be the opportunity page, or the article page, or sign-up pages.

00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:38,349
And those apps live on GitHub.

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:44,509
Every time we push to a branch in GitHub, that kicks off a CircleCI build, and if it's

00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:50,240
a master branch, then it goes to Heroku and it's off to production.

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,800
So pa11y kicks in here, in the continuous integration step.

00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,040
So it would run for every push for every branch for your project and it would tell you what

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,540
accessibility errors you have.

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:11,790
So to do that, we just need it to add one line to our existing build process which is

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,410
.make pa11y.

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:19,269
And really, what that does is run pa11y-ci and it's highly customizable.

00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:27,389
And so in our case, every branch generates a dynamic app with a dynamic name and so we

00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:28,920
run pa11y-ci against that.

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,779
And the interesting thing here is the threshold amount.

00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:40,290
So, at the time, we've had dozens of apps making up ft.com and we had hundreds of errors.

00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,829
So we couldn't just, one day, break every build, and hold production and say, hey, we

00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:47,149
need to fix all these errors.

00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:52,920
So what that allows you to do is integrate pa11y to not break your builds, and so your

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,029
builds will pass.

00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:59,660
So you initially set that value to something very high.

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:05,399
You'll still have builds pass, and no one will have builds failing because of it.

00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:11,329
But you'll have a report now of the accessibility errors that you have.

00:10:11,329 --> 00:10:21,769
So once we did that, we went, app-by-app, cleaning up the errors, and then we would

00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,320
remove the threshold argument.

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,110
So for that moment, if a new branch included a new accessibility error, then that branch

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,110
wouldn't pass.

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,209
And so that was sort of our ultimate goal.

00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:35,069
So it would look like that.

00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:40,649
So now you've reached kind of like a zero-error level, and now that has a new branch, it has

00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:44,129
a new error and you can't push that to production.

00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:49,449
So that was a big achievement and we were getting to the point where all of our apps

00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,449
had this.

00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,629
They all had zero errors and they were preventing making new errors into production.

00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,389
And that was a big deal.

00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:58,019
We felt like winners.

00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:02,059
No accessibility errors would ever make it to production.

00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:08,480
But we realized that even though everyone was for accessibility, they all liked the

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,690
idea of pa11y, they even liked having the idea of having pa11y break their build.

00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:19,369
We didn't really do a great job of explaining what once you got that list of errors, or

00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:21,499
what that meant, or what you were supposed to do.

00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:24,029
So that was a lesson learned.

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:31,089
So before you set a project on fire, train people.

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:40,379
So a good place to start is this free Udacity course.

00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:44,459
But this is a great tutorial that you can at your own pace and this is where we started

00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:50,350
our own training.

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,699
So we've reached that level where you have zero errors in your app, or in all your apps.

00:11:55,699 --> 00:12:00,259
You've removed that threshold argument and nothing's going to make it into production.

00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:05,709
So now we've talked about errors that you can detect automatically in pa11y.

00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:13,999
So that's about 20-35% of all the errors that you can and at least needs to be checked manually.

00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:18,989
And so to do that is you can do some things.

00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:25,939
One of them is getting an external audit where a third party with experience in accessibility

00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:30,779
checks your site and tells you -- gives you a report of what's broken, or certifies you

00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:33,700
that you have no errors and that you are accessible.

00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,680
Something else that you can do is have customer research or do user testing and the third

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:45,149
one is learning how to use assistive tech yourself so you can test your own site and

00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:46,269
spot some of these errors.

00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:50,130
These are not mutually exclusive, and ideally you should be doing all of them.

00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:54,149
So I'm going to go through each of these.

00:12:54,149 --> 00:13:00,220
In our case, the external audit was conducted by the Digital Accessibility Center, and I'm

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:08,110
going to show you a little video of what they did.

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:14,229
>> My name is Jebec Morgan, and I have cerebral palsy.

00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:18,069
>> Choose three.

00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:21,909
>> Click button.

00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:27,899
>> It controls the videos.

00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,109
>> My name is James Herkain, and I'm the color contrast and disability analyst at --

00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:38,369
>> On the home page, I encountered some text displayed on top of images.

00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:43,220
Text displayed on top of images could be very difficult to read because of the varying contrast.

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,519
>> I'm a web analyst at DOC.

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,489
I test zoom test with audible feedback.

00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:57,970
And I'm going to scroll down below and just test this.

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:05,049
>> My opinion, Morgan's companies, world, home.

00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:12,509
>> So there's an empty space here which would be an ideal place to put the subheading.

00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:20,209
>> My name is Charles Brew, and I'm at -- there's a moving image that extracts me from all the

00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:21,209
content.

00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:27,819
Another issue that I've found on the home page is the carousel.

00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:34,179
When navigating through it, I couldn't find the arrow to navigate to each page.

00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:43,819
And once I found that, eventually finding the other previous button was difficult.

00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:51,399
>> Hello there, my name is Mike Jones and I'm completely blind and I'm an accessibility

00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,959
analyst at the Digital Accessibility Center.

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,649
On one of the articles that I've tested, there were several headings that announces read

00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:02,800
more.

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,060
And these also interrupt the article.

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,189
It's not clear what the user should be reading more about.

00:15:10,189 --> 00:15:15,329
Actually these headings interrupt the main article that the user is reading.

00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:21,420
So it would have been helpful to me, to ensure that the article read smoothly and continuously

00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,649
without interruptions.

00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:26,429
LAURA: Yeah, so that's some of the work that they did.

00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:31,149
This is only two minutes long but I was lucky enough to be able to spend a day -- a full

00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:33,569
day -- with them while they were doing the testing.

00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:37,199
And if you have a chance to do this for the product that you're building, I highly recommend

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,249
it because it will change your perspective on the work that you do forever.

00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:49,610
So after that, all of that testing, we got a report back with about -- it was, like,

00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,449
a 200-page report giving us all the errors that we had -- all the stuff that they had

00:15:54,449 --> 00:15:55,730
to detect manually.

00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,489
So we went about fixing all of those.

00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:00,559
It took us a couple of months.

00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,019
And just very recently we got an accreditation saying that this website is accessible to

00:16:05,019 --> 00:16:10,410
this level of conformance and we were very glad to get it because it was very hard work

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:17,859
and we were also very glad to be the first site in our industry to get it, but this is

00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:20,420
not a title that we want to hold alone.

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,319
So we encourage people from The Guardian, and The Post, and The Times, to get on this

00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:32,879
because this is one metric that we should all be trying to outdo each other on.

00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:41,600
So another problem is customer research.

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,300
But if you want your new features to make sense, they should probably be tested by actual

00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,570
users, or you could end up, you know, building something that looks good on paper but still

00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,370
get it very, very wrong.

00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:01,629
So lastly, here I wanted to talk a little bit about how we went about learning how to

00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,699
use assistive tech ourselves.

00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:05,939
We had never done that before as a team.

00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,690
So this is one thing that you can do for free and I would highly encourage it.

00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,110
This is some of the tools we use.

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,699
You can get them all for free if you have a Mac.

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:20,139
We used VoiceOver for screenreader.

00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:24,549
And we used the zoom capabilities of the Mac.

00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:27,760
We tested a little bit on Windows as well because they have this high-contrast mode

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,429
that just breaks everything.

00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:34,049
So it's a lot worse than the Mac one, and by worse I mean a lot better because it finds

00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:39,159
more errors so if you have access to Windows, I would highly recommend looking at what you're

00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,882
looking at with that build on that mode.

00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:48,520
So one thing that really helped us a lot was testing keyboard only.

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,370
So initially we would just go to ft.com and just test the site using the keyboard and

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,169
then go about our lives and using our mouse, or our trackpad.

00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:01,799
But what really made a difference was going keyboard only all the time.

00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:09,520
So one thing you learn is you can use keyboard only on sites because they are good with keyboard

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,520
accessibility.

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:16,120
But there are some sites that are impossible to use, and that becomes evident very quickly

00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,350
once you give up your house or your trackpad.

00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:27,649
So to be able to make the transition easier from using a trackpad, to a keyboard is by

00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,620
using mouse keys.

00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:37,060
So what that can do is disable your trackpad but it gives you the possibility to control

00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,649
your pointer with your number keys.

00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:41,690
So you can use that in an emergency.

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:47,179
So if you have a site that has particularly bad accessibility, and you don't have a mouse,

00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:54,180
instead of using the mouse or a trackpad, you can -- so it's really annoying.

00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,330
And really only want to use it when there's no other way.

00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:05,620
So one thing we realize is convenient before you go keyboard only is printing out some

00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,279
of the shortcuts for your top apps.

00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,929
This was my setup around November.

00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:15,389
But once you do this for a while, and you just memorize the shortcuts by using them,

00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:19,139
and all that paper goes away.

00:19:19,139 --> 00:19:22,260
Sometimes I don't have an external keyboard when I take my laptop home, for example.

00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,900
So what I've done is I've made my trackpad really, really slow and I've removed all the

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:32,139
goodies that Apple gave me so that when I do have to use it, it's uncomfortable so it

00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:35,590
reminds me to go back and use the keyboard.

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,990
So that's lesson number three: Throw away your mouse.

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:45,970
So going back to that list of things that you have to fix, you've learned to use all

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:46,970
these tools.

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:47,970
You have your keyboard set up.

00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,820
It's really tempting to just roll up your sleeves and try to fix everything yourself,

00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,960
but if you're building a large site, I'd recommend you don't do that.

00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,240
So it's -- wait, let's go back to Jim Carrey for a minute.

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,840
So one thing that we learned -- or that I learned -- it wasn't that quickly, it took

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:13,750
a while, was that if you try and take on everything yourself, it's not efficient, it's not the

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,890
right answer.

00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:20,340
You end up burning out, errors keep coming back in faster than you can clean it up and

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,169
you really do a disservice to your team by becoming a bottleneck.

00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:29,779
So what you can do here is just get everyone involved.

00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:35,780
A lot of people -- almost everyone -- everyone I know really wants to be a part of this,

00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,429
and wants to help, and they can only do that if you let them know that you need to help,

00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:42,460
that you're doing this, and how they can help.

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,090
Just give them tools to do this.

00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:51,230
So if you do have some time, just spend some of it training your team and getting them

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,930
involved rather than just trying to fix everything yourself.

00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,880
Also make it part of your recruitment process if you can.

00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,870
Make it part of your job description, of your online tests, just put it out there.

00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:09,580
So that was lesson number four for us: Don't take it all out on yourself.

00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,330
Another good way to spread the word is making an event out of it.

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:17,220
We put together a road show in the office where we set some laptops in the middle of

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:23,440
the office and we invited everyone to just try to complete a form using a screenreader.

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,070
And we offered an Amazon gift card as a prize.

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,220
So it was, like, a $20 Amazon gift card but people love Amazon so everyone stopped by.

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,750
So this was a form that you had to fill out.

00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,460
So you can't really easy that much, and you're forced on using the screenreader to do it.

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,870
And a lot of people who stopped by, this was the first time of of them using a screenreader.

00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:45,340
Some of them didn't even know what a screenreader was.

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,890
So this was a great way to expose a lot of people at the same time to accessibility.

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,880
So that's what the form is.

00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,490
It's a very simple form with some annoying menu items if you don't skip them properly.

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,120
And it had some accessibility built in.

00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,440
And the way that we did that was just very crudely blurred things, and disabling clicks,

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,190
and discouraging people, saying not to cheat.

00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:17,601
But this event that we held was probably a highlight in my 15 years of doing this.

00:22:17,601 --> 00:22:18,601
Is this moment.

00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:30,259
That's Patrick Hammond, you probably know him, a seasoned developer, and Patrick, I

00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:35,639
apologize, I'm going to use that for the rest of the year as I talk about this.

00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:40,020
We got that type of reaction from a lot of people, and it was really great because we

00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:45,610
managed to create a space of collective empathy within these 20 minutes or so that people

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,530
did this.

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,820
We had all these people just stepping into someone else's shoes for a minute or two at

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,980
a time but everyone walked away with a new perspective on how people really use the product

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,330
that they were building.

00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,809
So that was lesson number five: Talk about it a lot.

00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:05,809
Make sure you spread the word.

00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:09,840
You never know who's listening and you're probably inspiring more people than you think

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,140
you are.

00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,200
Before we finish, I wanted to take you back to how they really all got started for us

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
at the FT.

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,411
I was in book duty one day and I noticed this card on our JIRA board for bug duty.

00:23:23,411 --> 00:23:31,510
Bug duty is the only place on our JIRA board.

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,890
It said integrate pa11y.

00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,490
I didn't know what pa11y was.

00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:40,290
And when I picked up that card expect and when saw the card, I noticed that it had been

00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:46,980
sitting around for a long time, I saw that Ben Fletcher created it.

00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:56,659
And he's a developer who's deaf-blind and he just made us aware that that is something

00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:59,480
that we should be looking at.

00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:08,700
So that's the next point, diversity will improve the team, it will improve you.

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:15,730
Ben's actions really snowballed into us building a better product.

00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:21,529
Our team learned about accessibility and got a new perspective, and just grew as a team.

00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:26,409
And it led to me standing in front of you all here today.

00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:32,080
So to recap, just the things that you learned, and probably some things that you can do tonight

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,600
in half an hour.

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,169
Accessibility doesn't just happen.

00:24:36,169 --> 00:24:41,000
You can do that in one minute in your project, if you make pa11y-ci as a part of your build

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,269
process with a high threshold, and start getting reports of your accessibility errors.

00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:48,440
Number two, train your people.

00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:54,980
One good way is you could share that Udacity course with your colleagues, that's very quick.

00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:00,549
Throw away your mouse but I do suggest printing out shortcuts beforehand.

00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:05,409
Don't throw it to yourself.

00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:08,910
Get people, get designers, QA, get product involved.

00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,910
Talk about it.

00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:10,910
Go on Twitter.

00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,799
There's a lot of fantastic people out there with great insights on accessibility.

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,730
I'll share some links at the end of this talk.

00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,899
So, yeah, just go over the Twitter feeds and see what they're talking about.

00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:25,799
Retweet that you find interesting, something that inspires you.

00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,390
That can be done very quickly.

00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,361
And the last one, I unfortunately, don't have a magic silver bullet but you can do it in

00:25:31,361 --> 00:25:34,730
30 seconds in your work.

00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:43,220
But if you're involved in hiring, try to prioritize it, and if not, make it a thing that you talk

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:50,200
about it, but it really benefits all those things that we just talked about.

00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,299
A while back, it was probably normal to have this be the only entrance to a public building

00:25:56,299 --> 00:25:57,610
somewhere.

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,540
Now it would be unthinkable to have this.

00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:05,440
But don't wait until it becomes unthinkable to have inaccessible websites.

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,720
The time to make your website accessible is today.

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
So just do it.

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,720
Thank you.

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
>> Thank you so much.

00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,720
That was an excellent talk on why accessibility is so important.

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Also how blind we are to how other people might be using the web.

00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
It's a super important space to work in and, yeah, thank you, again, to Laura.

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,720
We will be moving on to the next talk by Ruth.

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
And as y'all know there's also a second track.

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
We have talk by Jessica Tran, Hacking My Anxiety with Open Source Technology.

00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
So if you're interested in that, that's going to be starting in five minutes, as well.

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
So who's interested in making an interactive visual cool stuff happen with the web?

00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
People into this.

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
Yeah, absolutely!

00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
We're doing a lot of visual stuff that people can access visually, and there's a lot of

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
space in the web area to do that.

00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
And as a warning, there are going to be flashing lights in this presentation, so anybody sensitive

00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
to that, just to be aware.

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
And there's also going to be some sound playing.

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,720
And also with the accessibility talk, I really like the term "spaces of empathy."

00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
I think this is a really great term to talk about being empathic with people and creating

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
a situation in which you can be empathic because it's easy to lose that.

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,720
Do we have any, like, audio-visual artists out there attending?

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
The setup looks really exciting.

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
I can't wait to see it.

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,720
Also, I'll bring this up again, but in the Community Lounge, there's going to be talks

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
during the break, and also some of our sponsors have workshops going on.

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
For example, I know the Mozilla table is going to have a rust workshop if anybody is into

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
that, and later on, another one.

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
So make sure you check out those tables.

00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
There's going to be stuff going on.

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
I'll bring it up again later when we go for lunch.

00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:39,721
