Research shows that by simply regulating their breathing, one may experience less fear, anxiety, and improve memory. Sure, we all could strive to become more mindful and self-aware, but in true programmer fashion, I ask, “why not use technology instead?” Even better, why not use open-source technology to monitor and alert ourselves of these arrhythmic respiratory changes?

	00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,920
Thank you.

00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,920
Hello.

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,920
So yes.

00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,340
My name is Jessica Tran.

00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,130
I am from Montreal.

00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,690
I'm currently a student studying computer science and physics.

00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:47,890
And today I'm going to talk to you about my anxiety and selfmonitoring through technology.

00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,150
So I want to preface this by saying that me and my anxiety are not friends.

00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,059
In the very least.

00:00:55,059 --> 00:01:02,320
To get a sense of our relationship, imagine you have an ex, and you guys are on good terms.

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,810
But you share a lot of the same friends and end up at a lot of the social gatherings.

00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,530
You want to avoid them, but to have fun, you can't.

00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,330
That's a metaphor if I anxiety.

00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:26,060
My palms get sweaty, my heart races and my brain shuts down all processes.

00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,180
And in fact, this is not special at all.

00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,420
It's a universal symptom if you have a healthy brain and body.

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,490
So to get a longitudinal sense of how long I have been dealing with anxiety.

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,400
Let's address my biggest childhood fear.

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,610
This is a big therapy talk for all of us.

00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,380
One of my biggest fears was that I might forget how to breathe.

00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,120
And this sounds really, really dumb.

00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:59,590
But I was like 5 or 7 or 9 or some odd number and I would spend hours concentrating really

00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,610
hard on my breathing just in case the little guy in my head would forget to pull the lever.

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,179
You all thought about this guy when you were young.

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:15,060
But, of course, I eventual learned and breathing is an automatic physiological function.

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,209
I hope all of you have.

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,170
It lies in the same domain as blinking, hunger, exhaustion.

00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:26,090
It's just a way that our body automatically regulates so that cognitive resources can

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:30,569
be spent towards higher thinking, problem solving.

00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:39,030
Nonetheless, even at my ripe old age of 23, I still worry about my breath and overintellectualize

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,060
it.

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,730
To the point it becomes really irregular.

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,480
And that's, again, very natural.

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:52,020
If I were to ask you right now it pay attention to your breath, you would also probably get

00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,069
into an a-rhythm.

00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:55,569
So we can try it out.

00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:57,629
Please pay attention to your breath.

00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:59,069
Are you inhaling?

00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:01,540
What about exhaling?

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,459
Are you on tempo?

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:07,840
Did you remember to inhale?

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Okay.

00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,480
So that was a dumb exercise, but now imagine me doing that to you constantly all the time

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,480
at any moment.

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,489
That's what my anxiety is like.

00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:17,599
And this is my life.

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,410
But I really, really love to problem solve.

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,970
Which is one of my greatest strengths.

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,580
And I tried to address this problem in the best way I know how, which is through a mix

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:34,489
of psychology, philosophy, and JavaScript.

00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:37,680
So starting with psychology.

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,320
There's some studies that show a correlation between breath and mood.

00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:47,530
Basically, when you're in a heightened state like fear or anxiety, your breath rate is

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,909
going to quicken.

00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:55,310
And studies have shown in more recent years that this is a bidirectional mechanism.

00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,290
Meaning while a mood can change your rate of breath, your rate of breath can also change

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,310
your mood.

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,280
Which is really, really cool.

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,950
But we'll get more into that a bit later.

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:11,409
So qualitatively, I wanted to parse out the distinctions of my mood.

00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:17,079
So I just wrote out things that when I'm anxious and when I'm happy.

00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,659
And about last year� late last year, my anxiety was getting really difficult to manage.

00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:31,439
I had moved to a new city, I wasn't fitting in, the bills were surmounting, a few strands

00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,029
of stress I can deal with like most people.

00:04:34,029 --> 00:04:39,999
But eventual it compounded and got in the way of simple functions like eating, sleeping,

00:04:39,999 --> 00:04:43,129
being able to leave my house, and ultimately being productive.

00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:51,279
And it blocked all these things� these small things that made me happy and led you to depression.

00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:53,619
Which is what I like to call the anxiety/depression cycle.

00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:59,219
Can't do things you ought to be doing, and you feel sad.

00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:04,930
And to address it real quick, this is one of the hardest parts about dealing with mental

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,039
health.

00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:11,089
And one of the factors I really tried to address in this experiment.

00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:15,030
Secondly, I don't want to simplify mental health.

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:21,610
I recognize there are a ton of intersectional, biological, environmental and sociologic forces

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,499
that harm and continue it harm people.

00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:31,249
I myself am affected by factors, nonetheless, I carved out this particular aspect because

00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:35,289
it was the easiest to delineate and target.

00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:42,619
Because I'm a� back together, I figured this was the right way to start.

00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:51,659
And my next step was to figure out the mechanism behind this and what it means to be productive.

00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:52,740
So that bring us to the panopticon.

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:59,729
If you don't or do know what it is, and haven't read �Discipline and Punishment� by Michel

00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:03,399
Foucault, you probably have the idea wrong.

00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:12,189
Which I only point out not to be a dick, but before I had it pointed out that it was not

00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:13,460
correct.

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,830
Unlike the way that I'm doing now.

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:21,649
So there's a common misconception with the panopticon presented through mainstream media

00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:24,949
that makes it an analogy towards surveillance society.

00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:33,300
You have seen the sensational articles, the government is watching you, this is the panopticon.

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,889
And one of the great analogies is Sauron from the Lord of the Rings.

00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:49,139
They match with the originally, but it's a quality in which humans attribute characteristics

00:06:49,139 --> 00:07:01,249
such as villainy, evilness� which I want to very much frame right now that that is

00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:02,249
not the case.

00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:08,779
And for Foucault himself in the very beginning of his novel writes that we should not view

00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:12,599
power and surveillance as a negative thing.

00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:21,520
It was first introduced as a humane way to have social order as opposed to torture and

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,580
violence.

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:31,289
While now it is arguably invisible and silence, if we should view it as a mutual and malleable

00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:36,249
mechanism, we can use it for our own positive production of reality.

00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:40,689
So here's my very quick crash course on panopticonism.

00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:46,539
It's named after Jeremy Bentham's ideal prison.

00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:51,530
It's a cylindrical structure, a prison.

00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,129
And around the cells we have openfaced cells.

00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:58,649
And in the very center we have a guard.

00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:01,550
Just one single guard in this tower.

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,239
It's protected by trick glass so the guard can see out, but the prisoners cannot see

00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,239
in.

00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:13,509
And this mechanism, this is the most ideal and efficient use of this power.

00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:19,059
Because this possibility of always being watched will imbue the prisoner with an anxiousness

00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:21,479
to behave well.

00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:29,159
Which should, by the power of the panopticon, lead to the development of our own selfmonitoring

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:32,550
for good behavior.

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:34,370
The panopticon is polyvalent.

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,810
Means that the guard could be changed for anybody.

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,899
Your school teacher, your parents, your sibling, your friend, that guy on Twitter.

00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,980
Anyone.

00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,690
And it would still function without interruption.

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:54,360
Each node in this network can be swapped out and replaced at any given time, which is what

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,090
makes it so pervasive and powerful.

00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:03,690
With the perception that everyone or anyone could be watching you, you must fulfill your

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,899
social contract.

00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:10,779
And the panopticon rests on this power of observation to form good habits.

00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:20,769
So by definition, Foucault's panopticon is just a way to enforce a specific behavior.

00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,529
It can take many forms.

00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:29,550
So, for example, school welcomes hospitals, prisons, the new language, ten ways to make

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,449
yourself more productive, social networks, et cetera.

00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:36,759
It sounds a little scary, but it's not.

00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:41,639
It's actually meant to condition onesself for selfdiscipline.

00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:50,089
So using this and combining it with Pavlov's dog, which I'm sure all of you know the classical

00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,220
conditioning mechanism.

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,410
It's just the saliva and the trigger and the response.

00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:02,240
You have a really good recipe to improve one's life.

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:13,250
And combining this with� with heart rate variability, it's a very nice slide� I created

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,980
an app.

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,100
Anyways.

00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,350
So the panopticon itself is just an amplifier for things that already exist.

00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,350
It's not scary.

00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:29,110
It's not so much like Sauron, but Cerebro from XMen.

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,880
It can be exploitative, but also used for good.

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,560
Which is what we're going to do.

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,329
Getting into the technical stuff.

00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:35,980
Heart rate variability.

00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:43,450
When you inhale, your heart rate increases, and while you exhale, your heart rate decreases.

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,470
And if you plot this on a time function you get a really nice line.

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,620
And it's very distinct.

00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:56,360
And just an FYI, the Y axis is your interbeat interval, the time in between each beat.

00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,800
This is not to be mistaken for BPM which is beats per minute.

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,149
And it's just an approximation.

00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:12,490
So one of the reasons why I got started with this project was, A, my anxiety got pretty

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,490
bad.

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,660
B, I was actually doing an internship through Node with Outreachy, and we were working on

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,180
Node's serial port.

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:29,600
So I wanted to do a fun little project to figure out how this code base worked at all.

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,380
And I settled on something that was beneficial for me.

00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:38,899
I wanted to do a live demo, but my pulse sensor didn't work really well, so in short what

00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:45,339
I did was I just used Node serial port, a bunch of npm node packages and I designed

00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:51,560
this little heart rate monitor on my CLI.

00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,870
And read in my heart rate.

00:11:53,870 --> 00:12:02,439
So I'm sorry if you can't see that line really well, but this is me breathing at a resting

00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:03,439
heart rate.

00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:06,819
So this is� this is me not doing anything at all.

00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:11,730
And you can kind of see, naturally, as we know, as you breathe in and exhale, your heart

00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,680
rate goes up and down, plot that, it goes up and down.

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,249
It's not really predictable.

00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:21,449
And there's no way to really put this into an equation.

00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:27,149
However, if you breathe really deeply and regularly, you can increase� you can create

00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:31,699
these really beautiful sinusoidal wave lines.

00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:37,579
And this increase in amplitude and the consistency of the graph is sort of the heart of this

00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:38,660
project.

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,790
And this is called heart rate variability.

00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,560
You can see the heart rate is higher than before.

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,509
The greater the heart rate variability, the greater the physical health, and leads to

00:12:52,509 --> 00:13:01,839
psychological well-being, stress management, anxiety management, cardiac health.

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:11,110
So this is just a video of me� whoops� doing some breathing exercises.

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,170
As you can see here, with a metronome.

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:24,170
This is six cycles per minute which is what is called a resonance frequency.

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:30,529
Resonance frequency is basically just the most efficient rate that you can breathe to

00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:33,069
really flex your breathing systems.

00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:36,529
Also known as your autonomic nervous system.

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:37,740
This is a simple graph.

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:45,019
You can determine your resonance frequency by going through different cycles.

00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:50,120
You can breathe at 4 cycles a minute, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6.

00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,800
And you can see on the plot line, 6 is the highest.

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,960
It just dipped before 5.5.

00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,870
Just a really beautiful, beautiful graph.

00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:05,930
So the best amplitude it your greatest HRV.

00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:13,720
For most people, it is 6 cycles per minute, or .1 hertz if you throw it through a pass

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,769
function.

00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:21,150
And even if you're at like 5.5 or 6.5, you could still do around 6 and still get the

00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,720
same results.

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,379
So what can we do with this?

00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:34,180
We can basically just exercise our breathing mechanism to really flex our A and S or automatic

00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,750
nervous system.

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,759
If you do this� this has been done multiple times through a lot of different studies through

00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,800
different groups.

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,930
Healthy functioning athletes to depressed individual.

00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:55,709
Do this resonance frequency breathing 20 minutes a day, maybe 40 minutes a day with some intermittent

00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:00,819
biofeedback training and it can improve your mood regulation, your anxiety, et cetera,

00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:01,819
et cetera.

00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:02,879
Very, very cool.

00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:08,000
But one of the biggest and most important factors, I find, is that through this training,

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,100
the effects are chronic.

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,240
And persistent.

00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,410
So say you do this for a few weeks.

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,620
You stop.

00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,149
The effects will be long lasting.

00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,310
I'm not too sure what the TK is, that hasn't been studied.

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,069
But it still works even if you're not doing these breathing exercises.

00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:28,629
Which I really found cool.

00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,250
The regimen, 20 minutes daily.

00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,250
Relaxed breathing.

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:37,819
Which is just you watch the visual graph of your IBI coming in, the one that I showed

00:15:37,819 --> 00:15:38,819
earlier.

00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:43,529
And you just inhale as the line is coming up, and when it reaches the crest, you just

00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:44,529
exhale.

00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:46,760
And that's relaxed breathing and you this very regularly.

00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:53,269
And this changes your A and S. So I tried to couple this with a monitoring

00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:59,339
system by setting this up with a Bluetooth Arduino to calculate my average rolling heart

00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:03,910
rate, which worked really well despite integrating values.

00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,170
Full resting heart rate and resonance training.

00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:12,230
But it was really, really hard to calculate in realworld scenarios.

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,600
The reason being, as your breath quickens, the variance of your heart rate actually begins

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,449
to plateau from lack of variability.

00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:28,100
It becomes algorithmically very hard to determine your breath cycles per minute without a huge

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,740
margin of error.

00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:39,360
One accurate way to measure this is to have purchased a respiration device that connected

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,790
to your chest or to your nose.

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,660
But I didn't.

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,170
So instead I used the principles of the panopticon because, of course, it is polyvalent.

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,899
It can be used in any way and I designed this experiment to get my controls.

00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:55,990
I would do different things to exasperate my anxiety.

00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,230
Typical psychology things, pinch myself.

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,439
Post things online that I wouldn't normally do.

00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,510
Things that make me nervous inherently.

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,779
So here's a few examples.

00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:10,230
This is just a recreation that I did.

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,689
But I did do things like this.

00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:16,279
It was just message people that I liked.

00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,760
And measured in my heart rate.

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,579
This didn't go anywhere, just so you guys know.

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,830
[ Laughter ] And so, I also tried to program� or I did

00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,120
program my own panopticon.

00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:38,730
Meaning, well, it was more so what you could call yet another productivity tool.

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:44,870
So remember the panopticon does not necessitate constant observation, it's merely perceived

00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,960
constant observation.

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:52,750
So, again, leveraging my social anxiety, I used a bunch of npm packages to program a

00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,370
Cron job, to check if I was doing my daily logs.

00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:02,990
And I described a set of punishments for myself if I didn't do it by a set amount of time.

00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,140
The first tier, I wrote out all these things to send myself.

00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,260
When you're not doing the things you are supposed to be doing and you're angry.

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,100
I would call myself an awful human being.

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,130
Which wasn't very nice.

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,520
But that was the punishment.

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,169
I would send out inane Tweets to Twitterland.

00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:29,759
Although I recognize this is just how Twitter it, so it wasn't really a punishment.

00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,779
[ Laughter ] Tier three I had a bunch of, like, embarrassing

00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:39,500
things to send to like crushes or exes.

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,750
And thankfully I never reached here, but that would have been pretty much the worst for

00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,750
many reasons.

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:52,909
[ Laughter ] So ultimately the experiment was a redundancy

00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:54,390
of a lot of different methods.

00:18:54,390 --> 00:19:03,049
So, A, I used the exercise that had been tested to show improvements of mood regulation.

00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:10,440
I experimented with my anxiety coming in and measured it, which was a form of exposure

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,130
therapy, or rejection therapy.

00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:20,480
I built this accountability mechanism to watch over me, or my own personal panopticon.

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,760
And also, the act of writing down those thoughts that I had was a bit therapeutic.

00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,549
So I asked the question here, was it successful?

00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:37,520
I did go from a 24 resting heart rate� or 24 breaths per minute to like 22.

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,840
But I don't know if that's like really important to note.

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,320
But essentially part of the experiment.

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:54,630
I selfobserved that I have an improved control of my thoughts and ruminated a lot less.

00:19:54,630 --> 00:20:05,590
I can� I feel that I can distinguish when I'm getting anxious or am in a state of anxiety.

00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:10,890
And instead of using selfcoping mechanisms that didn't really solve the problem, I just

00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,900
employed this breathing technique, which is what I was doing before this talk, actually.

00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,670
And a bit of less social anxiety.

00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:25,500
And ultimately improved my feelings of efficacy across all areas.

00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,309
I wanted to note, though, that before you try this at home, and if you do plan to, there

00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:38,110
are some really important factors that could have contributed to all these positive effects.

00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,550
Which was� tada.

00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,990
So I got used to the new city.

00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,630
I built some meaningful relationships.

00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,090
I began therapy for the first time.

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:53,700
I exercised and I decreased a lot of my stressors from school and work ending.

00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:03,040
So, again, with mental health, it's hard to parse through and figure out what's� which

00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,510
factors are the main ones.

00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:12,760
And what has the alchemy to improve.

00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:18,299
So in conclusion, I wanted to wrap this up meaningfully.

00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:23,990
But I didn't want to end up saying something like, me and my anxiety are now best pals.

00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,820
Because I feel like that's a false optimism.

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,730
And frankly, just not true.

00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:39,870
If I could choose a physiology in which I didn't experience debilitating anxiety, I

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:46,140
didn't have to think about it this hard, and didn't have to do so many things to manage

00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:54,020
it, ten times out of ten, no question, I would definitely choose that body.

00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,669
But nonetheless, this is just who I am.

00:21:58,669 --> 00:22:05,010
And so what I have in closing for you instead is this clip from Star Trek.

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:10,490
Because I feel like that show just says things that I wish I could say all the time and says

00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:11,640
it so much better.

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,039
And if you're unfamiliar with the show well, first, familiarize yourself.

00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:23,890
And all you need to know about this is that it features Data, an android who is perfect

00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,100
in every way except that he's not human.

00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:34,149
And in this particular clip, he is speaking to his android daughter who also shares this

00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:35,149
flaw.

00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:36,149
So here we go.

00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:37,149
>> You, but I'm� >> This is a limitation.

00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:38,149
>> Then why do you still try to� what purpose does it serve except [inaudible] that you

00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:39,149
are in� >> I have been there many times.

00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,149
Trying to be more human.

00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:41,149
Until I realized that it is� that is most important.

00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:42,149
Striving to be more than� it does not matter that we will never reach our ultimate goal.

00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:43,149
>> All right.

00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:44,149
And that's the end of my talk.

00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:45,149
[ Applause ] Thank you for listening.

00:22:45,149 --> 00:22:46,149
[ Applause ] >> Thank you so, so much.

00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:47,149
That was absolutely fantastic.

00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:48,149
Please, another round of applause there.

00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:49,149
That was absolutely wonderful.

00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:50,149
>> Thank you.

00:22:50,149 --> 00:22:51,149
[ Applause ] >> So if you go for lunch now, lunch is ready

00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:52,149
for you.

00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:53,149
And please don't forget, there's some community talks� some lightning talks in the community

00:22:53,149 --> 00:22:54,149
lounge.

00:22:54,149 --> 00:22:55,149
So go over there for talks on UX and other things like that.

00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:56,149
See you back here at� well, after lunch.

00:22:56,149 --> 00:22:57,149
>> Thank you.

00:22:57,149 --> 00:22:58,149
