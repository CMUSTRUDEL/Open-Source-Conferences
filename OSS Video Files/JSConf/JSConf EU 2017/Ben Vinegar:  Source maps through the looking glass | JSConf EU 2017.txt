You’re probably familiar with source maps – they let you debug your original, unminified and untranspiled code in the browser. But ever wonder how they actually work? In this talk, we deep dive into the source map format to see what’s under the hood. We’ll cover source map generation tools and parsers, and learn how to manipulate source maps directly for fun and profit.
