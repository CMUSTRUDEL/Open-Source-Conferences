Whitney Williams - The Legacy of the JavaScript Community

00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,329
Hi, my name is Whitney Williams.

00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:43,940
My job is to translate design thinking and UX principles into performant-friendly and

00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,260
user-friendly front-end code.

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,260
Why am I here today?

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,079
I'm here to spark a conversation about the legacy of the JavaScript community.

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,309
I've talked to a lot of you already but what does this mean and what is your talk about?

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,600
I've given away a little piece of it but hopeful stayed enough to make you stay until the very

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,900
end of the conference.

00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:08,679
If you have questions, you can follow me on Twitter.

00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:15,240
I can talk to you at the after party where finally I can get excited and not have to

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,779
go to bed early!

00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:21,979
This story is pretty simple.

00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:26,719
When I was a little girl, every morning, I was really terrible at brushing my hair.

00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,090
That seems likes yeah, how does this fit into a JavaScript conference?

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,709
I promise it is coming.

00:01:31,709 --> 00:01:37,780
When I was little, I was terrible at brushing my hair, and my mom would help me brush it

00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,780
out.

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,259
Every morning, I had a question for her.

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:46,060
The question was, "What do you think I'm going to be when I grow up?"

00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,600
My mom came up with a different answer every morning.

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,999
He said, "I think you're going to be an astronaut."

00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:53,869
I went to space camp.

00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:56,899
I said what am I going to be when I grow up?

00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:01,079
"I think you're going to be a baker."

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,599
I think yes, I could be a baker too.

00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,480
Every morning, she would tell me a different answer, and I realised one morning, she wasn't

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,120
going to give me an answer that was right.

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,090
She couldn't predict the future, so I just stopped asking.

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,250
It was that sudden.

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,860
But I think it is that simple routine that really cemented my belief that I could do

00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,220
anything.

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:34,689
But telling that story, the reason I tell you, it is because I think small actions have

00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,700
a really big impact in the world.

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,840
And, in JavaScript, we're so wrapped up in the immediacy, so wrapped up in seeing results

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,170
like right now, and we've heard people talk about shaving off milliseconds, and, when

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:54,620
it comes to JavaScript, that stuff is really, really cool, but it also has sort of a darker

00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,459
backside where we sort of forget that the actions that we take right now can sometimes

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,219
take months or even years to see the full effect.

00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:07,510
When I talk about full effect, I'm talking about in the community, not just in the browser,

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,530
but in the people that surround us, and so what may seem like these small, trivial, almost

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,390
kitschy behaviours can become significant in ways we didn't imagine.

00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,969
When I told you the story about me brushing my hair, it seemed silly, but it was impactful

00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:31,610
in how I saw myself as a person in the world - like what can I really be when I grow up?

00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,079
Throughout this talk, I want you to think not just who you can be when you grow up,

00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,980
but who can the community be?

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,999
Who can JavaScript be?

00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:45,090
What is JavaScript going to look like in the future?

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,849
So I think another thing to think about is our community really needs leaders.

00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:57,719
The JavaScript community and the people who embrace JavaScript grow, it becomes ever more

00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:03,810
important we need the kind, gentle guidance that my mom gave me when I was a little kid.

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:10,000
But the big thing is that it's not going to be a parent or standards body like TC39 that

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,159
maybe leads the way and says, "This is what is going to happen."

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,920
It's not going to come from one individual person, and it's not going to come from a

00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,270
tiny little group of people, but instead, leadership is going to come by the many and

00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,800
not by the few, so it is not one person, it's all of us, and so it is the responsibility

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,669
of all of us just to come together and determine the legacy of the JavaScript community.

00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:41,180
So, when I say legacy, like what is legacy even mean?

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,300
I think a lot of times in software, we tend to associate the word "legacy" and specifically

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,860
legacy in the sense of code as being old, broken, irrelevant, as something that is really

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,930
almost negative, like when was the last time that you heard someone talk about legacy software?

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:06,240
And like a in a great and exciting way, and I can't wait to get this on my marsh working?

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,449
I think that that sort of sad because originally, when the word "legacy" originated in the 14th

00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:16,280
century, it had a completely different meaning.

00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,750
That meaning was a lot more affirmative, a lot more positive, and it was this: a body

00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,699
of Terence sent on a mission.

00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,682
So -- a body of persons sent on a mission.

00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:33,930
What I like to refer to when I think of legacy is that this is who we are as JavaScripters.

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,509
We're a body of persons sent on a mission to shape the world, not just through our code

00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:44,900
but also by our vision for the future of the language and the people that surround it.

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,030
Seeing ourselves in this way, like seeing ourselves as part of this living legacy, as

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,710
stewards of the greater good, is critical for two really important reasons.

00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,410
Agency and empowerment.

00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:04,270
When I say agency, I mean we don't need to wait for the permission of someone else to

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,680
make a change or to lead or to take charge, and so this ability to shape the direction

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,720
and influence the future of our community, like that's super impactful, and this directs

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
is just incredible.

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,819
I mean, when I talk about empowerment, I mean that it ensures by being active participants

00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:28,630
rather than passive bystanders, we don't leave the hard work of care taking, the hard work

00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,830
of inclusion, and the hard work of community to others.

00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,220
Lucky there is everybody's job.

00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,849
This is my - like in is my job, your job, everybody's job.

00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:44,680
This is the price you pay for being a member of the JavaScript community.

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,781
So, when I say "legacy" I would like really to boil it down into two simple things, two

00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:53,629
simple words and that is: people and progress.

00:06:53,629 --> 00:07:01,039
I think a lot of us, it is really difficult to boil stuff down to just the most common

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:08,150
tiny little factor that everyone understands, but the purpose of JavaScript is people, and

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:13,729
I think a lot of times, we get really mixed up because we think JavaScript is a lot of

00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:18,759
things - like JavaScript is conferences, and JavaScript is functions, and like JavaScript

00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,720
is all of these different things, but that's a mistake.

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,409
JavaScript really is the people and the community that surrounds the language and the people

00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:33,449
that interact with it rather than just the language itself.

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:38,199
So what I like to say when I say "legacy of the JavaScript community," when I think about

00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:44,960
that legacy, what I think about is not JavaScript and not what new features are we going to

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,150
add, how are we going to make it faster and more impactful?

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:52,979
How are we going to get it running in all of the browsers so super fast and offline

00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:59,640
first, and all these things, those are all great, but people first always.

00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:09,340
When we define our vision, our ideas about the legacy of the JavaScript community, maybe

00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,150
it makes a little bit more sense to sort of step back in history before a sort of attempt

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,680
to merge this path forward.

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,160
When you think about it, from the earliest days, JavaScript has been a foundational technology,

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,939
and despite the central role, something really unfortunate has happened.

00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,560
I think what has happened is that a lot of people tend to look down on us as JavaScript

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,650
developers, so developers who write primarily JavaScript are considered less than developers

00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,120
who write code for other languages.

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,750
A lot of times because we say, "JavaScript has really broad appeal, and a lot of people

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,370
can get started with JavaScript.

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:50,150
It's relatively easy to use."

00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:56,230
We use this as evidence that JavaScript has an inferior status, but it is not a real programming

00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,980
language, that you're not a real developer.

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,370
I think that is just flat-out wrong, to be honest.

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:08,350
So these classifications, they're misguided, and I think when we look at JavaScript as

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:14,660
a language, it brings to light a lot of JavaScript subtleties, and the language reveals that

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:20,230
JavaScript is actually really, really nuanced and complex, and we look at JavaScript when

00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,670
you think I've got this totally figured out, I'm going to run my function, and you run

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:27,840
it, and you think, "Wait."

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:33,220
That is a lot how we sort of need to think about the JavaScript community.

00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:40,030
On the surface, JavaScript may seem incredibly simple, and it may seem really easy just to

00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,760
apply these stereotypical programmer tropes to say, "I know what a JavaScript developer

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
looks like."

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,100
But on further inspection these I think that clich�s are wrong", untruthful, misguiding,

00:09:52,100 --> 00:10:02,600
and limited, and that's something I would really like to change.

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,960
So who hey as a community?

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,790
If we brush aside these silly ideas, who are we really?

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,000
What does meaning a community in the modern age really mean?

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,100
I think, honestly, community can be a group of members who share common characteristics

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:24,750
or interests and who often share a common historical and cultural heritage.

00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:30,120
Some of you might, when I say common cultural and historical heritage, might get a little

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,700
bit shaky.

00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,760
Stick with me here for a second.

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,230
A superficial glance at this definition can lead us in the wrong direction.

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,040
Look at you today, what I see is incredible diversity, and having listened to all the

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,570
talks, I've heard a lot of diversity and a lot of support for diversity, and we are people

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,890
of all ages, genders, people of all backgrounds, different sorts of beliefs, and a lot of us

00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:00,590
have different mother tongues - that's something I've noticed at JSConf EU in particular, there

00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:04,890
are a lot of different spoken languages.

00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:10,110
We also come from a lot of different places, and so the country that's printed on our passport

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,840
may not actually be the country that we most identify with.

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,610
And maybe it is just one part of an incredibly larger more detailed story.

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:24,210
So having heard all of the talks, having listened to people in the hallway, having seen everyone

00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:29,570
interact and seeing people treat each other with so much love and respect, what I would

00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:34,450
like to say is that it's clear that the characteristics and the interest that we share resolve around

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:40,690
JavaScript and programming, and around this need to make and build, and that is something

00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:46,490
that, regardless of where you come from, regardless of what gender you are, regardless of how

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:53,520
old you are, like JavaScript and this need to make cool stuff, like that is something

00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,330
that we all share.

00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,790
So, when I talk about heritage, I'm not talking about our genetics, I'm not talking about

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,210
a physical place or a spoken language, but a belief in the power of the web, and, most

00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:11,940
importantly, it is not these differences, or it is not despite these differences but

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,920
actually because of these differences that we are so uniquely prepared to share in the

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,890
mission of the web.

00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:25,750
So, the web is here to stay, and because of that, we as JavaScripters, as individuals

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,552
and as a community, we are obligated to create and maintain the culture of the ideas, the

00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:37,190
beliefs that will be carried forth by the next generation of JavaScripters, and those

00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,450
in a future that is so distant that we can hardly imagine what it is going to become,

00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:47,600
so the culture that we create today is going to go for the and shape the next generation

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
of JavaScripters.

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,030
Whether we actually intend for it or not, that's something that's going to happen.

00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:59,790
So, one of the things I think is really, really important is that JavaScript is open to all.

00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,310
One of the language's most most compelling features is its openness.

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:09,630
Even before we write our first function, many of us were looking into other people's website

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,951
and viewing the source and trying to figure out, "How did they do that?

00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:17,330
What did they write that made a particular thing happen?"

00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,690
We might not understand how code actually works, we might not understand who makes it

00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:28,430
useful or who wrote it, but it is the simple act of opening the control panel and viewing

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:34,060
this source, and being curious is instrumental because we're we might not consider ourselves

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:40,590
developers at this point, but it is this curiosity and in desire to understand JavaScript and

00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:45,910
the desire to understand what is going on under the hood which actually grants us membership

00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,010
to the community.

00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:52,850
I think a lot of times, when we are trying to sort of design these barriers to entry

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:58,470
of who is a JavaScripter, like who gets to label themselves as a developer, what we hear

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,730
a lot of times is negativity, and we hear this community of voices that would like to

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,070
set up barriers that I think are just, they're wrong, and they're silly, and they're not

00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:14,800
helpful, and we limit membership because we are trying to sort of get a handle on things.

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:21,510
And so what we end up hearing a lot of times from people who maybe have good intentions,

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:27,350
but go about things the wrong way is stuff like, these people are not developers.

00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,570
These people don't belong.

00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:34,160
These people don't use JavaScript the same way that I use JavaScript, and so they don't

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,660
struggle with the same concepts that I'm struggling with, so they're probably just pretending

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,260
they're not real JavaScripters.

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,910
You know what?

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,910
That's just wrong.

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:51,950
Like that's not true.

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,410
[Applause].

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:02,110
When they feel as though defining the JavaScript community in such a broad way is problematic,

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,730
why is that?

00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,160
Why are we trying to figure out who we are.

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,730
Why are we figuring out who are our people?

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,010
That's like finding your community.

00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,010
That's human nature.

00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,010
And that's okay.

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:16,720
It is okay to want to know that you belong.

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,170
But when we create this really broad definition, it has some really side effects.

00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,260
One of those things is that by creating this broad definition, and it includes a lot of

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:31,010
people that maybe we wouldn't have initially labelled ago JavaScript developers, and that's

00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:36,750
okay, but I will give you a couple of examples of people that you might not think of as JavaScripters,

00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,240
but going on forward after - JavaScript developers but going forward today, I would like you

00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,860
to rethink about that.

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:50,980
JavaScript developers includes a ten-year-old I taught to script on his homework and he

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:59,080
said I've done all of the Code Academy for JavaScript and this is super interesting.

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,140
And this kid is ten.

00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,860
Like holy cow, that's phenomenal.

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,660
The JavaScript community includes people like designers who are writing CSS most of the

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,510
time and they can write enough to get the stuff working.

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,240
We may not think of them as JavaScript developers, but we should.

00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,230
I think also it includes people who are writing JavaScript, make on the side, part-time, and

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,200
it is not a career for them, and maybe they are in college, or maybe they are in code

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,290
school looking for a new career.

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:38,870
When I said "code school" maybe some of you thought, "I don't know about that."

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,170
When I say "code school" what I don't mean is that students become members as soon as

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,920
they graduate.

00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:51,670
What I mean is not that they built their first website or finish, I mean on the very first

00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:57,730
day of class, like becoming a member of the JavaScript community is not something that

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:05,039
magically happens because someone granted you a - magically happens because you were

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,770
granted a privilege.

00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,409
It happens because you got curious.

00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:14,380
Like every one of you belong here.

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,220
You are enough.

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,900
[Applause].

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:33,450
So, just starting of thinking we can sort of erect, that we can define a set of rules

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:41,399
about who belongs in the JavaScript community is limiting, and it's defeating, and it is

00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:43,120
wrong.

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,480
So, how do we lead a community that is so super diverse?

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:54,809
How do we lead a community now and in the future.

00:17:54,809 --> 00:18:02,919
I think that earlier, when we [sound cut] it is time now to examine the word "leadership"

00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:05,740
and leadership is something pretty simple.

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,470
It is an act or an instance, it is a really fleeting moment.

00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:13,820
A leader is someone who provides guidance; a leader is someone who provides direction.

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,409
But let's think about that a little bit more.

00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:17,980
An act or an instance.

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:25,169
If we dive deeper, we find that leadership isn't a status that's granted after months

00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:28,289
or years of slowly gaining recognition.

00:18:28,289 --> 00:18:31,960
Leadership is something that can be fleeting, it can happen in a moment, and then it can

00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,049
disappear a moment later.

00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:36,120
This definition is really incredible.

00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,460
When you think about it, it is quite empowering, because in order to be a true leader in the

00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,670
JavaScript community, you don't need to be on the stage.

00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:48,460
You don't need a lot of Twitter followers, you don't need a blog or a deep understanding

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,960
of JavaScript itself.

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,620
And when I think it is really about is that leadership is not the loudest voice in the

00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,620
room.

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:01,210
Yes, of course there are things like technical leadership, so, researching a project and

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:05,490
understanding the costs and benefits of different frameworks, like absolutely, that's a form

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,410
of leadership.

00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:11,539
Being able to speak confidently about what is the right trace for your project, that's

00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:15,580
leadership, but being a leader, showing a leader can also be entirely non-technical,

00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,970
and often that can mean simply doing the right thing in the moment.

00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:25,149
What I'm talking about is making space for marginalised people of the community to speak.

00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:30,970
What I'm talking about is listening even when you think that you already know the best,

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:37,500
making the effort to use the correct pronounce for someone, not the preferred - just the

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,929
ones that are right.

00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:46,669
And I think what is really important that being a leader is not being the loudest voice

00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:49,009
in the room.

00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:54,370
Being a leader is actually not about having experience, it is just about helping others

00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,370
learn.

00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,980
It is about creating a culture where it is okay to make mistakes, it is okay to be wrong,

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,590
it is to sort of say, "Hey, I don't know something."

00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:11,649
It's not a culture where we invite retribution or start to pile on and say, "Yes, you shouldn't

00:20:11,649 --> 00:20:13,629
have done that."

00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:19,200
We want to create a culture where we have kind, constructive feedback.

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,759
Being a leader is not doing the right thing when it is easy, it is doing the right thing

00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:28,549
when it's hard - especially when it is hard.

00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:35,679
A thing that I would also like to say, that really before we continue, I want to step

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,490
back and think about something, and there was a really, really great talk yesterday

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:46,659
that touched on this, and, unfortunately, one aspect of the tech community is that sadly

00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:51,270
leadership and participation are just not equally attainable to everyone.

00:20:51,270 --> 00:21:00,919
I it is frustrating and wrong.

00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:07,029
Being part of this community, being part of this conference, being part of just the world

00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:14,009
at large, the boundaries that are faced by membership, by members of the JavaScript community

00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:20,509
are they're just - they're really harmful, and harmful not just to this one individual

00:21:20,509 --> 00:21:26,499
but harmful to the entire community, because they obstruct access and progress to the individual,

00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:31,879
but they also create these ripple effects that we don't see until later on.

00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:36,980
Like I said I wanted to grow up to be succeed in my mom couldn't predict the future.

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:44,179
A lot of the time when we talk about leadership or talk about small actions, being nice to

00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:49,220
someone, making space for someone, letting someone speak may seem like an incredibly

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,200
small thing to you in the moment, but ten years later, it may be that tiny moment they

00:21:54,200 --> 00:22:01,530
see as like the pinnacle of how they started to feel like they were truly part of the JavaScript

00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,879
community.

00:22:02,879 --> 00:22:09,530
So I think ultimately, being a part of this community, those of us with more power, with

00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:15,100
more voice, with more privilege, what we need to do is to try to remove the barriers for

00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:22,090
other people, barriers that are both seen and unseen, remove the barriers for the people

00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:27,480
and support them, and encourage them to face obstacles when we haven't had to overcome

00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,440
those obstacles ourselves.

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,470
We can really create real change.

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:39,309
So as the language of the web, JavaScript is uniquely positioned in the sense that we

00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:44,510
have a power to affect the broader community, more than just JavaScript, we can really change

00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,980
the world.

00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:51,559
And so before we sort of look back on the people and the technologies that came before

00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:56,950
us, like don't be field, JavaScript is here for now, and it's going to be here in the

00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:00,390
future, but it is not always going to be like that.

00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:05,919
It is really easy to believe that the blog post that we read, the podcast that we listen

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:12,309
to, the MPM packages and the GitHub repositories that we know are always going to be there

00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:17,299
because we download them and build with them every day, the conferences where we love,

00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:23,370
the meet-ups where we gather, we have a tendency to believe they are always there, like in

00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,590
the atmosphere, never going to go away.

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,289
And that's wrong.

00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:32,549
And the reason these things are not always going to be there is because they are built

00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:34,470
by the community.

00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,080
And is to the JavaScript community, like all community, is made up of individuals.

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,870
We are building the products, the tools, and the languages of the future.

00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:49,669
We are shaping the world in exciting and important ways, but without the people, everything else

00:23:49,669 --> 00:23:51,080
disappears.

00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,700
JavaScript is underpinned by all of these individuals, and you can start taking off

00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:02,080
one by one by one, you could remove each one of us and JavaScript might be there, but if

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,160
you took away all of the people, JavaScript itself is just not useful any more.

00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,639
So, in closing, I would sort of like to leave you with this: every morning, when you wake

00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:18,929
up, when you're getting ready for the day, when you're thinking about the future, and

00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:23,400
you're thinking about maybe what you want to be when you grow up, or how you can contribute

00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:30,539
to the future, I would like you to think sort of what can you contribute to to the community?

00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,929
What can the community be when it grows up?

00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:41,820
Each of us possesses different skills and how to go about best when thinking about leading.

00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,539
What would you wish for our community.

00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:52,120
The beat of JavaScript, this community we've built, and this technology that we love, is

00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,840
that by each of us as individuals, by doing our part and leading and contributing in ways

00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:03,659
that don't disguise our diversity but instead just sort highlight, something magical happens,

00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:08,107
JavaScript becomes this living legacy of not just - what it becomes like I said before

00:25:08,107 --> 00:25:09,107
is this body of persons that was sent on a mission to shape the road, not just through

00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,107
code, but also by our vision for the language and the vision of the future for the community

00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:11,107
of people that surround it.

00:25:11,107 --> 00:25:12,107
Thanks.

00:25:12,107 --> 00:25:13,107
[Applause] [Cheering].

00:25:13,107 --> 00:25:14,107
>> Thank you, Whitney, for rounding off the conference with such an inspiring talk, such

00:25:14,107 --> 00:25:15,107
a pertinent talk.

00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:16,107
Before you all run off, we have a few last things that are going to happen.

00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:17,107
I have one announcement coming from one of our speakers.

00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:18,107
Nidin Vinayakan, he did a talk earlier about shared memory in JavaScript, and he wanted

00:25:18,107 --> 00:25:19,107
to let you all know that his project Turboscript is open source.

00:25:19,107 --> 00:25:20,107
You can find it on GitHub.

00:25:20,107 --> 00:25:21,107
And he would love to hear from all of you.

00:25:21,107 --> 00:25:22,107
As a second announcement, we have had a raffle at the Google Cloud table, and we are going

00:25:22,107 --> 00:25:23,107
to let Miles come up and take over regarding that.

00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:24,107
>> Quick round of applause for everyone who organised this amazing event.

00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:25,107
[Applause].

00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,107
[Cheering].

00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:27,107
Every little detail has been phenomenal.

00:25:27,107 --> 00:25:28,107
I accidentally had Twitter open instead of the names of the winners.

00:25:28,107 --> 00:25:29,107
Do you want me to read you tweets instead?

00:25:29,107 --> 00:25:30,107
We've already sorted these, and the first winner, just get up and come up here.

00:25:30,107 --> 00:25:31,107
If I don't see you, we will go to the next person.

00:25:31,107 --> 00:25:32,107
The first winner is Bimbola Aidowu.

00:25:32,107 --> 00:25:33,107
Big round of applause.

00:25:33,107 --> 00:25:34,107
Wooh!

00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:35,107
[Applause].

00:25:35,107 --> 00:25:36,107
Thank you for coming and giving us the time to try everything.

00:25:36,107 --> 00:25:37,107
We really appreciate it.

00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:38,107
Thank you.

00:25:38,107 --> 00:25:39,107
Okay.

00:25:39,107 --> 00:25:40,107
Coming up next: Bram Gotink.

00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:41,107
Wooh!

00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,107
[Applause].

00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:43,107
Thank you very much, Bram.

00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:44,107
And, last but not least, Loenid Peneethch Madek Panik?

00:25:44,107 --> 00:25:45,107
[Applause].

00:25:45,107 --> 00:25:46,107
Thank you very much.

00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:47,107
Thank you all so much for your time, letting me be up here, to all speakers - you did a

00:25:47,107 --> 00:25:48,107
wonderful job, I know how hard it can be - and the organisers.

00:25:48,107 --> 00:25:49,107
This place is very special, and I appreciate being here.

00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:50,107
Thank you.

00:25:50,107 --> 00:25:51,107
[Applause].

00:25:51,107 --> 00:25:52,107
>> Obviously, we rehearsed this.

00:25:52,107 --> 00:25:53,107
At least five times.

00:25:53,107 --> 00:25:54,107
So this is JSConf EU number 8.

00:25:54,107 --> 00:25:55,107
[Applause].

00:25:55,107 --> 00:25:56,107
We could not do this without our sponsors, and I will leave the list up a little bit.

00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:57,107
Yeah.

00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:58,107
Just marvel at all these sponsors.

00:25:58,107 --> 00:25:59,107
Everyone who is here from a sponsor, please stand up so we can see who is here and who

00:25:59,107 --> 00:26:00,107
supported the event.

00:26:00,107 --> 00:26:01,107
Everyone, get up!

00:26:01,107 --> 00:26:02,107
[Applause].

00:26:02,107 --> 00:26:03,107
I would like to invite two more people on stage now, which is Fayle and Zimona.

00:26:03,107 --> 00:26:04,107
They've done the communication invitations run the errors in the back.

00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:05,107
So a huge applause for them.

00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:06,107
[Applause].

00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:07,107
Thank you.

00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,107
I'm not sure if they're prepared to come over, but Marina and Bjorn run the hall, doing the

00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:09,107
set-up, the design, the logistics, Luisa and Ronya.

00:26:09,107 --> 00:26:10,107
They're responsible for making this happen.

00:26:10,107 --> 00:26:11,107
There's no way we can do this without them.

00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:12,107
One more big applause for them.

00:26:12,107 --> 00:26:13,107
Thank you.

00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:14,107
[Applause].

00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:15,107
Thanks to everyone who was responsible for food.

00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,107
We've seen lots of feedback on Twitter.

00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,107
You all loved the food!

00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:18,107
Thank you very much.

00:26:18,107 --> 00:26:19,107
[Applause].

00:26:19,107 --> 00:26:20,107
And this looks and sounds amazing because the team spent lots of hours to get this right,

00:26:20,107 --> 00:26:21,107
so thanks again to them as well the light and sound team.

00:26:21,107 --> 00:26:22,107
Thank you to the CSSConf team as well.

00:26:22,107 --> 00:26:23,107
If any of you is here, please come up as well.

00:26:23,107 --> 00:26:24,107
This is our sister conference that happened on Friday.

00:26:24,107 --> 00:26:25,107
Lots of them are really nice little things that you see around the hall is actually all

00:26:25,107 --> 00:26:26,107
their work.

00:26:26,107 --> 00:26:27,107
Special thanks to everyone who has contributed to the community lounge, the lounge either

00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:28,107
with talking or organising.

00:26:28,107 --> 00:26:29,107
Thanks to that.

00:26:29,107 --> 00:26:30,107
Thanks to them, sorry!

00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:31,107
It has been a long day.

00:26:31,107 --> 00:26:32,107
Thank you to the live captioning team.

00:26:32,107 --> 00:26:33,107
I hope you can hear the applause.

00:26:33,107 --> 00:26:34,107
You were amazing.

00:26:34,107 --> 00:26:35,107
Thank you very much.

00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:36,107
CAPTIONER: Thank you!

00:26:36,107 --> 00:26:37,107
>> Next, we would like to invite all speakers on stage.

00:26:37,107 --> 00:26:38,107
Everyone who has been speaking here, or next door, and screw it, if you were speaking at

00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:39,107
the community area or sponsor booths, also come up on stage and get a very well deserved

00:26:39,107 --> 00:26:40,107
applause.

00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:41,107
[Applause].

00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:42,107
We're going to need a bigger stage next year.

00:26:42,107 --> 00:26:43,107
A little selfie moment there.

00:26:43,107 --> 00:26:44,107
All right, final thank you.

00:26:44,107 --> 00:26:45,107
It is you.

00:26:45,107 --> 00:26:46,107
Thanks to everyone who came to this and spent two days here, who spent all the money to

00:26:46,107 --> 00:26:47,107
get here to make this possible.

00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:48,107
Thanks to all the attendants, and, to celebrate, we are closing with a traditional family photo

00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,107
which means everyone else needs to come up on stage as well!

00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,107
[Applause].

00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:51,107
>> Before you join us up on stage, two last instructions for you: first of all, we have

00:26:51,107 --> 00:26:52,107
another party at the Hoppetauser tonight.

00:26:52,107 --> 00:26:53,107
We will pay the drinks, but there will be no free food.

00:26:53,107 --> 00:26:54,107
We have a food truck, but the bad news is whoever wants meat has to go else where the

00:26:54,107 --> 00:26:55,107
food struck is serving veggie food as well.

00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:56,107
It's fairly prised and they're prepared for 200 people.

00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:57,107
Let's see thousand how this works.

00:26:57,107 --> 00:26:58,107
Tomorrow, with our famous brunch, at Cafe Dacha, please be sailor, the same name as

00:26:58,107 --> 00:26:59,107
compared to last year, but it is another location.

00:26:59,107 --> 00:27:00,107
They have a new branch that's quite close to here, so the same restaurant, another location

00:27:00,107 --> 00:27:01,107
tomorrow.

00:27:01,107 --> 00:27:02,107
It begins at 10 am and ends at 2 pm, and this was it.

00:27:02,107 --> 00:27:03,107
Please now come over for the photo before we end JSConf EU 2017.

00:27:03,107 --> 00:27:04,107
Thank you.

00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:05,107
[Music].

00:27:05,107 --> 00:27:06,107
>> Please leave this location within the next 20 minutes.

00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:07,107
We will close down everything and the entrance to the venue is outside.

00:27:07,107 --> 00:27:07,607
