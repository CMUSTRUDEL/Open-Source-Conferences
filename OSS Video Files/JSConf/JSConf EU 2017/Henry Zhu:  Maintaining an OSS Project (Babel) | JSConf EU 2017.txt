How did piece of satire lead to a ASCII picture of Guy Fieri getting merged into the Babel source and our t-shirt design? Who is left_pad? How did I go from complete ignorance of one of the biggest tools used in the JavaScript ecosystem to becoming a user, contributor, and eventually maintainer? What are some of the interesting stories that maintaining a project lead to? In this talk, I hope to bring home the fact maintainers are just developers and people like everyone else.
