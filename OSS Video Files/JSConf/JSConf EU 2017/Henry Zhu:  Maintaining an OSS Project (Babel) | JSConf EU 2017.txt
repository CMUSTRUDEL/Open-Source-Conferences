How did piece of satire lead to a ASCII picture of Guy Fieri getting merged into the Babel source and our t-shirt design? Who is left_pad? How did I go from complete ignorance of one of the biggest tools used in the JavaScript ecosystem to becoming a user, contributor, and eventually maintainer? What are some of the interesting stories that maintaining a project lead to? In this talk, I hope to bring home the fact maintainers are just developers and people like everyone else.

Maintaining an OSS Project (Babel) By

00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,120
Henry Zhu

00:00:32,289 --> 00:00:33,289
[ Applause ] >> All right.

00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:34,289
Thanks, everyone, for having me.

00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:35,739
It's my first time in Europe and in Berlin.

00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:37,739
It's been pretty awesome.

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,469
So this talk, I'm going to be talking about my experiences with maintaining Babel.

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,559
And just a little intro for me.

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:55,289
My Twitter handle is left_pad and I maintain Babel and a bunch of open source projects.

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,600
I really like games, 7 Wonders.

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,839
I haven't played the Babel expansion yet.

00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:05,780
But looking forward to it.

00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,650
I also like Korean BBQ.

00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:14,580
I took Sean Larkin of Webpack, his first time in California.

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,210
And I'm addicted to open source.

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,600
This is just� I went to a restaurant in New York City and I just� that reminded

00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,550
me of the GitHub contribution graph.

00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:32,260
So this talk isn't going to be about wanting to get people to contribute to open source

00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,200
or becoming a maintainer.

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,770
Just to give you a picture of what it's like to be a maintainer.

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,860
Maybe give you some more awareness to what that's like.

00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,409
So how did I get started in open source?

00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:48,320
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia.

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,060
And my first introduction to open source is through hackathons.

00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,700
You know, the first project I made with JavaScript was just vanilla JS.

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:05,280
I didn't know about any libraries or things like Bootstrap or Angular.

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,420
Eventual I learned how to use, you know, npm and download libraries like D3.

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,609
My first pull request to GitHub was to the con academy.

00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:21,930
And I used this Website called first PR to figure out what it was.

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:28,280
And I actually realized that it wasn't merged because I didn't know how to use read base.

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,200
I just had all these commits there.

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,840
When I first started working I met this guy called Jonathan Neal and he encouraged me

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,329
to get started in open source because I was using Angular at the time.

00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:45,010
I tried to figure out how to get started.

00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,390
I read all the contributing docs.

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,030
I read through all documentation again, I went through all the issues.

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,239
But it was really hard for me to find a place to get started.

00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,900
Well, I found that there was an issue about updating the linting config.

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,739
Oh, just updating some JSON.

00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:06,169
I went in, made a PR for that.

00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:11,959
Except I found how it had to learn how to use npm shrink wrap and all this crazy stuff.

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,129
Eventual I ended up being the number 22 committer on Angular.

00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:19,239
And that was only because I updated the styling.

00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:22,370
I didn't do any core changes.

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,239
So all these changes were manually fixed by me.

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,139
Because we didn't have autofixing or anything like that.

00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:34,889
And it was really cool because Igor, one of the maintainers, he even reached out and emailed

00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:40,090
me and asked if I wanted to get a Tshirt.

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,049
And then I wanted to contribute more to Angular, but then I realized I had no idea what was

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:46,989
going on in the code base.

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:52,129
I figured because I was working on the styling I should check out the project I was contributing

00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:53,129
to.

00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:57,790
And so I found JSCS, which is a linter.

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,530
And that repo was really cool because they had help wanted label.

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,489
And that was� it made it easy for me to contribute.

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:10,750
So my first PR to this project was just adding this table of contents.

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,680
Over time I ended up doing more things to this like bug fixes and new rules.

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,030
And eventual I got an email that said, oh, you can be on the core team, which is really

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,350
awesome.

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:27,870
And even better than that, a few months before that I actually got an email to work at Behance,

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,220
where two of the maintainers worked at.

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,130
So I moved to New York.

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,880
Right now I work at Behance where I do JavaScript and work on Babel.

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:44,580
So how do I become a maintainer?

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,570
Basically� Sebastian was saying he was getting burnt out and he wanted to maintain that.

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,010
I found a different project and I was working on linter.

00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:02,120
So it made sense, oh, I can figure out how to contribute to that.

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:09,090
And he wrote a blog post a while back talking about his problems with open source in the

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,920
community and getting burnt out.

00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,170
And so, you know, he started working on it and all these contributors came in.

00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,410
I just happened to be one of those people.

00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,480
And� yeah.

00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,720
And then I feel like I didn't even realize I was a maintainer until he basically told

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,130
me, like, you know, you slowly did more and more stuff.

00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,641
So it just kind of creeps up on you.

00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:36,140
And you realize, oh, I'm a maintainer now.

00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,080
But the problem was that I felt like I was a contributor the whole time I was being a

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,910
maintainer, and that led me to only doing the things that I thought were easy.

00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,930
So I would fix docs or may fix bugs.

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,450
I would never look into the code and figure out how to make core changes.

00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,720
And it's funny because people were asking me all these questions, I didn't know the

00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
answer either.

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,060
I had to look it up and send a message.

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,060
Okay.

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,060
This is what it is.

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,790
But I guess nobody knew that I didn't really know what it was either.

00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,670
[ Laughter ] Yeah.

00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,500
So then that led me to think that the project wasn't moving forward.

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:19,110
All we're doing is maintaining what someone else already created.

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,340
And I felt like at any point that Sebastian would come back and tell me what to do or

00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,390
what the vision of the project was.

00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,340
And only recently where I was like, oh, okay.

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,500
We are the maintainers.

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:36,990
We should figure out what the priorities are, what the roadmap is, how to move forward.

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:43,430
And a lot of that led to just thinking about, like, why do we do open source in the first

00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,340
place?

00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,680
When you get really involved in something, whether it's work or open source or anything

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,550
else, you know, we start thinking that's where we get our worth from.

00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:01,360
When it doesn't go well, we start thinking, like, what are we working towards?

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,310
Yeah.

00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:08,430
So this makes you think this everyone thinks that maintainer know everything.

00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,620
And they have the answers to everything.

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:18,310
But we're just other developers that, you know, figured out how to look it up.

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,900
[ Laughter ] So yeah.

00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,140
How do we actually measure success in open source?

00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:30,650
I think we glamorize all the downloads� we have like 8 million downloads a month and

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,330
all these stars.

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,370
But then at the same time, like, you know, there's one.

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,070
Everyone's using open source now.

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,320
But what was the cost of that, right?

00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,440
We have all these people that are volunteering to, you know, spend their time working on

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,760
this thing for all these companies and people that, like, what are we actually getting out

00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,250
of this?

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:59,510
So it's like where I think that it's not just like the work that we put in, but how we do

00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,510
it, right?

00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:05,930
That I want to make sure that when we do ask people to join open source or become maintainers

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,900
that we figure out how to do it sustainably.

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,230
[ Laughter ] So I just am going to talk about a few stories.

00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,970
So GitHub issues.

00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,950
A lot of people use GitHub issues.

00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,660
A lot of people switch off of GitHub issues.

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:30,090
We're probably the only project that switched and then went back to GitHub issues.

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:38,650
A while back Sebastian posted about how GitHub was not a good, you know, use for managing

00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,730
issues.

00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,770
And so we moved to this thing called Phabricator.

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,620
A lot of people complained about it.

00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,190
Some of the positives.

00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,750
There was a lot less back and forth.

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,830
People had to say what version they were using, the input and output.

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,770
It was a lot easier to actually reproduce issues.

00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:06,060
It also led�to more people talking in PRs because we had to disable the issues.

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,380
And they had a lot more features like merging certificates and reactions and all that stuff.

00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,020
But it ended up being that there was a lot more negatives.

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,440
All the previous GitHub links are not available.

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,460
If you had a blog post link to GitHub, it fails.

00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,440
If you're coming to the problem, where's the issues?

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:37,010
That led to people doing a lot of weird things like emailing me directly or making a comment

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,310
in the commit of the repo.

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:46,110
Or making issues on the Website repo rather than the actual repo.

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,440
It also led to less issues.

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,580
It feels like it's good, but I heard from a lot of people that they didn't even want

00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,840
to do it because they didn't know how to use the interface.

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,670
And also, over time, GitHub made a lot of improvements so that it felt reasonable to

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,050
move back.

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:12,490
So we had to make more code to convert all the issues to GitHub.

00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,170
It was insane.

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,080
I didn't do any of the work on this.

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,210
Daniel, one of the team members, he had to write all this code to turn SQL queries into

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,140
GitHub API calls and make sure it doesn't ping anybody, and make sure it redirects to

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,180
the new GitHub URLs.

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:40,390
We made a battle bot and it imported 772 repos and basically copy and pasted the issue contents.

00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,120
And when we finally do this, everybody was excited.

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,600
Me too.

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,760
Because I had felt like in the other interface I started not looking at the issues either.

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,070
Stopped caring.

00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,380
All right.

00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,690
More frustration.

00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,640
So npm packages.

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,170
We had Babel preset 2015.

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,190
And I was like, well, it's 2016 now.

00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,200
So I guess I should make a Babel 2016.

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,730
And I found out that someone already made that.

00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:15,550
But this person was really nice and they said it was their pleasure to let, you know�

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,650
give the package up to Babel.

00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,180
And now I just thought, well, what about the next year?

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,650
And then I go to� and I found out somebody already made that too.

00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:28,500
But then this person didn't really want to give up the name.

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,810
Which actually kind of hurts our project because it makes it sound like the package naming

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,880
was official.

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,480
And so that was like a long back and forth.

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,070
And like a month later we were able to get the project.

00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:47,890
But the real solution is to use what npm has now with scopes so that everything under the

00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,650
add Babel name would be official.

00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,840
We haven't done that yet.

00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,500
But we're looking into it.

00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,890
And the next thing would be that we should just stop making preset ES2000 specs because

00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,180
then we'll have a hundred config values.

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:15,330
And it looks like people who know what the packages are willing to try it out.

00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,440
Okay.

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,029
So I think some of you might have seen this blog post.

00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:29,440
And in it Jordan talks about how Babel has this picture of�

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,910
[ Laughter ] Guy Fieri in it.

00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,350
And there's nothing you can do about it, right?

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,910
It was fun.

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:39,180
And then James made this PR that added this.

00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,880
And I was kind of surprised at first but, you know, went with it.

00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,230
It was cool.

00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,810
And then you get cool comments like this.

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,540
Which is really awesome to read.

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,300
And then we see this.

00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,330
Marco made this.

00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,080
And then I was like, okay, let's change the color scheme.

00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:06,079
And then I met Jordan for the first time.

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:13,560
[ Laughter ] [ Applause ]

00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,800
And then� yeah.

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,800
So� and then I was like, Jordan you should write an April Fool's blog post.

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,940
You can be the chief marketing officer.

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:28,700
He was busy so I just made up this other thing based on Wikipedia.

00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,960
Okay.

00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,060
So I have been talking a lot about open source and where it's heading in that we should make

00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,880
it sustainable.

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,930
So how do we actually do that?

00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,110
One way is by getting more contributors.

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:47,500
So what we're doing on that front is trying to focus more on like beginnerfriendly issues.

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,590
Making, like, actually explaining what you need to do.

00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,180
Not just being like, hey, if you know all these terminologies and these words, then

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,130
you'll figure it out.

00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,680
We're also participating in Google summer of code.

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,880
So we're going to have two streams working with us.

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,170
And also Rails summer of code.

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:13,430
And we can also partner with a lot of other organizations like schools or bootcamps or

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,540
companies.

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:22,630
If you are a company that's using Babel, then if you want to sponsor, just let me know.

00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,950
And� yeah.

00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,220
Even� so my company is really awesome.

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,710
They're letting my work 50% of the time on Babel.

00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:37,920
And the only reason why we have this is because I was able to work on it at work for two weeks.

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,459
And we're also partnering with TC39.

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,610
It's the committee that works on JavaScript.

00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,530
And Babel is a big part that have, right?

00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:53,480
Because we write all these stage zero plugins before it's actually in the spec.

00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,779
And the reason why we can� it's a good idea is because then people can actually use the

00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:00,240
syntax before we decide it's a good idea.

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,290
And Logan was able to go to the last TC39 meeting in March and I'm planning on going

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,750
in May.

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,960
We set up an open collective.

00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:20,300
And so what is the future of Babel?

00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:27,240
Now that I feel like I am a maintainer, then we� we're working on an actual roadmap.

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,950
We're trying to split up into teams, delegate, and we're trying to partner with a lot of

00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,490
different people.

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,760
So I think once we figure it out, like, we have a level of control.

00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:42,399
We can do a lot of awesome stuff.

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,860
So� yeah.

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,860
Look out for Babel 7.

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,860
Thanks.

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
[ Applause ] >> Okay.

00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,860
We can just have a couple minutes� break while we get the next speaker set up.

00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,860
So if you want to go check out some of the amazing things outside, go get some fresh

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,860
yogurt.

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,860
Go get some coffee.

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,860
You've got two minutes to do it.

00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
So run, run, run.

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,360
