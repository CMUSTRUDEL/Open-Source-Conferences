Over a year ago, the nested loops opened jsconf.eu 2015 with their debut single (and only song to date) “Javascript, what are you?”. Buttons were pressed, videos were played and music was heard, but nobody was really sure what even happened.

This year, we will be back.

And we want to answer the simple question: “How is it made?”. We’ll show you why and how Javascript and a lot of other web-technologies were involved in making an opening performance for jsconf.eu.
