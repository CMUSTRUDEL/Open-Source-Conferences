	http://2017.jsconf.eu/speakers/kahlil-boris-jan-martin-how-its-made-opening-jsconfeu.html

Over a year ago, the nested loops opened jsconf.eu 2015 with their debut single (and only song to date) “Javascript, what are you?”. Buttons were pressed, videos were played and music was heard, but nobody was really sure what even happened.

This year, we will be back.

And we want to answer the simple question: “How is it made?”. We’ll show you why and how Javascript and a lot of other web-technologies were involved in making an opening performance for jsconf.eu.

00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:13,110
hey uh with the nested loops onion for

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,370
you I'm Khalil

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:20,370
Boris Martin yeah you might have seen us

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,970
this morning or one-and-a-half years ago

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:26,820
at this very place and we want to tell

00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:29,220
you how this entire thing was made and

00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:36,020
there's a story to it and I won't tell

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:39,030
the story so the year was 2014 and I

00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:41,640
gave a talk at chess cons about Web

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,430
Audio for music production and live

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:47,340
performances and there was this part in

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,710
this talk where was actually performing

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:54,159
music and this is all look like

00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,159
[Music]

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:10,640
[Music]

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:13,040
I don't remember that load okay so what

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,170
he saw was just me dabbling on an iPad

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,690
and I had no idea how to make music I

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:21,110
bootlegs jay-z Linkin Park they didn't

00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:24,560
sue me what's great and but at that time

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,550
I had a much bigger dream and I was the

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,010
free guy

00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:31,640
their drums and they taught me to use

00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:36,230
software so the problem is neither do I

00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:39,080
have three people capable of doing that

00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,350
including me nor do I have the MIDI

00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,510
instruments nor do I have the software

00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:48,350
so that was kind of a foreshadowing of

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:52,640
what happened and so after that I had a

00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:55,570
plan the plan was find band members by

00:03:52,640 --> 00:04:00,530
MIDI instrument and write the software

00:03:55,570 --> 00:04:02,150
so just as I was just browsing Twitter a

00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,300
couple of weeks later and then I saw

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:06,920
this one tweet by Khalil he's like Oh

00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,220
before I was the developer I was

00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,860
requisitioned check it out this is me so

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:35,810
let's check it out

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:42,780
[Music]

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:45,390
whoa yeah now it's like I have to have

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,070
to collaborate with this guy he knows

00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,620
how to make music and he has a voice

00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:52,470
that sounds good so meet the ill

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,500
inspector okay so this is just a little

00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,450
story time so I was doing music before I

00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,850
was working at the developer so I was

00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,830
like like four years or so it's just

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,440
like touring in Europe and doing like

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,660
dancehall but living in Leipzig there

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,520
was a label there and actually so this

00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,770
video was actually shot in Japan because

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,260
there was at some point there was this

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:16,020
Japanese guy he wrote as an email saying

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,420
hey we would like to release an album or

00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,730
something into it okay great so we

00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,680
recorded an album for him and this track

00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,330
actually made for him as a request

00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,450
because he said in Japan they loved

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:30,150
poopa son who was like hmm he's like a

00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:33,090
foundation dancehall reggae artist and

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:35,370
so I made a song about him and we shot

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,990
this video over they were in Japan for a

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,900
week to do like promotions and stuff

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,060
like that and that's how it kind of was

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:48,810
traded and actually was my greatest hit

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:50,850
I would say what so the cool thing was

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:54,180
when I was talking to Khalil he actually

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,580
told me well I have this brother Shiva

00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:00,060
in the background he's actually a music

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:03,090
producer I was like that is great so let

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,890
me count I need three people me Khalil

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:08,040
and the guy who actually knows how to

00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:10,440
make music it's like yeah got the bad

00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,120
memories then I just had to buy media

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,160
instruments and we just bought I just

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,960
bought like one of these very sturdy

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,310
very great has a lot of buttons that

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:22,800
means you can do a lot of things I

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:24,660
thought I had no idea like really so

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,360
they call got the MIDI instrument just

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,010
have to write the software writing

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,210
software is easy right I mean we all

00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:35,190
know that it takes a week but should we

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,290
really look like a huge music production

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:40,380
app for this just to perform a task on

00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:43,980
knowing that it's like a couple of weeks

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,720
before Jays Khan's probably not also

00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,460
what kind of music do we actually want

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,770
to make so we reach out to

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,570
the date comes organizers like hey what

00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:54,750
kind of performance were you thinking of

00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:56,990
and Martha was like be creative we trust

00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,990
you

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:06,840
our excellent hands great so yeah we

00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:09,090
because I'm from Berlin they're from

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:15,539
Stuttgart so we met up at Kelly's house

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:18,180
and it's this is you okay yeah so that's

00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:20,940
where like we had our first meeting and

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,760
we're basic city we're trying to figure

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,250
out what we're going to do so we told

00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:30,000
Boris words we need music boards like

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,710
okay I got music and was like cool so

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,949
like because Boris has been doing music

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:37,680
since forever and so he had like a bunch

00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:39,930
of beats lying around and we didn't have

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,060
a lot of time so we had to there was not

00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:44,280
really time to do a whole new beat and

00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,729
so I guess so we chose one of his that

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,169
was unreleased and we liked it so we we

00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:50,849
decided on the music first and then we

00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,080
were like okay what are we going to do

00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:56,039
like we have to do something in the

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,320
browser like just music not enough so so

00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,000
we so the thought basically came up I

00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,470
don't know who had it or whatever but

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,570
like we're thinking okay we're going to

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:05,729
take talks I mean I think what you know

00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:08,849
like take some interesting snippets and

00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:10,740
then trigger them on the music in the

00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:12,330
browser like the video has to play in

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,250
the browser the music has to be played

00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:16,560
in the browser and everything needs to

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:22,470
be triggered by as the the pads

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:25,880
basically right so so basically sorry so

00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:29,550
this was basically how it worked we had

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,459
sorry we had the music running and we

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,690
were triggering just like random

00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:35,580
snippets that we just cut out of the

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:38,630
YouTube videos and we're just trying

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,630
around stuff like this

00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:51,410
the music in the background triggering

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:53,060
sniffing and so this was going on that

00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,339
weekend and we were just triangle for

00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,899
two days we're trying out stuff back and

00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:58,880
forth and and that weekend we kind of

00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:05,600
laid the groundwork for all of it and

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:11,089
then I would track see just me

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,769
performing over the beat so had some

00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:20,959
lyrics

00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:27,889
ready yeah okay what and this is

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:30,529
basically I'm just going to go to this

00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:33,290
one okay so and then this video the last

00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:35,389
one was us just before the conference we

00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,930
had everything kind of ready the video

00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:40,940
the videos were cut to a certain so that

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,069
you can see the speaker's really big and

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,220
then we had Boris also put a filter over

00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:48,470
the video and so that was the first

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:50,480
iteration and and then and actually this

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,139
took like weeks and weeks of meeting up

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,000
with each other

00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:54,319
arranging the snippet so that it kind of

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,050
makes sense that it's funny

00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:59,720
and so like Dorothy and me were meeting

00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:02,389
once a week or so for a while and Boris

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,370
was kind of yeah we were just trying to

00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:07,060
make sense out of the snippets we had

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,050
and huh and we were trying to make sense

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,930
we're trying to make it look good and

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:13,430
actually Jana was programming the

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,690
software the whole time like there was

00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:17,420
lots of little things that need to be

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:20,240
figure out like how can we because

00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,649
because the videos needed to be instant

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,750
like when you press the button it just

00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:25,130
needs to book happen right away it needs

00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,190
to be synced on the music and everything

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:29,720
so there was a lot of crazy stuff that

00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:32,980
when I'm sure you're going to talk about

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:36,399
this in a minute and so this is actually

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:41,660
practicing the day before the conference

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:44,180
2015 in our hotel room you can see the

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,970
venue right there just going through the

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:49,820
whole thing

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:53,779
okay that was us doing sound check the

00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:55,970
day before and yeah and now young with

00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,320
the software so yeah the software is

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,589
really easy right

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,389
so it just has to read MIDI data that

00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:05,149
this thing sends a thing to your browser

00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:08,209
and you like are cool these are events

00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:09,500
but this is what the data looks like

00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,600
that this thing is trying to communicate

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,670
with you felt like the movie the arrival

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,320
like you have to kind understand what

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,519
does computer is talking to you it's

00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,199
like all of these numbers you have to

00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:20,570
make sense like what is the position

00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:22,940
what is like did it get pressed or not

00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,160
and is to figure out all of these you

00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:26,690
have to read the midi document for this

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,529
thing and I was like oh I didn't know

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:35,149
that why why did I god well that just

00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:36,769
takes like two weeks and then what you

00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:39,709
have like you come up with like an idea

00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:42,440
okay so for the first row I want to have

00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:43,910
this video played this and then that

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,600
video played you come up with like an

00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:49,970
idea it's kind of happy but the thing is

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,160
so you have a video and videos usually

00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,930
have like a video feed and an audio feed

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,940
and you kind of want to have like the

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,399
audio desync with everything so you have

00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,019
to kind of like split them up again to

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,440
make put like your text on it and

00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,899
everything

00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:07,310
and then you have to kind of make like

00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:10,370
the video still be snappy because how do

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:13,760
you play a video without a delay in the

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:17,360
browser like using the video tag to you

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:21,350
a just to video element dot play do you

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:24,589
see preload and then play or do you see

00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:32,240
use an obscure heck and then call play

00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:35,510
on the thing a what be yet see so it

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,959
kind of hacky so you have to load the

00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,579
video in an era buffer make a blog out

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,110
of it with the correct mind type

00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:45,560
otherwise it doesn't know it's a video

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:49,130
and then it's the greatest thing ever

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:52,100
create an object URL out of this massive

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:53,329
video which is really bad for RAM usage

00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,640
but we didn't care

00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:58,390
this is the only thing that makes like

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:00,400
pushing a button and then being it

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:02,230
isn't there possible all the other ones

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,000
have like a lot of delay which I'm

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,980
probably sure we would have never heard

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,060
but the person actually pushing the

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:11,230
button really tells it so we needed this

00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,940
and yes so the cool thing is you do the

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,550
same for all the elements you have

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,400
someone who's good at pushing buttons

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:22,030
that guy and yeah yeah JJ's called

00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,610
opening performance software this war

00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:26,740
it's always more as we know the videos

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,230
were pre-rendered so we just had videos

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,480
with the effects on it out of like

00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,860
render it the beat was in life performed

00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,390
actually we just pushed the button and

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:40,780
then the music was playing nobody

00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:42,880
noticed that was great but if we only

00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:49,660
had more time we would have done it all

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:52,270
life so that was 2015 so we had a nice

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,400
tune right so we had a pretty

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,590
overwhelming performance like it's kind

00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,030
of like our little secret with multi for

00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:01,180
like a couple of weeks you couldn't talk

00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:06,430
about this like all giddy giddy nobody

00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:08,740
know we can know about this so the the

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:10,180
response was great like we got so so

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,680
much great feedback and I can tell you

00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,250
like before the talk or before the

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,590
performance

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,410
listen Foster syndrome thing that also

00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:18,430
applies for music performances

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:22,920
especially if you don't know anything

00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:27,670
about music it's a very bad so yeah we

00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:30,220
donated in T story yeah so made the

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:34,450
nested loop t-shirts so do you have the

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:36,310
thing loaded up yeah and many people

00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:41,020
wanted the t-shirt we produce the Trisha

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:42,400
for the yeah that's right and so we made

00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,260
the story fine thing I wanted to have

00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,910
selfies from everybody so anybody who

00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,620
has a teacher please you didn't send a

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,970
selfie our way I want to have the selfie

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,460
so I can put it into the story flower

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,830
okay so there's a lots of lots of people

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:59,529
who it's Allah

00:14:53,830 --> 00:15:02,950
and this yeah lots of cool people with

00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:07,089
the t-shirt and yeah so we so we saw

00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:08,709
those peace t-shirts on t spring and we

00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:10,990
we made a little bit of money so the

00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:13,390
margin on the t-shirt was very low the

00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,040
little money thing was like 300 dollars

00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:18,370
or something like that we all gave away

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,709
for good causes and so they're like a

00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:21,760
hundred dollars for caught her cause or

00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:25,180
something like that so we didn't make

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,000
any money from it but so yeah so we all

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:29,860
felt really good and it's nice to see a

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:42,790
lot of people with the t-shirt out here

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:44,920
today it was really cool yeah they're

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:47,740
all know that was a break a J's cones

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,589
break and then we got up again to step

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:54,850
it up a notch they didn't react to that

00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:56,620
but we felt we had to do that and this

00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,950
time I really wanted to build a real

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:02,440
piece of software not this like six

00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:04,420
weeks heck that lived on this obscure

00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,870
video hack that is still in the

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:10,360
production software now so this time we

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,550
actually started a six months ago

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,160
already like as you can see in October

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:18,640
the first two commits and then we worked

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,709
along the way on that and so 2015 what

00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:24,610
the thing did was push a button it it

00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:29,589
did a thing and in 2017 you push a

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:32,470
button and it does 10x things so we kind

00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:34,720
of thought who who does know like which

00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,360
one is which there by the way this is

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,810
this is our Tech's take an order to

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,600
guess which one is redox react and

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:46,930
electron so we thought like the one and

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,779
a half year that has like everybody was

00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:52,540
talking about react Redux an extra ones

00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:54,430
we don't we have to make a software to

00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,589
make music with all of these tools so

00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,769
that we can dog feed or industry

00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:01,890
gullible so the app actually looks

00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:03,660
amazing

00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:06,060
you will see later on so you have like

00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,520
this is like a representation of the

00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,890
physical pad and then on the side you

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,780
can see like what kind of clip you want

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:16,650
to play and all these things whatever

00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,690
you want to attach to it and so what was

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,910
really cool about this is you can import

00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:23,010
export project set up so the thing

00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,540
before was whenever Boris wanted to have

00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,120
like a button on a different thing there

00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,440
he is he was calling me and I was like

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,540
okay I'm going to do this

00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,350
push that to github so that he can work

00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:36,510
on it an hour later this was horrible so

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:39,270
now we can like exported zip and import

00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:42,360
and all these things it has perfect

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:45,920
timing in there before that we had like

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,780
a lot of human errors mainly mine and

00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:51,660
now there's a computer taking care of

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:55,800
the timing as in if you push the button

00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,600
too early before the beat it can make

00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,660
this wait a bit and I click like it will

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,730
be perfect to the beat so the problem is

00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,200
if you're too late we cannot take that

00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:09,480
because JavaScript doesn't have time

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:13,530
travel yet let's see see see 39 was

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:16,440
what's up this time we actually do have

00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:18,810
live music I mean you didn't notice

00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,240
before there was no like music but and

00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:25,530
also the we had a life video shoulders

00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,540
as you saw this morning but yeah this is

00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:35,190
like technical stuff let's let's hear

00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:37,020
how like a beat it's made so high so we

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:41,430
this time we wanted to make an original

00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:44,310
beat or I want to do that and first up

00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:47,790
the guys listen to all the talks and

00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:52,350
they gathered snippets for me and then

00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:56,340
I'd about 150 snippets about stuff that

00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,840
I don't really understand and so the

00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,490
first thing we have to do we when we

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,340
start from scratch we have to find

00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:05,790
something that we can build on so

00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,980
basically I was just trying out stuff

00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:10,140
like so it means that some of the code

00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,670
that's running now in angular 2 it and

00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,040
so it means that some of the code that's

00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:15,920
running now in angular 2

00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,610
more food and so it means that the flow

00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:23,740
of doodle and played around with that I

00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:26,290
had to pitch function with this

00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,880
controller which is the Ableton push and

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:33,500
I just played around and then at some

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,780
point we had a chorus which is as you I

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,960
think all know by now

00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:42,110
people got JavaScript this one the

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,420
people got mad JavaScript and then I

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:49,670
started to build a beat around it

00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:52,030
basically to have yeah pretty pretty

00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:52,030
simple

00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,920
yeah built built bent around it with the

00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:07,250
bassline drums first things pretty loud

00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:13,580
everything yes kick 8-bit kick as well

00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:33,290
and then just build on top of it make a

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:40,700
bass line and some melody and then we

00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:47,650
just need some people talking JavaScript

00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:52,220
people got that people got bad you got

00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:58,690
JavaScript people got bad yeah that's

00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:58,690
basically what I did thank you

00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:10,010
ah yeah so 2017 brought a lot of changes

00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:11,930
and an event member yeah you might have

00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:14,690
noticed I mean we kind of said it as

00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:18,350
well Martin joined the band and was

00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:20,990
doing live lights and the tech behind

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,000
that is pretty amazing and please tell

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:25,790
us how he did it

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:30,650
yeah technically and more roadie than

00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:34,340
proper band member but so can we can we

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:38,680
switch to develop to see you know all

00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:38,680
right of course

00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,859
[Music]

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:54,920
all right so um who was here last year's

00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:59,180
last time Jess cogs oh that's quite just

00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:04,010
few people but I gave a talk at just of

00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:07,670
you 2015 and there I kind of like left

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:11,360
through how to control professional

00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:14,540
light equipment using javascript won't

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,660
go until that much detail here but yeah

00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:20,150
that's basically what I did is a light

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:23,030
show Jas but if you will there you

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:27,800
already know that it was actually light

00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:29,900
shall see is there because everything

00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,880
you saw this morning considering the

00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:36,200
light show was entirely written in CSS

00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:39,410
with proper CSS killed was interpreted

00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:42,440
by my browser in real-time and

00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:46,580
everything I did was just toggling um

00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:52,430
classes on parent element using the same

00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:54,260
here so each of these buttons has a

00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,720
class name attached to it and if I

00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:59,120
prefer the class gets added if I release

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,760
it the class gets removed and there are

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,910
some buttons that act as switches where

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:08,570
I can just press class gets edit press

00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:11,790
again class gets removed so um this was

00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:14,260
basically how the lecture was controlled

00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:17,290
so in order to do that we'll see us as

00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,510
we need some HTML to operate on and lose

00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:21,970
basically how that looks I have devices

00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:24,280
and I give them class names I have some

00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:28,360
special attributes like type and channel

00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:30,850
which is the technical stuff and it

00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,650
turns out browsers just don't care as I

00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:35,440
don't know the tag name they simply

00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:40,450
treat them just like HTML so all fine

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:44,040
here I know I can use proper custom

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:48,280
element if you sure but - neato so um

00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:50,770
the CSS I have a color property I have a

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,170
brightest property and I define an

00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:54,970
animation over brightness on color the

00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:57,730
color is pretty simple there's something

00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:01,620
that CSS a way to provide the brightness

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:04,810
is yeah something that I just made up

00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:08,350
and considering more complex devices

00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:10,780
like those here they can move around and

00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:13,090
stuff like that there's lots and lots of

00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:14,920
functions and they simply made up CSS

00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:18,370
property names for each of their

00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:22,690
features and all of them can be animated

00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:25,480
so I add some JavaScript errors in this

00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:29,410
case I would just pull the get computed

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,970
style of all the devices notes and I get

00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,100
the computed style returns

00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,950
conveniently of the current animation

00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:38,020
state - including any animation and

00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:41,560
finish those can really running so I'm

00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:43,590
back there I had good Calavera I get the

00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:48,520
brightness value and I sent them over

00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:50,740
the DMX protocol side note and DMX is

00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,960
the serial protocol that is used by each

00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:56,770
and any piece of professional lighting

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,020
hardware there is so I can be pretty

00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:02,020
sure if I come to any venue they will

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:07,890
have a DMX system and my DMX interface

00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:10,420
will completely work with that in theory

00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:12,850
so I'm the only thing I will mention

00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:15,840
about DMX now is that each and every

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:19,390
device has a unique and yeah very

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,780
specific pre-configured address which is

00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:25,000
what you saw on the HTML earlier so the

00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:28,600
back to the spheres have code there's

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,510
obviously two problems with us first of

00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,370
all we can't just make up CSS property

00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,320
names because they will simply get

00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:37,930
ignored by the browser get computed

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,490
style won't return them so that's a

00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:41,830
no-go

00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:44,200
only now we have custom properties so if

00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:48,490
I add two dashes everything works fine

00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:50,190
right yeah except that custom properties

00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:53,260
together the transitions and animations

00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:56,800
currently do not work as intended in any

00:25:53,260 --> 00:26:01,360
browser so I have to find some way

00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:05,440
around this and this is this nice little

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:07,860
hack instead of just using my properties

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,630
like brightness can - whatever else I

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:14,020
simply choose one of the properties that

00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:16,630
can be animated like left right top

00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:18,460
bottom margin padding whatever anything

00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:20,560
that can be animated I can use as a

00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,780
replacement so in this case I chose like

00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,400
left for brightness as a replacement and

00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:28,960
it can animate the left property and

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:30,910
yeah everything worked like intended so

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,390
the only thing I need to do in order to

00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:38,560
get that done a little hack which is I

00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:41,970
pass the CSS now using the rework path

00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:44,290
or then I do some ASC transforms

00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:47,320
introduce the custom properties

00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:49,780
introduced for animated properties that

00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,060
introduces fall backs and then serialize

00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:56,860
the CSS again injected into the page it

00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:58,570
gets applied to my device node then in

00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:02,380
order to read all that out I have to

00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:04,300
reverse all that so I have to use get

00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:08,890
computed I could get in both cases left

00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:12,460
property value and apply it to the DMX

00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:16,749
devices as brightness in this case this

00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:19,389
works pretty well only

00:27:16,749 --> 00:27:21,940
all those doesn't really help to prepare

00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:24,460
a light show simply because there's

00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:28,509
never enough time to prepare if I only

00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:32,409
have more time right so the last

00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:35,950
comfortable I do that as I have like at

00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:37,659
best two hours preparation time at the

00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:41,080
band you're being connected to the DMX

00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:43,869
devices and as it is I'm rarely

00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:46,359
connected to such huge setups of DMX

00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:51,789
divisor so most of the two hours are

00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:53,679
spent fixing bugs and then I have maybe

00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:56,859
like half an hour to program the light

00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,999
and this is not something I want to live

00:27:56,859 --> 00:28:03,159
with and especially for this conference

00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:03,820
I needed to come with samples come up

00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:08,049
with something else

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:10,539
so I had from the awesome people that

00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:13,059
were planning a layout of this

00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:15,519
conference I guess it was like a month

00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:18,519
ago or something like that these 3d

00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:21,039
images of how the stage is supposed to

00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:26,409
look and it's pretty much like that now

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:29,340
right so I started to think about what I

00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:34,629
could do if I threw together basically

00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:39,099
any software that I could find and the

00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:41,979
end result is this so I have to build a

00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:51,639
Mexican which is basically just coq10

00:28:41,979 --> 00:28:53,830
for lecture and the nice thing about DMX

00:28:51,639 --> 00:29:00,450
channels that I have those runner which

00:28:53,830 --> 00:29:00,450
usual 3GS and a frame will provide me

00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:06,350
for the proper preview of what it might

00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:09,260
look like on stage turns out it doesn't

00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:11,780
really look like that because obviously

00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:17,210
my colors are much brighter than the

00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:21,290
real ones but yeah um to the left top um

00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:24,350
you see the HTML or devices panel those

00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:27,850
of the list of all the devices are found

00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:31,400
over in the main hall so we have like

00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:35,180
can a lot of these these spotlights here

00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:38,840
and this LP the short for light panels

00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:44,330
will be 2 by 2 meters panel there's 35

00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:46,910
of them yeah I simply just got all the

00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:49,610
channel numbers and so on from the

00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:56,390
people at the venue when I arrived here

00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:59,360
two days ago and yes that and this here

00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:03,400
you'll see a CSS code that was actually

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:06,860
able I'd show so am a lot of mixer and

00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:10,460
configuration basic settings things like

00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:13,250
that and then there are the a1 is simply

00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:16,970
on the top left bottom button and of

00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:22,220
oppressive it will just run the color

00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:26,300
animation that I defined there yeah and

00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:30,010
finally they also got there was this

00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:34,270
moving have spotlights which we can also

00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:36,670
toggle and trigger and yeah

00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:38,590
so nice to think about them just you

00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,179
didn't see that because in order to see

00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:42,640
this moving have spotlights you need a

00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:44,080
lot of haze on or smoke in the room and

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,610
it's not good at the beginning of a

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:53,950
conference so that's at it looks much

00:30:48,610 --> 00:31:02,230
better here reality bite if I only have

00:30:53,950 --> 00:31:04,600
enough time so um all of this and don't

00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:09,910
judge me about this twelve megabytes of

00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:12,520
JavaScript and it really uses everything

00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:15,070
barriers basically so I have the code

00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,470
Moreau editors Thanks for writing them I

00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:21,130
know he's here somewhere

00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:26,290
I used that Jes was actually actually an

00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:28,450
ASM compiled version of look at CSS or

00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:31,000
look that for something like that so I'm

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:33,250
using a fmjs as well I'm using a frame

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,300
from Mozilla what makes it really easy

00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:41,380
to build these virtual reality

00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:45,160
applications using three.js left here

00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:48,429
and all of the other Souls III think

00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,440
none of you also saw these libraries

00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:53,290
ever thought it would be used that way

00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:59,510
but thank you very much

00:31:53,290 --> 00:32:03,780
[Applause]

00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:06,660
and finally I left out all of the

00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:09,810
details so if you want to know more I

00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:11,970
will probably be giving slightly more

00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:14,580
technical introduction and the community

00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:22,460
area at large is due tomorrow

00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:25,770
so thank you very much oh and one thing

00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:28,950
we're going to do both now right we're

00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:37,350
going to do this now oh there's more

00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:41,520
that's always more that's a couple of

00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:45,240
announcements okay

00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:47,310
ah yeah yeah it's amazing yeah you can

00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,410
show the t-shirt so we have t-shirts

00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:52,230
again as you can see and also hoodies

00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:54,330
actually stuff so there's a new
