Functional programming can be difficult to learn. Although there are many practical lessons, they are often hidden through academic lingo and dry examples. What if these basics could be livened up and taught through the lens of music? Together, we will go over some of the basics of functional programming including functional array manipulation, closure, immutability, and composing functions. As I go through these, I will show how they can be applied to the creation of music and musical instruments using the web audio API.

Adam Giese is a software engineer in Austin, TX. He has a passion for music and the web and believes that the marriage of the two can lead to great outcomes. Outside of computers, Adam enjoys exploring the many sides of Austin with his family.
