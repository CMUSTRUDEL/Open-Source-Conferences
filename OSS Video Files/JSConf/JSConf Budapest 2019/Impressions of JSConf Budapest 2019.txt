So, for someone who's new to the profession,

00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,699
I think the best thing to do is

00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,000
start new projects and do things that you enjoy doing, because if you're doing something you enjoy doing,

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,420
you're gonna have such a better learning experience by doing that.

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,340
Look for mentorship.

00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,980
Sometimes you just need to ask, and you will be surprised how many people are willing to help with that.

00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:39,680
Learn the basics, like learn the JavaScript, learn the CSS, learn the HTML.

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,160
Yeah, I kind of agree,

00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:49,440
Like, I went through so long and I didn't know HTTP, and that messed up so much of my understanding,

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,680
but I still think if I stopped and tried to learn HTTP that early on,

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,540
I would have just abandoned the whole thing, because I wouldn't haveâ€¦ I mean

00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,160
you also have to be realistic, like many people start with a job, and in that job,

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,360
we use frameworks, you probably don't have the time to learn the basics.

00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,240
So I'm not saying, like, you're doing it wrong if you not learn the basics first,

00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,400
It's just that I recommend, I think it's time well invested.

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,560
I recommend speaking at conferences, like, before you even get a job in tech, speak at a conference, just make it up,

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,980
because it's really good for your profile, right?

00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,420
That's how you get it up in the first place! Exactly!

00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,660
Fake it 'till you make it. Fake it 'till you make it!

00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:32,100
This is my first time in JSConf Budapest, it's amazing. I love the diversity over here.

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,740
As an experience wise, it's amazing and the things I'm learning here is also very great, because, though I'm an infra engineer,

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,540
there are certain concepts which are relevant to a DevOps engineer as well,

00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,960
like how you should communicate to your architects,

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,460
how you should work in collaboration with your product manager and the way you build your products.

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,429
Maybe we can also think of having accessibility in DevOps, whatever products we're building,

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,630
So yeah, it's quite relevant.

00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:00,180
JSConf Budapest is my first conference as an attendee, and my very first conference as a speaker,

00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,099
it's all new to me, and I had a wonderful time. Thank you all so much!

00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:08,979
My experience of JSConf has been really good so far, we've been able to travel here with the whole family,

00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,920
got a lovely family room at the hotel,

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:19,239
the food has been good and all of the communications and the help I've gotten as a speaker has been, blew my mind.

00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:23,229
For me a very humbling experience to be here today

00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:29,679
This is one of the places where the people are so nice and so open. I love the community here

00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,380
Last time I was at JSConf Budapest, I got hit in the eye by an HDMI dongle.

00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,100
What a great memory! Yeah.

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,200
I think my favorite memory is my very first talk as a Googler with JSConf EU 2015.

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,400
It was a bad talk but it was a great community. I wasn't there. No, you weren't.

00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:00,740
It's my first time in any JSConf conferences and it's been amazing, I don't know, it's amazing content all the time.

00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,200
It goes outside of what you would expect from a tech conference.

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,980
My favorite talk so far has been the talk of this guy that works with refugee aid camp,

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,580
which is something we would never have access to this, like, anywhere else, and I think, like, that,

00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:21,140
alongside with the community here that seems to be very friendly and very respectful, I'm having a blast, like I'm having the best time.

00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,940
My favorite JSConf memory was talking to the organizer of JSConf EU,

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,100
and kind of hearing his authentic heart for the conference

00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,840
and how he wants to get everybody involved irrespective of race and gender and orientation, just,

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,860
it's a conference for everybody.

00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,360
When I think of JSConf, I think inclusion, family, community.

00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,140
