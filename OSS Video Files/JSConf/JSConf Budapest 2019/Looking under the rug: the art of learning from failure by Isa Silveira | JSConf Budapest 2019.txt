The tech industry has a longtime history of cultivating heroes and epic stories of success. “Look how this tiny startup became an industry giant!”, “Did you hear Joe just got his dream job?”, “Learn how to ship amazing projects to production in no time!”. We’ve all heard stories like these and they are indeed very inspiring, but how come no one is talking about the ugly parts? Why aren’t stories of things that didn’t work out more common in tech? Why aren’t we more transparent about our experiences and what we learned from them?

In this talk, I’ll go through all the lessons I took from failing miserably at a software project, how that made me a much better developer and the importance of failure in the career of a software engineer.

Isa is a software engineer building the future of payments at iZettle. Throughout her career, she has worked with scientific research and nowadays works both on back and front end applications. Isa has worked on products from world class companies like the Stanford University, Planned Parenthood and Virgin. She never turns down a good talk and a beer, in her free time she thinks about how can she make the world a better place while playing with her dogs and practicing slalom skating.

[Applause]

00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:12,030
thank you let's talk in a day yeah you

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,299
made it I made it yay I'm literally the

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,060
only thing that's keeping you from

00:00:14,299 --> 00:00:20,250
drinking beer so bear with me in fact

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,580
I'm here with some friends from work

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,289
they're right there yay and we seize the

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,480
opportunity since we're here in Budapest

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,390
and it's a pretty cool place we kind of

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,149
threw our friend a small bachelor party

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,270
on Tuesday that was pretty fun we drink

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:42,030
some pálinka set the name yay

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:44,040
that is dangerous watch out yeah I

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,809
mean we basically just ended up at this

00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,239
bar and next thing I know I'm like

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,160
upstairs in a bar and some creepy dude

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,059
starts like chatting me up and then he

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:59,699
just asked me for my email and

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:04,439
it's like what absolutely he's a sexy

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:06,150
surfer at hotmail.com so obviously I

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:09,479
gave him a fake email I thought about

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,470
giving him like some Yahoo email but I

00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,820
thought that that was not gonna be

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,830
believable enough our friend is already

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,360
married by the way this is what happens

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,150
when you delay projects in your real

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,070
life yeah so I'm gonna talk about

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,170
failures which is something that I think

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:28,350
it's really interesting for us to start

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,509
making peace with and and just creating

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,390
a more natural relationship with since

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:36,090
in our industry we really like to have

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,610
these heroes and cultivate these success

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,280
stories or how we ship this amazing

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,439
project and how did we get our team to

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,420
be the best team in the world but you

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,340
only got there basically by screwing up

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,689
a lot and this is what I'm gonna talk

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:54,329
about so what is your horse fear I mean

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:59,100
the one that really keeps you up at

00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:02,549
night well when I was this Iza which was

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,950
a lot of time ago I used to work in the

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,469
university today I used to do computer

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,690
science in Brazil and it was basically

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,120
like the integrated system of all the

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,280
University and that meant like the same

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,770
system to

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,430
to attract like students be enrolled in

00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:21,080
subjects or like the the professor's and

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,060
which classes they were giving and even

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,340
employees because there was a lot of

00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,190
like research projects and people needed

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:32,060
to like control money flow so it was a

00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:36,190
pretty big system we catered for more

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:39,100
than 67 thousand students and around

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:40,940
15,000 employees so it's pretty huge and

00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:43,160
basically it was pretty cool because

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,780
like while we were students we we just

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,670
had the opportunity of touching

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,709
basically everything on that stack and

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:52,220
that is like front-end back-end database

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:55,370
DevOps so it was really cool and there

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,870
was this one day that I was taking a

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,340
look at all the tables like that our

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,420
database wasn't pretty fast so I just

00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,630
remembered that we had a table for

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,280
employees and usually we added the

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,380
employees before they actually started

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,970
at their job just to keep their records

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,940
there and make sure that everything was

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:16,069
okay for for when they started and we

00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,079
usually registered those employees with

00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:20,120
the salary equals to zero and then we

00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:21,650
would update and but the things that

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,390
some of these employees never actually

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,940
made it in for some reason

00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:30,650
so what I was gonna do is just to

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:32,420
perform this very simple query to remove

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,180
all these like employees that weren't

00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:39,110
actual real employees but as I was doing

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:41,630
that I typed the first line and someone

00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:43,070
called me and asked something else I was

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,840
like yeah that's how are you doing no no

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:49,450
I'll take you there and then and I came

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,910
back and hit enter that was not cool

00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:56,150
because what you what happens if you do

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:59,570
this and you don't specify where is that

00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,690
you drop the table and of course I

00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:05,450
wasn't doing anything that allowed for

00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:09,230
rollbacks or anything so that was all

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:11,590
lost so around 15,000 records for all

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:15,489
the employees in the universities were

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:18,560
completely gone and that included names

00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:22,430
bank accounts information and that one

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,020
was specifically important because the

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,740
the way that the university would pay

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,509
them is that we would do

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,610
query in the database every month and

00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:32,880
get their banking information transfer

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,979
money and I must add that the this day

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:41,550
where this happened was one day before

00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:44,509
payday yeah it's a great story so that

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:48,150
was all gone that was all gone and

00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:49,710
honestly that was a moment that first of

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,180
all I refuse to believe that that was

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,590
actually happened so I tried to look for

00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,720
the table over and over and over again

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,800
and that I couldn't find it obviously it

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:02,069
was gone and at that time I just looked

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,789
stared at the void closed down my

00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:09,270
computer and honestly a tear held down

00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:14,759
my my face and I basically looked like

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:17,880
this puppet monkey so that was that was

00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,610
stuff no stuff but that wasn't doing

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,289
yeah that wasn't the end of me that

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,560
wasn't the end of my career it certainly

00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:27,240
felt so at the time and but that made me

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,770
into Who I am today that made me into

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,659
the developer and the professional that

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:33,300
I am today and I'm really thankful that

00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:36,150
that happened it taught me so much after

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,409
that we obviously did a lot more things

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,099
to make sure that this would never

00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:42,870
happen again we did backups we did

00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:46,130
well we couldn't like Jeff anything

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:49,050
because we did the the sort of trance

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:52,409
transition through that made you like

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,659
allows you to roll back operations so

00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:57,810
that also made our products way better

00:05:54,659 --> 00:06:00,599
of course learning by paying but but

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,610
still it was pretty good and if you take

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:05,130
a look at these free gentlemen they do

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,560
share one thing in common which is the

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,199
fact that they all have failed horribly

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,569
in their lives and probably that also

00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,979
made them into who they are so that's

00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:17,009
pretty cool I'm gonna talk about their

00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:21,569
stories and in the following slides so

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:23,819
bear with me I am Iza you can call me it

00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:27,659
sees a Bella but please call me ISA I'm

00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:29,240
a Mozilla tech speaker and as Paul said

00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:31,500
I work at I settle in Stockholm

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,310
originally from Brazil and I love

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,500
karaoke

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,990
and one really cool fact that I found

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,940
out it by myself last week is that I'm

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:42,390
the lost twin

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:45,720
of the impossibru meme guy that was

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,880
pretty cool it was actually pretty funny

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,580
because that picture was the thumbnail

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,980
of a pretty cool video of an interview

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,380
that I did with my Yuko a while ago and

00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:58,320
it was really interesting because as we

00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,140
took this picture I didn't actually see

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,700
it I just asked like hey how's a picture

00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,950
she's great

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:08,310
the picture came out great I was like ah

00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:09,720
awesome so yes this is what happens when

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,170
you ask your friend if the picture is

00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,960
great

00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,310
your friend is great you're not but

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,530
that's it this picture is gonna be

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,700
immortalized in the Internet for no one

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,800
but you should totally watch the

00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,520
interview it's awesome

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:27,650
okay so why do we fear failing why why

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:31,770
is it so hard and so crippling scarily

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:33,840
insanely the threatening to fail I I

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:36,720
give it some thought a while ago like

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,140
why is it so daunting and my conclusion

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,180
is that basically we're just afraid of

00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,520
shame we we don't want people to

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,669
discover that in fact we're not as good

00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,790
as we strike us to be and and that is

00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:53,640
not really nice right because shame is a

00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:55,680
toxic emotion it's it's not like you're

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,780
you're like afraid or or you're

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,060
concerned about what you did which would

00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,640
be guilt or you're not concerned about

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,070
your intentions which would be like I

00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,320
don't know regrets shame is

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:11,400
fundamentally feeling bad about who you

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:14,880
are this is not cool and being afraid of

00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,550
shame gets you to do a very a set of

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,880
very concerning and and horrible

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:23,820
behaviors such as self-sabotage who here

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,410
has never procrastinated to do something

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,810
that you're really not sure if you can

00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:30,480
do it or or perhaps like took in sanely

00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,610
long to to make a task that would be

00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,729
simple otherwise if you just take a stab

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,320
at it our or even just refusing to try

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,770
something because you think you're gonna

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,270
fail news for you this is self-sabotage

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:45,300
like I've done this time and time again

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:47,640
and I still do and and it is really hard

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,440
because it basically keeps you from

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,040
really being good at something or

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,199
learning

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,709
something or not being afraid to try new

00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:58,709
things and also another another way that

00:08:55,709 --> 00:09:00,649
this manifests itself is a thing that we

00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:03,899
I think we're all very familiar called

00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:06,089
parcel syndrome I think everybody here

00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,850
has felt at least once in their lives

00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:10,410
that holy look at all these people

00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,970
in conferences there is so much better

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,279
than I am look at all these things that

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,769
I don't know that I have to learn and

00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,990
this seems like really scary it seems

00:09:16,769 --> 00:09:21,620
like you deserve you don't deserve to be

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,180
where you are and that's another

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:27,930
manifestation of what shame and and

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:30,149
those emotions feel like but it is it is

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:32,130
very very concerning because if you if

00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:34,290
you do feel this way if you do feel like

00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,670
you don't belong there or that you can

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,009
never learn there would be as good as

00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,449
other people then you're never gonna

00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:41,069
learn anything in the first place

00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:43,410
because if you're if you're too afraid

00:09:41,069 --> 00:09:45,449
of actually trying something and failing

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:47,160
well you're not gonna learn because the

00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:49,440
main way that we learn things is by

00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,779
doing is white practice actually there's

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,910
a pretty cool paper about the psychology

00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:56,699
of learning that says that well

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:59,399
basically 80% of learning is just doing

00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:02,579
by practice training four senses like

00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,829
the actual lectures but fundamentally

00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:06,540
you just learn something by trying it

00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:07,769
and you're probably gonna fail I'm sorry

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,600
if you don't know something and

00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:12,089
something is like completely new to you

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,889
then odds are you're you're not gonna be

00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:16,050
great at first or you're gonna fail at

00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:17,760
something so that's that's really a

00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,430
shame that we don't have these kind of

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,230
things well you're also not gonna evolve

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,540
you're not you're not gonna grow because

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,490
if you're sag nating at a place and

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,800
you're kind of like afraid to take the

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:30,720
extra step because what if I'm not

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,269
good what if I can never get there what

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,010
if I try and I fail in front of everyone

00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:37,769
and what are people gonna say well then

00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:40,139
you're not gonna grow I'm sorry it's

00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:42,389
just not gonna happen most importantly

00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,610
and I think it's a very contradictory

00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:47,600
thing since it's such a buzzword and

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:50,310
companies and tech conferences nowadays

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,589
you have no innovation which is

00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,350
something that well we know that every

00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:57,329
company nowadays has it's the innovation

00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:01,470
team and blah blah blah we do machine

00:10:57,329 --> 00:11:03,640
learning well the way they learn

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,650
machine learning is by trying and

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,870
faily and honestly I I can say by

00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,400
experience because I try I do

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,860
machine-gunner myself because I think

00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,200
it's super cool and interesting and it

00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,380
is a really really frustrating thing to

00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,450
to learn because there's so many things

00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:21,760
that you don't get straight out of the

00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:24,760
box because it is a very like academic

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,580
and theory heavy thing so it is very

00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,220
taxing and if you're afraid of like

00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:32,890
maybe not making it or not understanding

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,810
machine learning well you're not gonna

00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:37,180
know machine learning so these are

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,490
pretty important three things that we

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:43,870
will be missing out if we are just too

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:45,550
afraid to fail and which was failure was

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,950
one of the things that will happen to

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,740
Bill Gates not sure if you guys know but

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,980
before Microsoft he had another company

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:55,420
called travel data if I'm not mistaken

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,640
the whole gist of the company is that

00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,860
they they would like collect traffic

00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,570
data from local authorities to try and

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,700
predict how the traffic was gonna be

00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:06,370
that was like especially important for

00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,200
trucks and and frights things and

00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:10,420
shipments and that that was pretty cool

00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,390
idea but it turns out it didn't really

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:17,050
work but there's actually this thing at

00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:19,810
a at a computer museum or something and

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,060
I found the text in this little plaque

00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,880
here pretty interesting this is Paul

00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:27,850
Allen Bill Gates a partner said that

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,420
well basically travel data wasn't a huge

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:33,550
success but it was essential for them to

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,620
actually be able to have Microsoft and

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,960
for Microsoft to be as successful as it

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,760
is it wouldn't have happened if they

00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,830
hadn't failed first at something else

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,600
and tried something again they really

00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:47,290
learned from it so that's that's how

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,020
Microsoft was built so there's a few

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:52,810
perks in when failing failing horribly

00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,940
at life the first one is that it

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:58,270
improves confidence after you try

00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:00,280
something you fail and you realize that

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,710
well you know what I survived

00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,480
that's awesome I can try this again or I

00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,820
can try different things so it really

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,470
makes a few more confidence at your own

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:11,590
ability to solve problems your own

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:14,620
ability to recover crisis your own

00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:16,960
ability to manage and unpredictable

00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:19,029
things so it is really

00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,070
good to just get yourself out there and

00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:23,170
try things for the first time because it

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,360
gets you more used to this way of

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,720
thinking because honestly ultimately it

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,390
is a way of thinking second thing is

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,610
that it just gives you tons of new

00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:35,260
things that you learned about like well

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,209
when you tried something for the first

00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,800
time that didn't happen so oh yeah I

00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:40,959
learned that next time I'm gonna do it

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,910
differently so most of these things that

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,980
we learn about programming you're about

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,560
teching about talking and dealing to

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,690
people you usually just get it you

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,580
understand that by trying something and

00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,740
and realizing what's the outcome and

00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,720
most times the outcome is not gonna be

00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,420
great but that's fine that's part of

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,330
life so it does teach you a lot I would

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:04,060
say like it's it's you just learn so

00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:06,220
much more from horribly of failure

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:08,290
experiences than these successes because

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,240
those are the experiences where as

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:12,279
something unpredictable happens and you

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,149
deal with it and they teach you so much

00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:17,529
more than just like the success outcome

00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:20,080
it could lead to happy accidents

00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:22,690
sometimes we do have a plan in mind and

00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,360
and honestly the thing that we haven't

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:27,070
envisioned doesn't really happen but you

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,720
just end up in really interesting

00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,420
scenarios that perhaps you didn't even

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,550
know about them it's it's not related to

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,320
tech but it is a pretty interesting

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:38,020
story that that was actually the case of

00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,970
penicillin so basically I forgot his

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:43,150
name but the guy that was like making a

00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:46,950
study on penicillin forgot to basically

00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:50,170
put a lid on the on the bottle thingy

00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:52,270
and then mold started to appear and he

00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:55,660
was like really ready to throw away the

00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:57,610
whole thing when he actually he realized

00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,790
that the the penicillin was killing the

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,440
mode the mold so that was a pretty cool

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,600
thing and perhaps he wouldn't have

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,010
reached that conclusion that this was

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,920
actually something that was worth

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:11,200
looking into if he didn't have that

00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,000
accident that well you can look at it

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,890
and see okay that was a mistake but

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,890
actually that led to a pretty cool and

00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:20,800
interesting solution and the last one is

00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:22,750
that like for the future events and for

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,029
the future opportunities you're gonna be

00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:27,820
able to recover so much faster from

00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:30,070
mistakes because I think it's really

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,780
unrealistic to try and

00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,310
set a goal to yourself was like oh you

00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,360
know what I'm gonna try that I'm gonna

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,420
be perfect

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,460
sorry you're not but it's a much more

00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,200
realistic goal to just say okay I'm

00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,360
gonna try this and I'm gonna be brave

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,330
enough to just see what it how it goes

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,150
and see how I can deal with this and

00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:51,190
honestly if you have like failed a

00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,930
couple of times at the same thing you're

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:55,240
just able to recognize like your own

00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:57,640
patterns of thinking your own ways of

00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,830
like okay how does that mistake make me

00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,140
feel like okay I get really anxious when

00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:04,270
this happens so perhaps the next time

00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:06,270
I'm gonna be able to understand more and

00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:09,400
why I feel this way and be able to

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:11,260
manage that situation faster and this is

00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,180
only going to happen if you failed a

00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,560
couple of times there's really no way

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,670
around it it's just something that we

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,500
have to live with so the important thing

00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,930
here is that I think it's way more

00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,180
healthier if we're just like transparent

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,680
about our mistakes and accept the

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,910
mistake as the mistakes of others

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,010
because ultimately it does create like a

00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:35,230
much healthier environment in the sense

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:38,380
that well if I'm in a team that nobody

00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:39,970
ever asked me for help or says oh you

00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,210
know what I just up at this thing

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:46,210
I'm never gonna feel confident enough to

00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:48,430
just go up to someone and admit that oh

00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,960
yeah you know what I tried this and it

00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,960
didn't work can you help me figure out

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,910
how to do better you're not gonna feel

00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,710
comfortable enough and that that's

00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:59,200
really important especially in

00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:01,420
development like we can brush up our

00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,060
tools as much as we want or we can

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,350
create the best frameworks but

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,900
developments about people and it's about

00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:10,780
teams and it's about how comfortable you

00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,240
are making making stuff happen with like

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,620
a set of five other people that are

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,640
doing this with you so it's really

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:21,280
important to be in the same game

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,230
together and you know what I like the

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,720
most

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:28,720
vulnerability vulnerability in a team is

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,340
really important because without you

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,440
feeling comfortable enough to feel

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,720
vulnerable with other people and without

00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,780
you making sure that people are

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,860
comfortable of being vulnerable with you

00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:41,620
you're probably not going to ship a

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,820
great tech product I'm sorry it's not

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,340
going to happen

00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:48,040
you're not basically you're not gonna be

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,690
able to single-handedly make a huge

00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,550
platform happen you're not gonna be able

00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:54,010
to push like great things to detect

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:55,840
community so you need to be vulnerable

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,880
with your team and you need to embrace

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,690
their vulnerability because that's what

00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,790
makes things happen better and as a

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:06,550
second anecdote there's a really

00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,530
interesting story of Steve Jobs and I

00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:11,560
think everybody knows his story that he

00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:15,220
was actually fired from Apple basically

00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:18,190
because he was a jerk and so he had all

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:20,710
these like really high level of demands

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:24,370
and he was all like very hard on his

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:26,170
criticisms and ultimately that drove the

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,740
team's to such an inhale thei

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:31,540
environment and an unhealthy way of

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:34,120
dealing with the product and and that

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,010
was just not working so basically what

00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,380
happened is that like the whole Board of

00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:41,140
Directors got together and said like hey

00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,580
man you need to leave I'm sorry and in

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,160
the case of Apple since it was like a

00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,590
public company and you have stakeholders

00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:51,040
that actually was possible of happening

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:53,320
and for him that that would have been

00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,180
like absolute doom were for anyone that

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,860
is in that situation to be fired from

00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,940
the company that you started yourself

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:04,920
could be considered like horribly

00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:07,240
terrifyingly big a failure but I

00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,980
saw this really interesting quote for

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,630
him and you don't need to read the whole

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,760
thing but basically he's saying that

00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:14,530
well getting fired from Apple was the

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,900
best thing that ever happens for him

00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:19,180
because he was at this status where he

00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,610
needed to be the king he needed to be

00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,940
the genius guy that always presented

00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:28,600
amazing things and after he had that

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,610
first fall from grace he just felt like

00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,240
he was liberated he was set free by the

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,360
whole thing

00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,460
he didn't need to be the genius guy all

00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,130
the time again and that eventually

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:41,710
sparked his creativity to the fullest

00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,870
and obviously I'm not Steve Jobs and I'm

00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,280
not even that successful but I can't

00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,560
really sympathize with that like

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,410
sometimes in our careers we just reach

00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:52,450
to a level where we just feel like okay

00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,760
wasn't accept what's an accept how am I

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,590
gonna get bigger and that is addicting

00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,940
that is kind of almost kind of like

00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:02,620
golden golden chains so it is really

00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,600
important for us to think that it's okay

00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,879
to make mistakes and it's okay to make

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,370
different decisions because that's what

00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:11,860
gonna makes us feel more created and

00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:15,190
more free to to think in different ways

00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:18,309
so that's really important so okay

00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:20,440
Oh all that said I went ahead and made

00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:23,259
you all something that I call the guide

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,929
to recovery and I hope you enjoy

00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:29,409
it I think it's gonna be useful so the

00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:32,409
rules are first of all when confronted

00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:34,779
with a massive horribly failure

00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:37,590
in your life first thing you need to do

00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:39,549
is breathe calm down

00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,809
obviously because when when we were

00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:42,940
confronted with something that is

00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:46,389
unexpected and that never happened

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:50,139
we get really excited in sciatica and

00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:52,389
just like afraid and scared of how am I

00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:54,669
gonna do to figure this out and when

00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:56,169
you're in that stage of distress you're

00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:57,879
probably not gonna come up with a lot of

00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:01,090
good ideas you're gonna come up with

00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:04,179
that spread idea so take take a moment

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:06,070
to yourself take a deep breath be calm

00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:09,549
talk to someone talk to someone really

00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:11,139
helps especially because it's really

00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:13,690
nice to have the perspective as someone

00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:15,580
that is not within the problem so that's

00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:19,960
something that for me is always very

00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:21,549
useful so keep calm second it's

00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,470
important to create an action plan

00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:25,629
because obviously when when you're

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,850
confronted with a really serious like

00:21:25,629 --> 00:21:30,789
situation of something that went

00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,320
terribly wrong you you you basically

00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,749
don't know what to start like how do I

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,499
start unfuckin this like how do I start

00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:40,629
making this well again so try to dissect

00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:43,779
the problem try to figure out okay what

00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:46,419
causes how can I revert this is it

00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:50,049
possible to revert this and if it's not

00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:51,909
how do I manage the the whole situation

00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:53,950
how do I get the data to be back in the

00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:57,159
database how do I get the server to be

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:59,649
back up and if you're not sure if you

00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,080
don't know please ask for help like it's

00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:03,879
fine to us for help sometimes we as

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:08,019
developers tend to think of ourselves as

00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:09,950
like lonely heroes but it really does

00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:11,570
help for you to just like

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,820
get someone to help you and get someone

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,970
to at least share that discomfort and to

00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:20,600
be by your side to back you up

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,429
next up establish prevent preventive

00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,870
measures because obviously you don't

00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:26,990
want to make the same mistake a lot of

00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:29,570
times right so it's really important

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:33,889
like as I as I shared in a case of my

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:35,029
happening we did establish measures to

00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:37,940
make sure that this wouldn't happen

00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:40,100
again such as trying to create backups

00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,870
create routines for checking if the

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:44,840
database is all right create a pipeline

00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:47,659
on Jenkins or a CI or whatever it is to

00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,279
to make sure that you have things to

00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:51,769
prevent you from doing something that

00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,090
could be destructive or at least prevent

00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:54,710
you from doing something with that

00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,799
asking for like a double check

00:22:54,710 --> 00:23:00,200
confirmation kind of thing so make sure

00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:01,850
that this you're creating a setup for an

00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,059
environment where this is not gonna

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:07,250
happen again it's important to revisit

00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:09,919
goals because we're talking about

00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:11,899
accidents here but sometimes a failure

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,970
is not gonna be indexed and a failure is

00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:15,769
something that you have conviction of

00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,260
something that you really thought it was

00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:20,029
gonna work and it didn't so it's

00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,309
important to revisit the goals that you

00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:25,279
have through yourself and make sure okay

00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:27,529
like do they still make sense or should

00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,389
I change something here what did I learn

00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:32,059
with this episode that I could possibly

00:23:29,389 --> 00:23:34,039
like apply two different different

00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:35,480
episodes and that's really important

00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:38,000
because you don't want to insist in a

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,370
plan that well it's like fated to to

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,350
fail so it's really important that you

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:46,669
just sit down reanalyze the whole thing

00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:49,730
basically regroup and finally repeat the

00:23:46,669 --> 00:23:51,590
cycle because this is gonna happen again

00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,970
I mean if you fail today it's very

00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:55,880
likely that you're gonna make some

00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:59,809
mistakes in the future nobody's shielded

00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,190
from anything so be okay with this make

00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:02,750
peace with the fact that you're gonna

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,149
make mistakes and that other people are

00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:07,039
gonna make mistakes and that's okay

00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:08,539
it is really important for especially

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,909
we're talking about like a product

00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:12,500
company if you have like a really long

00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:14,179
relationship with the thing that you're

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,039
building you're gonna have a lot of

00:24:14,179 --> 00:24:18,679
convictions that are gonna be proven to

00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:20,570
be wrong and and it's really like nice

00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,399
to make peace with this whole cycle in

00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:25,499
understand oh okay things can go out

00:24:23,399 --> 00:24:28,589
out of what is expected and that's fine

00:24:25,499 --> 00:24:30,659
we don't need to marry an idea because

00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:33,599
it's another thing that I get a little

00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:35,489
bit not pissed off but like annoyed

00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,349
sometimes as ow

00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:40,409
we just like have an idea of something

00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:43,440
that would work and we try to make your

00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:45,269
work regardless of how many signs or how

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,799
many signals were getting of the fact

00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:49,109
that well perhaps is another way perhaps

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,809
we have to figure out another solution

00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:53,940
so like don't be married to ideas they

00:24:51,809 --> 00:24:55,379
it's okay if they're not the absolute

00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,889
truth you can always like think of

00:24:55,379 --> 00:25:01,529
something else and for the nest the next

00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:04,889
story here in the three gentlemen this

00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:08,879
is Thomas Edison and he was a guy that

00:25:04,889 --> 00:25:12,029
invented lamps and Lexor City and light

00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:14,820
bulbs and before inventing the perfect

00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:17,759
one the one that got to the market he

00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:20,909
failed not once not twice but ten

00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:24,119
thousand times ten thousand

00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:26,099
times and and that was the whole cycle

00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,690
that took him like all the way from like

00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:29,369
no not knowing how this would be

00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:31,409
commercially viable because like you

00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:32,820
don't you're not gonna be able to sell

00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:36,330
something if you're selling it for like

00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:38,519
too much money so when someone asked him

00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:40,979
about like okay but do you never get

00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:43,309
frustrated or how did you manage to

00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:45,570
you're like insists for so many times

00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:47,879
he's have something that I think it's

00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:49,469
very interesting he said why would I

00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:52,769
feel like a failure and why would I ever

00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:55,499
give up I now know definitely over 9000

00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:58,049
ways of electric an electric light bulb

00:25:55,499 --> 00:26:00,210
will not work success is almost at my

00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:03,179
grasp so that's also a really cool way

00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,609
of thinking about mistakes now you know

00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:07,979
something that definitely not works and

00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:10,950
and it's a pretty cool way to reach a

00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:12,690
solution you just can do you can rule

00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:16,019
out things by elimination and that's

00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:18,089
also a very valid process it is the

00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:21,599
process as Thomas Edison took can it

00:26:18,089 --> 00:26:24,659
worked for him so that's a pretty cool

00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,249
thing cool so now you can all pet

00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:30,330
yourselves in the back you're a

00:26:26,249 --> 00:26:34,489
certified experts congratulations

00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:34,489
you deserve a round of applause

00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:44,470
when my key message here is that we all

00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:46,809
need to like celebrate our failures as

00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:48,790
much as our successes as much as our

00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:51,309
conquests because they are equally

00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:53,320
important for our lives as much as like

00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:55,120
all the things that we do right all the

00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,090
things that we do wrong teach us even

00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,429
more about how to get to the Holy Grail

00:26:58,090 --> 00:27:02,920
how to get to your gold so make sure

00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:03,970
that you celebrate all of them and make

00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,059
peace with the fact that you're not

00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:10,660
going to be perfect always and to close

00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:11,950
up the talk I have quite big quotes but

00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:14,679
I would like to read it to all of you

00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:18,340
because I love it it's by theory our

00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:20,800
Theodore Roosevelt and he has a quote

00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,840
that says it is not the critic who

00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,730
counts not the man who points out how

00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,860
the strong man stumbles or where the

00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:29,080
doer of Deeds could have done them

00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,120
better the credit belongs to the man who

00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:33,730
is actually in the arena whose face is

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,429
marred by dust sweat and blood who

00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:38,350
strives valiantly who airs who comes

00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:40,270
short again again and again because

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,820
there is no effort without error and

00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:45,190
shortcoming but who does actually strive

00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,620
to do the deeds who knows great

00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:50,410
enthusiasms the great devotions who

00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:53,410
spends himself in a worthy cause who had

00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:55,960
best knows in the end the triumph of

00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:58,510
high achievement and who at worst if he

00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,630
fails at least fails while daring

00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:05,140
greatly so that this place shall never

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:08,309
be with those cold and timid souls who

00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:11,520
never know victory nor defeat

00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:11,520
