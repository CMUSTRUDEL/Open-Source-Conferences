In 1985 pop music was mesmerized by the a-ha “Take on me” music video. It’s been almost 35 years since then, the world needs new catchy tunes with impressive video animations… on the web.

In this talk we will explore the bewitching ways we can modify web videos and create immersive experiences worthy of the ‘80s using JavaScript and CSS. Let us swim in the why-not possibility of Chroma key, Rotoscoping and more video animation techniques on the web platform!

Evangelina Ferreira is a front-end developer and teacher. She is currently working at Aerolab as a UI Developer and has been teaching web technologies at the National Technological University of Argentina for more than five years. In her free time she organizes CSSConf Argentina.

[Applause]

00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:10,230
thank you very much thank you for having

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,049
me here in this beautiful city my talk

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:17,490
is called take on me take on me is

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:19,619
actually a 1980s song very catchy song

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,990
very catchy music with some amazing

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,090
animations it's by a Norwegian man

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,369
called aha

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,410
the thing is I'm not really good at

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,090
music I'm not going to talk about the

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,000
catchy music but I'm going to talk about

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,700
the war animations because that's like

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,800
my life go I really enjoy making this

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,870
kind of completely useless animations

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,629
it's like hey I could grab Harry Potter

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,399
and use CSS gradients and there's

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:48,180
something like that because if he turned

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,840
white wouldn't you so high or oh yeah

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,489
I'm ever my friend on developer birthday

00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,340
protector feels less creativity at night

00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:00,480
I'm also a Mozilla tech speaker and I

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,340
also organize CSS conversion Tina so by

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,949
the way my name is actually all that but

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,780
as long as you call me a by Eva or a

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:11,880
face okay well what is this thing this

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,650
is something called rotoscopy it's an

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,770
animation technique that has more than a

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:20,509
hundred years old and this animation is

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:23,009
no release to make it takes so much time

00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:24,810
the thing is that it's really

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,939
interesting and even though it has a

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,820
hundred years old and it began in the

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,880
movies and cinema it has eventually

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,640
gotten into the music video industry

00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:38,430
especially with this song in 1985 but

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:44,520
also in this another one by Green Day in

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:48,090
2009 Lily Allen 2015 I mean not Paramore

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:52,680
occasionally in two years ago and part

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:54,750
Murat all again in 2018 and why not

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,020
let's mention that and Justin Bieber

00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:00,390
this year so how does it work well

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,969
rotoscoping consists on recording a

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,329
completely normal video and drawing on

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:10,289
top of that so you have to tell from 15

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:12,870
to 25 images per second that's a lot

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:15,359
and you can be drawing like for five

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,129
hours when you actually play the video

00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:19,980
and you have like three seconds of

00:02:17,129 --> 00:02:23,790
animation it's not a much but it will be

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,769
the best three seconds of your life so

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:28,409
you can turn something like these which

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,909
looks really what is going on and -

00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:33,060
something like this which it looks

00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:35,040
amazing so right now you can do

00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,909
rotoscoping with other with photoshop

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,870
and welcome but we can actually do it in

00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:44,970
the browser so the thing is two years

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,849
ago this video came out is called hard

00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:51,209
times by Paramore and when I took a look

00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:53,549
at this it was like this light bulb that

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,919
turns on and it's like maybe we could

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:58,109
like thing what we can do right now in

00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:02,040
web animations and imperator see what

00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:04,379
else we can do the thing is I kind of

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,980
took a look at what we have right now in

00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:10,439
the web of traditional animation because

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,810
once again we keep on bringing things

00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:14,909
from tradition and animation from movies

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,709
and from the cinema into the web and

00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:20,220
it's really interesting how far we have

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:23,549
gotten for example we can do today

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,919
just emotions and motion graphics in the

00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:28,319
web if you are into learning a

00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,810
stop-motion you should actually Google

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,879
Rachel my words because she's an amazing

00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:35,400
teacher and she has so many videos

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,530
online and courses as well teaching how

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,560
to make a stop motion animation on the

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,819
web and when it comes to motion graphics

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,340
you can go Chris Connor who is a really

00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:49,979
nice person and he does this wonderful

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,840
useless animations as well like a pig's

00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:53,970
eye spinner so when you're waiting for

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,150
the website too long but it looks like a

00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:00,810
pizza is great and also I have to

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,180
mention Julian must solve our problem

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,239
miss rennolds is her name and she

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,150
actually did this great thing which is

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,840
kind of an and motion graphic animation

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:15,440
but in pure CSS so take a look at her

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,450
code but if you can because it's amazing

00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:21,029
so my question is can we go further can

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,830
we do something else besides this kind

00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,620
of too traditional image

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:29,280
can't be Mabel does skipping on the web

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:34,970
well the answer will surprise you know

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:37,050
we can and the reason why is because

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,259
rotoscoping it's something completely

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,629
handmade it has like the soul of the

00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:44,669
people who is drawing and I love my

00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:47,729
computer is called Minerva of course he

00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:49,729
has a name but it doesn't have a soul so

00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:52,949
it's not the same you cannot really

00:04:49,729 --> 00:04:56,400
pretend to do something that the human

00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:59,580
can can do but anyway we can also

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,440
interact with the computer and if we

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,629
take a look at music videos we cannot

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,000
interact with music videos it's like you

00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:08,099
watch it and that's it so there is a

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,440
place for improvement there is a place

00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,990
to do something interesting in there we

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,650
can take the basic idea of rotoscoping

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,300
and take it into the browser so if we

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,060
take a look at these part of the video

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,069
of heartens by Paramore we can see that

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,500
there are free layers we see a

00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:27,900
background layer with kind of blue 1

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,180
yellow moving things then there is a

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,969
second layer in that second layer we'll

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,159
see these two people dancing and on top

00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:37,409
of them we got a rotoscoping we got

00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:40,380
these lines that are moving around and

00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:42,960
if you look at the back and like behind

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,840
the scenes we got this which is really

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,060
funny to watch what they did was

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,449
actually they recorded this video they

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,060
reverse it so it's actually reversed

00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:56,430
they remove that green background fill

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,460
it with this kind of yellow and blue

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:02,580
animations put themselves and on top of

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,500
that the other animations so we can do

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,020
something like this we can begin with

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,539
this we can remove the green background

00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,219
and add something else there is

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:15,090
something called chroma key and it's

00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:18,090
really common in movies like Avengers so

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,639
what they do is they record a movie with

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,219
a green or blue background white green

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,740
and blue or not because it's Percy B

00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:28,349
well we cannot really use well because

00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,509
our faces have a tendency to be red so

00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:32,639
we have to choose either green or blue

00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:35,399
which has the two colors we don't

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,300
usually have on our skin and of course

00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,650
if we will use

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:40,680
the green background we don't wear a

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:43,169
green if we use blue we can wear please

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,419
and once you've got that once you got

00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:48,120
that blue or green background you need

00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:48,599
really good light and I mean really good

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,039
light

00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:54,840
and that means use not natural light

00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:57,150
natural light is like that level for

00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,879
animations if you have ever work on in

00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:01,620
stop-motion animation or even work on

00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:03,270
something like chroma key you will

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,810
understand that natural light is

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:09,389
horrible simply because these kind of

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:12,030
animations take so much time that maybe

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:14,699
you expect any towers working on it and

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:17,639
in those eight hours the earth moves

00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:20,069
around the Sun so suddenly only shadows

00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,560
move and that is a disaster so we don't

00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:24,539
want really this kind of natural light

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,120
we prefer these lights whenever we work

00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:29,370
with animations or in this case with

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,259
chroma key so let me see

00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,509
chroma key now let's make chroma key

00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,949
with the users camera because again we

00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:38,580
are in the web we can actually enjoy

00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:41,279
this so to do this what we need to do is

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,199
to take the users input camera and take

00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,229
that input and put it into a video tab

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,900
now we cannot edit a video tag so we

00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:51,330
need to copy that into a canvas and then

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,090
process that canvas and what we will do

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:56,880
is remove the green or the blue and

00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:59,069
replace that with something else so

00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,279
first step take the users camera input

00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:04,289
to do this we actually use getusermedia

00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,629
which is really simple to use and it's

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:08,610
available a loss in every browser this

00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:09,919
will return a promise and then we can

00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,620
work on it

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,440
so we got our B data with an ID of video

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,169
and we copy all this streaming from the

00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,990
camera into that video and if it doesn't

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:29,639
work we just throw an error message and

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:32,310
we get something like this anywhere it's

00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,159
kind of ok so you got your video tag you

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:38,579
accept the job prompt assess would you

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:42,269
allow using your video and perfect so

00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:44,910
let's copy that into a canvas tag so we

00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:48,530
get to create our canvas with an ID of

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:51,710
canvas because I'm really creative and

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:54,620
then we basically allow 2d context and

00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,600
we create a function like this so what

00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,270
this function will do is it will take

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,880
all the information from our video from

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,250
the top left corner on to the bottom

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,090
right corner and it will copy it into

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:10,760
our canvas now if you only use this code

00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:13,640
we will have one issue that is that only

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,160
we will see the first frame of the video

00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,290
copy into the canvas and then the video

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,480
will keep on a streaming but it canvas

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,240
one refresh so we need to refresh the

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,310
canvas all the time there are so many

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,200
great performance talk in this

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,600
conference that's why mine is not

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,560
performant we are going to do a set time

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,200
out of zero so we do it the time out the

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,060
zero we get something like this we get

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,460
the prompt will you share your camera

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,320
with this website years and then we get

00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,860
the videos on the left the original

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:51,080
video and on the right the canvas and

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:53,570
something else we get my cut so it works

00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:56,420
it works perfectly and it refreshes all

00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:58,190
the time so next is to process the

00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:00,800
cameras is to remove the green or the

00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,230
blue for that we need to do something

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,270
called pixel manipulation so we need to

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,730
actually kind of remember a little bit

00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,710
about what is a pixel now I know this is

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:12,860
a front-end conference but let's take a

00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:15,740
closer look anyway so a pixel is the

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:19,250
tiniest part of a video or an image like

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:22,100
this a pixel has information in this

00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:24,320
case or shibi information so if we take

00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:28,160
a look at this pink we are actually

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:32,930
taking a look at this red blast screen

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,550
plus this blue and all those free audio

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:39,560
returns this pink

00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:42,710
an RGB goes from 0 to 255 0 being black

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,540
and 255 being the strongest rather

00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:47,030
stronger screen and the strongest blue

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:50,360
so in this case we got a really strong

00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:53,510
red a kind of dark green and a kind of

00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,460
in the middle blue under so through the

00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,500
alpha Channel and I know this sounds

00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:00,950
weird because there is not such a thing

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,769
as transparency in videos but anyway

00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,860
when we ask

00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:07,800
information in will return the alpha-2

00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:10,739
so what we will do right now is we will

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,439
ask for every pixel information of every

00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:15,329
frame that our video is getting and we

00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:18,959
will ask for the red value of the green

00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:22,739
value w value and the Alpha value and

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:26,519
then we will turn that alpha value into

00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:28,170
zero so that will be the trick so we

00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,509
find the green pixels and we'll read

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,189
them with them to find the good pixels

00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:34,259
we need to take a look at the

00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:37,110
information of the video so to do that

00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:38,910
we use get image data get image data

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,499
will return all the information from

00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:45,389
every part of the video in an RGB a way

00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:48,569
plus it will return the height and the

00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:51,119
width of the video so when I cancel not

00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:54,749
that I get this which is okay the width

00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:59,100
of the video is 480 the the height is

00:11:54,749 --> 00:12:02,699
480 the with a 640 and here it is the

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,860
1.2 million array because yeah why

00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:07,920
wouldn't you need the 1.2 million all

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,779
right when is this 1.2 million because

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,089
it seems like a random number it's

00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,980
actually the width of the video multiply

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:16,709
the height of the video multiply 4

00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,139
because 4 is the number of information

00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:21,779
that you get from each pixel the red the

00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:25,429
green the blue and the alpha so if you

00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:29,339
open that if it is so you open it again

00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:32,249
and again and again and suddenly you get

00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:34,559
to the important part so in this part it

00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:38,399
looks like random numbers again but we

00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:40,589
can find a sequence the sequence is 255

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,079
so we know that video doesn't have

00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:45,509
transparency so that must be the Alpha

00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:48,749
and if that is the alpha that means of

00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:50,790
we can identify the others is rgbi your

00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:53,759
GPA you should be a of every pixel

00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:56,279
beginning from the top left so if we

00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,040
take a look at the first pixel we get

00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:02,669
this value which is equal to this her

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,480
GPA so what get there is something like

00:13:02,669 --> 00:13:08,399
blueish

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:12,929
yeah because it's 55 red 74 of blue and

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:15,059
86 of green of sorry 74 of green and

00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:16,019
ethicists of blue 16 of lewisham is

00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:18,899
really dark

00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:23,189
those are really low values and the one

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:25,829
of the alpha so let's go through all

00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:28,529
that data and let's find the green

00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:30,899
pixels and we need to identify them we

00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:33,480
identify the red values the green values

00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:35,730
and the blue values and then we ask if

00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,980
the Green is greater than the blue and

00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:39,869
it will Green is greater than the red if

00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,139
that is the case I'm going to turn the

00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:45,480
opacity value to syrup and then I have

00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:49,980
to return this new information to our

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:57,629
cameras so this gets us something like

00:13:49,980 --> 00:14:00,119
this which looks really bad I mean it

00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:02,220
works but we cannot really happy on

00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:04,049
celebrating because of that so we need

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,850
to improve it there are two things that

00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:08,819
are really wrong in there first one is a

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,920
right that is natural light that's why I

00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:12,929
say natural light is not the devil you

00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,269
don't do natural light you can see that

00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:18,299
it's like a lot of light coming from one

00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:21,089
side and nothing from the other and then

00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:24,569
we need to remove the colors only if the

00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:26,759
greens are bigger than 100 why because

00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:29,369
as you can see part of my hair has been

00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:32,509
taken away I mean hair is not green as

00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:36,420
far as I know but it's brown and

00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:39,360
basically browns and grays have a value

00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:41,699
of red green and blue so even though if

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,559
those values are really low the computer

00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:45,839
will is still identified it's only has

00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:47,549
only one more pixel screen and it will

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,009
pick it a screen even though we listen

00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:52,829
so whenever it is too dark whenever the

00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:55,110
value is too close to zero we really

00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:57,959
cannot trust it so we won't remove

00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:00,059
values that are lower than 100 because

00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:02,490
those are dark values and we are not

00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:06,629
sure if they are really green off or if

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:12,029
they art may be grounds or grace so we

00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:14,249
get something like this in return so I

00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:18,209
kind of worked better we have now no

00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:20,999
natural light we have to remove only the

00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:23,489
greens if they are bigger than 100 so as

00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:25,319
you can see my hair is normal again but

00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,990
there is something wrong with my t-shirt

00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:29,430
I know what you're gonna say it's a

00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:33,750
Harry Potter t-shirt it's magic

00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:36,089
yes but also is white and white has a

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,120
tendency to take in a lot of the colors

00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:41,310
from the surroundings so I could either

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,779
modify my cold or change my t-shirt

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:45,720
guess what

00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:49,290
and I changed my t-shirts that's why I'm

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,380
running back today this is what every

00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:59,790
developer week at home so let's try it

00:15:52,380 --> 00:16:01,020
we'll die let's see so I got these will

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,580
you share your coming around

00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:04,020
I got our goat cheek with two cameras I

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,940
got the camera from the computer and

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,330
they lend me this one so I'm going to

00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:12,480
use this camera which is much better

00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:15,540
Here I am so this is the video on the

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,459
left from the canvas on the right and I

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,050
made this kind of drop-down where you

00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:22,080
can select if you want to filter green

00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,589
or blue it's in green Rina so we got

00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,899
this

00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:27,870
when we open weave and when you can

00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:36,390
please know how works because of the

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:41,040
background thank you and if you turn it

00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:42,959
into blue you can see the same but in

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,779
all the filters blue are not no longer

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,610
green so that's pretty cool but let's

00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:50,910
make something even cooler which is

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:53,130
basically invisibility cloak because if

00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,350
you're like Harry Potter why wouldn't

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:58,170
you make an invisibility cloak so how

00:16:55,350 --> 00:17:03,870
does it work well you need to take a

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:07,230
picture of your background without you

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:09,420
so I'm going to move over here let's

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:12,990
take this tell you that and I'm going to

00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,730
take a picture of that and then I'm

00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,449
going to use that as a background

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:21,390
instead of the hard words so let's take

00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:25,170
this picture the one I just took I'm

00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:27,209
going to copy it into our images folder

00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:31,490
right next to her words let's go up in a

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:35,100
name and let's modify our beautiful CSS

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:40,250
so one longer it will not no longer be

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:42,280
hard words will be windows some fan set

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,770
so we can refresh

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:49,060
and we get that that's lack of any mesh

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:52,240
that's great we are going to allow the

00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:56,470
camera see did I use the right camera

00:17:52,240 --> 00:18:00,250
that's my question yes there's a right

00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:03,820
time around that's good well she's the

00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:06,610
other camera over here alright and we

00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,830
are filtering green so we're twin and

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,980
the thing you need to do is like to

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:17,400
cover yourself and that's it it's pretty

00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,400
simple it's like it's done and invisible

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:26,350
[Applause]

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,950
thank you very much

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:32,440
it also works with blue because you

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,450
always anytime you get a chance to make

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:39,460
get silly of your selfies like please do

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:41,200
so so it's the best dress you can get

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:48,370
for a conference when you are an

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:50,620
introvert so one final point over here

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,810
which is what happens if I want to make

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,610
something else what happiness we we

00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:58,540
don't only not only want to modify the

00:18:54,610 --> 00:19:02,350
backgrounds that's my fault like so more

00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:05,860
victim manipulation I can paramour video

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:07,960
in this part the tap if they had the

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,370
singer is dancing and at the same time

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,250
there are cheaper she would suffer

00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,990
dancing as well with the same moves so

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,680
there is rotoscoping somebody actually

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:20,230
draw that and copy it right next to her

00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,580
so we can do something like that I'm not

00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,340
going to dance that would be awkward

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,470
they know so if it dancing so we are

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,670
going to grab this gift of Taylor Swift

00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:32,260
we are going to remove the background

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:35,550
and then we are going to copy Taylor

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:39,310
Swift so now we get free Taylor Swift I

00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:41,350
I also kind of shrink that you all are

00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:43,540
Taylor Swift so it gets a kind of nicer

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,040
effect but you don't really need to do

00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,990
that

00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:49,000
so to copy the Taylor Swift what you do

00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,580
is create another canvas and then you

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:56,920
position them with position relative and

00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:59,590
absolute then after you copy them you

00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,680
need to make them pink so what you need

00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,360
to make being is not the green area

00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,660
because the green is gone you need to

00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,940
make pink what is left of the green so

00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,430
we used to have an ephah statement we

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:17,170
are going to use the else

00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:18,940
so if what is left is not a green pixel

00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:21,880
what we are going to do is we are going

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,550
to grab the zero value on the number two

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,320
value and the zero value number two are

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:29,080
the information from the green and the

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,110
blue so if you put a high value of green

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:35,890
of bread and a high value of blue what

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:39,550
you get is kind of pink so high

00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:41,620
Plus hi blue give us pink in the second

00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:44,170
and said also found in the third Taylor

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:47,020
Swift so you get something like this

00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:50,350
which is Taylor Swift dancing and pink

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,250
leadership decides and if you want to

00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,900
make it better

00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:56,110
you cannot kittens because they always

00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:58,330
make sense better and since we have any

00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:05,860
JavaScript conference it can only act

00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:07,690
logos because why wouldn't you so I know

00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,310
it's not what the scope in because like

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,530
yeah and it's a computer it's not a

00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,510
human doing that but it's pretty cool

00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:16,090
and you can do a lot of stuff we can

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:18,370
really open your mind to whatever you

00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:20,320
want and he was in your browser I mean

00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,810
when I was a child and I used to like

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,720
this kind of green screen things I used

00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:27,520
to actually pirate Adobe Premiere and

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,340
Adobe After Effects because I couldn't

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,500
afford noise like 15 so I no longer

00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,210
think that now I got my own software now

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,790
I got the browser and I can do that we

00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,740
shall expect so thank you very much for

00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:42,280
listening I will leave you with these

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:44,020
links if I were you I wouldn't open the

00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,150
second one on my phone because he

00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,280
crushed mine is actually the online

00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:51,210
version of that so I hope you enjoy

00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,210
thank you very much

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:59,769
