Flat, muted minimalism, vast fields of whitespace, millennial pink landing pages, and those corporate illustrations that all kind of look the same: the internet today, amirite? In the West, consumers and web developers have deep-rooted expectations of how the web should work and look that have gone largely unquestioned.

In this talk, we'll take stock of these biases and take a culturally relativistic look at the internet outside of our comfort zone. We'll explore questions like: Why are Japanese websites so information-dense? How does a script like Arabic, read right to left, affect web design? What languages do (or can) programmers across the world use? Attendees of this talk will walk away with a fresh perspective and ideas for improving our web and making technology that's more inclusive of a global audience.

Kat Kitay is an engineer, former product manager at BuzzFeed, and anthropology grad from UCLA. She's an appreciator and cataloguer of the internet in all its beautiful, weird, and diverse forms.

thank you hello I'm really excited to be

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:17,850
here and Budapest and to talk about the

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,939
World Wide Web and all of those things I

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,140
have heard a ton of languages spoken

00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:25,830
yesterday which is really exciting for

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,470
me and quick intro my name is Kat Cote

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,230
I'm actually no longer at BuzzFeed I

00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,840
work at a startup called ribbon in New

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,420
York City where I'm a product engineer I

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,010
used to be a product manager and

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,510
although my I've worked in tech for a

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,399
couple years now my background is

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,340
actually in anthropology which is the

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,809
study of human societies biology

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:52,829
evolution culture and so like Steve Jobs

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:55,440
I like to think about systems of people

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,620
and now in my job I think about systems

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,899
of code and logic and I think that

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:04,199
understanding people is the key to

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,180
building good software products and now

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,369
that I'm an engineer I think it's also a

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,619
really important part of architect and

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,119
software the right way and that's kind

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,170
of the crux of what this talk is about

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,299
I'm gonna see if this clicker works so

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,070
the this talk is about the web norms of

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,380
the world it's it's based on the premise

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,759
that the web is different around the

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,700
world in different countries and so I

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,290
think everybody here it's probably

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,450
familiar with traveling to a new country

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,420
looking up an event they're trying to

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,619
buy a train ticket maybe and noticing

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,509
that websites look a little bit

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,520
different and I think especially here in

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,130
Europe this is a no surprise where I'm

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,360
from the US it is more shocking when you

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,240
when you leave and things are so

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,320
different and I wanted to jump just into

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,720
a couple examples to warm us up

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,360
this is Rakuten which is the top

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,130
Japanese ecommerce site and this this

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,049
talk was actually inspired by some

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,420
friends going to Japan and coming back

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,939
and talking about how different Japanese

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,649
web looked so what's different about it

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,180
it's obviously it's like a familiar

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,270
website right but it's obviously in

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,760
Japanese there's a lot of there's a

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,230
pointer there's a lot of navigation

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,410
option

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,360
really readily clickable there's a heavy

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,120
use of iconography paired with the

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,160
navigation items I noticed and I noticed

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,810
also that in the product images

00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,470
themselves there's a lot of baked in

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:31,470
text so the marketing images all have

00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,110
text in them and just to compare it to a

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,450
Western site Amazon and there are fewer

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,580
navigation elements in general so all of

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,890
the product categories are hidden behind

00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:43,230
a really big hamburger menu and there's

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,270
no text in the product images themselves

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,310
the text is natively rendered in the

00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,310
browser around them and it's generally

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,760
more spaced out and to move to a

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,550
European example this is the French

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,989
train travel portal it's really normal

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,480
here in Europe you probably know more

00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:02,280
than me that is pretty normal to get on

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,620
a train to go for a vacation or to

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,320
travel to a new city and I've noticed

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,030
that on a lot of European transit sites

00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,790
it's very they've adopted this really

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,660
friendly rounded color like candy

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,730
colored design aesthetic with a really

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,910
heavy focus on packages and hotels and

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,700
destinations and so if we look at Amtrak

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:27,630
which is the largest rail system in the

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:30,239
US it's way more serious it's there's

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:33,060
actually no destinations on this page at

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,310
all and I think it's probably more

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,049
commuter focused and so the differences

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,870
are subtle but they are they're there

00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:43,650
right they're different and I've started

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,870
to wonder why they're different and as I

00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,140
think through them I keep coming back to

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,880
my background and studying culture I

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,730
always thought that there were clear

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,230
right or wrong ways to develop websites

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:57,390
like if you're gonna make an e-commerce

00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,709
site it should look this way and if

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,810
you're gonna build a social network it

00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,900
needs to be super experiencial and look

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:06,720
that way but I think that within a more

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,299
cultural and anthropological lens that

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,010
might not be the best approach and I

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,260
think the question of why are websites

00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,700
different around the world it's kind of

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,470
analogous to asking why are people

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,709
different around the world which is

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,120
really hard to answer and scientists

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,310
have been trying to do that for hundreds

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,510
of years so I'm gonna try in 30 minutes

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,110
to do it

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:30,420
but I think it comes down to sort of my

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,900
new core belief which is that technology

00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:37,560
is a mode of cultural expression just

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:40,830
like language music dancing food and

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,400
that technology that we use on phones

00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:46,830
laptops and iPads are just another

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,250
social tool that humans use to express

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:52,290
themselves and that even our technical

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,840
decisions you know the frameworks the

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:58,440
programming languages the services and

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,230
the design we use in in the websites and

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,080
the technology we build are driven by a

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,010
combination of cultural factors so

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,440
that's really what this talk is about

00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:12,060
it's kind of a mix of culture technology

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,620
but just to preempt it a little bit why

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,050
is this important to talk about why

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,540
can't people and hungry figure it out

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,910
for themselves and build websites for

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:24,510
Hungarian audiences and people in the US

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:27,180
will do it for us audiences there's a

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:30,000
couple big reasons one is that we are

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,770
really all in it together computer and

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,860
Internet technology I think has

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:38,460
globalized truly and utterly faster than

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,680
any other human technology we all rely

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,780
on the same fundamental foundation for

00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,940
building software like operating systems

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,920
we use the same mobile phones mobile

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,320
operating systems we're all here to talk

00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,720
about JavaScript probably most of us are

00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:54,660
familiar with using some really core

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,460
frameworks like react we rely on the

00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,010
same developer tools an infrastructure

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,170
like AWS and we're seeing these huge

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:06,450
mega global corporations forming like

00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:08,550
Amazon Google and Facebook and the more

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:11,010
and more of the world is coming online

00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,460
so there's this concept known as the

00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,230
digital divide so in 1990 most people on

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,470
the internet we're like in the u.s.

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:21,480
maybe in the UK and today there are

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,990
three and a half billion people on the

00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,210
Internet

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,890
which is half of the world's population

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:29,250
which is kind of shocking for how both

00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:32,370
large and small it is but it's

00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:35,700
definitely shrinking some researchers

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,950
estimate that the entire world will be

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:41,060
online between 2030 and

00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:44,370
forty and emerging economies like India

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,250
Bangladesh Ghana are adopting the

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:49,260
internet really exponential rates and so

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,090
this is bringing new users onto the

00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:53,490
internet in those countries which is

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:56,100
creating demand for Internet services

00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,900
and companies which will create demand

00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,940
for developers in those countries and

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,250
they'll be using and coming to a lot of

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:05,910
the software and technology and tooling

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,980
that is already existing and as

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,690
developers we benefit from being

00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,790
globally connected we can share code

00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,860
with each other I can look up answers to

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,440
questions that were you know answered by

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,880
somebody across the world we can more

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,560
easily learn from each other we visit

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,770
each other's countries for conferences

00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,780
like I'm doing right now and innovations

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,940
that we make in one place like a coal

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,190
trick I pick up here I can take home and

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,840
use in my home country and that's a

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,900
really cool thing that not every

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:36,480
industry benefits from and finally a lot

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,440
of us work for internet companies and

00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:43,320
our users are online and as

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,750
internet-based companies we are uniquely

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,330
able to reach new audiences in global

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,390
markets again this is especially true in

00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:52,620
Europe where it's pretty common to

00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:55,160
attract new users from neighboring

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,050
countries and so translation

00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,210
localization is becoming a really core

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,250
part of growth strategies for internet

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,680
internet companies and so learning to

00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,840
localize apps well is pretty critical in

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:13,020
building successful software that's able

00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:16,260
to grow so with all that in mind how can

00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:18,840
we think about culture as technologists

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,520
as engineers as we approach building for

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,490
the web in building technology in

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,500
general we can start by understanding

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,750
some of the different cultural factors

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,690
that would contribute to differences in

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,729
building software and the first one is

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,280
language it's really the core activity

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:37,140
of what we do every day it's we

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,080
literally do it all day and it extends

00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:41,940
to programming whether you as a

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,310
developer can read the technical

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:47,220
documentation for a project you want to

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:51,900
try and how you would design a web site

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:54,510
to be read in a language by your users

00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,430
the second our cultural attitudes which

00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:59,340
are the really invisible but really

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,950
strongly held true differences between

00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,440
people which is how they have integrated

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,180
technology into their daily lives what

00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,740
their lifestyles are like what their

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:12,900
behaviors and their beliefs are like

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,210
there's government policy so some

00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:18,690
countries don't regulate the Internet

00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:21,450
some of them pass restrictive or you

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:23,790
know the sensible regulations others

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,590
censor the Internet and then finally

00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,390
people across the world access the

00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,860
Internet in different ways they use

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,360
different types of devices they have

00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,290
different levels of speed and stability

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,360
so I'd like to go through each of these

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,010
and talk about how developers in

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,590
different parts of the world are dealing

00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:42,660
with these sort of different types of

00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:46,050
contexts and the challenges that they're

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:47,970
facing and so let's start with language

00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,340
there are a lot of languages in the

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,690
world and there are over seven thousand

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,570
known languages this is one of my

00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,950
favorite maps from school and most of

00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,230
these languages have their own writing

00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,870
systems and one of those writing systems

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,150
is Hangul which is the primary Korean

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,490
writing system and when you take all of

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,560
the unique characters in Hangul and put

00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,150
it into a Unicode block you get a block

00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:19,290
that's about eleven thousand characters

00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:21,240
large so this has challenges right it's

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,300
not the Latin alphabet there are no

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,240
longer 26 and some but you might have to

00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:29,370
render on the screen and so that

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,950
proposes challenges for natively

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,620
rendering Chinese Japanese and Korean on

00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,270
the web first of all it's expensive to

00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,140
design these fonts because each of these

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:42,660
characters has certain spacing and there

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,580
are thousands of them again and the

00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:46,680
files that contain these fonts can reach

00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,690
15 megabytes and so this becomes really

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,240
prohibitive especially on a mobile

00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:54,840
device or in a place with with slower

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,730
internet speeds so developers have to

00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,890
get really clever and one common work

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:02,550
around this is a Korean ecommerce site

00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:03,940
called G market in this case every

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:08,080
single piece of text on this

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:11,020
is an image which is kind of unholy to

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,570
us maybe but there's huge benefits it

00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:16,030
loads faster than a 15 megabyte plant

00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:17,970
file and you can the developer can

00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,840
ensure the quality of the text rendering

00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:23,200
and they know what's going to look the

00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:26,470
same across browsers and in mobile

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,140
phones and there are some there are some

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,900
newer ways to render these fonts more

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,370
quickly through subsetting and so sub

00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,740
setting is where you take a really large

00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:37,540
font file with a lot of characters or

00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,610
glyphs in it and slice it into pieces

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,440
and just load the pieces you need and

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,210
some browsers like Chrome now will do

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,820
this automatically and there are also

00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:48,670
really cool projects I'm so google fonts

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:51,550
has this new Korean font library in it

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:54,670
that uses machine learning to subset

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,860
fonts based on how often they're the

00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,720
characters are seen together and when

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,310
these fonts are served through the

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,260
google fonts API it benefits from

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:04,360
cross-site caching which means the user

00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,660
would only need to load the font file

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,640
once in order to benefit from it across

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,080
many web sites during their session and

00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,960
so techniques like this are making it

00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,060
more possible and easier to render

00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:19,330
languages like Korean Japanese and

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:21,220
Chinese natively on the web and other

00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,380
languages are written in other

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,960
directions and in other ways and so

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,300
Hebrew and Arabic are written from right

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,150
to left and they require layouts that

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:34,690
are bi-directional so this is the

00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:37,150
tel-aviv Museum of Art in English but in

00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:40,990
Hebrew it's completely flipped really

00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:43,810
down to the navigation itself and as a

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,640
native reader of Hebrew it wouldn't make

00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:48,400
sense if you had just translated this

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:52,140
and it was from left to right it really

00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,850
has to be a mirrored layout in order to

00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,700
feel native and make sense to a native

00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,770
reader there were some CSS frameworks to

00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:03,670
make this easier this is right-to-left

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:06,040
CSS which will flip directional CSS

00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:10,060
properties like border left or margin

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,740
right and when you translate text to

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:14,320
begin with it takes different amounts of

00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,900
space different characters have

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,769
different heights and widths words may

00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,920
be longer there might

00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:24,369
more or less spaces and other rules like

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,139
that so the word views in Italian is

00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:28,059
actually three times longer than it is

00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,589
in English and this is a subtle

00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:31,660
difference but this is like a YouTube

00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:33,910
card or they had it pushes it to the

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,549
next line and so if you sort of compound

00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,259
this across an entire layout you can see

00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,360
how you would really need to allow for

00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:43,660
the expansion and contraction of text as

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,999
you translate it between languages and

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:49,929
in my really informal test tie is about

00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:54,489
1.7 times the space I'm just to adjust

00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:56,949
in this sentence so really localization

00:13:54,489 --> 00:13:58,720
is more than just translating strings

00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:00,879
you can't just swap the strings if

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,350
you're going to create an Arabic version

00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,660
of your website you need to build a

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,549
bi-directional layout and if you are

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,989
translating into new languages you

00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:09,819
should account for the expansion and

00:14:07,989 --> 00:14:12,309
contraction of text I definitely

00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:14,259
experienced this in the past where you

00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:15,129
swap the strings out and things start to

00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:17,739
go really weird

00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:19,799
I mean users want to you know use a nice

00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:24,730
experience and they can tell if it was

00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:26,559
quickly done so we're building websites

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,980
in many different languages right and

00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,540
there's over 7,000 of them but I think

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,579
one of the really interesting things is

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:36,869
that we're all programming in English

00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:39,339
and so these are the reserved words in

00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:40,809
JavaScript and they're all in English

00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:43,779
and this is true for every major

00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:45,790
language that we use even languages like

00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:49,209
Ruby which was invented actually in

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:51,249
Japan and it's kind of weird when we

00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:54,220
look at the spoken languages in the

00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:55,899
world it's a really big disconnect so

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,299
you know English is no more commonly

00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:01,449
spoken than Hindi and certainly less

00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:02,709
commonly spoken of in Chinese and what's

00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:05,919
happened here is that English has become

00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:08,410
a legal franca which means a common or

00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,839
trade language between groups of people

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:12,879
for computing and it's actually become a

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,459
lot more than that English has become a

00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,980
common language for diplomacy and for

00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:21,850
business and trade and it's not a

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:23,529
totally equitable history either but

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,329
adopting these common languages does

00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:27,759
have a lot of benefits it means that we

00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:29,740
can all be sitting in this room coming

00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,270
from different countries with our own

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:33,160
you know first natively

00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,040
which is and understand each other and

00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,970
I'm giving this talk in English which is

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,540
crazy because we're in the middle of

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:42,220
Europe and I don't have to translate you

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,500
know a piece of your code into my

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:47,020
language in order to run it first of all

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,270
orders understand what it's doing I mean

00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,730
because we're programming sort of it all

00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:54,760
in the same terminology and language it

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,020
makes it easier for us to grow software

00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,580
together and build on top of each

00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:00,670
other's work rather than developing

00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:03,880
technology sort of in parallel separate

00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:06,490
language groups but I also think it's

00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:09,790
important to recognize that a code isn't

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:13,690
really English I don't know what RF

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:16,210
means and I I don't think you actually

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,830
need to be conversational English to

00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:19,780
learn how to code

00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,390
I would probably describe code as like a

00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:25,870
new dialect some weird morphed subset of

00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:28,360
English I'm in some programming tools

00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:31,540
this is scratch which was developed by

00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,030
MIT a school in the US it's used in

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,420
libraries and classrooms around the

00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,000
world

00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,280
I'm skips this English based paradigm

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,780
altogether and they have this this block

00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,900
abstraction which makes it really easy

00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,220
to translate between different languages

00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:47,140
and research has shown that kids learn

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,960
how to code faster in their native

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:52,600
language which makes a lot of sense

00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,700
and just because reserved words in the

00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,710
programming languages we all use are in

00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,370
English doesn't mean they have to be and

00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:03,580
this is a this is your lang which is a

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:06,339
node like language in Yoruba which is a

00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,750
language spoken in Nigeria and I think

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,000
projects like this while they haven't

00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,280
you know hit a critical mass yet could

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,200
be really useful for getting programmers

00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,450
who don't speak English in the door and

00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:20,520
pass that first really big learning

00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:22,390
curve and then also I think that

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,370
developers in general especially

00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,589
developers who don't speak English

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:30,550
really want to read documentation and

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:32,260
debug issues in their native language it

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,450
is again really important for developers

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:36,730
who don't speak English translations and

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,620
channel and channels for talking in your

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,290
native language about programming and

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:43,510
code really benefit everybody it helps

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,060
make these non-english speaking

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:48,180
developers lives easier

00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,740
and for an open-source project or a

00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,080
developer tool it can draw more

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,510
developers into the project and I think

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,820
given the growth of you know the youth

00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:59,250
the internet base and the years to come

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,410
it will become even more important and

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,360
people find translations so important

00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:05,100
that they will do it themselves if you

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,590
know an open-source project doesn't have

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,750
any and so this is Doc's China which

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:13,200
aggregates Chinese language translations

00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:15,920
of many of the open-source projects we

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,590
all use I think it's a pretty incredible

00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:21,780
project and a really great example of

00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:24,120
you know just getting it done but these

00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:26,220
in unofficial translations do have some

00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,020
issues so they're less discoverable

00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,030
because they're not a part of the core

00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,980
documentation and they have more

00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,600
opportunity to grow stale or be

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,000
incorrect because they're not part

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:40,290
they're not maintained by the official

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,540
maintainer x' the react org recently led

00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:44,760
a project to add a bunch of translations

00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,590
to their core documentation so on their

00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,330
site there are now a bunch of different

00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,640
language versions I think is a really

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,860
great example and a fantastic step to

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,920
recognizing their super international

00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,720
community they even built a bot to open

00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,440
pull requests in each of the

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,050
translations

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,450
whenever the core English Doc's change I

00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:06,120
know that this was inspired by the

00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,290
vue.js team who are also doing a really

00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,510
good job and I think it's a great

00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,170
strategy for including developers around

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,380
the world

00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:16,230
I don't know that take another sip of

00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:23,400
water I invite you all to do this as

00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:27,690
well so moving past language let's talk

00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:30,420
about culture cultural differences play

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:34,200
a really big role in how technology is

00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,890
used in people's everyday lives cultural

00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,350
attitudes

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,790
refer to people's beliefs their

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,200
lifestyles their customs

00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:42,600
you know how they greet each other in

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,580
the morning or how they were coffee and

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,440
what time they eat meals that and what

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,230
kind of devices they use to do all of

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:51,320
those things and talk to each other and

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:53,700
culture is really hard to quantify

00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,620
there's a framework for doing it

00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,660
it's called Hofstede's cultural

00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,580
dimensions

00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,100
and it's not perfect I really hate the

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,800
the gendered power versus nurture

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,660
spectrum but I think it is a good

00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,310
framework for understanding how

00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,920
different nations and cultural groups

00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:11,630
might be different from each other like

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,330
some might be more focused on preserving

00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:17,660
tradition or more oriented towards

00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:20,000
future and change some cultures are

00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,310
really focused on collective success so

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,770
the success of their family group or of

00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:27,160
their country others are like no screw

00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:31,400
them I will just get rich myself right

00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:33,800
and it makes more objective I won't say

00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,370
perfectly objective comparisons between

00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:39,770
different cultural groups possible so in

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:42,380
this study they surveyed a bunch of

00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:46,210
people around the world and we can see

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:48,170
that Egypt Egyptian Japanese and Russian

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:51,290
participants all have much higher

00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:52,820
avoidance of uncertain situations so

00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,890
these are situations where there might

00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,900
be like lack of information

00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,570
there's just generally an uncertain

00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:02,690
outcome we can see that the u.s. in

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:05,540
comparison is extremely indulgent and

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:07,490
really values values individualism and

00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:09,920
individual success over these countries

00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:11,720
as well and I think that although these

00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,780
these differences are subconscious and

00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,390
they show up in the way you would build

00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:19,910
a website or launch a product in these

00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:22,160
countries so this is a website for

00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:25,790
purchasing tickets for the Ghibli Museum

00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,790
near Tokyo it is a notoriously booked

00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:30,950
and really difficult to get into museum

00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:33,580
but on these sites it's really common to

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:36,020
see really elaborate instructions

00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,310
step-by-step with screenshots of the

00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,200
kind of software you would need to use

00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:41,900
and down to the buttons you'd press to

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,670
get a ticket so you know exactly how to

00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,760
get the ticket and if you don't get one

00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:50,060
you know why and to contrast this with

00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,530
the brode Museum in Los Angeles first of

00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,790
all there's you can either show up or

00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,070
buy a ticket so there's a couple ways

00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:56,990
and once you start to dig into the site

00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,880
you see all this uncertain language like

00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,070
oh there's a best chance to view the

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,230
exhibit and it's first-come first-serve

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:06,050
so you don't actually know if you get to

00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:09,440
see the whole museum if you go which

00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:11,490
results in funny reddit threads

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,800
like wouldn't it be easier to travel

00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:17,790
through Narnia on a flying pig than to

00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,170
get a ticket to go to this museum and I

00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,880
think that we can think about cultural

00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,520
differences not just in these really

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,620
broad terms in terms of like societies

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,050
and nations but also in terms of teams

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,000
teams that we work in or cities in our

00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:32,610
own countries and so at my company

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,670
ribbon I help I build tools that help

00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:38,340
people manage the purchasing of homes so

00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:40,470
we built this really elaborate sales

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,660
tracking tool and we thought we designed

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:45,390
the table really nicely but the team

00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:46,950
kept going back to Google sheets and we

00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:49,800
couldn't keep up with all their requests

00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,300
and changes and so we eventually gave up

00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,100
because they just wouldn't use the tool

00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,640
and they kept doing all this data entry

00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,500
and we replaced it with this monstrosity

00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:01,650
which is a third party and Beda Bowl

00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,270
spreadsheet tool and they loved it it

00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:05,970
turns out it's exactly what they needed

00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:07,830
they needed something compact so we

00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,890
didn't need to optimize for readability

00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:12,750
or beauty they didn't want to scroll

00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:14,880
they needed to see all the information

00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,650
all together in one screen and they

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,750
wanted it to be really flexible because

00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,810
their requirements and KPIs were

00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:24,450
changing all the time and so by building

00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:26,250
this presumably worst product actually

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,320
by not building a product at all and

00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:32,610
deleting a bunch of code we better met

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:34,860
the needs of our team and so just to go

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:37,620
back to the cultural dimensions let's

00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:40,380
compare the US and China China is also

00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:43,110
pretty low on uncertainty avoidance but

00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:44,700
much much higher on future orientation

00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:47,970
and so this means that they're willing

00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:50,880
to deal with ambiguity sort of as a

00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:54,210
generalization and more adaptable to

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,130
changing technologies and so what we're

00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:59,250
seeing is that China has adopted mobile

00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:01,800
technology in all aspects of their lives

00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:05,730
so QR codes are found literally

00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,800
everywhere in transit advertisements you

00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:10,770
use it to open websites to add contacts

00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,500
to get information to buy tickets now to

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:15,480
make payments WeChat is an absolutely

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:20,550
ubiquitous app with over a billion users

00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:22,500
in China and in that area that you know

00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:25,320
has really spread throughout China

00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:28,140
years and years before we saw the the QR

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,880
technology catch on in the West and so

00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,430
we're really starting to see China that

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,820
outpace the US and the West in

00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:37,020
technological innovation and this kind

00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,760
of thing changes how you would launch

00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:40,920
startups right so in a really mobile

00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,410
oriented country you might skip a

00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:46,110
desktop app altogether so this is a

00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:49,530
light app that you would build to be

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:53,160
opened from a QR code in the we chat in

00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:54,720
the WeChat mobile browser and there

00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,160
again not meant to be viewed from

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,920
desktop it just doesn't work on a

00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,190
desktop it's a completely different kind

00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:04,680
of environment there and while we're on

00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:06,540
the topic of China we can talk about the

00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,180
fact that the internet is not actually

00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:12,030
equally free and available in every

00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:13,950
country in the same way so Internet

00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:16,650
infrastructure is provided through

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:19,290
private companies and utilities subject

00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:21,960
to national laws so in the past

00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:23,970
China has cracked down on foreign

00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,340
services they have blocked Google api's

00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:29,340
which will force developers to find

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:31,050
mirrors and alternatives the latest

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:33,750
status is that Google APs are being

00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:35,760
served through servers in Beijing here

00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,470
in Europe there are new privacy

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,300
regulations called gdpr

00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:42,120
so I'm sure everybody here is familiar

00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:46,440
with the requirement to get users

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:49,650
permission to set and use cookies and

00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:52,890
unfortunately in July the u.s. sanction

00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:54,420
Iran and a developer in Iran named

00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,760
Shaheen wrote a really good blog post

00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:59,460
about what it's like to be a developer

00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,680
living in a country with sanctions

00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,870
imposed on it talked about how really

00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,660
critical developer services were cut off

00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:09,210
like gitlab docker Android developer

00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:11,700
just the documentation site itself and

00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,740
even github and so developers lose

00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:16,710
access to their code their sites might

00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:19,260
go down they have to use proxies and

00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,900
VPNs which is questionably legal and

00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,920
pretty dangerous to have them do and

00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,620
it's you know it's a very challenging

00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,520
situation and continue it's going to

00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,520
continue to be a problem

00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,610
and finally internet access in general

00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,770
is very different across the world

00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,080
people don't use the Internet in the

00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:38,529
same

00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:41,409
way so for example mobile traffic is

00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:44,049
much greater in Africa and Asia than it

00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:49,419
is in the Western Hemisphere so in 2018

00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:53,260
I think 78% of visits to websites in

00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:56,140
India were on mobile devices whereas in

00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:58,029
the US the split is more 50/50 so in a

00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:00,309
place like India where three-quarters of

00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:01,840
Internet traffic is from mobile you

00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:04,120
would certainly build a mobile first

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:08,200
website or a native app before you built

00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:10,299
a desktop site and if you look at

00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,750
high-speed sort of broadband access

00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:16,299
which is fast stable internet it's not

00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,830
equally distributed either there was a

00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:22,720
really good talk about this yesterday I

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:23,950
think well I know and there's a you know

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,690
there's a really big gulf between the

00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,330
developed world and the developing world

00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:31,419
and people in rural areas and every

00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:34,360
country also experienced this where with

00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:36,789
a slow internet connection first of all

00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,740
you have slower speeds but your

00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:40,600
connection might also drop out too so it

00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,190
will be intermittent and this can make

00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,419
using apps and websites really

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:46,059
frustrating

00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:49,149
and so as a developer you can improve

00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:51,610
this experience by offering on offline

00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:53,620
support so by using techniques like

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:55,840
local storage service workers by

00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:59,169
building progressive web apps and this

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:03,760
is a progressive web app from Kenya it's

00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:05,559
an another ecommerce site and you use it

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,940
by visiting the site in Safari and

00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:10,149
actually adding it to your home screen

00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:12,190
and so by doing that and it has the then

00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:15,070
has the ability to cache content locally

00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:16,809
and use service workers to stay usable

00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:19,690
even if the internet connection drops

00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:21,429
out and these progressive web apps also

00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,809
take up less space on a phone which

00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:24,940
would be really important in a place

00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:26,230
where a lot of people use budget phones

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,990
and they're not using really expensive

00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:34,029
iPhones and this this article in

00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:37,090
business and usage and conversion after

00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:39,370
building this progressive web app and so

00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,620
it's not just that by architecting the

00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:44,230
application differently it became better

00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,820
and easier for users to use actually

00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,590
resulted in a better business outcome

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:50,850
and more money

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:53,850
big maid so that's a really Roman tour

00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:55,620
of just some parts of the world and just

00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,309
some challenges that developers in other

00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,980
countries

00:28:56,309 --> 00:29:02,519
experience I think that it is really fun

00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:05,279
and fascinating to talk about and I like

00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,870
it sort of in an academic sense but I

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,720
also think there are ways we can all

00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:12,149
apply this to our everyday and the first

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,129
is that we can always be thinking about

00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:16,259
and including developers who might not

00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:17,669
have the same access as us you know I

00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:19,919
think probably everybody in this room

00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:22,619
speaks English not every developer does

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,360
or will if you are part of an

00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:26,429
open-source project or build developer

00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,159
tools consider making translations of

00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:31,649
priority and if you have friends who are

00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:35,279
affected by sanctions and censorship we

00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:37,710
should be giving them a platform if you

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,869
come across a website or an application

00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:41,850
that isn't what you're used to so if you

00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:44,309
travel to a new country and things feel

00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:45,809
differently try to think about the

00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:48,869
cultural context in which it was made

00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:51,480
what led to it being built that way and

00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:54,509
try not to apply your own value system

00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,730
to another person or another project

00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:58,409
that was built with a completely

00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,299
different value system in mind and this

00:29:58,409 --> 00:30:02,879
is called cultural relativity it's a

00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:05,610
really core anthropological concept and

00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:07,980
it helps us avoid using loaded terms to

00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:11,789
describe user interfaces like cluttered

00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:14,249
or ugly or text access old when it might

00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:15,840
be more of a lack of context and I think

00:30:14,249 --> 00:30:17,700
this can generally make us more

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,519
inclusive and empathetic with each other

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,740
as well and finally user empathy is not

00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:25,470
just for product managers and designers

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,740
we as engineers can use it to make

00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:31,409
better technical decisions for the tools

00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:35,009
and the products we build and we can

00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:36,869
also use it to localize to our own users

00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:41,700
people in our own you know in our own

00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:43,830
cities so if you know that your your

00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,019
product has users in an international

00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,639
market or that your company is growing

00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:49,549
to attract people from another country

00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:52,409
where they speak a different language

00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:54,330
consider putting in more effort to on

00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:56,460
providing a truly localized

00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:58,200
strong translation or Architect your

00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,969
application to be a progressive web app

00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,519
if your users experience

00:30:59,969 --> 00:31:04,949
slower or intermittent connections I

00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:08,190
mean I think that the companies and the

00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:09,989
engineers that do this will win the

00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:13,169
hearts of their users they will build

00:31:09,989 --> 00:31:14,879
better software and ultimately benefit

00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:17,519
from the growth of the Internet in the

00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:18,700
decades to come and that's all I have

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:28,539
today thank you

00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:28,539
