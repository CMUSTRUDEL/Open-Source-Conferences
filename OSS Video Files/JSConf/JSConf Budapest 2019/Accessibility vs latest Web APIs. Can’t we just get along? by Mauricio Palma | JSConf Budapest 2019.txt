Unfortunately, we still treat accessibility in the same way we deal with front-end development for older browsers, something to be done at the end. What if I tell you that we can use the latest Web APIs and still offer an inclusive and accessible experience.

In this talk, you'll learn how to combine Web APIs such as Speech Recognition and Geolocation, with performant Javascript techniques to create empathic user interfaces.

morning Budapest how's everyone doing

00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:10,950
doing

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:13,110
hmm so before we get started I'll give

00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:15,240
you a little bit background I guess I

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,250
will not so I will not do so good as

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,800
Paul did but um my name is Mauricio

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,529
Palma I was born and raised in the

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,650
beautiful country of Costa Rica and I've

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:27,859
been living for the past 13 years in

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,399
Hamburg Germany

00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:34,760
not because of the lovely weather Eddie

00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:37,800
it is an amazing city don't get me wrong

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,820
I work as a product engineer at

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,440
sahasrara and you will see me also

00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,860
wearing multiple hats as the co-founder

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,850
of would like ocean where we craft swim

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,410
or out of ocean recovery fishing nets I

00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,600
have to warn you though this

00:00:52,410 --> 00:01:00,359
presentation is going to be filled with

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:04,409
personal anecdotes so be ready and the

00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,659
first story is about how I gave my very

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,600
first conference talk it was the

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,600
diseases called Budapest two years ago

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,540
and I just have found out that David

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:19,350
yesterday said on the CSS Cohn he did

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,439
his first top two here four years ago so

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,509
today it is a very special humbling

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,960
moment for me and I'm so happy to share

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:31,020
it with you if you have ever held a talk

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,950
before the first time it is a very

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,829
exciting nerve nerve wracking experience

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:40,189
and as you can imagine I was super super

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,240
nervous I thought I was gonna die

00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:45,270
especially because all these amazing

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,540
people then some of the speakers you

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:51,750
have followed during your career and I

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,540
can't forget how Dennis mission of came

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,119
to me and gave me some really comforting

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,049
words and I think I had just this

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,780
terrifying look in my face probably but

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:07,530
I did my best then and I think the

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,560
presentation came all right but my point

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,800
here is this is a very special

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,930
conference and I am very very

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,510
excited to be here and share this

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,000
presentation with you if you have your

00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,760
own ideas if you want your voice to be

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,510
heard this is the best platform to do it

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,890
so submit your ideas and you will never

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,160
forget regret it

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:35,640
and for that reason I want to thank the

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,460
organizers for having me I want to thank

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,670
you for being part of this amazing

00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:45,450
community and I hope that we can use

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:48,540
next two days to get inspired to meet

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:53,180
each other to learn new things and for

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,180
that I hope let's give it up for that

00:02:53,770 --> 00:03:01,320
[Applause]

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,180
the web can be an amazing place a place

00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:07,140
where we can collaborate where we can

00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:09,300
learn where we can be creative and it

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,610
has an inherent open nature to it

00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,610
information is accessible to everyone

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,400
and for me was especially important

00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,459
because I'm a self-taught front-end

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,360
developer now by race of hands how many

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:27,570
of you are self-taught developers that's

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,630
a lot of us and now imagine this

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:33,360
information would be only accessible to

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:36,540
a certain amount of people that you were

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,820
not invited to be part of it and this is

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,100
actually what we're doing every single

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,350
day when we're not thinking about

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:47,730
accessibility and the applications will

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:50,640
build in today we want to invite and

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:55,050
empower people through emerging web

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,739
technologies and I love being a front

00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:01,860
developer I love my craft and working

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,560
with the latest technologies learning

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,790
about new paradigms and bringing

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,060
projects to life

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,910
and I think we share the same passion

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,730
but what I have learned in later years

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:19,459
is that my work should serve a higher

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,459
purpose that just my own gratification

00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:27,260
and I know web accessibility is not an

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,930
easy endeavor especially if you're

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,870
working on large-scale projects with a

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:36,400
lot of decision makers can become a real

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:38,690
challenge you get to hear stuff like

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,420
accessibility it's not important for us

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,400
it's not relevant for our target market

00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:47,000
and these kind of comments are

00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:49,340
frustrating and yet it is still our

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,820
responsibility to remove these barriers

00:04:49,340 --> 00:05:00,430
to teach people and try to promote and

00:04:52,820 --> 00:05:03,980
implement accessibility we as developers

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,840
have a collective responsibility for the

00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,450
Caleta for the applications we were

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,500
building today even if we are aware of

00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:16,850
it or not think about it for a second

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,250
most of us have seen hundreds thousands

00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,700
of websites have gone through a ton of

00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:27,620
user flows and we have this toolbox full

00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:30,260
with buzzwords and my point here is it

00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:34,630
doesn't matter how badly design a user

00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:38,030
interface is we still make our way out

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:40,130
but this is not how the rest of the

00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,950
world is interacting with the

00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:47,690
applications widow not at all

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:54,170
we are working in a bubble trapped in

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:56,330
our own bias and like I mentioned a lot

00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:58,940
of personal anecdotes but don't worry we

00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:02,570
have some technical stuff too

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:05,870
there were two events in my life that

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:09,020
made me realize about the importance of

00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:12,560
accessibility so I had to learn the hard

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:17,090
way and the first one was a painful one

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:21,020
a family health issue my uncle in law he

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:23,720
was found on the floor dehydrated and

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:26,900
unconscious and he was probably on the

00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,320
floor for a couple of days so today

00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,420
we're very happy that he's back home but

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,950
you have to consider that he's an

00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,650
elderly person

00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:39,500
leaving by himself so before the

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:42,620
accident he completely relied on the web

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,530
to get pretty much everything done he

00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:48,260
will buy his groceries online pastries

00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,900
would be order for cut family coffee

00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:56,240
dates he will take care of his bills and

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:59,900
finances and unfortunately after the

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:04,850
person after his hospital release he

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:07,880
know he was diagnosed with with poor

00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:10,910
vision and memory loss

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:12,620
and after he release he called me and he

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,630
said Modi see I think my computer is

00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,870
broken you know that when computers are

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,730
broken family are calling normal stuff

00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,100
and as I'm trying to order some

00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:24,920
groceries and I think my computer is

00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,700
broken so I went over there to see what

00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,060
was the problem

00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:32,540
and so his computer was working just

00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:35,030
fine and I asked him can you please show

00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:38,180
me the problem and this is the moment

00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,850
that I realized and I will never forget

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,360
he couldn't recognize and Add to Cart

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:47,540
button he couldn't recognize or

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,700
differentiate between copy text or input

00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:53,240
fields he could neither gave to release

00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:57,140
ID at all and I was very sad because I

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,150
realized that I swapped developer was

00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:01,700
not being responsible enough with the

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,940
applications I was building until that

00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,940
moment

00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,150
but we can actually make better use of

00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:24,030
the current accessibility tools to help

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,750
people like my uncle in law get things

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:30,270
done online we can even go further

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:32,570
further and think about all these web AP

00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:36,590
is that we can use to our advantage to

00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:40,740
actually make the web a more open place

00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:43,380
but what I have observed among us

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,320
developers sometimes is that

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:50,160
accessibility is perceived as just a

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:53,610
checklist a list of things given by the

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:58,520
web content accessibility guidelines for

00:08:53,610 --> 00:09:01,710
us to implement and it reminds me a lot

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:05,010
to the same attitude we have for

00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:07,860
front-end developer for alders front-end

00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,390
development for all their browsers you

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,510
know when you have been working on a

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:15,620
project and the time has come for you to

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:20,520
check it in an older internet explorer

00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:23,190
think about it for a second and and my

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,650
conclusion to that is that we as humans

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,770
we tend to avoid things that we don't

00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,720
understand and that's our nature and I

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:34,920
think that's why accessibility is being

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,830
perceived that way but what if we start

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,520
considering accessibility as the core

00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:44,580
concern of our application now let me

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:49,380
give you an example in Europe alone

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:51,750
there are 30 4.4 million people I mean

00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,800
let me correct that adults with

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:57,750
disabling hearing impairments a

00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,730
disabling hearing impairment it is one

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:05,850
that is greater than 35 decibels and

00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:08,780
every single day we denied deaf and

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:12,050
hard-of-hearing people access to our

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:16,470
personal and professional lives and

00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:19,200
during my research I found this app

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:22,260
called Ava that I would like to show you

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,850
and I think the team challenge this

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,600
notion with their work

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,600
and let me show you what they're doing I

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,600
am

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,449
one day is too many people down this can

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,449
get really tough

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,960
people talk so fast it can be pretty

00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,960
overwhelming

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,589
there's too much going on

00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:11,889
ava is awesome to see what people say

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:14,850
with one tap I invite people and they

00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:14,850
join me with their phones

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:35,740
I knew Ava to attend meetings at what

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,520
follow what the teacher says in class

00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:41,010
[Music]

00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,530
what kind of sound people Wendover got

00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:46,410
to look at me

00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:53,540
baby I will transfer about anything

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:53,540
oh well almost everything

00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,480
and that for me was very inspiring I'm

00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,340
not related to them I don't even know

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,120
the team but I think that's a really

00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:04,950
good example of when you recognize

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,970
exclusion and you be and you become

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:11,310
empathetic towards people with death and

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:13,070
hearing impairments then they were able

00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,510
to come up with a meaningful solution

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:17,850
maybe it's not the best one but it is a

00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:21,300
good start and that's why we're here

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:23,310
talking about it today because we can do

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:28,380
this kind of things on the web natively

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:32,340
and I mentioned two events this is the

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:35,220
last one I promise and the second one I

00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,830
had a sport injury so I dislocated my

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,260
arm I couldn't move my arm for a couple

00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,510
of weeks and that was really frustrating

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,630
in a way because I couldn't interact

00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:49,620
with my environment so this becomes a

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:52,410
disability yet I was feeling super fit

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,500
and I wanted to work and this is how I

00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:58,020
discovered the Mac dictation keyboard

00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,980
tool now how many of you are you

00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:06,630
familiar with the dictation tool a few

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:09,930
of them do you like it yes mixed

00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:14,760
emotions well I love it I recognize that

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:17,970
there is so much potential in in the web

00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:21,300
speech API it allows to control web

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:23,430
applications through voice and we can

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,580
open through that for example our

00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:28,830
applications to a lot of other people we

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,110
can be inclusive towards people with

00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:34,170
vision impairments we can be inclusive

00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:37,700
towards people with literacy problems or

00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:42,300
maybe with up with the disability with

00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:44,070
with a permanent disability if you have

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,760
heard of it before it has been around

00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:51,870
since 2014 and it has been big natively

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:55,560
into the web and we will be covering

00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:57,210
how to include voice in a demo in a

00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,150
small application I wrote for this

00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:03,270
example and considering accessibility

00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:06,390
and inclusion as the core concerns of

00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:10,320
the application and what this little toy

00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:12,990
application does is it pretty much it's

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,360
JavaScript application and gets all of

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:20,550
my Spotify playlists so I can navigate

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:24,240
through them play tracks or or manage my

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:29,370
devices through the Kinect Web API from

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:33,060
Spotify which is pretty neat and to

00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:35,070
include it the speech recognition

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,320
service works pretty much I have a very

00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,230
funky looking microphone that you will

00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,560
see you soon it receives sound through

00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:46,080
your devices microphone and it checks it

00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:49,140
against the list of provided grammars

00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:52,920
and that's basically what we need to get

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:55,850
that running now a word of caution is

00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,420
that the speech recognition involves a

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,360
server-based

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,370
recognition engine meaning that audio

00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,220
will be sent to a web service for

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:09,270
processing so this is important to have

00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:12,060
in mind because it would only work if

00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:15,060
we're online and for that reason I have

00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:19,530
a hotspot open because maybe our Wi-Fi

00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:21,600
might not be that good so this is the

00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:24,030
initial configuration very

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,890
straightforward we just instead make an

00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:30,330
instance of the speech recognition

00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:33,150
controller we configure the max

00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:36,270
alternatives and the interesting thing

00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:38,160
about it per default is actually one but

00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:41,910
the interesting thing about it it let us

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,850
define how many words or just one word

00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:46,920
or the list an array of words for the

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,780
service to give us back for us to work

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,760
with it so it gives us a lot of

00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:54,030
flexibility with the kind of stuff we

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:57,420
can do we have higher property interim

00:15:54,030 --> 00:16:02,190
results which will give us the the

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:04,920
results that are not final yet now like

00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,720
I mentioned ok lack property is really

00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,050
important

00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:14,330
so if you don't define a length property

00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:17,810
it will use the HTML tag attribute as

00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:23,570
default or as a last default would be

00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:25,580
the user agent language settings and as

00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:27,500
I mentioned grammar is going to be one

00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,900
of the most important aspects of this

00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:34,370
implementation and the speech grammar

00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:37,250
list represents an object of grammars

00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:41,720
and uterine cies and patterns for the

00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:44,120
service to understand so looking back to

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,950
that instantiation function you will see

00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,610
that we will pass those uterine psa's

00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:54,040
which means spoken words necessary for

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:57,260
the recognition I am using rxjs

00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:00,080
observables we will not cover them in

00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,090
detail but it helps me a lot with a lot

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,180
of data streams that we're handling and

00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:06,980
the difference is that instead of

00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:09,199
receiving them all at once we can

00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:14,449
receive them over time so it is very

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:18,230
useful for this for this purpose and we

00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:22,130
will subscribe to it and pass to the app

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:24,439
from string method the grammars and a

00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:27,069
confidence score right now is just

00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:31,820
statically one but as you can imagine

00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:36,080
the can we can tell by every search how

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,550
important is this search for us and at

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,530
the end we'll pass it to the speech

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:46,150
recognition itself excuse me

00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:46,150
that's very hot up here

00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:54,190
so I mentioned grammars are super

00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:58,720
important and for that we need to take a

00:17:54,190 --> 00:18:01,869
look at NLP an NLP or natural language

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,059
processing is the field that focuses in

00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:07,090
the interaction between human language

00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:11,350
and computers so what it basically does

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:14,259
is computers try to understand process

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:17,230
and derive meaning from human language

00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:19,539
and this is basically what the we the

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,970
web speech recognition is all about it

00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:24,279
is an abstraction that takes all that

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:26,139
complexity away for us in order to

00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,690
include speech recognition into our

00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:33,970
application there is though an

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:38,109
underlying problem and human language is

00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:40,779
ambiguous a word can have many meanings

00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:43,779
and this is what makes natural language

00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:46,929
processing so hard to get right

00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:49,720
now I'm telling you from experience the

00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:52,720
German Alexa and me we have the worst

00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,690
relationship ever like I talked to her

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,200
she understands pretty much anything

00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:01,450
even though I think I can talk German

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,989
English is better but I realized my

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:07,320
mother tongue is Spanish is the best and

00:19:04,989 --> 00:19:09,970
if we're talking about accessibility

00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,389
it's not going to be useful for us if

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:16,330
the application don't understand our

00:19:12,389 --> 00:19:18,269
intentions and for this demo application

00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:22,210
I thought

00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:25,359
Alexis intent would be a really good

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:28,090
source of inspiration for tackling to

00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:32,409
some extent the problem of ambiguous

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:35,019
language meaning you saw on the app we

00:19:32,409 --> 00:19:37,029
can go through the playlist so there are

00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:39,789
many ways that I can express my

00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:42,460
intention I could say show the playlist

00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:45,580
go to playlist we can even go further

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,470
and consider what if the service these

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:51,279
are actual responses I got from the

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:53,350
service before it says ok lists so

00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,350
instead of frustrating the user I can

00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:59,350
already consider these cases and trigger

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:02,470
the relator command to it

00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:05,020
so this is a very basic example of how

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,970
something like that looks it's not even

00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,490
that clean because I'm mixing languages

00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,070
like you can do it way better but it

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:15,010
works so basically all the intentions

00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:19,360
for me to navigate to the playlist it

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:22,630
will trigger one action we will iterate

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,750
over this in ten samples and we will

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:28,020
register to a command Factory and what

00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:31,840
this command factory does it

00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:35,980
administrates it manage it matches the

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,140
commands with intents we go over it one

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,960
more time and we have this callable

00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:43,480
intent that we will need later when we

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:48,220
receive the result and I have a little

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:51,190
demo for you and I heard from Raul

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:54,070
yesterday I love that he said let's hope

00:20:51,190 --> 00:21:00,960
the demo gods make this possible and I

00:20:54,070 --> 00:21:00,960
hope that too so basically check that

00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:21,550
I have this funny-looking microphone but

00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:24,550
it will make it better and exploding so

00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:27,430
it's working fine like I said Internet

00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:28,630
is very slow I'm gonna with the hotspot

00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:32,950
but we'll give it a try

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:35,520
so we would say something like show

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,520
playlist

00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:52,100
go to playlist so we'll go to the

00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:55,070
playlist is a very basic example then

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:59,630
you will see don't judge me for my pal a

00:21:55,070 --> 00:22:03,050
list so this is basically all of my

00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:05,300
Spotify playlists they have gone until

00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:13,760
now and we can check this one riding the

00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:16,100
Lightning go to riding the Lightning so

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,040
it goes actually way faster but I like I

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,200
said it's pretty slow and these are all

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,160
the tracks so I could say something like

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:29,930
let's try something hard like

00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:33,640
peaseblossom boogie all right play

00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:33,640
peaseblossom boogie

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:46,090
okay they better work

00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:56,790
the API don't wants to give the right

00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:02,010
response oh one more time

00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:02,730
let me try something first is this

00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:06,990
working

00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:14,100
yeah this is working so I'll go back and

00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:24,510
we try it one more time play

00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:27,810
peaseblossom boogie so the response to

00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:30,720
came and now we're playing this on so

00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:36,180
it's pretty fun if you like vintage rock

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:37,590
music and and before we get done there's

00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:41,160
one more thing I want to show you

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:43,950
because this is not just for English so

00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:49,020
you have to correct me if I'm wrong I

00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:52,140
think it is the bcp 47 tack right this

00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:54,960
time that you can use so basically any

00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:58,290
language supported by this tack can be

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,560
used as a recognition engine and I was

00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:03,990
asking in Norway because I didn't knew

00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,660
in Norway there's apparently like four

00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:09,690
dialects or of Norwegian well they all

00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:12,740
of them work and I would like to show

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:15,740
you how can we do something like

00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,740
languages

00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:30,889
and we will try it in Spanish and now

00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:35,509
you have to excuse me that's not really

00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:37,730
empathetic for me but I was taught

00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:41,120
Spanish for a second not just for the

00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:45,820
example and we will do something like

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:50,120
you see the second one vibra tropical

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:52,580
and what I love about it is I don't even

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,009
have to create a new instance so it

00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,799
denying weekly changes just by changing

00:24:55,009 --> 00:25:03,909
the the right property and we can try

00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:03,909
second one talk on the side of Yang

00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:14,750
yeah that's wrong talking with salary

00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:15,820
yang and that's wrong again one more

00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:20,200
time

00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,200
toka masala yang

00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:41,760
Doka masala yang hallelujah so thank you

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:47,880
so we have three minutes I have to hurry

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:50,510
up right so I I had a fallback in case

00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,640
it didn't work so we can skip that and

00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:55,560
so we covered the basics and there are

00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,150
some methods that are very useful I just

00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,980
want to give you the whole overview of

00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:01,880
what you need to get this thing running

00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:04,140
we have three methods the start method

00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:08,130
triggers the speech recognition engine

00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:10,350
and this case was kind of weird because

00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:13,710
I have to press the mic button there is

00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:15,990
for sure a better way to trigger that

00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:18,840
but that was our case the the start

00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,330
method there are the stop and a board

00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,570
method which basically tells the service

00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:28,260
stop recognizing and give me or give me

00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:31,260
not the process results until then we

00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,600
have some events too we have on error

00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,790
that could be very useful if we have a

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,250
good error strategy going on because

00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:42,450
it's really granular the letters know

00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:44,640
what the service didn't work and pretty

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:47,670
much this is the result we will get it

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:50,460
is the speech recognition result which

00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:53,070
is within the second area which is the

00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,530
speech recognition alternative and it

00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:59,400
will give us the list of words and a

00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:02,340
confidence score we filter those events

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,710
and keep them to the command factory

00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,730
that we saw already and it will match

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:13,380
those commands with the results and

00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:16,980
before we wrap it up I hope you have had

00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:19,020
an idea of how all the things you can do

00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,060
this is just a very little example but

00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:24,030
but I hope that you understand there are

00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:26,580
so many Web API s and we can use them in

00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:29,130
creative ways to actually give more

00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:31,500
possibilities people to interact with

00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:36,060
our applications now you might be

00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:37,330
wondering browser support it looks

00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,779
horrible

00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:43,149
as you see it is still an experimental

00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:46,889
API I was surprised that it is coming in

00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:49,299
edge but there are a lot of third-party

00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:51,940
JavaScript API s that you can use

00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:54,129
instead for a production project there

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:57,100
is natural language processing from

00:27:54,129 --> 00:27:59,619
Watson there is speech to text so

00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:02,289
there's a bunch of libraries or engines

00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:05,100
that you can use for that so it

00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:08,980
shouldn't stop you from trying it and

00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,809
this small project is on get up you can

00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,239
try it out you can play with it you can

00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:15,429
break it you're more than welcome to do

00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:16,960
that and if you have any questions I

00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:19,690
will be hanging out the next two days

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:24,260
and you can ask anything you would like

00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:32,700
and that being said thank you very much

00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:32,700
