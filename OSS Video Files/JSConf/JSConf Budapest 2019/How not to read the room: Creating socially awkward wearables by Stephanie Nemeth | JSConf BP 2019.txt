I’m introvert. This can be bit unfortunate, when you are a person that enjoys spending a lot of their free time creating things bedazzled with LEDs… only to rarely wear them out in public. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

In an effort to actually share my weird and wonderful creations with others, I decided create a wearable project that would force me to be sociable in order for it to reveal its magic. In this talk, I’ll share how I used machine learning with javascript and tiny computers to make “fashion” that is responsive to the people around you and the attention you are (or aren’t) receiving.

Stephanie is a developer living in Berlin. She enjoys experimenting with hardware and LEDs to make beautiful, useless things.

[Applause]

00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:11,300
hi everyone thank you for coming to my

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,710
talk oh my gosh this is so many people

00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,070
yeah so I'm just gonna start with a

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,680
disclaimer that this is a tech talk

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:22,740
about my necklace so I'm just gonna talk

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,380
for 30 minutes about my necklace and I

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,769
can do that because there is a ton of

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:32,640
tech involved in this necklace and it's

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:36,180
responding to people around me so yeah

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,350
you can see I have a lot of electronics

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,989
currently strapped to my body so I have

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,239
this choker with a camera attached in

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,510
the cameras attached to a Raspberry Pi 3

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,110
B plus and the Raspberry Pi is running

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,360
nodejs

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,340
and it's running tensorflow j/s and it's

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,710
with tensorflow JSS running an image

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,059
recognition model the machine learning

00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,219
model and the PI determines how many

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,770
people it sees and it sends that

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,690
information to an Adreno and the Arduino

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,689
is controlling the lights on this

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,610
necklace and it updates these colors and

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,780
patterns of LEDs based on parameters

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:16,020
I've set for how it should respond like

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,270
Paul said I am a not a hardware hacker

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,720
for work I am a web developer so I

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,420
mainly do react HTML CSS and

00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,119
accessibility I work on Microsoft to do

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,860
which if you want to organize your day

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,290
it's a great app or if you want to use

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,600
it like me and make lists of weird

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,840
German words and a few names for future

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:44,820
pets you can use that too and I go by

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:46,829
she/her pronouns okay um yeah I'm really

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,560
fascinated with making myself income

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:52,049
uncomfortable in public so a few years

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,220
ago I started making lighted clothing

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,799
because I just thought they were really

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,350
beautiful but that's also a burden for

00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,969
me because I love them but it's kind of

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,640
hard to deal with sometimes all the

00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:05,180
attention that they draw but I've tried

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,729
to learn how to channel that and from

00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:11,220
anxiety into more like fascination and

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,150
excitement and also try to use them to

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,599
come confront my discomfort

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,769
of drawing attention to myself and I

00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:23,010
just want to start off by showing you

00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:23,010
some of the projects I started with so

00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:31,780
so the first project I ever made was

00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:33,220
this fiber optic dress and made this a

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,750
few years ago because I was going to a

00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,769
festival and I thought this is what you

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:42,459
were supposed to do and I basically add

00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:46,150
this link is linked to the kit I bought

00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:47,980
it's actually a fiber optic rave whip so

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,019
it's like a flashlight with like 200

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,879
strands of fiber optics attached and I

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:54,849
guess you sling it around or something I

00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,980
don't know but I coffee Dan

00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:58,720
Instructables tutorial I bought this kid

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,000
it has just like this flashlight with

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,280
preset programs so I didn't code any I

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,920
didn't saw it or any and my mom kindly

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,139
made this dress for me and I sewed these

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,150
two hundred strands to the dress and

00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:15,730
made this really cool-looking jellyfish

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:17,919
dress and it people really loved it I

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,739
got a lot of compliments I felt

00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,389
extremely awkward I wasn't it was first

00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:24,430
time wearing anything lit and I wasn't

00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:26,379
used to all the attention but it was a

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,659
positive attention so gave me a

00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:32,440
self-esteem boost which was like the

00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:34,510
trade-off I wish it could have been more

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,159
alive though because I set a program and

00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:40,449
I was that was it there was no like

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:43,449
interactivity aspect to it so last year

00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:45,340
I made this project which I called with

00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:48,430
Paul helps me name this project it's

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:53,260
called Hall it's Couture and so it's

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:55,690
just multiple coordinated pieces and I

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,359
gave that link is I gave several

00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:00,940
versions of a talk about this so that's

00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:03,810
a link to my talk at Jas coffee you last

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,829
year so I have these multiple pieces

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,709
they're all coordinated together there's

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:10,840
a an app using react that you could

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,310
control the lights with anyone on the

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,530
web could change the colors and the

00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:16,539
patterns it was a lot of coding I had a

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,479
web app built in react and then I had a

00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:22,419
node.js server it was using MQTT

00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:23,450
messaging protocol to relay information

00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:26,060
and

00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:28,850
had each piece had an Adreno in it and

00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,640
it was a ton of bartering i soldered

00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:33,830
each of these pieces sometimes I had to

00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:39,260
rebuild and had to do it multiple times

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:41,930
because that's with hardware yeah so

00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,640
with this project I purposely wanted to

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,980
explore creating this temporary

00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:49,070
experience that connected a viewer

00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,080
directly to an the artwork for a brief

00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,610
period so to kind of blur the lines

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,780
between who's the artist

00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:58,760
and who's the viewer and I wanted to

00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,930
explore the reactions of people when

00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,090
they realized that the lies could be

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,600
changed with a web app that they had

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:08,120
complete control over my outfit um and

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,250
it was an interesting experiment but

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,070
what I realized that I was doing it more

00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,900
to please other people

00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,760
which is ok but it was less of the

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,220
direction that I wanted to go in I

00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:24,590
wanted to be more focused on me and what

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:27,370
I was experiencing um the last project I

00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,660
built last year was this speech to image

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,610
necklace I know there's no sound but I

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,510
have basically the caption I'm saying I

00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,040
like turtles

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,990
and then it's showing the meme if you

00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,180
know of like the kid dressed as a zombie

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:43,490
and he says and I like turtles

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:45,410
so so this is the last project I made so

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:49,220
it was just it's meant to show

00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:50,960
accompanying images as I talk in hopes

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:55,820
that people would find me interesting

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,070
and stay engaged speaking to me so it

00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,510
has a Raspberry Pi with a touchscreen I

00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,830
just plugged in it so the Raspberry Pi

00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:04,210
is just behind the touch screen there

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:07,280
and on that PI I have a no js' server

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,530
that sins and it has a microphone in a

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,310
sends audio to the Google speech

00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:16,430
recognition API and then it sends those

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:19,220
key words to the Google Search API which

00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,800
I have a custom image search criteria

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,990
set up so then it would show an image

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,310
correlate to what I'm saying so I liked

00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,800
that it was responsive to the

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:32,270
environment but because I was using

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,620
these api's I still needed Wi-Fi so that

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:37,670
I kind of wanted to get rid of like the

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:41,570
Wi-Fi dependency on future projects and

00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:43,250
a side note I didn't realize I was

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,290
really working with machine learning on

00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,700
this and this is relevant cuz I'm gonna

00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,680
talk a lot about machine learning so I

00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,940
just wanted to point out that ironically

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,710
I didn't realize always working with

00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,360
machine learning I just thought you know

00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,500
until it really looks back at my project

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,720
I know that's a bit naive

00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,370
but I also feel like machine learning is

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,740
so pervasive you just sometimes feel

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:03,140
like you're using api's but you're

00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,700
actually using machine learning because

00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:11,090
I just thought I was sending data and

00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:12,950
get a response so my current project so

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,050
I wanted to take the things I liked

00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,110
about other projects and go in this

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:22,550
different direction I wanted to be

00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:26,120
responsive to people around me but it

00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:28,820
will it increases my discomfort unless I

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,880
can conform to social norms so what that

00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,350
means is very innocent flashy and

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,050
attention-getting when I'm alone when

00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:38,150
I'm off by myself and it only calms down

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,770
and eventually turns off when I'm

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,170
sociable and surround myself with other

00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:45,110
people so it's less about

00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:47,000
purposely attracting people it's more

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,710
about me wanting to get rid of the lies

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,770
as fast as possible

00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,960
and I think I might have convinced you

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,210
that with this progression of work that

00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,340
my progression of work through my

00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,280
projects it was a convincing reason for

00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:04,550
me to build this Nexus but I've misled

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,860
you a bit there was actually like a

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,230
really pivotal moment that I decided to

00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,540
build this so like I said I work at

00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:14,870
Microsoft to do in Berlin and I started

00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:16,280
this job almost a year ago and I was at

00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,060
this really first time working at a

00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:23,450
really big tech company and I was very

00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,220
insecure because I'm not I don't come

00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,650
from a computer science background and

00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,150
everyone else had like masters and been

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,880
doing computer science since they were

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,320
like 12 years old and folks started a

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,979
machine learning study group so we were

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:39,290
doing a big online MOOC course and I was

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,570
falling behind from the first study

00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:44,900
group session and I felt really insecure

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:47,930
about that but I wanted to prove mainly

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,680
to myself that I could learn all these

00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:51,050
concepts

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,490
do it in my own style and for me that

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,439
meant I really need to build something

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,629
physical like I have a physical use case

00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:59,959
that was relevant to me and my interest

00:08:56,629 --> 00:09:01,220
and this is so the real reason I built

00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,689
this project is because I couldn't keep

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:10,579
up with a machine learning course at

00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:13,459
work um so there was a couple courses

00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:15,290
that work for me the first one is this

00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:18,559
machine learning for artists course by

00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:21,800
Jean Cogan he's really influential

00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,480
creative machine learning artist and he

00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,199
teaches at NYU but he puts all his

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,600
course works online for free and so I

00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:32,269
just watching the videos for the course

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,490
it really opens my eyes to what artists

00:09:32,269 --> 00:09:38,629
and non-traditional technologists are

00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:41,269
doing like playing Tetris with fate your

00:09:38,629 --> 00:09:42,529
face and it really inspired me and gave

00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:44,779
me a lot of ideas on how I could

00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:48,350
integrate machine learning into a new

00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:50,449
project and then because I'm a

00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,949
JavaScript developer of course like I

00:09:50,449 --> 00:09:54,589
wanted to do everything in JavaScript

00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:57,470
which in hindsight was kind of awful

00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:59,959
because if it would have been a lot

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:02,899
easier just cease Python because there

00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:04,370
was already stuff and tensor faux faux

00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:06,439
Python was already pretty well

00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,079
documented for the PI but I don't like

00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:11,779
to make things easy for myself if you're

00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:14,350
not familiar with a tensorflow it's the

00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:16,819
library for training and running machine

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,379
learning models mainly in the browser

00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:20,929
where you can also run it in node and

00:10:18,379 --> 00:10:23,029
this is dan Schiffman from the coding

00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:25,490
train and this is honestly how I wanted

00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:29,149
to use sensor flow GS his videos are

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,589
great and he just basically kind of

00:10:29,149 --> 00:10:32,779
plays around with tensor flow and that's

00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:33,799
how I learned so when I started this

00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:35,420
project I knew I wanted to use

00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,189
JavaScript to do the machine learning

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,949
but there was two things I wasn't sure

00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:42,410
of first of all I needed to run the

00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:44,480
machine learning models in node because

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,819
I would be running on a PI and not in

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,999
the browser and then I also needed to

00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:55,490
run these models and note on the PI and

00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:57,589
the model I wanted to use was this model

00:10:55,490 --> 00:11:00,470
called tiny yellow and yellow stands for

00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:03,019
you only looked look once and it's

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:06,079
called tiny because it's one of the

00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:09,829
image recognition libraries for the

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,389
browser and since the flow but yes for

00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:13,490
the browser it wasn't set up for nodes

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:14,690
so the first thing you wanted to do to

00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:19,820
see if I could get this model running

00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:22,100
just a node so to do that I just luckily

00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:24,199
just had to do some minor code changes I

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,220
just bought the repo for this project

00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:30,740
and then I needed to replace use the

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:33,440
attention flow node specific package and

00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,029
then store all the models they were

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,389
originally in the crowd a cloud I had to

00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:39,529
store them locally changing like

00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:42,019
import/export statements to require say

00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:46,670
minutes things that you do for node and

00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:49,790
I couldn't use like the web camera media

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:53,029
devices API I needed actually load the

00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:57,709
file in node and then send it to the

00:11:53,029 --> 00:11:59,389
model so I was able to do those things

00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:03,230
you can see I was so happy I sent out a

00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:06,079
tweet about this and yeah you can see it

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,760
sees it like thinks deceased ties which

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,279
I'm not sure why but it also saw people

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,120
which what was in the photo that I was

00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:16,370
sending it so I got that done that was

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,140
pretty exciting but I needed to actually

00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,660
get it didn't matter if I got it running

00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,329
if I couldn't get tensorflow is running

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,940
on PI and I didn't do too much research

00:12:23,329 --> 00:12:30,410
into this beforehand but I got pretty

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:33,500
lucky that the tensorflow J s team was

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,660
actually making tensorflow J s like the

00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:39,190
same week I started working on this they

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:42,050
had a branch that they made the

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:45,170
architecture for the PI which is a ARM

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:47,540
architecture they were making changes

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:52,810
and they were going to allow it to be

00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:57,350
ran there so it wasn't released in yet

00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:59,630
but I was some help from my colleague at

00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:04,839
work I was able to just clone it and

00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:07,069
like use this package called y'all y'all

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,139
to link it to my project and as you just

00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:11,890
I could build a tensor flow J s on the

00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:14,320
PI and it worked

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:16,959
and I think this is like probably one of

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,339
the first instances of actually building

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,390
on that pie because it was like right

00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:23,529
after they added identify so I was kind

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:26,500
of cool I was doing something like

00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:29,079
really bleeding-edge and I have a

00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,870
disclaimer that I haven't touched this

00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:35,829
since I did this so it's running on

00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:39,459
tinder fudge is 0.14 too to give you

00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:40,810
context the latest release is 1.2 0.8

00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:43,269
and they're also prepping release

00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:46,240
candidate too but you know what I did

00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:49,450
this months ago it's for my project

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,410
it works like really I look down to make

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:55,360
sure so it works really reliably and if

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,610
it's not broken why fix it like I have

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,040
other things like in four hours into so

00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,920
yeah so just disclaimer if you want to

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:06,880
try this yourself I'm using an older

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,910
version of tin so fledge is um so yeah

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,070
my two biggest hurdles we're done so I

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:17,079
could start working on the LED necklace

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:19,269
and as a maker I tend to just buy in

00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:21,880
bulk and I always see cool things that I

00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:25,570
like and I buy things a lot and I have a

00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:27,670
huge drawer of just like extra things so

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:30,010
a while back I bought this kit it's like

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,579
an intro soldering to kit called blinky

00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,029
tiles

00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:36,430
it sees just shapes that you can solder

00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:38,380
together and it comes with this pre

00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,899
program it's meant to be used with this

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,000
pre-programmed

00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:46,899
micro control that comes with it but I

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,730
really like the aesthetic of it and I

00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:51,730
actually had played around before with

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:54,160
just using their micro controller to try

00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,510
to use something that you're supposed to

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,000
create and set on your desk into a

00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:01,959
wearable itself so i had made this

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,149
before this got completely destroyed

00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,070
when i moved to berlin so I just took it

00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:10,779
apart but I didn't want to use their

00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:12,310
preset controller so um I feel like

00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,779
you're gonna hear me say luckily someone

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,480
had did this but this is kind of like

00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:19,899
how it goes with making luckily someone

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:22,120
had controlled these blinky tiles before

00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:24,190
with a different Arduino and it's

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,630
basically using if you're familiar with

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,940
stage lighting and stuff there's is

00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:30,610
called DMX lighting but they had used

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:32,710
this library called DMX simple and I

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,000
could just kind of see the code that

00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:36,100
they had written for their Drina so I

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,790
was just able to kind of know what

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:42,820
microcontrollers they used and I just

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,920
they used a TTT board so I just bought

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,870
that exact board and this is just like

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,690
my test of making sure that I can

00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:52,090
control with my own

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:55,810
Adreno and it worked and then I just set

00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:57,940
out on designing what I would design I

00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,440
wanted to make you can see like the

00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,120
design on the left is not what I went

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,260
with I went with the one on the right

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,120
and tomatoes I just I have a mannequin

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,310
and I just pin a I solder on the

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,040
mannequin I just spin things out and cut

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:15,430
wires and it's super tedious but I just

00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,650
do it on my mannequin um so I created

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,620
the LED necklace but then I needed to

00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:26,050
send that image data from the PI to the

00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:27,670
jury no to control the Y's and I didn't

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,850
want to rely on Bluetooth or anything

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:33,370
that could go wrong so I just decided I

00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:37,210
wanted to hardwire it and for that I was

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:40,390
going to use serial ports I never sent

00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:43,240
any messages between devices with serial

00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,290
ports but the PI there's two pins

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,660
there's one for sending and receiving

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,700
and then I could send the data from the

00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:51,570
PI or my data pins of the Drina so it

00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:54,520
seemed pretty straightforward but I

00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:56,650
struggled a lot so I was trying I had a

00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,530
lot of problems just getting the serial

00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:01,930
on the PI to work so I had trouble this

00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:05,709
if you look at C on the Left I just have

00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:08,199
a wire going into the send pin to the

00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:10,120
receive and this is called a loopback so

00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,730
it's how you can test that your serial

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:16,959
port is working and I spent like a week

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:19,329
and had like desperate tweets like

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,329
trying to figure out what was going on

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,040
and because you know it's like the PI is

00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:26,650
supposed to be super kid friendly but I

00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:29,520
had a lot of problems with this and I

00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:32,110
basically just I had to change like

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,230
disable a bunch of stuff configuration

00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:37,490
on startup and I wrote this huge gift so

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:40,220
I would like potentially remember how to

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,230
do this next time but yeah I basically

00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,809
had to disable stuff like on startup

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:50,270
every time so it's like has the Pens

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:52,220
like active um so things were not going

00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,390
I figured out things but things still

00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,070
weren't going great I had some problems

00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:56,960
that I needed to deal with before I can

00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:00,920
move for further with like connecting

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:04,070
the two so as you can see like that is

00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:07,040
like bad it's not supposed to be

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:09,800
flickering like this and at the time

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,679
like yeah I'm not like an electronics

00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,020
like expert I had a hunch it was like

00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:17,179
power issues but it really was like

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,730
outside of my abilities at the time so I

00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:24,590
just switched boards with another board

00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:27,050
I had and I switched from the teensy to

00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:30,410
an Adreno called the Adafruit mini Metro

00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:32,360
and I got lucky that this board actually

00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,450
worked with that DMX simple library

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,950
because it only works with a few but

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:38,960
sometimes you don't learn things until

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,940
after and that's okay I got really lucky

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,970
but I also think it was it was a power

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,250
issue where like the teensy Borg is like

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,650
runs on 3.3 volts but it's five volt

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,230
tolerant but the mini Metro is has a 5

00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,730
volt output and the blinky tall's need 5

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,620
volts so it just happened that it

00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,570
matched that better but really it was

00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:59,059
because I had one lying around and I got

00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:01,570
really really lucky so I fixed the power

00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:04,820
issues but then I had another problem

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:09,559
when I was running the machine learning

00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:12,080
model after about 30 minutes the this is

00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:14,390
a CH top to monitor things the memory

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,640
would fill up and then the swap memory

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:18,730
the Phillip which is really bad and then

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,660
it would crash because it had it had a

00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:25,460
memory leak and I like come to my

00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:28,130
program looking for like memory leaks

00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,990
and I always just stopped I could just

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:33,620
see there was like you know a node I

00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:36,590
have called at Jayenge well do you

00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:40,550
remember this project I was using the

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:42,500
same SD card and Raspberry Pi and it

00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:45,350
turns out this project had a memory leak

00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,669
it was so it was running at startup with

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,910
I had it running with p.m. to boot and

00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:51,620
yet

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,290
this one had a memory leak but because

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:58,790
they were both called a PJs it was kind

00:19:54,290 --> 00:20:02,390
of hard to debug yes so I figured out

00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:06,340
that and I turned off the other no js'

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:09,770
half elf is running and then it was okay

00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:11,510
yeah so I I got those bugs fixed up so

00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,830
then I could get back to actually

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:15,140
sending this data from the PI to the

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,660
lights and then how did another the

00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:20,240
decision to make so what formats would I

00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:23,090
use to send data from the PI to the

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,010
lights and as a JavaScript developer I'm

00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:28,250
like hey I just use JSON every year I'll

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:31,510
just use JSON here and yet JSON on

00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:36,230
Torino is a thing there's a library um

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:39,650
and it worked but in retrospect this was

00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:43,310
a really bad decision because adrenals

00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:46,880
are tiny they're very like limited and

00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:50,630
resources of memory wise and the lights

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,940
would pause while it was processing and

00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:56,270
parsing the JSON it received and I

00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:59,570
thought I was so clever for using JSON

00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:03,410
on a Adreno but it was just a really bad

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:08,540
decision on my part so I had to redo

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:11,240
this and this is code from my nodejs

00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:13,220
app so I switched to I had to think

00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,200
about what really the Arduino needed I

00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,760
didn't need an object with like

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,340
information about all the things that

00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,040
the camera was seeing I just needed

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:24,500
really to know how many people it was

00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,140
seeing so to do that and to do that I

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,710
only really needed a byte I needed a

00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:33,200
number so I condensed it down and I'm

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:35,720
just sending three bytes now to the

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,720
adrenal so I have just a starting and

00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,400
end by just so on the drain oh it knows

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,260
when it because some over serial just

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,570
gets a lot of garbage and so it knows

00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,540
these bytes is getting an incoming

00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:49,130
message and then the second the one in

00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:53,980
the middle is just the number of people

00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:57,140
and the tiny yellow model only can

00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:58,760
categorise up to 20 things so I wouldn't

00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,980
I know I knew that a byte would be

00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:05,230
sufficient for that so

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,780
Oh finally I could send information and

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:12,490
then it was time to work on programming

00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:16,030
the lights and this is just a lot of

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:20,920
like non JavaScript C++ ish

00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:22,750
Audrina stuff and thankfully like

00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,280
Charlie showed a little bit of Adreno

00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,500
cosy so you can see there was like a

00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,710
setup and then there's a loop and inside

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,990
this loop I have some methods that are

00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,490
checking one is receiving you can know

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:37,030
if it's receiving a message and things

00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:39,970
and this is I just want to show a

00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:43,900
snippet of code so this is some code I

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:45,430
wrote that when it knows is receiving a

00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:49,750
message and they can call this like set

00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:52,630
program method and basically I wanted to

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:55,810
show that when there's no one around I

00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:58,150
have this like it's really chaotic and

00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:01,450
then as the people there sees more

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:05,470
people then it goes to more gentle light

00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:10,450
program and then eventually it goes to

00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:12,160
dark mode once they're sixty people and

00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:15,310
if you're interested in looking at

00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:18,220
adrena code this is the link for that I

00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:23,860
also have the links to my project at the

00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:25,810
end if you don't catch it in time and so

00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,400
I had it sending things but then I had

00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,940
another problem because this is like

00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,370
this is how Hardware goes so I had just

00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:36,400
been testing it on my mannequin but then

00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:38,920
when I actually put it on myself it was

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,870
having some fit issues so like as I

00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:42,850
moved it was like flashing because like

00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:46,270
some of the wires were like shorting out

00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:49,030
and I originally envisioned putting all

00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:51,670
the tech and just like a sani pack not

00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,560
really not realizing how big a pie and a

00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:55,420
battery pack and everything was so it

00:23:53,560 --> 00:24:00,910
was no way that I was gonna fit and look

00:23:55,420 --> 00:24:04,360
cool and I have fanny pack um so I had

00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:05,710
to resolder something so after I started

00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:07,360
stopped crying about that I just

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:09,550
restarted and that was fine and then I

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:13,390
decided to just kind of strap everything

00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:16,740
to my body on the skirt oh and this

00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:19,920
actually works quite well

00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:25,740
and solves the problem of like too much

00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:27,000
stuff um and then I decided to add one

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,370
more feature that hadn't really planned

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,150
for so sometimes I get really

00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:36,120
overwhelmed wearing this and I just want

00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,620
a way to turn it off completely and give

00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:42,120
myself a break without having to be

00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:44,670
around people so I added this button

00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,250
ring because so I have two things I can

00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:50,850
do with the button ring um the first is

00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:54,630
I can flip the light programs so it's

00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:56,820
actually when I'm around no one it's off

00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:58,559
and then as more people come around and

00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,650
gets more chaotic so I just completely

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:05,010
flips them if I do this short button and

00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:06,450
then it can come back on and then when I

00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,950
just get completely exhausted by

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,540
everything I can do a long button press

00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:13,260
and I can just completely turn it off

00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:15,179
but then I can turn it back on just to

00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:18,030
like it's kind of like my escape hatch

00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:25,220
if I just can't rip this off of me and I

00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:28,200
just and that's it

00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,900
this project was hard and I got

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,640
demotivated a lot it's I originally

00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:35,040
envisioned doing this in three months

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,350
and it took me eight months not because

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,360
I was working on it constantly but

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,580
because I took like some month-long

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:45,030
breaks because some of these problems

00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:48,559
like the messaging and the power issues

00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:50,910
and things like recently wore me down

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,760
and of course as always stuff I could

00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:57,240
have done differently but I'm really

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,429
happy with what I've learned and I'm

00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,220
excited to continue doing machine

00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:05,340
learning things with wearables and other

00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,640
projects and I love to talk about non

00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:10,920
tech stuff dogs fashion all the outfits

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,040
of the day any of those things but we

00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:16,980
can talk about tech to just if you're

00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:19,770
around and you want to say hi just I

00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,750
know I can look unfriendly sometimes but

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:25,140
I'm actually friendly I'm just nervous

00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:27,430
most of the time so say hi and that's it

00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:35,779
thank you so much

00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:35,779
