What if you could interact with interfaces and devices using your clothes? When we think about wearable garments, we usually think of the technology as an output. We might think of LED dresses or designer-made outfits that react to the environment but what if instead, we used this technology as an input, as a way to interact with other things.

I have been prototyping wearable interfaces in JavaScript to use clothes as an input device and, in this talk, I will walk through the process of making interactive clothing using conductive textile, show what it can do and talk about the possibilities and limits of such technology.

Charlie is a software developer in Sydney. She is passionate about creative coding and building interactive prototypes mixing science, art and technology. She also spends time giving back to the community by mentoring new developers, contributing to open-source projects and speaking at events.

[Applause]

00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:12,210
okay thank you thanks to that yes well

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,650
thanks everybody for being here well

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,310
this morning or this afternoon it's 12

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,230
so I don't know how but so this title is

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,720
this talk is about textile based

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,699
interactions in JavaScript so this talk

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,130
is not really about what you should do

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:28,800
or what you will do there's more about

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,900
what you can a lot of the times when

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,719
we're are conferences we talk about the

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,059
future of interfaces like with react or

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,829
web components or the new web api's or

00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,110
things like that but this talk is more

00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,790
about the other side of the interface

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,180
the actual thing that you can use to

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,920
interact with it so I already got

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,570
introduced but my name is Charlie Gerard

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,079
I'm a front-end developer I live in

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,280
Sydney in Australia and outside what I'm

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,620
going to talk about today has nothing to

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,039
do with what I do for work but outside

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,030
of that I'm also part of Google

00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,239
DevExpress delight tech speakers I know

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,559
that there's a few around at this event

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,880
so if you have any question about how to

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,360
get into these programs or what they are

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,950
feel free to come talk to me afterwards

00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,540
yes so what we're going to talk about

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,150
today is not about me but it's about

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,130
textile interfaces so what does it

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,560
actually mean just a quick definition

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,280
it's using textile as an input to

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,930
interact with interfaces and or devices

00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,280
so the main inspiration for this talk is

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,950
actually something that I came across

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,619
about three or four years ago

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,970
that's called a project jacquard so for

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,100
those of you who don't know what this is

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,700
this is a collaboration between Google

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,979
and Levi's so the brand of jeans to

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,360
create a connected jacket so instead of

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:44,520
just spending some time explaining tick

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:53,490
to you I'm just gonna play the I'm just

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:54,990
gonna play video okay why so there is no

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,130
video great so there was a video five

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,460
minutes ago and now there's no video

00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,869
anymore

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,409
so I'm just going to talk about what the

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:03,869
video shows so Google partnered with

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:05,759
Levi's to embed a jacket with

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,190
electronics so that you could interact

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,020
with your phone while you're riding a

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,060
bike so if your phone rings and you're

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,590
supposed to you don't want to take the

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,540
call you could just

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,010
touch the fabric and it would it would

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,390
send a signal to your phone and you

00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,340
would have you be able to interact with

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,620
a few different interfaces with that you

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,150
could switch the music or get the next

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:28,200
direction from google map just by

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:30,930
interacting with the jacket and after I

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,160
saw things like that I was like to me it

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,209
was brand-new at the time like three

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,239
four years ago I didn't really know how

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,800
to make this and I go be like I got

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,330
really interested into understanding and

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,940
this talk is about how you can actually

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,310
build something similar while just being

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,080
a JavaScript dev so why am I actually

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,049
talking about this there's a few reasons

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,510
so the first one is the evolution of

00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:53,610
interactions we still most of the time

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,880
interact with technology using a laptop

00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,560
or our mobile phone but there's more

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,959
like we can see some people start using

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,269
voice interaction people have tried VR

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,130
or AR and I do believe that there is

00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:07,049
some potential in textile interactions

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,549
as well and as technologists I think

00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:09,989
it's our role to we don't have to build

00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:12,480
these things but at least keep in touch

00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,250
with what's going on I know the reason

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,530
is that it's a lot of exciting

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,180
possibilities hopefully you'll feel the

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:20,790
same way at the end of that talk as well

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,160
but I know that in technology well in

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,750
our job we build things that people will

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,269
use for money and things like that but

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,310
to me technology has a lot more exciting

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,170
opportunities and that's why I love this

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,150
industry and I'll show you a little bit

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,410
what you can do with textile and then

00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,530
finally and that's a personal challenge

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,620
is to identify what you can come across

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,120
online when you look at innovative

00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,440
innovations so every time that I come

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,720
across something that I don't really

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,910
quite understand I don't want to just

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,720
look at it and not figure out how to

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,700
build it myself

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,380
I don't want to think that you have to

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,540
have a PhD to build certain things or

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,060
you have to be backed by Google or

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,530
Facebook I believe that everything that

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,260
we see we might not understand at first

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,019
there is a kind of cheap hockey version

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,549
that we can do at home without having to

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,519
think that you have to work for Google

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:09,989
for to do stuff like that so now we

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,690
let's talk quickly about the potential

00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,519
of textile so first of all it's flexible

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,560
when we think about our laptop or our

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,060
phone is quite rigid if you try to bend

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,130
it well it's going to break but with

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,930
textile when you embed electronics in it

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,880
you actually can well it's quite

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,940
flexible so you won't you have less

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,290
chances of breaking it easily

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,550
very lightweight most of the time we

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,110
don't even realize that we're wearing

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,640
clothes by the way it textile doesn't

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,740
have to be clothes it could be this

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,570
textile on the table here you have

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,480
curtains at home or towels or blankets

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,340
or pillows or whatever it's in the end

00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,840
we don't really look at it that way we

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,520
kind of just take it as well it's

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,470
textile it just covers our body but it's

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,360
actually a lot of potential there as

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,360
well and it for it being lightweight it

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,710
means that we would maybe be able to

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,080
kind of walk around without having to

00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,120
carry a heavy phone or a heavy laptop I

00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,280
started speaking at conferences last

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,620
year and even if I try to travel light

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,180
at the end my luggage is or my backpack

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,130
is actually quite heavy because of the

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,200
laptop and the phone and stuff like that

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,270
so being able to embed that kind of

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,030
interactions into textile means that we

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,520
could actually travel even a lot lighter

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,140
it is quite modular so if you want to

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,340
build your own things you can add

00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,830
different components you could add

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,020
lights or flex sensors or all that stuff

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,150
and you get to build it yourself so you

00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,800
rather you get to decide where you want

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:27,360
it to be if even if it was on a t-shirt

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,490
it could be the shoulders or the back or

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,830
whatever so you don't have to actually

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,360
buy something as it is like the phone

00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,770
you know I mean well Google I think was

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,140
working on a modular phone but in

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,970
general when you buy a piece of tech

00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,990
it's kind of like you know you just buy

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,430
it and that's the way it is and you

00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,560
don't get to decide what parts you want

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,240
but by building your own textile

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,680
interfaces you get to decide the

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,800
interaction and the sensors that you

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,260
want to embed in it it's responsive to

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,730
adaptive touch so this is in this talk I

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,730
kind of had to made up make up some

00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,900
words because so adaptive touch is well

00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,310
that I made up because I didn't really

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,040
know how to explain what I wanted to say

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:05,310
so adaptive touch what I mean Dada is

00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:09,390
that so when you for example for the

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:11,400
jacket by Google you interact with it

00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,750
and it sends a signal but adaptive touch

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,520
means that you don't have to press it

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,230
very hard to then send a signal you can

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,430
even just slightly touch it and you

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,980
could have different interactions based

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,470
on how you decide to touch the jacket so

00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,690
this is what I mean by adaptive touch it

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,220
is very low-power if you've been playing

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,050
a bit with Arduino or Raspberry Pi

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,940
depending on the amount of components

00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,169
that you have in your circuit it's not

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,490
something that you'll have to recharge

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:35,250
every day like you do with your phone

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,050
and then finally it's pretty cheap so

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,800
I'll cover that a bit later as well but

00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,080
if you compare the price of

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,490
a Macbook - something that you can do

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,960
well obviously you will do a lot less

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,539
with interactive test I'll let you do

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,330
with your laptop but it's to get started

00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:52,240
in that space you don't have to spend a

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,330
lot of money okay so how does it

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,460
actually work at the core of it is

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,110
conductive thread so this is normal

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,120
thread that it makes that is mixed with

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,860
stainless steel so it means that it

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,000
carries the current through a circuit

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,900
the same way that Y is do so again well

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,270
I don't know if you've been playing with

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,009
Arduino but usually you connect your

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,349
microcontroller and your sensors with

00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:17,440
wires in between and you can do exactly

00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:19,150
the same with conductive thread the main

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,460
difference though is that usually wires

00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,599
are coated like they're wrapped into

00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,889
some kind of plastic so you don't really

00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:26,199
interact with them whereas the

00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:28,150
conductive thread it's bare and as your

00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,550
body conducts electricity as well it

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,159
means that when you use conductive

00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,020
thread in your circuit you can know the

00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:36,370
kind of like electric charge that goes

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,840
in a circuit and as soon as we interact

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:39,759
with it so as soon as you touch the

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,289
thread you have a change in this

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,870
electric charge in a circuit that you

00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:47,830
can track and then use that as as an

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:50,229
input for your interfaces and devices so

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,630
this is like the latest version of the

00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:53,740
one of the things that I built so I'm

00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,090
just going to go through a little bit

00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,729
about how it works and the modules that

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,199
you have to use to do that so I built it

00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:01,630
three different times that's just the

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,860
latest last one you don't have to build

00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,539
it that way if you're interested there's

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,819
a few different microcontrollers that

00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:09,460
you can use or things like that but at

00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:11,500
the core of it is a flora board the

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,210
reason I used that one is because it's

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,340
good for wearables if you look at all

00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,889
the holes around the board they are big

00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,930
enough to have to be able to put a

00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:22,270
needle through them so at first I didn't

00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,529
know and I worked with another board

00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,699
that wasn't made for wearables and I

00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:26,080
realized a bit too late that I couldn't

00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:28,300
even put the thread through the hole so

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,740
they was trying to use this so if you

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:33,010
want to do wearables I think the flora

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,990
is a good one then I I did a Bluetooth

00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,729
module because I didn't want to have to

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,740
be tethered to my computer obviously I

00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:40,209
want to be able to walk around and be in

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,320
the street or whatever and communicate

00:08:40,209 --> 00:08:47,350
to my phone or my laptop via bluetooth

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,970
then you have high level resistors I'm

00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,640
not going too much into that but to be

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,900
able to filter through and get data from

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,780
the amount of touch the capacitive

00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:58,870
sensing you have to use resistors then I

00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:03,210
have two pieces of thread and finally a

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:08,020
battery to make it totally portable okay

00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:10,450
it's 48 dollars so when you want to buy

00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,810
all these components online it would

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:15,280
only be about 48 dollars so when I was

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,990
preparing this talk I realized that

00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,120
Google actually partnered with another

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,280
brand called Santo ha to make a backpack

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,020
so now they also have an interactive

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,440
backpack but the thing that looked at it

00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,630
after and I was like 685 pounds are you

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,860
for real and I'm like normally you do

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,890
that for 80 48 dollars

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,960
so it is the instead of instead of

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,490
having to buy something that is super

00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,620
expensive you could actually start

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,050
playing with that technology and put

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,820
like interactive stuff in your backpacks

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:47,110
or accessories or whatever for a lot

00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:49,420
cheaper ok so in terms of code now we

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,430
assembled the whole auto Hardware

00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,170
together so it can't you can't do

00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:54,840
everything in JavaScript so that's a bit

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,100
of Arduino but I'm gonna go through it

00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,500
line by line I mean red block by block

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,580
so it is a that's pretty much all the

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,280
code that you need to upload to the

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,860
Arduino what's going on here is that we

00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,750
accentuate the Bluetooth communication

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,640
we use there is a capacitive sensor

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,130
library for Arduino so you don't have to

00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,690
write it yourself you just create two

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,880
capacitive sensors for the two pieces of

00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:19,690
threads that I used and we use a

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,760
threshold so as I said in in circuit

00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:23,320
there is always an electric charge but

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,610
you want to be able to track when you're

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,290
touching it so you put a certain

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:27,810
threshold so that when it's over this

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:29,860
one is a thousand but you could decide

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,990
whatever you want really based on the

00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,370
attraction that you want the as soon as

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,870
the value coming back from the Arduino

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,640
will be over a thousand it means I'm

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,430
touching a piece of thread so do

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,050
something in the browser the main the

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:43,180
setup function that runs once when you

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,380
upload your code to the Arduino you just

00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,570
kind of reset the value of your

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:49,960
capacitive sensor you set the Bluetooth

00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:52,030
mode to data that you know it's with the

00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,580
library so that you don't yeah it's fine

00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:56,920
and then the loop function is going to

00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:59,080
run continuously and what you do you

00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,880
just read the value from the two pieces

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,560
of thread and then as soon as they're

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,899
above a threshold you send that via

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,430
bluetooth so in just a few

00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:08,740
of course you have the capacitive

00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,959
sensing running on the Arduino and now

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,540
what we have to do is deal with it in

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,699
the front end so as i said i'm using

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,230
bluetooth so i decided to be able to

00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:19,410
connect to the browser using web

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:23,050
Bluetooth so what we're gonna do here is

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:25,230
we have the name of our of our device

00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,429
that's called the Adafruit bluefruit le

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,480
you can reset that name if you don't

00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:32,379
want to call it that way but that will

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,209
be on the arduino side you so for web

00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:35,980
Bluetooth it works all the Bluetooth

00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:37,959
protocol works with services and

00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,149
characteristics so they have certain new

00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:42,699
ideas that you have to use to be able to

00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:44,350
connect to and for web Bluetooth knew

00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:46,569
you for security reasons you have to

00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,339
start the connection to a device with

00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:49,329
user input so you can't just run your

00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:51,429
browser and it will connect straight

00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:53,290
away so let's say on webpage we have a

00:11:51,429 --> 00:11:55,449
button and as soon as we click we're

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,189
going to request nearby devices and we

00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:58,420
add a few options to filter down the

00:11:57,189 --> 00:12:01,119
device that we want to connect to so

00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,939
that would be our Adafruit module and

00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:06,220
the services that we want and then

00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:07,269
finally we connect to it we get the

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,160
primary service we get the

00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:11,199
characteristic and at that time here

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,550
we'll start to get the data from the

00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:16,629
arduino so we call the start

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:18,850
notification method on on the

00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:20,529
characteristic to start getting the data

00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,019
every time it changes from the arduino

00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:25,029
so every time that the data that yes

00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:27,759
that the data from my touch is changing

00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:29,470
i actually have an event listener and i

00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,329
get that and i have to decode it so at

00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,730
that moment here we're just getting a

00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:35,199
certain value in the browser and then we

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,139
decide to do with it at the moment it

00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,759
will just be an integer and this is

00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:42,129
where we could to decide the type of

00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,139
interaction that we want to have so

00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:45,910
let's talk about the interactions if we

00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:47,769
consider again that have a piece of

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,410
fabric and i have two conductive threads

00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:52,779
on it we could create an interaction of

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,730
swiping down i know if i get the value

00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:57,399
of thread one at thread two in the order

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,389
obviously I'm swapping down and then you

00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:00,399
could have reversed you could have

00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:02,230
swiping up so if I touch the bottom

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,660
thread first and the top one later it

00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,999
means I'm going up then you could have a

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,319
tap or a touch times two because we have

00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:09,910
two different threads so if I'm only

00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:11,110
touching the first one maybe do

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,240
something if I'm only touching the

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,189
second one do something else then you

00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,100
could have a double tap so if over time

00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:20,079
I touched if for example in half

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,149
second I get value from the bottom

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,649
thread twice it means I'm doing a double

00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:26,380
tap and things like that

00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:29,319
and finally we could have pressing the

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,880
both threads at once so with only two

00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:32,829
pieces of conductive thread we could

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,079
already have seven possible interactions

00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:40,089
of ways of things that we could do in

00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:41,199
the browser or with a device so I'm

00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:42,490
going to try and show you how it works

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,740
so now all the demos are going to be

00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,779
live because I think I couldn't really

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,899
bring everything but so the first thing

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:52,000
that I built was just I tried to augment

00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:54,670
my couch with conductive right so I

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,759
wanted to be able to switch songs on

00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,410
Spotify by just touching the thread so I

00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,079
don't know it looks like videos and not

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,160
okay so I don't really know okay so well

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,509
that's not the slider you can watch

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,680
later so what was supposed to happen

00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:11,019
here is that I when I'm touching threads

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,730
one by one I would switch the song to

00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:15,190
like the previous one or the next one

00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,690
and if I'm touching them if I'm touching

00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,870
a piece of thread long enough the volume

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,220
goes up or goes down so yeah if you're

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,680
interested in watching it's like a

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,089
10-second video anyway but you can do

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,579
that later I have no idea whether video

00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:30,420
work but so the second one I'm gonna

00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:33,759
dive a bit more into is this example

00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:37,689
that was when Google was working on

00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:39,220
project jacquard they also showcased

00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:41,380
that at a conference so people could try

00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:45,189
the fabric and have that visualization

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:46,810
and at the time I only knew that I was

00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:48,670
only thinking about simple interactions

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,170
so like oh if I touch one piece of

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,399
thread do something or the other one but

00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,110
this one I was quite interested because

00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,850
I was thinking how do they get the

00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:59,139
location of where I'm touching and

00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:02,110
things like that so I built a very like

00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:03,939
it's not as good right but the it kind

00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,199
of works so I'm gonna try to demo it

00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:07,029
live and then I'll explain a little bit

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,470
how it works because I feel like in

00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:11,470
terms of reverse engineering that was

00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:16,449
very interesting to work on so now is

00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:20,199
the time where hopefully I tested it

00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:22,689
like many times so okay yes okay so I'm

00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:25,480
just gonna run my server so for this

00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:27,550
particular for this particular example

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,569
I'm not doing Bluetooth because I had a

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,630
lot of issues with Bluetooth at

00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:31,810
conferences so this one is tethered to

00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,890
the

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:38,740
that's my first prototype so if I touch

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:40,779
yay okay so if I saw well its reverse

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,820
for you the where I'm touching baby

00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:45,520
Seacliff I'm touching on the bottom left

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,380
I should do yeah bottom left if I go to

00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:50,040
the top right yeah well that was a bit

00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,480
of a bug here but if I go in the middle

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,589
you can actually well that's just a

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,450
visualization it doesn't really do

00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:57,010
anything but it means that it's just a

00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,970
piece of thread like I could just like

00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,620
flick it around what this wires

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:01,750
everywhere so I'm not gonna do that but

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,550
it's very like I can fold it like I it

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:07,240
was in a really tiny bag in my luggage

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:08,440
and well I I only did a visualization

00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,760
because I wanted to reproduce what

00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,100
Google did but you could really do

00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,460
anything with it you could turn it into

00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:18,160
a MIDI controller for life Cheers

00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,390
but yeah I know I've been trying to join

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,089
last year's for a while but they don't

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:24,910
think I'm cool enough so maybe if I make

00:16:22,089 --> 00:16:26,110
them a textile media controller maybe

00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:29,080
that will work

00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:33,390
yes so now let's go just a little bit

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:37,120
quickly into how how many it happen so

00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:39,520
instead of just sewing threads just like

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,120
horizontally just like separately I

00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:44,320
turned them into a matrix so agreed and

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:47,050
one thing that is really important is

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,820
that the thread should not touch so when

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,520
a piece of thread goes over the fabric

00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,980
the one that is on the y-axis should

00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,080
actually go under the reason for that is

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,820
because if you're touching one piece of

00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,320
thread and that piece of thread touches

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,440
another piece of piece of thread then

00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:04,660
your reading is going to be wrong so I

00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,040
do edit it in terms of a matrix because

00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,589
all of a sudden your threads can be

00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,480
changed into coordinates obviously you

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:12,100
want to be mapping where you're touching

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,010
the thread to a location on the screen

00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:18,250
so your vertical threads could be X 0 X

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,439
1 X 2 and then y 0 y 1 y 2 for this

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,449
particular example I only used six

00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,370
pieces of threads but you could see that

00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:25,780
because I did it manually and there

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,939
already took me a while so if I had a

00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,670
swing machine I could actually do a lot

00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:32,110
bigger and better stuff but what is

00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:34,950
going on after that is that when you're

00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:37,660
touching for example the top left corner

00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:40,900
you get data so you could be like okay I

00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:42,310
get a value from my first thread my

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,830
first vertical thread I get a value from

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,720
my first horizontal thread so I could be

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,690
that the

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,520
is then x0 and y0 and then with

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:52,260
coordinates you could you could add that

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,870
to canvas in the browser and stuff like

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:57,330
that so for example that as I showed

00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:00,390
here as I'm touching the middle thread

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:03,270
and the bottom thread like vertically

00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:08,520
presently I apply that to then my

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:10,230
visualization in the browser yes and

00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,940
then you could actually also have that's

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,500
the second made-up turn temporal

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,120
gestures it's not lip smart I was I

00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,950
don't know how to call it so but if it

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,580
sounds madam I'll take it

00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:22,440
so here when I showed you the demo I was

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,870
just touching one at a time and it was

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:27,270
impacting the visualization but you

00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:29,610
could assert you could program swipes

00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:32,190
like I said before and the way you would

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,830
do that is you would track data that you

00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:37,080
get over time for example over half a

00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:39,000
second or over a second you would push

00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,919
everything into an array and then every

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,780
second or every half a second you would

00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,740
check okay if the first value in my

00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:48,809
array was X 0 Y 2 and then the last

00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,000
would be X 2 y 2 then it means I'm

00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:52,530
swiping right and you know the opposite

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,299
for swiping left you could do up and

00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,820
down and things like that so then you

00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,020
could create a lot of different gestures

00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,299
that would mean different things so even

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,559
with only six pieces of threads you

00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:03,000
could actually have quite a lot of

00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:06,270
different ways to interact with an

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,940
interface and okay this is not me but I

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,710
wish it was me and that uses the same

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,600
principle so but it's a lot it's not

00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:15,330
done by hand you can see that it uses a

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,669
machine and the reading is really really

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:20,880
good so it is a great agreed as well and

00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:23,669
the where you're touching on an X and Y

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,340
axis is then showed by lighting up

00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:29,100
certain squares on the screen so I put

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:30,809
the link to the blog where there's like

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,130
a lot of different other interactions

00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:33,840
that you can do a six style so you can

00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,700
check that afterwards but ultimately

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,490
that's kind of what I would like to be

00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,620
building because it's also like a super

00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:42,270
lightweight and it's like on your skin

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,740
so you could really just interact with

00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:46,530
interfaces with that so that's really

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,059
cool different a few different

00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,059
applications this is where I wish the

00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:52,710
videos were working but okay so

00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:55,080
accessories so as I one of my prototype

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:57,000
that I built was to augment a couch but

00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:58,809
you or you have some brands that are

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,480
already working on accessories

00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:03,399
wanted with interactive textile this

00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,299
brand has a pair of speakers and instead

00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:06,429
of having buttons

00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:09,159
it's a textile that you can press a

00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:10,360
certain way to trigger our next song put

00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:15,809
the volume up or down and things like

00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,809
that you can make musical instruments so

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,450
so I don't know if you heard of the meme

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,820
gloves I think it's a project that

00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,730
started about seven or eight years ago

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,559
by an artist called Imogen Heap and she

00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:32,860
also has a team of engineers that have

00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:34,480
been building these musical globes so on

00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,919
top of having conductive thread it's

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,470
also gloves that are embedded with

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,149
flexed senses and position senses so if

00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,740
you are interested I really I really

00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:43,929
advise me to actually watch that video

00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,730
after it's really really cool so by just

00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:47,320
being on stage and moving hands a

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,470
certain way you can change the frequency

00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,809
or the beat or the instrument and and

00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:56,009
that's a good total new way of having of

00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:59,049
playing music of having keys

00:20:56,009 --> 00:21:02,379
accessibility so this project is it has

00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:05,259
the same concept where a pair of clothes

00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:07,360
is embedded with Flex senses and it's

00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:09,610
just a team of students who have been

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,159
working on training machine learning

00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:15,190
model to recognize to be able to map

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,570
sign language to actual spoken words so

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:18,610
this is a prototype but it's something

00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:21,220
that you could do as well as JavaScript

00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:23,139
developers and hopefully you feel like

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,220
you know that hopefully it makes a bit

00:21:23,139 --> 00:21:27,460
more sense now that I explained to you

00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,809
how it works and finally and I realized

00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:33,129
that if you just a couple of days ago

00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:35,289
you can store data into textile like so

00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:37,119
the way this one works and I wish I

00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:39,610
really wanted to get it to work for

00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,799
today but I didn't have the time it's

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:45,429
like if you magnetized conductive thread

00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:47,200
you could actually encode bits into it

00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:49,929
and you can just like send messages so

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,509
this particular demo is actually around

00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:54,100
gesture recognition with just magnetized

00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:55,929
thread so it's not in the camera it's

00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,929
reading the magnetometer in your phone

00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:00,759
and when it senses the change in

00:21:58,929 --> 00:22:02,350
magnetic field you could actually have

00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:04,330
encode like build different types of

00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,549
gestures just by having a little piece

00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:08,919
of magnetized conductive thread on your

00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:10,389
finger and that works through your

00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:12,279
clothes so it means that you could

00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:12,880
actually have your phone in your pocket

00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:14,770
and you

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,450
by doing it putting your hand a bit

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,730
closer just trigger things and if you

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,620
have a piece of thread on all of your

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:23,980
fingers you could really map so and just

00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,750
use quite quite nicely and and it's

00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:27,130
really cool that you don't have you

00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,740
don't have to have a PhD to do things

00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,030
like this like I was I'm quite convinced

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:32,560
that I could figure out how to do this

00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:34,060
it's gonna take me probably a bit more

00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,680
time but I was googling yesterday like

00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,300
how to calculate the magnitude of

00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,070
magnetic fields and I was like oh my god

00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,930
you know it's so cool I didn't figure it

00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:44,170
out yet I need to find the formula but

00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:45,580
you have a web you have the sensor API

00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:47,560
in the browser that allows you to have

00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:49,750
access to stuff from the magnetometer

00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,220
and your phone it just doesn't it just

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,680
doesn't give you the magnitude so you

00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,820
have to calculate yourself so maybe I

00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,270
will come back one day and I would have

00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,920
figured it out then of course you know

00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,480
I've been talking about the

00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,730
possibilities and how excited I am about

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,980
this but there are limits so I have to

00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,510
mention that as well it is partially

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,220
waterproof we're talking about textile

00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,990
so obviously you know if you wear

00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,690
something on a jacket and it rains you

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,070
have to be a bit careful but you you can

00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:17,140
add a certain coating so there's a spray

00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,810
that you can add on conductive thread to

00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:22,510
make it waterproof a connective thread

00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:24,910
works for two years maximum so I think

00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,170
it works like well for two years and

00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,580
then like that it doesn't work anymore

00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:30,360
all of a sudden but it means that the

00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:32,260
reading might change over time and

00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,730
finally quite interesting the

00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,890
capacitance changes with external

00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,970
factors and that will impact the way

00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,100
that you're going to code that will

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,720
impact the threshold but what it means

00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,700
is that depending on the weather if it's

00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,380
humid or dry the reading that you're

00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:46,720
gonna get the capacitance is going to be

00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,400
different so your threshold you know

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,540
mine was a thousand but if it was like a

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,580
dry winter day it might have been

00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,990
different so depending on what you

00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,250
actually want to build if it's a jacket

00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:56,530
that goes outside you'll have to take

00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,450
that into consideration if you have like

00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,860
a couch at home while you will be less

00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:02,140
affected by external factors so it

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:04,120
should be all right but yeah so that's

00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,460
to me that's the main limits that I

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,540
found also if you want to do this I

00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:09,070
would not advise to do it by hand

00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,480
because sometimes it takes hours to just

00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:14,940
put stuff together and that was very

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,990
frustrating for me and a few extras so I

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,490
made most of my experiments with

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,890
conductive thread but it's not the only

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,270
material that you can use so there's

00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:24,370
actually quite a lot you can use

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,570
conductive rubber stretches sensors so

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,430
you can

00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,930
detect how the rice conducted but also

00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:30,160
how much you stretchy so that's pretty

00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,800
cool I don't know what I would do with

00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,900
it but that's nice the second one is a

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,660
piece of conductive fabric so instead of

00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,460
just having the thread you could

00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:41,440
actually cover a bigger area of textile

00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,470
by cutting fabric into different shapes

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,210
or or just cover or have an entire shirt

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:47,560
that's conductive instead of just a you

00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,480
know piece of it

00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,330
you have pressure-sensitive conductive

00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,650
sheet where instead of just having the

00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,810
connectivity you could have the pressure

00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:58,300
how much you're pressing on the sheet as

00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:01,330
well and then finally you have stretch

00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:03,780
resistive fabric where you can read the

00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:06,790
amount of stretch by by stretching it

00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,500
and the what that would allow you to do

00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,190
as well is to play with something that I

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,170
really want to do

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:13,780
that's called electrical to typography

00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:16,030
where instead of just so it's about

00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,680
finding coordinates as well but for me

00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:20,050
to find coordinates and map them to a

00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,910
screen I made a grid of thread and I

00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:25,390
converted that into coordinates but if

00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:27,520
you have a sheet of fabric there is

00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,830
actually a way to try and find

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,660
ultimately where you're touching it by

00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:34,120
doing electrical topography so you're

00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,230
adding sensors all around the sheet and

00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,570
they're going to give you a certain

00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:39,820
value of capacitance and as your body

00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:41,950
touches the conductive sheet it's gonna

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,410
it's gonna change the electric charge

00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,570
and by reading the data coming in all

00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:48,670
sensors you can approximately know how

00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:51,310
close you are to certain senses rather

00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:53,260
than others and what I really like about

00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:55,390
that is that it's not something that I

00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,160
thought JavaScript devs would be able to

00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,320
do like usually just build websites but

00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,780
now I know that by just going with a bit

00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,490
of hardware you can actually come up you

00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:05,290
this probably there's probably a formula

00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:07,870
to actually calculate this I just need

00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:09,850
to buy the sensors and then figure stuff

00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:12,010
out and and just play with stuff like

00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:14,890
this which i think is really cool and

00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:16,900
then finally before I finish some final

00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,330
words of wisdom that are not by me by

00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,040
never entertain imagination is more

00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:22,870
important than knowledge for knowledge

00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,180
is limited to all we now know and

00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,370
understand while imagination embraces

00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,890
the entire world and or there ever will

00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,810
be to know and understand and I read

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:33,970
this quote while I was reading a really

00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:37,780
short essay called the usefulness of

00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:39,340
useless knowledge and what I really like

00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,540
you don't have to believe me

00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,160
you when I say that this is really

00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,460
interesting and important to look into

00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,530
this

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,670
but if Einstein says that it's important

00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,920
then you know you kind of have to

00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,750
believe it but the reason why I'm saying

00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,450
that is because I feel like sometimes as

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:55,720
developers we're not really using our

00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:57,610
full potential in what we can build I

00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,380
think we might we might forget that a

00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,270
lot of people who are not devs have to

00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,770
just take the world as it is and just

00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:04,000
buy the stuff that other people have

00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:06,310
built without really having the chance

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,020
to make it more personal or you can

00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:09,910
imagine but you can't build where as

00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,740
developers even just JavaScript

00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:14,050
developers it doesn't you don't need to

00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,060
to like have like a master's degree or

00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:18,190
know all the languages in the world it's

00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,960
just about being curious and wants you

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:22,090
not only imagine what you could do with

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,620
tech but you also get to build it and I

00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,970
feel like that's that's extremely

00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,020
powerful we don't know what kind of

00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,940
interactions are going to be in the

00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,400
future but we can actually get to tinker

00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,800
and maybe even you know get to influence

00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,480
how it's gonna be and that's like one of

00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,610
my favorite part of take if tech was

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,680
only about building react components at

00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:40,660
work I might not want to be there I mean

00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,760
it's cool too but I the fact that you

00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:46,270
can use technology to build a lot more

00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:48,610
and whatever comes to mind is really

00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:50,350
really cool to me so that's all I had

00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,390
today thank you very much thanks a lot

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,520
the organizers for helping me set up

00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:56,290
that was a bit that was a bit of a

00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,300
hassle but thank you everybody for

00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:00,400
staying with me for half an hour and if

00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,840
you have any questions about that or if

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,890
you have any ideas of stuff that you

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,110
want to build if you just want to talk

00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:07,420
about that I will be around for the next

00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:09,760
two days and otherwise I will be sharing

00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,120
the slides on Twitter there's a lot more

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,110
resources and the videos will work

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,390
better than they did here because they

00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:17,670
didn't but anyway thank you thank you so

00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:28,270
much that was it

00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:28,270
