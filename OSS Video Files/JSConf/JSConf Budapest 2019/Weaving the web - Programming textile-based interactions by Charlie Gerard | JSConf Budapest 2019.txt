What if you could interact with interfaces and devices using your clothes? When we think about wearable garments, we usually think of the technology as an output. We might think of LED dresses or designer-made outfits that react to the environment but what if instead, we used this technology as an input, as a way to interact with other things.

I have been prototyping wearable interfaces in JavaScript to use clothes as an input device and, in this talk, I will walk through the process of making interactive clothing using conductive textile, show what it can do and talk about the possibilities and limits of such technology.

Charlie is a software developer in Sydney. She is passionate about creative coding and building interactive prototypes mixing science, art and technology. She also spends time giving back to the community by mentoring new developers, contributing to open-source projects and speaking at events.
