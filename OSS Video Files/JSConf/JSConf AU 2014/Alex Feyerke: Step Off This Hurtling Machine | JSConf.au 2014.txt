Oh

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,590
good afternoon my name is Alex I'm from

00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,690
Berlin and thank you very much Jared and

00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,370
all the organizers and also Maxine and

00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:18,280
John from web directions for having me

00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,750
here it's a great privilege to be flown

00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,660
halfway around the world to talk about

00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,640
things you care about and I I'm still a

00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,640
bit baffled but yes it's amazing thanks

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,369
very much for having you as Jared said I

00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,519
work on a project called hoodie which I

00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:36,309
won't be talking about actually because

00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:38,020
I think that as much as I adore hoodie

00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:39,850
for how brilliant it is and I think it's

00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,510
really important but I also think that

00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,829
the last talk of a talk the conference

00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:46,930
it's also kind of special and it should

00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:48,250
be about something special and actually

00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:52,030
have a larger scope and just you know

00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:54,280
one project so yeah this is a talk about

00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:58,750
perspectives it's called step office

00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:02,199
hurtling machine and it yeah part one

00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:04,629
take a step outside yourself so the web

00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:05,920
turned 25 not too long ago and I think

00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,359
it's a good opportunity to take a look

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,009
back at its history and I don't mean a

00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,649
technical history you know with ARPANET

00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:13,509
and CERN and everything but the cultural

00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:15,909
history where does all the the way we

00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:18,279
think come from in this industry and on

00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:20,770
the web and this story starts like many

00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:21,990
stories start in San Francisco in fact

00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,909
it starts on the roof of that building

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,819
which is the old American Red Cross

00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:30,969
building so in the corner of second

00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:33,689
mission and the mission district in san

00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:37,569
francisco california united states

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:39,579
planet earth and on that roof was a very

00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:41,020
surprisingly small antenna and it talked

00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:42,609
to a machine that was hovering somewhere

00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,799
round about where we are looking back

00:01:42,609 --> 00:01:49,149
down at the earth a NASA satellite

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:52,270
called 80s three and 80s three had a

00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:54,249
couple of jobs so whether experiments

00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,630
and communications and navigation things

00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:56,739
and all sorts of technical stuff but it

00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,340
also had what you could call the

00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:02,399
cultural mission which was the first

00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:04,950
full disc photographs of Earth and

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,569
that's what it did it took the first

00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:12,709
full color photograph of planet Earth

00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:15,560
and in this was in 1967 and after almost

00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:17,629
20 years of sending cameras into space

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,609
this was the first time we purposely

00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:20,959
looked back upon ourselves with a truly

00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:23,689
new perspective and suddenly there was

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,730
this image this cultural artifact that

00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:28,730
encompassed that entirety of our species

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,170
in our history and back on earth that

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,060
made one land very happy and oddly

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,439
enough he lived not far away from that

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,120
red cross building because everything

00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,749
happens in San Francisco apparently and

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,430
that man was Stewart Brand while on LSD

00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:43,639
and 60s he had this idea that a

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:46,669
photograph of Earth could really you

00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:50,449
know unify human humanity and give a new

00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:54,500
kind of perspective to humans basically

00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:56,180
and broaden their consciousness so he

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,370
campaigned to have this photo taken and

00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,900
we sold these buttons all over the

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,489
United States and he wrote to NASA and

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,379
you've got two politicians in America

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:04,879
and in Soviet Russia he really didn't

00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:07,579
care who took the photograph as long as

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,260
somebody took the photograph and well as

00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:11,030
we saw NASA took the photograph and

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,919
since everything they do is public

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:15,979
domain he could use it for basically

00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:19,009
anything and yeah he used it for the

00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:20,840
first of what I call brands three big

00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:23,449
projects and all of these three projects

00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:30,109
do resonate with what we do and what we

00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:32,989
are today so project one 1968 the whole

00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:36,379
earth catalog access to tools for 1968

00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:38,090
five dollars now this thing was often

00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:40,310
called the Sears catalog for the

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,349
counterculture brand and his wife Lois

00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,349
wanted to list everything you needed to

00:03:42,349 --> 00:03:47,599
create a new better society in the in a

00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:50,479
commune somewhere in the desert so they

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,400
collected useful stuff and basically

00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,989
they made a shopping catalogue so in

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,509
included books about Indian teepees and

00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:59,209
growing mushrooms and books on organic

00:03:56,509 --> 00:04:01,370
gardening beekeeping and of course books

00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:03,979
by Buckminster Fuller on domes and

00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,870
tensile structures and well so far so

00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:08,239
predictable 460 San Francisco I think

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,239
but the catalog got more to offer

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,909
actually so more books first of all so

00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,459
psychological reflections the human use

00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:21,310
of human beings the ghost in the machine

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:24,490
the year 2000 the futurist modern utopia

00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,470
jun of course it had you the Green

00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:30,850
Revolution and very interestingly groups

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:34,810
under stress and even more books human

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,700
bio computer information cybernetics but

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,650
maybe most telling of war in this

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:40,810
catalogue of things you would need for a

00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:42,570
commune in the desert is that

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,620
programmable calculator in the top right

00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:48,160
that's a four thousand nine hundred

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:51,490
dollar programmable calculator and in

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:57,360
today's money that's 35,000 australian

00:04:51,490 --> 00:05:00,070
dollars that's enough to buy two

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,300
volkswagen camper vans back in 60s

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,880
california and still have a couple of

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,490
hundred dollars left over so what kind

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,229
of hippies was this more exactly eighty

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,210
percent of the products referenced in

00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:11,979
the catalogue workbooks so you had some

00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,520
things like boobs and shovels but mainly

00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,960
you had books the catalog wanted to the

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,970
tools the catalog wanted to provide

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,430
access to weren't necessarily physical

00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:24,460
tools they were mostly ideas and big

00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,020
ideas at that and when I say referenced

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,720
it's interesting because the catalog

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:32,320
didn't actually sell anything it was

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,570
only an index for distributed objects

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:38,229
and documents and if that sounds

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,820
familiar well should be anyway the

00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:41,470
catalog became very influential had

00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:43,150
profound I opening effect and quite a

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,490
lot of people and it's all rather well

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,130
too but practically none of them managed

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,240
to sustain a successful commune

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:53,889
small-scale politics and groups on

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,090
easily solved by a mail-order but lots

00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:56,740
of people didn't see the whole of

00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,180
catalog as a guide to escape modern

00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,740
society they saw it as a technical

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,840
futurist manifesto of a social

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,840
reinvention for new interdisciplinary

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,910
thinking at a large scale you'll notice

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,560
in the index of the catalog the first

00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:13,000
thing is understanding whole system's

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,760
kind of shows you which direction this

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,500
was all meant to go the catalog was

00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,789
absolutely eye-opening it was a how

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,460
things work book for basically

00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:23,229
everything was DIY as the new world

00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,050
order it was a cliff's notes to becoming

00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:27,700
a new modern renaissance man massive

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,190
environment of the individual through

00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,530
information and technology its first

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,770
line was we are as gods and we might as

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,229
well get used to it

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,000
and that's a powerful statement but it

00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:42,139
still resonates well in the tech world

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,460
even today when I was young there was an

00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:45,229
amazing publication called the whole

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,360
earth catalog which was one of the

00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:48,949
Bible's of my generation I was

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,560
idealistic and overflowing with meat

00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:55,520
tools and great notions that was steve

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,440
jobs in 2005 the catalogs legacy is

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,539
marrying two seemingly completely

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,520
opposed the ideas environmental

00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:03,530
conservation and technological progress

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,879
and in the 60s you could you could be in

00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,470
one slider you could be only on the

00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,599
other side you could be for

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,990
technological progress industrialization

00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:13,389
capitalism and the man basically or you

00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,280
could be for sustainability

00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,810
environmentalism and you could you'd

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,819
basically be striving to go back into

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,909
the wilderness and now the catalog came

00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:25,219
along and said no wait you can have

00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:27,500
unbridled technological progress without

00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:30,069
about conscience it's possible now

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:32,060
because technology will solve everything

00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:35,210
the problem was becoming its own

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,250
solution and remember this is sixty San

00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,810
Francisco this is a time where computers

00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,819
were seen as a tool of government

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,340
oppression and where people went out on

00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:43,940
the streets to protest the

00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,919
computerization of University

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,020
bureaucracy you can see at the bottom of

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,750
the punch card says do not fold spindle

00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:53,569
or mutilate and that sentence became

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,699
iconic symbol of tech anxiety in the 60s

00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:56,940
and of course they made buttons about it

00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:59,370
again

00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,140
and now the whole earth catalog was

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,280
managing to reconcile all this and it

00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,630
opened up technology for the

00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,750
counterculture and it opened up the

00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:10,080
counterculture for technology now

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:13,620
interestingly xerox palo alto research

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,500
center which has everything to do with

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,210
what we do do well situated not far away

00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,470
from where brand lived actually and made

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,020
the catalog and for the first couple of

00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,570
years parks library was exclusively

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,850
stocked with books reference in the

00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,320
catalog Alan Kay worked there and

00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,210
invented the graphical user interface

00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,120
which Steve Jobs saw there for the first

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:37,620
time and the rest well it's basically

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:41,370
all descended from there so on to brands

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,289
second project 1985 the well by the

00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:44,910
early eighties the catalog was long dead

00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,950
and all the communes may have inspired

00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:48,480
as well and fueled by enormous defense

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,670
and infrastructure spending in the past

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,340
half century California had long since

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,350
become the focal point of the tech

00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,790
industry in the world really hippies

00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:57,990
were being replaced by engineers and

00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,660
hackers it was only a matter of time

00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:05,280
till brands ideas and their ideas

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:07,260
collided so a program a friend of his

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,400
and I excuse me for that being so tiny

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:14,700
but they've had the same logo.gif since

00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,110
1985 it's really that big I can't do

00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,720
anything about it anyway a friend of

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,370
brands a man fittingly named brilliant

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,080
suggested let's just try again let's

00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:24,840
have an online version of the catalog on

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,660
brand said wait let's have an online

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:31,440
forum instead but on the same topics and

00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,730
this launched as a BBS in 1985 and it

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,530
really took off and it brought the

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,780
remains of the 60s counterculture people

00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,460
who actually lived in communes brought

00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:40,650
it in there and brought it together with

00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,020
the new hackers and first we got the

00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:45,330
well the whole earth electronic link

00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:50,330
which is a terrible acronym but a very

00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:52,740
good name so it was new about the well

00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,940
first of all it was fast was much faster

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,839
than publishing anything on paper

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:59,280
obviously but at the time that was new

00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,830
secondly and this should sound extremely

00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,780
familiar it connected Silicon Valley

00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,970
people in a social network of tech

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,920
professionals so what this meant people

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,600
could now switch jobs and products

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,069
quickly and easily

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,130
is now everyone knew what everyone else

00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:15,600
was doing and in a way that is the root

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,949
of the startup culture somebody

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,680
calculated background that the average

00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:23,220
turnaround time in jobs was a hundred

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,839
percent of two years so everyone changed

00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:28,589
their job every two years on average

00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:31,620
some even faster third thing was it was

00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:33,180
a gift economy was also new people just

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,310
did stuff for each other professionally

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,560
and privately and it was kind of an

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,850
antithesis to this corporate culture it

00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,620
wasn't it was a village it was like a

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:44,190
commune people were just you know nice

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:46,139
help each other out private life and

00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,000
work started merging in a new way or you

00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:50,850
had now had an online persona which

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,089
incorporated both your your private life

00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,620
and your work life and you suddenly had

00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:57,990
a new social circle that encompassed

00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,230
both things where before both would have

00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:05,069
been relatively cleanly separated and

00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:07,170
finally it was a new way of living was

00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:10,829
Network constant communal non

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:13,319
hierarchical and merit-based and the

00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:14,970
well is actually still around today its

00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:19,620
influence on our world really can't be

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:22,230
understated brands third project the

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,480
long now foundation so now it's 1996 and

00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,649
brand is once again seeing that you know

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,060
some of the things he helped kicked off

00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:30,839
a kind of having adverse effects on the

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:33,060
world and I started thinking about that

00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,620
he says civilization is revving itself

00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,500
an empathic logically short attention

00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:39,149
span strain might be coming from the

00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,889
acceleration of Technology the short

00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:42,899
horizon perspective of market driven

00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:45,060
economics the next election perspective

00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:47,370
of democracies all the distractions of

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,769
personal multitasking all around the

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,779
increase so brand along with a couple of

00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:53,579
others created this long now foundation

00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:56,100
to increase awareness for the problem

00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:58,800
and to foster a mindset of slower but

00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:02,160
better and his compatriot Danny Hillis

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,509
wrote when I was a child people used to

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,120
talk about what happened by the year

00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:07,319
2000 for the next 30 years they kept

00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,459
talking about was going to happen by the

00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:11,130
year two thousand and now nobody

00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:13,529
mentions the future at all the future

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,990
has been shrinking by one year per year

00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:18,420
for my entire life I think it's time for

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,160
us to start a long-term project that

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,100
gets people thinking past the mental

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,550
barrier of an ever shortening future

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:38,850
so let's see what we can do end of part

00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:39,870
1 I need a drink part 2 no future given

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,270
everything I've just said about the

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,230
catalogue of the well and along now

00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:47,760
let's talk about us on our relationship

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:49,980
to time our industry's technology is

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,540
amazingly in flux it changes all the

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,280
time stuff becomes obsolete and

00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,620
deprecated there's new libraries

00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,390
frameworks languages workflows best

00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,920
practices preprocessors testing and

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,460
deployment infrastructures all the time

00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,260
stuff changes constantly there's new

00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,970
stuff every day as so many newsletters

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,760
and blogs and people to follow summit

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,630
should keep up with and so much to learn

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,930
it's more than anyone can remember

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:14,700
really this is chris coiours short list

00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,370
of resources you should be following as

00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,510
a web developer presumably a lot of work

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:22,800
went into making it this short and

00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,020
anyway we're always on a bleeding edge

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,480
really it's what defines us and it's

00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,710
what people pay us for honestly but we

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,120
can't stop you can't just get off and

00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,640
say oh well I've learned enough for just

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,340
you know do my thing from now on and

00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,110
stagnate on a high level can't really do

00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,730
that it leaves little time for anything

00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:40,530
else especially reflection about what

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,240
you're doing and we're proud of it I

00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,950
mean rightfully also because we're proud

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,420
of our mental flexibility thinking as we

00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,700
speak and in a way with the Masters of

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,730
making it up as we go along it's kind of

00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,340
a programming is in a sense but we're so

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,580
so stuck in this ever-present now and

00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:58,260
our industries culture isn't any better

00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,750
startups this huge focus on speed and

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,100
flexibility on being agile and lean you

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,720
can pivot your product you can pivot

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,030
pivot your company I mean think about

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,760
that you can pivot your entire product

00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,290
if it's not working out it's crazy you

00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,210
can fail early you can fail off and it

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,030
doesn't really matter it ship it

00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:16,920
our prototypes are rapid so we can adapt

00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:18,780
and change quickly and in the end

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,130
there's acquisitions and sun setting and

00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,350
everything just vanishes as if nothing

00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:24,060
happened amalgam when we make mistakes

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:27,660
we have version control we can roll

00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,790
things back it's all totally in flux all

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,860
the time it seems in fact like there's

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,480
little or no value in actually planning

00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,860
ahead because everything might change at

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,720
a moment's notice anywhere and we can

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,050
change anything

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:42,800
notice how all that really matters is

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:45,439
this ever-present now and our industry's

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,930
content is even worse so Jeremy Keith

00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:50,149
last year at brighton's full frontal

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,740
conference said that fool that an

00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:56,029
average web site is online for a hundred

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:57,470
days three months given that is it

00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,839
surprising that we're so focused on the

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,759
present everything is ephemeral anyway

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,310
and we embrace the fleeting nature of

00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,920
this medium without a conviction because

00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:10,370
everything changes all the time forever

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,569
and we're forever accelerating and

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,139
fragmenting as well so in the beginning

00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:17,360
content was a bit like content was in

00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:18,920
the offline world you had websites blog

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,319
post and then you have micro blogging

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,610
then your Twitter the naive snapchat and

00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:23,899
by now no doubt you have something

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:27,279
that's even quicker and shorter I'm not

00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:30,529
aware of because I'm old I don't know

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,449
but this means something we become what

00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:34,579
we behold and we shape our tools and

00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:37,040
then our tools shape us what have we

00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:39,860
shape when have you created constant

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,389
flow an endless stream of ephemeral

00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,329
content accompanied by the constant

00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:46,040
panicky fear of missing something we're

00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:49,569
always compelled to stay on the crest of

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,769
this wave again everything is fast and

00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:53,569
we were caught up in microscopic

00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:55,459
implementation details and living from

00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:57,079
day to day and simply reacting was to

00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:59,689
what is happening to us because so much

00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:02,149
is happening to us and because the

00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:03,980
future is utterly ineffable and we end

00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:05,509
up optimizing our creations performance

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,009
in milliseconds long to see them vanish

00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:10,490
into obscurity through a few months

00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:12,379
later so in a way we take no

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,759
responsibility because we have no

00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:15,709
concept of the future everything

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,350
vanishes again anyway we work in to

00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:20,059
avoid we do take responsibility and we

00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,220
do care a lot about the tiny things we

00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:24,860
feel we have control over but everything

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,360
else just carries us along with it and

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,889
we say that once some things on the web

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,819
it'll stay forever but barely anything

00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:30,819
really lasts

00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:42,279
so our perception of time is skewed I

00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:46,449
think but that's only half of our

00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:48,429
perspective problem so Jim Menlo Park in

00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:50,709
Silicon Valley it's where all the tech

00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:53,079
people live basically it's near palo

00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,699
alto it's your Mountain View Cupertino

00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,649
it's where California's tech industry is

00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:59,619
it's where the industry is that

00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:01,119
basically dominates the web where

00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:03,549
seventy percent of the residents have an

00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:06,429
advanced degree I think we're becoming a

00:17:03,549 --> 00:17:08,169
bit like a community like fat a bit

00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:09,819
increasingly you know incestuous a

00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:11,889
little bit detached a bit self

00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,110
referential I feel it's only natural

00:17:11,889 --> 00:17:15,639
especially the self-referential

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:18,699
referential ality bit comes with the

00:17:15,639 --> 00:17:20,679
territory I'm willing to bet money that

00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:21,970
most software especially open-source

00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,839
software was made out of the same

00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:27,429
motivation personal need scratch your

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,559
own itch dogfooding those are fixed

00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:31,240
terms in our industry for a reason most

00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,419
of what we build we build first and

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,010
foremost for ourselves and I'm sure sir

00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:37,389
tim and only the best intentions when he

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,549
implemented the first web server a

00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,200
quarter century ago at CERN but

00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:42,789
fundamentally he was building a tool to

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,820
solve his problems and the problems of

00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:50,440
his peers nowadays when we build tools

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,539
we solve our problems and the problems

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,970
of our peers we build tools for web

00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:57,250
developers now wonder our two kids are

00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:01,230
growing at such ridiculous rates that's

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,230
somebody's random grunt file off github

00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,980
every day we get more and more tools

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,660
tailored to address increasingly

00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:10,010
specific problems in many cases

00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:14,540
inventing those problems in the first

00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:16,400
place and at the same time view source

00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,080
that's vanishing into the developer menu

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,790
making the web is becoming a profession

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,820
with professionalizing this to it to a

00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:23,900
scary degree anything and for an

00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,400
increasing number of people it's not

00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,130
going to be this thing we easily

00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:29,420
discover on the side where you can be

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,180
self-taught and look at other people's

00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:34,580
code like i did in probably many of you

00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:37,130
it's going to be a career choice view

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,450
source even if it still exists i don't

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:42,410
think it helps beginners anymore those

00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:44,270
times will be behind us in a way yes our

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,740
work is becoming increasingly more

00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,450
complex and complicated and let people

00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,370
expect that of us and they pay us for it

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,710
makes total sense that our tools and

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,120
workflows keep up with that at the same

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:57,470
time we're leaving everyone else behind

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,940
I think it requires an empathic leap a

00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,230
change of perspective to realize that

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,720
other people have different needs than

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,950
we do and then maybe it's our job as the

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,560
people with this power that is our

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:11,030
responsibility on top of a regular job

00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,980
to accommodate them somehow I think

00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,110
we've most certainly got an empathy

00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,030
problem I go so far as to say its

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,740
intrinsic to this industry partially

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,390
because of how much of our work is this

00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:22,250
scratch around each type and we're very

00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,770
focused on ourselves and people like us

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,730
and partially maybe because programming

00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,770
has always been a bit of an infra

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,380
introverts activity if I may further

00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:33,080
that cliche I mean we actively outsource

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:35,060
empathy to other people we hire product

00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,040
designers graphic designers UI and UX

00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,420
experts and business consultants we hire

00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,890
them to make empathic connections to

00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,900
other humans so we don't have to

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,520
so we can keep coding because that's

00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,960
what we do we work with tech and tech

00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,430
does what we tell it to mostly and

00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,850
that's a pleasant experience and people

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,500
are complicated anyway at the same time

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:55,950
we see the people who make the empathic

00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:58,140
connections as inferior in a way we

00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:02,250
value their work less than our own

00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,960
because those are soft goals right and

00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,640
that's fine somehow in a company or

00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,800
product context but an open source it

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,050
really becomes a problem because an open

00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,510
source we project our work and to avoid

00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:15,990
most of what comes back is from people

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:18,150
who are exactly like us it's not really

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:21,810
everyone's issues is it it's only the

00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:23,340
issues of people like us so we're not

00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:25,290
only losing our perspective on our place

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,430
and time we're also losing our

00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:34,710
perspective on a place among other

00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:37,560
humans part 3 Hotel California thinking

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:40,260
about the future is hard it's hard as an

00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,880
individual those for me it is because

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,170
I've completely embraced this notion of

00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,610
that everything changes all the time

00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,590
forever and that the only viable

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,830
strategy for living in life is being

00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:53,280
highly adaptable but that makes it hard

00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:54,330
to make plans but I think thinking about

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,910
the future and group is even more

00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:58,260
complicated and we're all in our in our

00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,090
own little circle here but I suspect

00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,670
we'd have trouble formulating a vision

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,860
of the future web that goes beyond some

00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:08,640
open source buzzwords like you know free

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:11,610
open secure private may be decentralized

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,260
who knows because thinking about the

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:19,760
future is not only hard it's a bloody

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:19,760
minefield but never actually said that

00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:26,390
seriously the thinking about future is

00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:28,560
hard he's crop weirdly isn't any way

00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,360
there are conceptual tools we can use

00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,750
and I'd like to use one from the

00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,460
discipline of speculative design so we

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,140
can agree that the future is vast and

00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,540
unknowable but we can narrow down our

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:41,460
idea of how things might turn out by

00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,930
incrementally iterating through variants

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,650
of the future that become increasingly

00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:48,360
likely so you start with the present and

00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,520
then you have this vast scope of things

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:52,340
that up

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,840
possible basically any of it narrower

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,160
scope of things that are plausible and

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,720
an even narrower scope of things that

00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:01,880
are probable and then we recall Alan Kay

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,560
from Park who said the best way to

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:07,750
predict the future is to invent it and

00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:09,950
therefore we have the preferable future

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,220
what kind of future do we want for

00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:17,030
ourselves now again we're a diverse lot

00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:19,370
and probably be a lot of arguments what

00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:23,420
we can more easily do than trying to

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:24,740
think about our own future is to

00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,300
hypothesize about other entities

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,280
preferable futures other noteworthy

00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:33,110
entities on the web like Google Facebook

00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:34,460
Apple Amazon various governments so what

00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:36,530
kind of web would they like to have in

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:38,180
20 years and how will they as wealthy

00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,830
resourceful systems that wish to ensure

00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,080
their own survival and prosperity make

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,820
sure they're still around here's the

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,840
future I can see these huge entities

00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:50,780
being happy with with a future that's

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,310
more closed uncertain all of them will

00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:53,630
be completely fine with a more closed

00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,940
web and some of them will actively

00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:57,610
pursue it because in their view closed

00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:59,570
ecosystems with vendor lock-in

00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,130
consolidate different usage patterns

00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,750
into one provide and promised greater

00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,970
use of attention because if you can't

00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:08,780
leave what you're going to do will stay

00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:10,400
a future that is more invasive because

00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,810
ads are still the main way of making

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,400
money on the web services will be

00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:15,560
increasingly invasive because the more

00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,050
they can find out about users the better

00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:20,330
they can target ads towards you and make

00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,160
more money so the latest development is

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:23,960
facebook on android take increasing

00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,520
liberties in this regard the current

00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,980
version actually has full access to all

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,430
of your text messages why would they

00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,620
want those so the third aspects of their

00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:35,180
prayer for the futures maybe something

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,700
like future that is more inaccessible

00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:39,590
and laureen transparent the more you

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,930
restrict access the more tightly you can

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:43,790
control the experience and prevent users

00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,800
from leaving your service or using it in

00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:48,920
an undesirable way it also makes

00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:50,780
monetization easier and i think that

00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,210
services and devices will start making

00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:56,420
choices for you in part because they

00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:58,790
don't trust you maybe that's one of the

00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,560
things one of the reasons why facebook

00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,060
wants to look at your text messages

00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,870
maybe they don't trust what you write in

00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,340
your profile

00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:07,930
and they'd like to check for themselves

00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:10,100
a future that's more tightly controlled

00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:11,780
from governments to corporations

00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,910
everyone is interested in more control

00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,440
beard implicit or explicit and for the

00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,750
tightest control you need not only

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,940
completely closed software you also need

00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:22,100
completely closed hardware and in that

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,960
light it's interesting to look at

00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:26,660
Facebook's oculus a closet acquisition

00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,120
the betting the basically betting a

00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,830
non-trivial amount of money yet

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,240
ultimately insignificant in their scale

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:37,250
of four hundred million dollars in cash

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:40,790
plus 1.6 million what did I say 400 yeah

00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:42,110
one no oh god that's a lot of money see

00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,300
I can't even read it correctly anyway

00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:46,940
amazing amounts of money two billion all

00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:49,730
in all there basically betting on

00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,590
virtual reality becoming the nips next

00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,740
step in content consumption technology

00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:56,510
it's a bet that the way we moved from

00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:00,860
desktop to mobile will be moving from

00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:02,210
mobile to VR in the future don't know if

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,050
it's going to happen but will that still

00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,130
be the web what is going to happen

00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,690
though is that they want to make sure

00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,550
that they own and control the hardware

00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:13,190
and they want to make sure it runs their

00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:14,540
software under their terms and consider

00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:16,340
this in the light that these services

00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,100
are always trying to consolidate use as

00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:22,309
many relevant usages as possible unified

00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:24,350
into one provider you can already lead a

00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:26,120
really involve digital life using only

00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:28,010
google products it's convenient and it's

00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,679
seamless and it's hard to resist because

00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:32,450
it's just really well-made and at the

00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:34,670
same time in many developing nations

00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,679
Facebook has become orbit synonymous

00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:38,120
with the web there are ethnographic

00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:39,740
studies from Trinidad in Kenya that

00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,330
document her poor people's web users

00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,400
practically exclusive to Facebook

00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:49,160
because it lets them do everything at

00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:50,510
the same time at lower costs findings

00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,550
from our fieldwork suggests that

00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:54,550
residents similarly consolidate diverse

00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:57,290
activities into a single online platform

00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:58,970
now this is from Facebook use in an

00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,160
informal settlement in Nairobi and

00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:04,010
informal settlement as a euphemism for

00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:06,230
slum also known as a place where half of

00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,860
humanity lives and they're using

00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:11,570
Facebook it's undoubtedly Facebook

00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,390
strategy to become more than than just a

00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,650
website to become just as Google and

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,039
Amazon want to be more than a collection

00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,229
of

00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:21,080
I want to be platforms they want to be

00:26:18,229 --> 00:26:23,479
ecosystems ecosystems that extend into

00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,249
the real world with virtual reality and

00:26:23,479 --> 00:26:27,830
glass and the self-driving car and that

00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:29,479
magical barcode reading wavy stick thing

00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,559
from amazon that you just wave around

00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:35,090
the house and then it restocks your

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:37,519
fridge and glass and all of these

00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:39,739
they're perfect examples of manifested

00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,690
preferable futures they might all fail

00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:45,200
but their show is really well what these

00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:47,659
people want they want to completely

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,159
surround you in their service and be

00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:51,590
your main or even only gateway to the

00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:52,909
virtual world but the same way bleeding

00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,499
into the physical world and sometimes

00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:58,129
they get help from really unexpected

00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:59,840
places here's an Indian telco that's

00:26:58,129 --> 00:27:02,119
moving from volume based products where

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,389
they charge you per gigabyte to service

00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:07,519
based products wait where the cheapest

00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:11,539
thing you can get there now is just

00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:13,399
facebook and or whatsapp and that's

00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:14,869
totally fine for people whose web use is

00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:17,739
already consolidated into facebook

00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:22,340
that's going to be their web done period

00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:24,049
and all of these big players these

00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,940
stacks they have amazing talent

00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:28,309
practically limitless resources and a

00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:29,690
strong will for self-preservation if

00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:30,889
you're still comparing facebook demise

00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,929
base and thinking it's going to go away

00:27:30,889 --> 00:27:34,789
at some point you're massively under

00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:36,229
estimating how aware they are their own

00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:39,229
mortality and the lengths they will go

00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:42,950
to to survive like paying 19 billion

00:27:39,229 --> 00:27:44,119
dollars for whatsapp and oddly enough

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,919
there seems to be quite a lot of

00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:48,229
optimism about this in in our industry

00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,979
so here's an ill dash saying we'll fix

00:27:48,229 --> 00:27:53,570
these things I don't worry about that

00:27:51,979 --> 00:27:55,820
the technology industry like all

00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:57,259
industries follow cycles the pendulum is

00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,940
swinging back to the broad and powering

00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:02,320
philosophies that underpin the early

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:04,999
social web and I no longer believe this

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,499
these cycles aren't inherently systemic

00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:08,539
in my view they happen because there are

00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:10,849
people and institutions pulling the

00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:12,799
pendulum in their direction knowingly or

00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:17,570
unknowingly and this tug of war is

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:20,119
becoming increasingly lopsided most used

00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:23,749
websites / country red is google blue is

00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:26,389
Facebook that's a bit depressing this

00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:28,309
time it's different I think even if you

00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:29,589
believe that the open source world can

00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,609
build an e resist

00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:36,229
decentralized secure and private

00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:37,399
alternative to that or if you believe

00:28:36,229 --> 00:28:39,709
that you know sharing may suddenly

00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:41,659
become uncool or you know startup

00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:43,399
funding becomes uncool or some major

00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:45,559
regulatory action suddenly cripples

00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:47,839
these giants there is one almost

00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:50,389
geological trend that I don't think

00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:52,190
anyone can slow or stop and that's a

00:28:50,389 --> 00:28:54,289
trend to the consumer device you can

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,669
call the phone or tablet if you like but

00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:58,039
its consumer because it's a one-way

00:28:55,669 --> 00:29:02,059
thing you can only consume services you

00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:03,889
can't create them while the desktop is a

00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:05,359
veritable do anything machine and it's

00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:07,579
open and your options are basically

00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,919
unlimited a tablet or a phone is still

00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:12,109
an amazingly powerful tool I know people

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,989
who basically lead their entire life off

00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:17,450
an ipad it works just fine for them but

00:29:14,989 --> 00:29:19,219
it is more closed and the form factor

00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:22,159
simply does limit what you can do with

00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:23,959
it and this is just as true of an open

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,049
Firefox phone as it is of a closed

00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:30,259
iPhone they are designed for consumption

00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:33,019
and not production there's no view

00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:35,389
source menu item in there and there's no

00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:36,889
view source menu item Google glass and

00:29:35,389 --> 00:29:38,329
there won't be one of Facebook's oculus

00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:40,700
and there won't be one in any of the

00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:45,019
increasingly d materialized devices we

00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:46,669
use to access the network the internet

00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:48,649
will become more pervasive but less

00:29:46,669 --> 00:29:50,179
explicit and visible it will to some

00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:54,079
extent blend into the background of all

00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:56,089
we do so these consumer devices are a

00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:58,339
thing than I fear that our team is

00:29:56,089 --> 00:30:00,950
shrinking most people starting with the

00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:03,769
web today only know this consumer side

00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:05,359
from their consumer device there's a

00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:07,729
saying that the entire continent of

00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:10,570
Africa is practically mobile only it's

00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:13,369
not even mobile first it's mobile only

00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:15,679
new web users can't really see it for

00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:17,329
what we see it as this wondrous

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,909
malleable thing that anyone can shape

00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:21,919
don't know its history or its promise if

00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:23,690
Facebook is your entire web you're

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,129
holding that pendulum to the closed side

00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:28,399
and you kind of do anything about it

00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:31,489
because you don't know about it the web

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,049
has been split into a wedge has been

00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:35,209
driven into the web thoroughly and

00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:38,089
deeply on the one hand we have the

00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:40,279
consumer web with little black boxes and

00:30:38,089 --> 00:30:40,880
a black cloud and monolithic stacks

00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:42,290
services

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,150
it's smooth and it's slick and it's

00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:46,970
well-made it's affordable it's easy to

00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:48,500
use it's very compelling on the other we

00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:52,130
have the professional web where we all

00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:54,140
hang out but the web the wedge is still

00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,970
moving and the more separate the two

00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,850
parts become I think the more both will

00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:00,400
suffer the consumer web because it's

00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,960
becoming increasingly closed

00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:05,720
consolidated access controlled and gate

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,270
kept on our side because our side will

00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,680
simply continually shrink until it's

00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:18,890
only a factory to make stuff for the

00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:21,950
other half end of part 3 this consumer

00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:25,040
web it's closer to TV than it is to our

00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,660
web now everyone's a channel but apart

00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,120
from that it's as much a black box as a

00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:31,220
TVs Inc ordered a black cloud really

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,130
money and time go in and Taemin comes

00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:37,640
out and we have no idea or control what

00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:40,280
happens in between internet internal

00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,630
access to this box is reserved for

00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,330
specially educated people and the

00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:46,580
companies they work for and just having

00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:49,190
the ability to create content for this

00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:53,000
medium doesn't make her mobile devices

00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:54,590
much more than many televisions where

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,880
our services and content produced and

00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:57,950
selected who decides what comes through

00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,960
and what doesn't access control

00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,450
filtering and censorship cannon will be

00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,220
Semak Lee inherent as will surveillance

00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:06,500
and we won't even be able to tell

00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,880
because the system is closed and if all

00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,760
you have to access the system is your

00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:14,420
phone well that's it you can't find out

00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:15,350
more right now the internet is headed

00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:17,360
towards a highly commercialized

00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,980
profit-driven opaque and privatized

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:28,780
domain much like the mass media of the

00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:35,330
1980s part 4 where did it all go wrong

00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:37,280
so we did everything right didn't we we

00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:40,070
the web aficionados the open source

00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,960
community data privacy paladin's we

00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,660
warned everyone repeatedly over the

00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,970
years we wrote more secure peer-reviewed

00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:49,070
alternatives we even generously gave it

00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:51,059
all away for free and yet in the

00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:52,919
consumer space open source hasn't

00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:56,100
one everyone's using Facebook what the

00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:57,749
hell regular people suck why haven't we

00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,029
already had the year of linux on the

00:32:57,749 --> 00:33:02,999
desktop I mean it's clearly superior why

00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:03,899
doesn't everyone PGP their emails you

00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:06,299
didn't really think they weren't

00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:07,830
intercepting everything do you you can

00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:10,830
use ab dot net that'll solve all your

00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:14,159
problems it's all right there but no

00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:16,139
it's not the solution so regular people

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,679
aren't the problem right must be the

00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:21,480
opposite vent open source sucks ah I

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,210
love open source too much to leave that

00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:26,399
up there I'm endlessly thankful for all

00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,470
the time saved and abilities I've gotten

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,990
through open source it's practically

00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,700
exclusive to my side as a developer and

00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:35,519
a generally nerdy computer person I

00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,559
think open source does a lot for many

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,940
people but it rarely touches people

00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:44,009
outside of our demographic so to make

00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:47,100
this more precise open source sucks for

00:33:44,009 --> 00:33:49,080
this type of a problem for the problem

00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:51,869
of providing good alternatives to the

00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:54,090
stacks of building an open free secure

00:33:51,869 --> 00:33:59,269
private and ideally properly

00:33:54,090 --> 00:34:01,980
decentralized web is why lack of empathy

00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:03,600
again we graciously scatter our work on

00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,789
the earth expecting the unwashed masses

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,740
to flock to us take up a half-finished

00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:09,569
and often seriously shonky tools and

00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:11,159
make a better world with them at the

00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:12,780
same time we patronize them for needing

00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,690
a helper when they can't figure out how

00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,700
they work that's wrong we took it as

00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,649
self evident and obvious that people

00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,030
would even want to participate in this

00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:22,619
medium instead of doing the hard work

00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:24,119
necessary to make it a welcoming and

00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:27,750
rewarding place for the rest of the

00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:30,050
world it's just the the cherry on top of

00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,919
this ice cream sundae of egocentricity

00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,899
expecting that everyone else would care

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,510
about this as deeply as we do they don't

00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:39,000
they have other priorities in life oops

00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:41,429
I don't know what your first computing

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,869
experience was mine was that he wasn't

00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:45,450
have been ready on a blue screen or

00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:47,339
something in any case if you're my age

00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,409
it was probably a black prompt and

00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:52,190
that's a system with a learning curve

00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:55,260
that very closely resembles a brick wall

00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:58,230
so to us though for lack of any

00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,420
alternatives that represents a great

00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:02,819
opportunity it's lots of fiddly rubbish

00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:05,609
and pain but we saw great opportunities

00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:07,890
that's not a majority opinion especially

00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:10,049
not today nowadays many people's first

00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:12,599
and only computing experience as a phone

00:35:10,049 --> 00:35:14,190
and they love it and you shouldn't ever

00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,170
fault them for it because they're not

00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:18,299
lazy and they're not done all they want

00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:20,819
is a good experience and they want to be

00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:23,790
empowered and that might be hard for us

00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:25,589
to understand given our tools and our

00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,780
history with these super powerful tools

00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:30,180
that give us total flexibility at the

00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,280
price of usability but we can deal with

00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,569
it because we're used to the pain and we

00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,760
kind of expect everyone else to go

00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:37,920
through the same thing but if we had

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,069
have had at if we had had iphones as

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,480
alternatives back then i think many of

00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:46,710
us wouldn't be here today second problem

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,170
believing that technology will save us

00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,960
all and really this goes all the way

00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:53,280
back to the catalog and the well as tech

00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,349
people we put a lot of faith in

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,720
technology it's been good to us we owe

00:35:55,349 --> 00:35:59,430
it a lot but just having something that

00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,849
works for us and then expecting everyone

00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:05,000
else to use it that doesn't cut it arab

00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:07,920
al can cause a trickle-down technology

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,150
so you make stuff for the elite and you

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,740
believe that will eventually trickle

00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,089
down to the masses it's like

00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:14,280
trickle-down economics where you make

00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:15,390
rich people richer and you think at some

00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,430
point what's going to arrive at the

00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:20,250
bottom so now and just like trickle-down

00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:22,770
economics that doesn't work so who

00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:25,140
really benefits from our openness it's

00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:27,599
other people I guess and it's companies

00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,859
we employ people like us companies

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,900
profits so much from open source

00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:33,420
consequently they fund or maintain large

00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:35,220
parts of many other big big projects and

00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,410
again I realize that much of the basic

00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,630
underlying infrastructure of the web is

00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:41,579
open source and that is obviously a

00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:43,200
benefit to everyone but again I'm

00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:47,940
talking about the places where people

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:51,270
directly interact with software in the

00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,829
end none of that really helps propagate

00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:55,049
the original values of the web you know

00:36:52,829 --> 00:37:01,079
this is for everyone not just for web

00:36:55,049 --> 00:37:03,060
developers for everyone it doesn't help

00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:05,280
fulfill this empowerment promise of the

00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:07,530
web it makes us feel good and they leave

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,230
and never learnt and helpful yes but

00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,940
none of all this really reaches people

00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:15,220
outside of our circles

00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,140
and much of this tech evolves over time

00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,780
often without a clear goal mostly in

00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:22,300
reaction to other processes was often

00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,680
never proactively designed to be usable

00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:25,810
it was made to solve a specific problem

00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,099
and then people just took it and did

00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,980
things to it and solve other problems

00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:32,470
with it and it's always unforeseen

00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:35,260
issues and usages we always build in

00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:36,819
reaction to a problem or on top of some

00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,250
exciting tech just for the sake of it

00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:42,099
but rarely does any of our building

00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:44,560
truly start with a human side and

00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:49,180
another aspect of this tech focused

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:51,099
nurses this idea of meritocracy we're so

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:53,190
text entered the main aspect that

00:37:51,099 --> 00:37:55,420
matters in a person is their tech output

00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,589
doesn't matter in a meritocracy it

00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,839
doesn't matter how awful you are as a

00:37:56,589 --> 00:38:00,910
person as long as your code is good but

00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:02,560
conversely that means if you write good

00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:04,300
code you can be an utter bastard to

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,089
people and most of your peers will still

00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:09,310
respect you and that's a lousy set of

00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:13,410
values and a great deterrent to reaching

00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:15,819
more people and it's a huge problem OOP

00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:19,349
culture matters it's not just what you

00:38:15,819 --> 00:38:22,750
do it's how you do it third thing

00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:25,599
hypocrisy do you encrypt all your emails

00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:27,400
I don't have you sworn off all

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,540
centralized services deleted your

00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,390
facebook google and twitter accounts

00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:33,369
because i haven't I adventure all of you

00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:34,990
use Twitter most of you use Facebook and

00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:37,660
most of you probably use at least five

00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,490
Google services a day so how persuasive

00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:41,800
does that make us when we speak of the

00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,300
open and free web how could we really

00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,859
ever convince anyone that we really

00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:48,880
believe in this secure private

00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:50,589
decentralized thing our daily behavior

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,960
just confirms how important good

00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:54,640
experiences are if you can we can't

00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,260
resist the allure of the big stacks and

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,780
the huge companies how can we truly

00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:01,930
expect anyone else to they empower us to

00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,579
to ride them as much as we will the

00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:05,790
tools we propagate are often too

00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:07,780
inconvenient even for people like us

00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:11,710
especially in contrast to the Polish

00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:15,550
consumer stuff so seen from the outside

00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:17,230
from other people's perspectives who are

00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:22,329
not part of the tech industry what what

00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:23,360
does this look like that doesn't sound

00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:25,520
good

00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:27,200
that sounds depressing and it leads it

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,910
leads to a super weird schism because on

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,100
the one hand you have this amazing

00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:33,140
occasionally very altruistic open source

00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,700
idea which is so cool it regularly

00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,920
floors people when I tell non tech

00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,570
people about how it works if there's

00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,330
wonderful global results-oriented

00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:43,250
collaboration and structural agreements

00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:44,600
that benefit everyone it's brilliant and

00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,940
I'd really like to see it in other

00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:48,920
realms on the other hand we have a

00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:51,620
culture that is often intrinsically

00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:55,520
condescending unempowered are too often

00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:58,280
straight-out misogynistic so neither

00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,020
what we make nor how we are was or is

00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,700
especially attractive to people outside

00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:06,080
our peer group to get their hands on

00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:08,840
directly culture we have is often

00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:10,580
ideologically naive and it ranges from

00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:13,490
obtuse and unapproachable to

00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:16,070
occasionally plain our style and it's no

00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:17,630
wonder that no one cares no wonder they

00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:24,310
all go to the highly polished beautiful

00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:24,310
services par 5 where do we go from here

00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:30,620
tragically we're a bit late to our own

00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:32,600
party the consumer web in my opinion

00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:35,510
it's a thing and it's going to become

00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,850
more other thing that's done and I don't

00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:39,550
see it going away but we're still

00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:43,070
somewhat in control of the other half

00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:44,450
professional web and by necessity it's

00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:47,030
going to stay open and more accessible

00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:49,760
at least technically accessible for

00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:52,550
longer culturally low I think it's too

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,280
closed I'd much rather we turn it to a

00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:58,450
producer web something that's culturally

00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,250
and socially accessible welcoming and

00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:03,350
truly open to all of any skill level of

00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,240
any language of any gender and that

00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:07,790
doesn't necessarily have anything to do

00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:10,880
with altruism if we want this open web

00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:14,110
we need to populate it with people who

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,580
care about it otherwise there's no point

00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:19,400
so what can you do

00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:21,320
I want to briefly show two things we do

00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,960
at hoodie so I'm going to talk about

00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,910
what your tiny bit that we do to

00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,780
increase accessibility to the technology

00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:32,360
we make so very quickly if you haven't

00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,670
heard of it yet hoodie makes developing

00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:37,190
web apps easy and fast it's like jQuery

00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,260
you include a library it gives a user

00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:41,930
authentication data storage sink or five

00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:43,550
features and stuff and in development we

00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:45,980
have a few concepts that guide how we

00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:47,780
make things and i'd like to share two of

00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:51,200
those with you the first one is no

00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:53,390
back-end building web apps is complex

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,350
business especially on the server side

00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,090
we're dealing with a lot of

00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:58,040
technological legacies some a

00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:00,080
decades-old all different or acting upon

00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,780
another it's difficult to get into it's

00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:05,720
very easy to get wrong it's daunting if

00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:10,010
not outright tutoring to beginners it's

00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:12,800
a huge barrier to entry so we looked at

00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:14,450
what people wish they could do we saw

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,250
that many people want the same basic

00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:18,140
things out of web applications they want

00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:20,150
to authenticate users they want data

00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:22,490
sync they want to send a couple of males

00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:24,470
and we thought man these things have

00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:29,150
been around forever they really should

00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:31,850
be easier what I'm trying to do is

00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:34,070
really simple it shouldn't be hard all

00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:36,650
computers are just carefully organized

00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:39,470
sound everything is hard until somebody

00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,960
makes it easy and we thought hate web

00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:44,570
programmers we have power in this brown

00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,000
we can do this we can make it easier

00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:49,160
it's all arbitrary it's all agreements

00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,180
between human beings we can agree on new

00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,440
things so we agreed on this promise

00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:56,030
we'll let you build full-featured web

00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,280
apps from the client side and you don't

00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:59,590
have to worry about the back end so we

00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,300
want to give people a tool that

00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:04,460
radically lowers the barrier to entry to

00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:06,530
building web apps making it easy to set

00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,180
up quick to get going and if you can use

00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:10,850
jQuery now you can probably build a

00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:13,340
simple web app what we're trying to do

00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:16,760
is build good tools and make them for

00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:19,310
people who aren't us to help us with it

00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,950
we have a second guiding principle dream

00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:24,350
code that's an interface design

00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:26,420
philosophy by interface we mean the API

00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:28,430
so we're humans interface with our

00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,600
software

00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:31,220
instead of looking at all the technical

00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,440
features our stack has and thinking

00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:35,180
about exposing them somehow we took the

00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,880
opposite approach again we looked at

00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,710
what people wish they could do what's

00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,500
the best and simplest possible way to

00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:44,420
for example sign up a new user how far

00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,560
can you abstract this how simple can you

00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:50,120
make it why can't we just do this

00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:52,580
account signup you pass it user name and

00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:55,670
a password you should be done right it's

00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,350
2014 and this is such fundamental task

00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:59,900
to everything you want to do in the web

00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:04,010
why is it still hard why is it not that

00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:05,600
simple so we made it that simple and the

00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,370
implementation may be difficult or it

00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,020
may be easy it doesn't matter for the

00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:11,900
person who uses it what matters is the

00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:14,690
experience of using that and so that is

00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:16,190
a thing that works and you can do that

00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:17,780
immediately there's no backend set up

00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:21,890
there's no database schema you create in

00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:24,430
your hooding app and you go so what it

00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:27,800
is in essence is user centered design

00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:30,020
apply to code and not not to visual

00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,530
interfaces coupled with a bit of our own

00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:36,050
preferable futures because everything is

00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:38,270
hard until someone makes it easy build

00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:40,880
could build good tools for people who

00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:43,400
aren't you and remember that technology

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,640
isn't enough if we want to change the

00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:50,300
web itself to build this free open

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,860
secure private and decentralized web we

00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:54,560
can either resign ourselves to doing it

00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:56,120
in our own realm the pro web or we can

00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,460
take on the consumer web and try to

00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:00,800
compete with the Giants with Facebook

00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:02,540
with Google and Apple but we can't win

00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,930
on the features that aren't important to

00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:08,180
us in fact it may well be useful to hide

00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:09,920
the things we value most like you know

00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,230
peer-to-peer encryption decentralized

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,540
infrastructure etc because at recent

00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:17,690
history is shown nobody cares enough

00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,980
well even we do we care about the

00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:20,360
principles but we don't want to make the

00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:23,270
sacrifice we don't want to sacrifice

00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:25,040
convenience for security I mean even now

00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:26,420
there are still people who make excuses

00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,540
because they're too lazy to use seat

00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:33,050
belts it's the same phenomenon we have

00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:35,090
to win through good experience tools and

00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:37,280
services we make have to beat what

00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:39,140
currently exists on user experience and

00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,750
convenience and all the auto P&I deals

00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,660
we want to impose on

00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:45,760
the web freedom openness security

00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:47,200
decentralization they must be Trojan

00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,590
horses because they're not selling

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:53,590
points to the average people and too

00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:55,240
many of us thing out either and I think

00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:58,660
we should provide an upgrade path for

00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:00,970
people to move from the consumer web to

00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:03,490
the pro web so if you can find ways of

00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:05,620
making the workings somewhat accessible

00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:07,420
under a beautiful veneer of sensible

00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:09,220
defaults and excellent user experience

00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,990
and so much the better if we can invite

00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:13,210
them over that's a good thing because

00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:15,190
however of all types has become more

00:46:13,210 --> 00:46:18,760
accessible to more people compared to

00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:22,120
save the 70s produce a hardware like a

00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,590
proper PC just the rates of those exist

00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,420
existing in the world they just haven't

00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:30,070
increased at the same rate as mobile but

00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:32,650
it's more than they used to be so right

00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:34,690
now today we can't see the thing at all

00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:36,040
that's going to be the most important

00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:38,080
one hundred years from now or even 10

00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:41,380
years from now but whatever that thing

00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:44,350
is people will have to think it and we

00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:46,210
can right now today prepare powerful

00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:47,980
ways of thinking for these people we can

00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:50,620
build the tools that make it possible to

00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:53,470
think the thing and I see this as our

00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:56,410
job because we have the power to do it

00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:58,090
and with power comes responsibility in

00:46:56,410 --> 00:47:00,130
this case because who else is going to

00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:04,440
do it and when else's are going to be

00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:06,670
done if not now it's our responsibility

00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,230
we are the people who are setting the

00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:10,540
earliest patterns for this medium our

00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:12,610
fate won't matter much but the norms we

00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:14,770
set will and i don't mean technical

00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:17,020
norms neither does he we've seen how

00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:18,910
fleeting they can be but currently

00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,220
there's a vacuum of cultural norms on in

00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:23,350
our industry and the web apart from this

00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,720
Californian ideology we have little to

00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:30,120
offer and we can and must do better than

00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,120
that end of part 5

00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:40,750
take a step outside yourself to close

00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:42,819
let's look back at that satellite

00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:45,220
picture it was the first of three

00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:47,980
photographs that deeply influenced

00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:50,140
humanity's consciousness for the first

00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,940
time there was a cultural artifact that

00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:55,089
allowed us to see at first glance our

00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:56,339
place as part of a natural system we

00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:58,299
were no longer the pinnacle of creation

00:47:56,339 --> 00:48:02,440
standing above and separate from the

00:47:58,299 --> 00:48:05,019
rest of nature now we're hardly even

00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:08,579
visible from space we were nature we

00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:10,480
were planet inseparably intertwined

00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:12,640
photographs helped coalesce an

00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,190
environmental philosophy the green

00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,450
movement ecological consciousness

00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:18,309
sustainability they helped us understand

00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:22,720
ourselves as part of the whole system in

00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:24,700
an easily graspable way today we're

00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,410
similarly it similarly entwined with our

00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,150
networks and the web as we are with

00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:30,789
nature clearly they're not as a crucial

00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:32,140
as the plants the provider oxygen but

00:48:30,789 --> 00:48:34,750
the networks are becoming increasingly

00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:37,150
prevalent spanning the globe bringing

00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:39,369
formally dumb objects to life augmenting

00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:41,680
our individual bodies and our collective

00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:43,839
increasingly cybernetic humanity they've

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:47,079
become a nervous system or externalized

00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:49,200
memory and it will only ever grow denser

00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:52,299
connecting more people and more things

00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,759
the network is the ultimate human tool

00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:57,670
and it will in time become utterly

00:48:54,759 --> 00:48:59,049
inseparable from us we'll take it with

00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:01,269
us when we eventually leave other

00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:03,009
planets and when it will outlast many of

00:49:01,269 --> 00:49:05,319
the company's countries religions and

00:49:03,009 --> 00:49:08,410
philosophies we know today the word the

00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:09,759
network is never going away again it

00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:12,069
will be with us in some form or other

00:49:09,759 --> 00:49:14,589
until the very end they will receive

00:49:12,069 --> 00:49:16,299
from view as a technical entity but it

00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:19,710
will remain there as the invisible

00:49:16,299 --> 00:49:22,720
backbone of human society in culture

00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:24,700
what I wish for in a way is a cultural

00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,220
artifact that will easily convey this

00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:29,019
notion today that will capture the

00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,880
beauty and the staggering opportunity of

00:49:29,019 --> 00:49:32,890
this human creation that will make

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,869
abundantly clear just how intertwined

00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:37,180
our fates are it's make clear that it's

00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:39,309
worth preserving and improving and

00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:41,289
cherishing it's one of the few truly

00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:42,819
global species and compressing

00:49:41,289 --> 00:49:45,279
accomplishments that has a power to do

00:49:42,819 --> 00:49:46,690
so much for so many even if they never

00:49:45,279 --> 00:49:47,860
have the power to contribute to it

00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:50,150
directly

00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,800
but to get there we must not only build

00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:54,260
great tools we must build a great

00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:57,350
culture we will have achieved nothing if

00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:59,480
our tools are free open secure private

00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:04,580
and decentralized if there is no culture

00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:07,940
to embrace and support these values so I

00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:10,100
implore you make good decisions now step

00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:12,280
