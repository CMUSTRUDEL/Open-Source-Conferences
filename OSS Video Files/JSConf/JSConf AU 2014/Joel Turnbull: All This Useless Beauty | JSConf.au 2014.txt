Oh

00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:12,019
so this talk is called all this useless

00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:14,030
beauty and it's about surreal numbers in

00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:15,679
JavaScript so it's kind of a tricky

00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,780
topic and it's not particularly useful

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,519
it's nice to get this over with so we

00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,779
can get on with actual useful stuff that

00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,960
will make you better developers for the

00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:26,480
rest of the day yeah as John mentioned

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,560
I'm a teacher so this is the kind of

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,849
thing I try and get my students

00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,300
interested in rather than just how to

00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:33,770
make money doing web stuff I'm not

00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,930
really a social media kind of guy but

00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:39,559
you can find me on snapchat my username

00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:41,480
is crud head and I'm also called head on

00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,379
IRC if any of you ever run into me that

00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,390
and I'm from Sydney so these slides

00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:50,270
obviously this is just the plug for my

00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,039
sponsor here this is revealed j/s it

00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,000
doesn't look like usual reveal jazz but

00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:54,890
I don't want you to think that I

00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,079
actually have design skills I've

00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,210
actually ripped this design off from jen

00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,940
Schiffer I haven't even renamed the

00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,420
files its source to references to jquery

00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,860
conference in austin texas of last year

00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,840
but I met her last year and she's

00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:10,820
wonderful she talks about the same kinds

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,670
of things except her stuff is much more

00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:16,450
beautiful obviously and I'd encourage

00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,770
you to go and look up some of her talks

00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,240
what I have added to this is my own

00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,610
picture here which is Harvey Birdman

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,960
there was a complaint from some people

00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,329
that I didn't include enough pictures in

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,000
my slides so I put Harvey Birdman on

00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:30,920
every single page there and if you get

00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,420
bored you can just look a Harvey Birdman

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,790
I like to think that he's kind of

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,649
looking at my slides and quietly

00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,860
approving of them so he got to slide to

00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:42,229
himself there this presentation contains

00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,270
one animated gif I know that you young

00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:45,740
developing people like animated gifts so

00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,659
I've got one in here it's not a funny

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,530
one but if you're a fan of animated gifs

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:50,530
you can look forward to that

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,750
so where do I come from I'm not famous

00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:58,030
I'm just one of the regular kind of guys

00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,790
that r is interested in web stuff I

00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:03,250
haven't ever done anything famous I'm

00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,590
much older than all of you at least

00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,660
spiritually so I was doing this stuff

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,470
last century before most of your born

00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,450
before nine eleven I like to think of it

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,880
and I was making the internet and it was

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:17,110
all going fine and then I'd know exactly

00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,830
sure what happened but something called

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:23,080
the dot-com collapsed and lots of people

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,580
didn't have work for a while so I went

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,200
to university and I thought I'll study

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,840
mathematics that's got something to do

00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,030
with computers probably and that stuff's

00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,980
really hard and don't don't study

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,690
mathematics don't let your children do

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:38,920
it I really regret having done that I

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,590
discovered it there towards the end of

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:45,220
my seven-year failing first you mats for

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,630
x degree that jQuery is quite fun so

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,330
Java scripts not my favorite language

00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,550
you can beat me up for that later but

00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:53,260
I'd really like the community I like the

00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,580
community I like JavaScript because of

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,030
you people that come to things like this

00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:59,530
I like the jQuery IRC channel I like

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,090
jQuery because it makes it easy for

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,310
people to do cool stuff that they're

00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,910
excited about so that got me back into

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,290
the web and I ended up teaching so I

00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,820
worked for a number of years doing that

00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,550
and it turned out it's easier to teach

00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,720
people if you can speak easy to teach

00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,220
and actually make things because I

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,600
didn't have deadlines my students come

00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,400
to me they say the projects due on

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,590
Friday I'm not gonna get this finished

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,890
and it's not my problem I just say good

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,890
luck with that

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,560
so what I learned at University this is

00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:30,569
a you know a brief summary maths is

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,980
really hard and it's very impressive

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:33,930
that some people are good at it I'm not

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,060
one of those people I especially hate

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,020
calculus I didn't realize those going to

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,300
be so much I should have seen that

00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:43,380
coming but it's just one of those things

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:46,110
I especially hate infinitesimals so I

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,880
side with Bishop Berkeley when calculus

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,100
was kind of invented or discovered we'll

00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,420
talk a bit more about that in a moment

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,450
he wrote a letter complaining that

00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,640
infinitesimals were offensive to God so

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,470
you guys know with the area under a

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,360
curve you can work it out by taking an

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,250
infinite number of infinitely small

00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,410
things and they add up to the area under

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,360
the curve that makes me feel icky I

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,760
really don't like that it doesn't make

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,350
sense I know it works i'm happy that it

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,970
works but i don't i don't want to have

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,000
anything to do with it so I'm with

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,290
Berkeley that that is horrible and it

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,090
turns out what I should have studied is

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,489
these fields called the philosophy of

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,750
mathematics and or meta mathematics so

00:04:20,489 --> 00:04:23,310
that's the stuff about how math works

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,780
rather than actually having to deal with

00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:28,950
the nitty gritty details so the kinds of

00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,050
questions you get to talk about in the

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:35,280
philosophy of mathematics do numbers

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,960
exist is mathematics invented or

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,560
discovered would we have mathematics if

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:44,520
we didn't have people how do written

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,190
symbols capture mathematical truths what

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,200
the hell is truth I took too long

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,430
courses on what truth is I still don't

00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,789
know but it's it's an interesting

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,289
question more relevant is how well do

00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:57,440
computers model mathematics and we'll

00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:59,370
talk about that in a little bit and

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,140
questions like how does girdles

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,850
incompleteness theorem affect our daily

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,060
lives I'm not sure that it does but it's

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,160
fun to think about so what I try to

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,520
teach what I'm teaching three months at

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,110
a time of a full-stack web development

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,270
bootcamp kind of thing that's all the

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,340
rage these days so I teach people how to

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,400
make web stuff the full stack as they

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,870
say and you know my motivation is that

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,310
I'm trying to hire I'm trying to teach

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,720
people to have the kinds of skills that

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,370
I would hire them for so if they showed

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,650
up on day 1 i'd be able to give them

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,659
something to do and they be able to do

00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,099
something useful for me but beyond that

00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:33,330
i take it as an opportunity to teach

00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,830
people about the joy of programming

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,160
because i really love this stuff i just

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,780
got into

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,430
computers when as a kid and I've never

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,710
really had a wobble about what I do with

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,790
my career that's just worked out well

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,440
for me so I try and teach them stuff

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:47,820
that like this isn't anything to do with

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,110
money this is just interesting or fun so

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,490
the things that I insist that they

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,780
should know the things I say when you

00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,160
have some spare time this is what you

00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,960
should go and look up I think they

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,610
should learn formal logic I think there

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,770
is not enough emphasis on formal logic

00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,390
in computer science courses and I think

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,850
it makes us stronger developers it makes

00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,590
development more easily if you're able

00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,480
to understand reasoning that kind of

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,830
abstract thought and I also think you

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,060
should learn regular expressions because

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:10,740
everyone should learn regular

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,570
expressions I mean obviously especially

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,400
developers but I'm often shocked to

00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,140
discover that people who are senior to

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,640
me in companies don't know regular

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,780
expressions and come to me for help with

00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,210
what the hell is matter with you people

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,380
these things will save you time so you

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,870
know I tell my students you need to

00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,660
learn regular expressions why I think

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,790
formal logic matters in computing so you

00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,350
guys know about cheering machines um you

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,420
don't have to know how to make them but

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,890
you know that what they are the idea was

00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,900
you know ensuring invented this who's

00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:38,220
like how would I automate the process as

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,680
I go through when I'm trying to think of

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,070
some think through some problem so it's

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,150
like a machine that does the job that a

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:48,180
mathematician or a logicians brain would

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,220
do so Turing machines are basically

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,740
mechanical reasons they can do reasoning

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,330
mechanically for you and computers that

00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,919
we use today are practical cheering

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,200
machines we kind of we wouldn't have

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,410
computers in this state if we hadn't had

00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,850
the concept of a Turing machine first

00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,200
computers are also formal systems so if

00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,910
you're able to think about formal logic

00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,410
and formal systems then that gives you a

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,480
sense of what your computer is doing and

00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,700
I like to think that a computer is a

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,070
tiny frantic robot logician trapped

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,419
inside these machines so if you think of

00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:19,980
them in those terms it's easier to push

00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:21,090
them around so this is about two real

00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,650
numbers but I'll give you a little bit

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,260
of context for this numbers is really

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,340
strange and children understand this you

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,600
forget about it because you just get

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,790
used to them you can pay your bus fare

00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,590
or pay your rent each month or whatever

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,790
else needs to do but when you explain

00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,140
what numbers are the children they

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,970
understand that numbers are quite

00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,290
strange and I like to encourage people

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,330
to go back to think about this and kind

00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,490
of be weirded out by numbers so for

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,370
example does the number seven exist and

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:46,350
if so where is it is the number seven in

00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,900
this room somewhere with the number

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,430
seven exist if people didn't exist

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,530
hand on the physical universe in some

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,210
way it's an interesting but you know

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:55,440
obviously we can use the number seven

00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,580
and whether or not we believe in it it's

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,740
not an important question but it's an

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,720
interesting one where did the number

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,600
come from where is it going what does it

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,520
want we're actually relying on numbers

00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,800
but we don't really know what they are

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,259
and I mean I've thought about this a lot

00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,880
and I still don't know what they are and

00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:13,199
most mathematicians it turns out don't

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,120
want to talk about this they just want

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,680
to get on with it they ask you to stop

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,880
asking questions and please leave the

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,800
university but if you're if you're in

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,090
the philosophy department they will

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,910
agree with you that foundations of

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:28,470
mathematics are still uncertain so

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,060
there's quote from John von Neumann he

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,580
of the von Neumann architecture which

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,320
are machines today using mathematics you

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,789
don't understand things you just get

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,380
used to them and that's really true we

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:40,140
just get used to mathematics we kind of

00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:44,039
ignore how weird it all is so let's

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,570
consider the number 144 in decimal

00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,940
that's expressed with one and a four and

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,260
four that's what it looks like in binary

00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,700
and that's the JavaScript version

00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,000
because JavaScript doesn't want to do

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,529
binary as a literal that's the octal

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,589
version and that's the hexadecimal

00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:00,420
version so these things all represent

00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:03,900
the number that we call in decimal or

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,339
base 10 144 but they're not the actual

00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,779
number ok go to keep that in mind

00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,760
they're just different representations

00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:11,430
of this thing whatever it is wherever it

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,200
is the number 144 and these basically

00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,640
just symbols which behave like the

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,890
number they do the things that we expect

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,450
the number 144 to dirt it's greater than

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:23,430
100 it's divisible by 2 and so on so

00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,510
numbers in JavaScript I put some

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,950
JavaScript in here because that's why

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,430
you guys are here so it seemed like the

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,050
right thing to do programs generally

00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,760
model numbers as collections of ones and

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,610
zeros so you know that computers really

00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,640
binary that's what they're insured and

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,839
JavaScript as you know uses the I eeee

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,450
754 double precision binary

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,890
floating-point format which gives us

00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,540
most of the values we care about so we

00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,430
can count lots and lots of integers and

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,160
we get some rough approximation of a

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:52,290
bunch of decimals so in JavaScript this

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,450
is what 144 looks like in the computer's

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,589
memory at 64 bits and there's a couple

00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:59,130
little ones in there and then a whole

00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:00,209
bunch of zeros and there's some problems

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,470
with this which are fairly famous

00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:02,400
problems you will have heard about these

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,230
so we have

00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,230
Robbins with overflow and underflow and

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,730
precision so to give you some examples

00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,440
in JavaScript this is the biggest number

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,090
you can talk about or think about just

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,430
using native JavaScript so you can

00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,260
access number max value tell you what

00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,030
the biggest number is and that's it and

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,770
it's a huge number but if you ever

00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,560
needed a bigger number you can't do it

00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,880
in JavaScript we also have this problem

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,650
this is the integers if you're just

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,200
counting integers as soon as you get up

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,730
to this big old number here and add one

00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,490
to it you just get the same number back

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:35,960
which is not a great thing for a

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:38,280
language that's doing mathematics to do

00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,560
that shouldn't be true but it is in

00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,390
JavaScript you'll also have heard about

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,280
this one point two plus point one

00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:48,140
doesn't give you point three gives you a

00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,140
point three and a little tiny bit extra

00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:54,900
so I e75 for is an imperfect model you

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,520
can do a bunch of mathematics but you

00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:01,050
can't do all that but it's of Isis so

00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,200
can we model numbers in a different way

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:06,060
and it turns out that yes we can so

00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,490
let's talk about sets this is a terrible

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,480
pun and I'm sorry for that fortunately

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,750
you're too young to know what I'm

00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,370
talking about so I've stolen Wikipedia

00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,830
definition of what a set is here they're

00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,720
very easy to understand in mathematics a

00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,970
set is a collection of distinct objects

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,980
considered as an object in its own right

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,560
so we say that there's a thing as a set

00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,540
it's a collection of things so sets

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:31,200
usually delimited with curly braces like

00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,090
that and for example here's the set of

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,100
positive primes less than 10 so that's

00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,140
two three five and seven to find how to

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,670
put the numbers into the set and then

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:41,820
I've actually gone ahead and drop them

00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:44,370
straight in there so here's some

00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,990
interesting sets that doesn't just have

00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,580
to be math related so there's the set of

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,860
people in this room right at this moment

00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,390
that's a valid set that's a thing you

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,460
can talk about you can think about you

00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,640
can reason about it there's the set of

00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,680
Paul Irish there's the set of odd

00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,930
integers and that's an infinite set as

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,160
infinitely many audiences and you can

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,070
still put them in a set you can have

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,830
infinite sets that's fine there's a set

00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,510
of things that don't exist which is also

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,160
an infinite set and it's a very big one

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,750
and I quite like thinking about it the

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,270
set of things that don't exist seems to

00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,960
be much much much bigger than the set of

00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,960
things that do exist

00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,450
and you can have the set of odd numbers

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,070
and a set of sorry the set of the set of

00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,380
odd numbers and the set of even numbers

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:31,970
so sets can contain other sets that's

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:34,250
not a problem either and we've got this

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:37,130
concept called cardinality so the

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:39,410
cardinality of a set s is the number of

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,360
members of s so for example if we have a

00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,550
set B which has three colors in it blue

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,560
white and red then the cardinality of

00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:47,360
that set is three this is easy right

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,910
this you can teach this stuff to primary

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,470
school kids so cardinality the

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,790
interesting thing about it why I care

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,590
about it is because we can use it as a

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,480
source for natural numbers and so it's a

00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,270
way of generating natural numbers it's a

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,370
place where numbers can be derived from

00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:03,470
so the number seven for example you can

00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,900
say that that is the cardinality of all

00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,400
sets with seven members so if we want to

00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,170
say does the number seven exist we can

00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,300
say sure you just take all of the sets

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,100
that have exactly seven members and it's

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,370
the cardinality of those sets it's the

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,380
number of things in them and so here's

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,120
some headache-inducing sets so I'm just

00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,340
focus on Harvey Birdman if this is too

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,860
much for you these ones are the tricky

00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:27,410
ones that keep people awake at night so

00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:30,080
we have this set of all sets that is a

00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,940
big old set and an interesting property

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,370
of the set of all sets is that it

00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:40,610
includes itself right because it's also

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:43,730
a set we have also the set of all sets

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:45,020
that include themselves which is another

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,090
one's that they'll make your brain hurt

00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,190
so the set of all sets does include

00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:51,850
itself so it's included in the set of

00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:54,770
all sets that include themselves and

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:57,710
Russell's paradox the set of all sets

00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:59,780
that don't include themselves so for

00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,040
example the set of Paul Irish doesn't

00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,360
include itself it's just got

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,420
polarization and it doesn't have any

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,850
other sets in it does Russell's set

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,800
include itself so does the set of all

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,410
sets that don't include themselves

00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,230
include itself or not and the answer is

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,030
yes and not because as soon as it

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:18,650
includes itself you need to remove it

00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,180
from the set but as soon as you remove

00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,520
it you need to put it back into the set

00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,990
so this bar Bertrand Russell was trying

00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,970
to establish that mathematics worked

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,760
really well and had a solid basis in set

00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,140
theory and then this burned him are you

00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,640
kind of had a breakdown about this

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,110
because you found this set that you just

00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,330
couldn't really deal with in a nice way

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,930
so there's paradoxes of the heart of set

00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:39,890
theory you just can't get away from that

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:41,990
so now we're going to deal with a much

00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:45,380
nicer set one that's much easier to

00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,820
think about is the empty set so all the

00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,100
sets that we've talked about so far have

00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,110
relied on external objects we needed

00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:53,450
things elsewhere in the world or in the

00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,850
platonic realm or something to put into

00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,710
the sets so it's likely people in this

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,440
room that's we were relying on notice to

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,300
define what that set was but there's an

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,670
interesting set with no members and it

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,290
doesn't rely on anything and that's

00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,130
called the empty set so that's just the

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:11,600
true curlies with nothing inside of it

00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,030
so we can derive this set in various

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,700
ways it's easy to show people that the

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:20,050
empty set exists the set of porsches the

00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:23,000
iron ore will ever learn is an empty set

00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:24,590
the set of numbers that is less than 10

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,510
and greater than 20 obviously there's no

00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,850
number that is both less than 10 and

00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,680
greater than 20 so that is also an empty

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,390
set and we just think of that as being

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,340
the empty set in all of these cases it's

00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,640
the same set its the empty set is set

00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:39,110
with nothing in it we can use the empty

00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,850
set to produce numbers that's why

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,440
mathematicians and logicians like it

00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:45,440
they can use the empty set as a basis

00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,780
for mathematics so they can derive the

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,270
number three from the cardinality of the

00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,730
set with 3m avec with three empty sets

00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:54,980
inside of it so there's a set inside it

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,270
has three empty sets I can produce the

00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,310
number three I can say well obviously

00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,110
the number three exists because it's the

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,430
cardinality of this set and doesn't

00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,470
depend on anything else so you need to

00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,360
say is that sets exist and the empty set

00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:09,470
exists and we can get the number three

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,450
out of it so several formalization of

00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,860
the foundations of mathematics proofs

00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,510
that mathematics has a rigorous

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,850
foundation we're actually talking about

00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:18,770
something and not just hallucinating you

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,930
can use this as a way of doing it and

00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,600
it's it lots of different formalization

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,790
have done that so the thrill numbers I'm

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,190
about to finally talk about are using

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:31,340
this idea they're using a variation of

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:32,630
this idea so we'll get on to those so

00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,550
surreal numbers they're not actually

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,320
useful nobody would ever do this in real

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:37,970
life and I did it in real life and I

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,920
kind of regret it but I get to talk to

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,080
you about it now it's from these this

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,760
area of recreational mathematics which

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,480
is also called armchair mathematics

00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,220
or our mathematical games and Douglas

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,070
Hofstadter called it meta magical femurs

00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:55,190
which for anagram fans is an anagram of

00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,510
mathematical games so that it's implicit

00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,280
in here that is not of any particular

00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:02,030
use it's just interesting to think about

00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:05,209
and surreal numbers were invented by

00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:06,620
John Conway and I picked this picture of

00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,980
him because he looks quite depraved in

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:12,949
there I kind of like that about him and

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,270
Harvey Birdman likes it too you will

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,339
have heard of Conway because you'll have

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,870
heard of Conway's Game of Life and this

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,209
is not JavaScript this is actually an

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,980
animated gif so I'll leave that one for

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:23,990
a second for you to enjoy but obviously

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,610
Conway is a time waster right he's

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,040
interested in the game of life which has

00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:29,420
no real practical usage and he's

00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,400
interested in serial numbers so that

00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,750
that's kind of his his schtick is like

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,140
things that are interesting but don't

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:38,390
matter I first heard about us real

00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,830
numbers from Donald Knuth which makes it

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,170
sound like I know him personally I've

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:45,140
never met the guy but he's written a

00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:47,240
book about it he's known as the author

00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,190
of the art of computer programming which

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,960
I told my students to read because it's

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,360
currently five volumes long and about

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,910
this wide and no mother get to the

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,320
bottom of it Bill Gates once said that

00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:58,730
if anybody had actually read the whole

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,470
thing they should apply to him directly

00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,770
for a job I don't know if he still says

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:05,390
that but he did but Donald truth also

00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,620
wrote this book surreal numbers and I

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,760
don't remember how I first heard about

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,080
this book because I didn't know there's

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,570
going to be a big deal to me so I didn't

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:13,910
make a note of it he wrote this book in

00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:17,150
the 70s and you'll see how 70s is in

00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:19,370
when I show you the subtitle how to X

00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:22,310
students turned on to pure mathematics

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,470
and found total happiness which is very

00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,930
70s they also enjoy the cover which I

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,910
believe his wife true that's two people

00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:31,010
sitting on a beach having a chat about

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,840
surreal numbers and those that that

00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:38,330
particular color scheme is also very

00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:40,100
very 70s it's not a good book it's it's

00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:41,690
not a bit it's not written as a textbook

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,420
the whole thing is written as a dialogue

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,830
between these two starstruck lovers

00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,020
sitting on this beach somewhere on the

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,610
coast and there are they just invent

00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:52,010
surreal numbers or discovers real

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,030
numbers as something to do it's

00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,500
interesting if you're interested in

00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,730
serial numbers but I wouldn't go to it

00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,530
if you're looking at putting on a play

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,520
for your local theater company

00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:04,130
something like that so surreal numbers

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,080
this is how they work so your numbers

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,640
are made up of sets of other sets so

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,850
surreal number is a set with some other

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,680
sets inside of it and we make new

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,630
numbers by taking existing numbers when

00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,740
putting those in new sets and in a

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:17,900
second you'll see how horrible the

00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,890
syntax for this is the notation but you

00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,560
should be able to get the idea of how it

00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:23,840
works so each set has two members what

00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,040
we call a left and a right so this is

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,050
what it looks like this is the template

00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,330
for a surreal number it's a set with two

00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:31,910
spaces in two slots in it into which

00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:35,480
we're going to insert other sets while

00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:36,770
this real numbers so to get things

00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,000
started you have to define the first

00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,710
serial number and this is what it looks

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,080
like it's that's the number zero and

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,520
it's a set with two empty sets inside of

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,140
it so the left part of it is an empty

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,330
set and the right part of it is also an

00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,250
empty set so that's a given that's it

00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,480
and an axiom of the system once you've

00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,630
got that we can make everything else

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,360
work so this is the number one what we

00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:58,190
do is we put in the left-hand slot we

00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,960
put the number 0 which we defined

00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,340
earlier I've marked it in blue there so

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,380
you can see that it's just that same

00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,450
symbol again and the right-hand side is

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,950
just the empty set and make it a little

00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,510
bit more readable we usually write it in

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,390
that way we write the number 0 meaning

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,860
the real number which represents 0 which

00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:16,180
we've already defined that goes in the

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:19,010
left slot and the empty set in the right

00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,390
we also got minus 1 which we do the same

00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,860
thing we put it into the right slot

00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,810
rather than the left slot so here the

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,520
left slot has the empty set in it and

00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:29,210
the right slot has the number 0 which

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,770
looks like that and then this is where

00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,320
you can see how it starts to get hideous

00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:35,270
this is the number two where we take the

00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,890
existing number one and put that into

00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,210
the left slot and we leave the right

00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:39,950
slow to learn so it still has the empty

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,330
set and marked in blue in the middle

00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,240
there you can still see the original

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:45,920
zero so we have a zero and that's used

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,290
to produce one which then is used to

00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,820
produce it too and you would write that

00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:51,710
in that syntax you'd say the number that

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,240
represents one sets that represent one

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,700
going the left slot and the empty set on

00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,620
the right and minus two we do the same

00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,180
thing I left the left set alone and I

00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:02,180
put the number minus one in the

00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:04,919
right-hand set is that all perfectly

00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:06,999
clear haha

00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,059
so you can also use this to produce

00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:11,499
fractions so the fraction here we take

00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:13,209
the number zero put that in the left

00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:15,969
slot and the number one goes in the

00:21:13,209 --> 00:21:17,619
right spot you can produce a quarto by

00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:19,569
taking the half and sticking that in the

00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:21,309
right-hand side and you can produce an

00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,749
eight by taking a quarter and putting

00:21:21,309 --> 00:21:23,979
that in the right hand side and so on

00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:28,179
and you can keep doing that to get

00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:29,769
successive powers of two so if you do

00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:31,690
this forever what you actually produce

00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:33,309
and people who are much smarter than me

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,079
have proved that this is correct you can

00:21:33,309 --> 00:21:36,549
get the entire continuum of real numbers

00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:38,259
so that means all of the numbers that

00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:39,509
we're familiar with the real numbers are

00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:41,259
all going to have a space a

00:21:39,509 --> 00:21:43,209
representation in this real number

00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:44,979
system it might be you know thousands

00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:48,609
and thousands of sets of empty sets but

00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:50,319
it's possible it can be done and this

00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:51,699
real numbers have various interesting

00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,949
properties which is why mathematicians

00:21:51,699 --> 00:21:55,929
are interested in them so for example

00:21:53,949 --> 00:21:57,609
the surreal numbers contains more

00:21:55,929 --> 00:21:59,169
numbers than our actual real number

00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:00,489
system there's some bonus stuff that you

00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:02,109
get for free if you use this system

00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:03,459
there's some numbers that you can

00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:05,259
express as surreal numbers that you

00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:06,669
can't express in any other way and they

00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:09,069
still behave like numbers you can still

00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:10,179
do all the usual mathematical stuff one

00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:12,249
interesting example is you have

00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:14,139
different sizes for the number infinity

00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:15,969
or just have positive infinity you've

00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:17,199
got different sizes of infinity and

00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:19,709
they're all infinite but some of them

00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:23,559
are more infinite than others no

00:22:19,709 --> 00:22:25,569
seriously so this is this is an image

00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:27,759
which should make it all perfectly clear

00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:29,289
to you it's much too tiny to read but

00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,759
this is from the wikipedia article and

00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:32,139
surreal numbers and it shows how you

00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:33,879
start from zero and you keep producing

00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:36,369
more numbers in terms of the numbers

00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:37,719
you've already got and you see down the

00:22:36,369 --> 00:22:39,009
bottom it gets very thick it means we've

00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:42,429
filled out the number like we've got all

00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:45,129
these numbers in that so my stupid idea

00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:48,339
was to implement surreal numbers in

00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:50,949
JavaScript using empty arrays as empty

00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:52,029
sets and as few real numbers as possible

00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:53,759
I want to see how far I could get

00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:55,359
without using any actual real numbers

00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:59,079
just trying to do the whole thing

00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,940
bootstrapping or surreal numbers so

00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:03,429
that's what 0 looks like on the first

00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,729
day conway created 0 and that's how

00:23:03,429 --> 00:23:07,690
array with two empty arrays in it and

00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:09,999
what would this mean if i got this

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,199
working every real number could be

00:23:09,999 --> 00:23:12,789
represented so we wouldn't have the

00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:14,109
limitations of current javascript

00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:15,940
numbers you could go up as high as you

00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:17,549
wanted it go as low as you wanted you

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,659
could get very small numbers

00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:23,039
all the fractions and everything would

00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:24,659
work properly you wouldn't have the

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,230
rounding errors that we saw before when

00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:30,419
we add point 1 to point 2 there's also

00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:33,059
no fear of underutilizing your memory

00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:35,100
your own because these things are arrays

00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:37,320
of a raise if you've got a macbook with

00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,600
eight gig of ram in it you can very

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:43,110
easily exhaust that memory just by using

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,460
fairly small numbers and beyond that

00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,649
there's no need to restart your browser

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,090
periodically surreal numbers will do

00:23:46,649 --> 00:23:50,129
that for you by crashing the browser

00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,509
entirely so if that's what you're

00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:53,999
looking for in a number system this is a

00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:56,519
solution for you so how far did I get

00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:58,259
with this I've got natural numbers in it

00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,389
that was a nice surprise to get that

00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:02,129
working I can now if I have you know

00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:05,009
very very powerful machine I can count

00:24:02,129 --> 00:24:06,659
up to infinity I've got all the integers

00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:09,570
that means i can count down to minus

00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:13,919
infinity that works well are also given

00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:16,320
you know infinite computer power so in

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,549
theory i can go up as high as positive

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,460
infinity but of course it will crash

00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:22,259
long before it gets there I've managed

00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,850
to go from an integer so I can take an a

00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:27,419
you know normal human number and convert

00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,799
that into any surreal number and I can

00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:31,830
go the other way I can get the integer

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,419
version back and I've got the quality

00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,769
working which I'm quite pleased about so

00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:37,529
i can say where the true surreal numbers

00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:38,789
are equal I've also got the comparisons

00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:40,529
working so i can say where the two

00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:42,509
numbers are less than or less than or

00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:43,769
equal to or greater than or greater than

00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:46,859
or equal to that all worked really

00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:48,450
nicely so some of the code I was

00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:50,039
surprised by how beautiful this turned

00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,600
out to be you probably can't read that

00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:54,090
especially well there but what I've got

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,529
is the is equal to i define that by

00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,779
saying a number is equal to another

00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:59,759
number if it's both less than or equal

00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:01,289
to the other number and greater than or

00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:02,999
equal to the other number if both of

00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:04,590
those conditions are true if it's both

00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:06,450
less than or equal to and greater than

00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,789
or equal to I know it must actually be

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:11,879
equal to so the test for equality is

00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:13,830
just that one single single statement in

00:25:11,879 --> 00:25:15,570
that single function now so that was a

00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,460
nice surprise and the rest of the

00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:20,249
comparisons are really nice as well I've

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:24,119
got is less than is defined by saying

00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:25,350
it's not greater than or equal to I to

00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:27,269
work out if something is greater than or

00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:29,039
equal to I just work out if it's the

00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:31,140
other way holds that the other number is

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,820
less than or equal to this number

00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,500
is greater than it's just the same as

00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,050
the first case I say if it's not less

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,670
than or equal to so that's all really

00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:40,380
nice that's very short amount of code

00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,090
you'll see though that I've only got

00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,380
three of the comparisons in here and you

00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,910
know that there are four and the reason

00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,890
I've put this on a separate slide this

00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,020
is my beautiful code this is my

00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,640
nightmare code so to make all of this

00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,410
work all the other ones I could define

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,140
in terms of this one this one actually

00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:57,720
had to do some work to make it happen

00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:00,630
and there's a whole bunch of code in

00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,970
there I'm not proud of that stuff it

00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:04,530
could probably be improved but it gets

00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,340
crazy to work out which side of zero

00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:09,720
you're on and how large numbers are so

00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,710
if I'd known that was coming I wouldn't

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,830
have bothered with this and you wouldn't

00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:15,180
be hearing from me today so the things

00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,650
i'd like to do i haven't learned my

00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,150
lesson from this i'm still doing this i

00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,200
think the frustration i have is because

00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,670
i'm teaching at the moment i'm not

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,340
actually making anything new so i'm just

00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,900
looking for random problems to solve i'd

00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,860
like to get fractions working there in

00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,240
the book but i haven't actually

00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,130
implemented them yet because that's

00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,800
going to mess up all my existing courage

00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:33,660
i also have no arithmetic so i can't

00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,860
actually add or multiply or divide any

00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,510
of these numbers yet i can just make

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:39,510
them exist and count with them but

00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:42,300
that's all so you can see this code for

00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:44,160
yourself i put it up on github my

00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,780
username on github is called head and

00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,700
it's surreal jeaious there's no fancy

00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:50,790
test suites or anything like that it's

00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,230
just my file with 170 lines of code that

00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,880
implements the serial numbers but what I

00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,920
would argue is that it's better to do

00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,150
this stuff yourself you don't I don't

00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,530
think I'd make this library because

00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:00,960
somebody be like oh that's good i need

00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:04,350
an implementation of surreal numbers to

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,120
do maths in javascript it's more that it

00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:08,250
was highly educational when a lot of fun

00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,420
to do and i would urge you to go and

00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:11,670
have a look at this book it's freely

00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,870
available in various PDF forms you can

00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,430
go and read it and have a cracker

00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,810
implementing it or even just pushing

00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:20,010
these things around on pen and paper is

00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:21,330
that it's fine so I've got also here a

00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:22,950
short list of books if you're interested

00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,940
in any of this this is the things i

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,820
would suggest you read if you're

00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,170
interested in this topic douglas

00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,690
hofstadter wrote a couple of books in

00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:32,520
the 70s as godel escher bach and eternal

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,070
golden braid which is about number

00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,510
theory and formal systems and where the

00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:38,460
computers will ever be able to think

00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:40,110
that kind of thing and he also has a

00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:43,830
series of essays called meta magical

00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:44,980
famous rudy rocker is a computer

00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,200
scientist and mathematician

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,460
titian who also took a lot of drugs and

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,200
also wrote a lot of fiction I

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,360
particularly recommend his where

00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,480
tetralogy which is software wetware

00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,820
freeware and real where which deals with

00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,919
artificial intelligence and robot rights

00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:02,559
and things like that but also the hot

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:07,299
topic of human robot sex which I know a

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:08,770
lot more about now and as an actual

00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:10,390
professor he's written a couple of

00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,830
series books so there's book called mind

00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,570
tools which is about the fundamentals of

00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,190
mathematics and how it works and another

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,990
book called infinity and the mind which

00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:21,370
is about well just what it says really I

00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,740
also really liked David Foster Wallace's

00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:25,480
recent book everything and more concise

00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:26,860
history of infinity so these are all pop

00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,390
books they're not for mathematicians of

00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,549
people like us who have some interest in

00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:32,710
these things everything and more is just

00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:35,790
a history of how mathematicians and

00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:38,410
magicians have grappled with infinity

00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:40,000
I'm also recommending alice in

00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:42,160
wonderland with this cute quote from

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,049
Alan Perlis the best book on programming

00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,760
for the layman is Alice in Wonderland

00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:47,679
but that's because it's the best book on

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,880
anything for the layman and if you don't

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,230
agree with that that just means you

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,940
haven't read it enough time so you

00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:55,990
should go and give that another shot so

00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,330
what I learned about math so i'll just

00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,520
quickly sum up with we're actually what

00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:02,350
I took away from all of this making math

00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,970
work is actually really hard you think

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:05,080
that's easy children can count I'll be

00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,610
able to do this for sure I've got a

00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,049
textbook to help me and it's not like

00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:11,440
that it actually turns out to be much

00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:12,580
trickier than I expected especially if

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,809
you have to build your own numbers so if

00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,950
you're not using any of javascripts

00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:17,200
numbers behind the scenes if you're

00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,270
doing all yourself you appreciate how

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,040
much is going on that when you get it to

00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,630
work it is incredibly satisfying when

00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,220
you create a giant number you've got an

00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:26,020
integer and you say give me the serial

00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:27,549
number version of this and then you say

00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,750
what's the real number but the integer

00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:30,669
version of this and get it back the

00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,679
other way that is satisfying in a way I

00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:34,330
wasn't expecting particularly as it's

00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:35,799
not actually useful it was just like

00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:38,710
I've got this hard problem to solve and

00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:40,210
then I fixed it but what I especially

00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,910
have realized is you can't take your

00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:45,130
number implementation for granted so if

00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,960
maths works in your programming language

00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,220
that's really a big deal people have put

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,530
some hard work in there to make that

00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:53,260
happen for you so if something works you

00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:55,480
should hug an implementer and we have

00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,340
Dave here if anyone wants hugs later and

00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,370
how it feels about that but you can

00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:03,340
negotiate that with him

00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:05,080
what I learned about programming these

00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,220
particular problems this is this is new

00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:08,080
stuff for me I hadn't solved this

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,850
particular problem for before and this

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,470
involved an incredible amount of staring

00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,180
into the distance lots of walks around

00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,230
the harbor just thinking about how the

00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,150
hell I'm going to get the next bit

00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,120
working and it didn't look like I was

00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:20,590
working but I was working really hard

00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,240
the old fashioned pen and paper approach

00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,600
goes a long way with these kinds of

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,190
things where possible it's good to get

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,070
anger scroll from Twitter to review your

00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,900
code he's available on Twitter and I

00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:35,080
don't know just asking just send him

00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:40,090
your your reviews maybe we'll do it he

00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:43,240
did it for me and finally what I learned

00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:44,470
about the big stuff it's good to break

00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,390
your habits and get out of your comfort

00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,740
zone so as web developers were used to

00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:50,620
doing web stuff and we tend to see

00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,450
everything in in terms of you know Dom

00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,190
manipulations or if we're not developers

00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,720
we think about streams all the time it's

00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,730
good to just do something that isn't of

00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,860
useful used to your isn't necessarily

00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,890
part of your daily life just as mental

00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,330
exercise and it's you know people say

00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:06,340
don't reinvent the wheel you can

00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:07,660
reinvent the wheel you can make stranger

00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,070
wheels you can make wheels that don't

00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:10,600
work as well as the existing wheel the

00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,860
existing wheel is pretty good but you

00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,720
can learn some interesting stuff by

00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:17,470
making bizarre new kind of alien wheels

00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,360
that nobody needs but also I got this

00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:20,830
nice sense that wonders never cease so

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,480
the more I've looked into the theory of

00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:23,950
mathematics and how it all works the

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,350
more surprised and kind of delighted I

00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:28,510
am there's all this magical stuff that

00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:30,190
exists somewhere I don't know how it

00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:32,350
works and all these strange properties

00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,020
arise from like surreal numbers or

00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:37,210
whatever else you want to look into um

00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:38,710
but overall I would argue for making

00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:40,300
beautiful and useless things just as

00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,860
something to do it's immensely

00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,940
satisfying it might not help you get a

00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:47,230
job but you know do it for yourself and

00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:48,550
that's all I've got I won't be taking

00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:51,660
questions because I don't know the

00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,660
answers but thank you very much

00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,460
if we can put our hands together patrol

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,200
again also i have a round of applause to

00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,650
Harvey Birdman who was pivotal in that

00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,650
