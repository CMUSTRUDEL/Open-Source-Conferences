today it's not something that comes up

00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,450
that often at conferences but I have

00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,369
heard a few mentioned so far at least

00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,529
yesterday at CSS cops which got me

00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:21,500
pretty excited to hear people talking

00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:22,939
about accessibility so just a show of

00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,470
hands how many people are familiar with

00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:29,779
shadow Dom quite a few cool that's

00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:33,860
awesome so we're going to start with a

00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:35,360
story so imagine that you are working at

00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,850
a company that's a little behind the

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,860
times they're losing engineers because

00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,989
the people are pretty cool but the work

00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,270
is really boring it's really stale you

00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:46,370
don't get to do anything modern it's

00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:50,480
like you're supporting ie7 and it kind

00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:52,370
of sucks but you are in a really good

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,769
position at this company and they have

00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:58,160
trusted you to pick the technology for a

00:00:54,769 --> 00:01:00,350
new project they've said it can be super

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:07,310
modern you don't have to support IE 7 or

00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:09,500
I ate or ie9 so that's awesome they've

00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,200
given you this trust and you get to pick

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,670
something you start thinking man like

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,220
everyone's been talking there's so many

00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:18,500
cool things out there right now and you

00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,360
think web components I've heard of that

00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,250
that might be pretty cool to work into a

00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,560
project because you know we're only

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,210
supporting the most evergreen of

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,030
browsers which means that they update

00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,770
themselves and we can use a polyfill and

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,130
that sounds awesome I think I'm going to

00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:36,710
do that so you get to work on this

00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,500
project it's like the best project ever

00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:42,560
you get to your cool workstation finally

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:45,320
the quality of the work aligns with the

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,329
kind of work that you want to do and the

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,149
kind of work at a company that you want

00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:51,740
to work at so do you go to your job

00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:55,040
every day and you work on this amazing

00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:58,539
project super cool a couple months goes

00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,189
by and you need to present this project

00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:04,360
so a couple things about this company

00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:06,770
they hire people with disabilities and

00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,410
you have a really awesome project

00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:12,500
manager who is blind and she uses

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,270
microsoft project along with jaws which

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,750
is a screen reader it actually stands

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,120
for job access

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,760
speech actually didn't know what that

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,070
stood for but she can do her job

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,800
effectively if she is supported by the

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:29,430
technology that she needs so she'll be

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,370
in the audience also your CEO can't use

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,230
a mouse so you have some requirements in

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,290
your audience for this internal project

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,760
you've chosen technology that you're not

00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,400
really sure if it's going to work for

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,950
them so when you go to present it are

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,360
you going to be a hero or are you going

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,010
to be sent back to the drawing board

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,860
because you didn't consider your

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:54,300
audience so we'll have to find out so

00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,470
before we answer that question we're

00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,480
going to do some accessibility

00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,390
background just refresh our memories of

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,209
what accessibility is about how you can

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,770
make your projects more accessible we're

00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:06,780
going to talk about what is the big deal

00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,340
with web components everybody's been

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,170
talking about them sounds like most of

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,930
us have heard of it but we'll talk about

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,150
what that is specifically we're going to

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,430
talk about shadow Dom which is one part

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,480
of web components and then we're going

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,660
to talk about the accessibility

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,220
situation of web components and then

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:28,140
we'll answer that question about if

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:30,510
you're a hero or zero so when you're

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,940
creating things that are accessible or

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:35,459
any projects actually who are you

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,470
building it for I think sometimes we

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,290
forget that everybody has different

00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,180
ability and it seems like some people

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,570
aren't actually building projects for

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,450
people which I find pretty peculiar so I

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:50,190
just want to remind us all that we're

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,930
building things for people and we all

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,220
have different abilities so it's

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:58,019
important to keep that in mind in

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,959
accessibility there are some traditional

00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,720
groups of people that we talk about and

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,299
that includes blind and low-vision

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,430
there's people who they can see but

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:09,780
maybe they can't see very far and they

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,870
look at their phone really close to

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,780
their face all different kinds of visual

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,220
impairments deaf or hard of hearing so

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,660
if you have video you need to provide

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,789
captions physical disabilities there's a

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,010
huge range of those as well color

00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:29,180
blindness which affects a lot of people

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,710
and then cognitive impairments

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,680
which are a little more challenging but

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,599
if you can make the copy in your project

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,370
read a little more understandably you

00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:40,319
kind of cut down on the marketing speak

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,879
you can make something more

00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,960
understandable to someone with a

00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:49,530
cognitive impairment but really that

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,449
includes everybody so maybe you broke

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:55,259
your arm and you can't use a mouse for a

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:57,180
temporary period or maybe you had LASIK

00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,009
eye surgery and you can't see for a

00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,539
little while like we have these

00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:02,069
different abilities that come and go

00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:03,930
some people have to live with them

00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:06,319
forever so it's important to remember

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:13,259
that not everybody can use a mouse or

00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:16,169
see the screen so I wanted to find a

00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:19,470
persona that we could focus on a little

00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:21,599
bit and I remember that Stevie Wonder's

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,310
blind maybe I could find a picture of

00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:26,009
Stevie Wonder so I went and looked for

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,830
one and i found this which is a picture

00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:31,590
of a goat his name is actually Stevie

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,389
Wonder because he's a blind goat so I

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:37,130
went alright I like goats I'm gonna go

00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:40,020
with that what a pic Stevie Wonder and

00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,539
we're going to look at this graph I have

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:45,120
up on the screen that describes the

00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,979
assistive technology process and there

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,990
are multiple assistive technologies but

00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:52,139
the one we most commonly talked about is

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:54,690
a screen reader so in this diagram we're

00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,940
seeing Stevie Wonder he interacts with a

00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,069
web browser or in the case of our

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,190
project manager Microsoft Project so

00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:04,949
some software application that software

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:06,900
application then interacts with another

00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,029
application which is a screen reader in

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,360
this case and they talk back and forth

00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:15,180
via and accessibility API and there are

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,270
multiple api's but there are some tricks

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:22,080
we can do to make that expanse fur of

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:24,719
data more understandable so this graph

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,490
is just indicating to you that there's

00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:30,750
some interaction between the web browser

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:32,610
and the assistive technology so that was

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:35,460
the goal of this but Phoebe wonder

00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,839
relies on his screen reader to tell him

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:42,680
what's on the screen because he can't

00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:44,509
see it so in an ideal world

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,600
we should have everything work from the

00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:50,180
keyboard have you ever navigated a

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,220
website without a mouse and you gave up

00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,320
and started using the mouse because you

00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,820
could you tried using the keyboard

00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,560
you're having through you don't know

00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,710
where you are maybe you got trapped

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,810
somewhere you gave up because you could

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:06,740
but what if you couldn't use a mouse at

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,030
all part of what makes this better that

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,400
we should do this is some low-hanging

00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:13,070
fruit stuff that just applies to any

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,470
website that you build is that we should

00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,780
provide good visual feedback it's really

00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,880
helpful for everybody if you along with

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:23,210
the hover state you define a focus state

00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:26,960
pretty easy right another thing you

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,849
consider is a logical tab order if you

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,740
tab through a web page what is the order

00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:32,960
of elements that you see as you focus

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,509
throughout the screen it should go in a

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,940
linear fashion just no matter what your

00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:42,080
layout looks like it should be logical

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:43,820
it shouldn't jump all over the place so

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,860
keyboard navigation is pretty important

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,479
if you have stuff hidden away in a mega

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,159
menu you should be able to get there

00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:50,840
from the keyboard you shouldn't prevent

00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:55,580
people who can't use a mouse from

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:58,460
navigating your website so with screen

00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,460
reader access meaningful page structure

00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,229
is really important so you want to

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:07,130
consider the outline of your document

00:08:03,229 --> 00:08:09,500
not just the way it looks you should pay

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,770
attention to semantics you should use

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,720
headings you should think about what is

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,690
this document what am I trying to convey

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,820
and what is the best HTML that I could

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,430
use to communicate what is on the screen

00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,710
right now you should have relevant non

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,840
visual content so if you have images you

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,360
need to explain what they are especially

00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,849
in the case where we used to embed text

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,110
into images we have to provide that text

00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:37,909
off-screen somehow you have to make it

00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,409
usable without seeing basically it's

00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:41,750
pretty important if you can't see the

00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:45,680
screen you should know what's on it but

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:47,180
we forget that sometimes some general

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,209
accessibility things that we should

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,209
remember color contrast that's a huge

00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:55,610
population of people who can't see some

00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,490
of your texts because it doesn't stand

00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,800
out enough over

00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,779
the background on this slide actually I

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,260
had some great X where it says in an

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:06,060
ideal world and i figured that probably

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,910
wouldn't be readable because of this

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,230
monitor so i changed it and that's

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,300
something that we should consider is

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:16,589
your text going to be readable based on

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:18,450
you the colors that you've chosen we

00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:21,120
should make experiences interactive and

00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:23,100
accessible so just because you're making

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,649
it accessible doesn't mean it has to be

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,959
text only and boring you can script it

00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:31,170
so that it's interactive using the

00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:36,209
keyboard it's really important that we

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:39,240
consider the user experience SEO and

00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:41,640
accessibility are bffs I like to think

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,800
of that it's a good way to sell

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,800
accessibility actually if you can say

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,270
that there's more than the small niche

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,730
audience that you're considering

00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:53,370
actually google bot is the world's

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,500
largest blind user because google bot

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:57,930
can't see the screen it also needs

00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,480
relevant text content so that's a win if

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:05,300
you can make your content work for as

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:08,160
many people as possible and Googlebot

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,200
mobile accessibility is a thing that we

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,270
have to think about we should make our

00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,700
websites work from a screen reader on a

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,320
phone it's kind of a no-brainer now that

00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:19,140
I realized that but at one point I

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,790
actually thought oh that won't matter we

00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,910
don't need to make our mobile web pages

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:25,380
accessible you should because you have a

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:29,790
screen reader in your pocket all the

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:31,770
time it's pretty useful and then lastly

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,600
for general accessibility software

00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,420
testing is really useful for this so

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,520
what if when you're creating a project

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,140
you could check whether you're about to

00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,690
deploy code that would fail an

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,850
accessibility test that might be kind of

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:47,970
useful if you can lit for accessibility

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:51,930
and then on the flip side of that there

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:53,880
are methods of software testing that

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,459
ride on the coattails of accessibility

00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,350
so I know an iOS development and windows

00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:01,380
development sometimes you can get

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:05,100
testing to work by way of accessibility

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:08,579
api's so it's pretty awesome if you can

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:11,990
make accessibility a win for multiple

00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,990
groups and multiple purposes

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:17,990
so checking in on our project how's it

00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:20,430
going we've been working for a while

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:23,820
we've got this cool prototype we're

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:26,640
presenting just want to keep in mind

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:29,310
that we have an audience that might have

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,900
different needs than our own so projects

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,700
still going really well but we don't

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,550
quite know yet whether they're going to

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:40,560
be able to access it so we'll come back

00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:42,030
to that so web components there are set

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,520
of new standards we're super excited

00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:47,510
about them there's multiple parts to

00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:51,360
this new standard moving through the w3c

00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:54,090
HTML imports templates which we're going

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,270
to look at a little bit today decorators

00:11:54,090 --> 00:12:00,090
I don't really use those yet but custom

00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:03,330
elements and shadow Dom are super

00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:04,860
important for creating web components

00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:09,390
and we're going to look at those today

00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:11,460
as well so why are we excited about web

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:15,210
components it's a new approach to

00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:17,670
building HTML and web pages that I think

00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:20,730
we we are just super excited to try

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:24,540
something different we aren't waiting on

00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,830
browser implementers so the html5 stuff

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,600
came around and it was really cool

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,060
because we have these new range inputs

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,950
and we have new elements that we can use

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:34,500
that we don't have to go and script

00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,360
everything with JavaScript so we aren't

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,430
waiting for browser implementers anymore

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,420
because we can create our own widgets

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:44,640
that have that same native effect as

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,070
these new elements they get rolled out

00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,440
every so often not having to wait on a

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:54,210
browser for that to be to be able to

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,920
create your own it's pretty exciting web

00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,590
components provide a way to minimize

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,970
conflicts and the way that I explain web

00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,890
components to people who aren't familiar

00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,890
at all is that it's kind of like an

00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:07,680
iframe and that you are creating a

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:10,970
sandbox for your your javascript in your

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:13,130
CSS so that it is encapsulated and it's

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,230
separated from the rest of the document

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:19,950
so encapsulation to me is the biggest

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:21,660
win in web components and that's kind of

00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,050
getting into where my questions about

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,720
accessibility came in

00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:30,310
which was all right we can create the

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:32,440
sandbox so that you know CSS can't go in

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,660
or out depending on what styles you're

00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,970
defining but what happens to a screen

00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:39,100
reader and that's really where I started

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,990
wondering what is the going on here with

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,459
web components so I started digging in a

00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,750
lot more and it became really

00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:48,640
interesting so diving into the shadow

00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:51,940
Dom specifically which is one part of

00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:54,100
that spec the shadow Dom encapsulate say

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,100
dom subtree and we're going to talk a

00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,260
little bit about what a subtree is it

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:03,190
has this idea of implementation versus

00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:05,529
interface meaning that you can implement

00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,120
a single tag but there's this whole

00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:09,640
interface behind that that you didn't

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,950
have to implement which is pretty

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,230
awesome like in the case of the the

00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,360
range input it has multiple parts to it

00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:20,560
but all you're putting in your HTML is

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,680
one input tag shadow DOM is not a

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:28,779
shadowy underworld organization which it

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,490
has pretty creepy name so this interface

00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:32,680
versus implementation a good example

00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:36,070
that we actually see and use on the web

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:39,070
it's a video tag and we can see here we

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,589
have a screenshot of a there's a video i

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,750
just found last night actually of a goat

00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,959
named gary and he was accused of eating

00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:50,350
flowers outside a museum in sydney and

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:53,290
so we're looking at a screen capture of

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,959
the video with the controls and then i

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:58,779
have the devtools open and in the latest

00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:00,720
chrome you can turn on this flag to show

00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:03,790
shadow Dom you're probably aware of it

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,220
once you've enabled that you see how

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:09,130
widespread shadow Dom usage is on the

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,620
web it's on text areas it's on form

00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,140
inputs any time that we have this

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,720
element that we can drop in just an

00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,310
implementation it has all of these other

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,130
things that it comes with that we didn't

00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:23,110
have to build we didn't have to create

00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,209
the inputs for these play and pause

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:29,170
buttons over the range for the volume

00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:30,730
slider but it comes prepackaged and it's

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,130
all wired up and we can use it and

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,150
that's awesome so the whole idea with

00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,610
web components

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:41,290
that we could create our own versions of

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:45,310
this which is super cool so some

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:47,980
important terms the document object

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:50,560
model I mean we've all used the document

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,840
object model but what is it really it's

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,250
a it's an object-oriented tree

00:15:52,840 --> 00:16:01,000
representation of an HTML document so

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:05,710
each component of that tree is a node

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,630
nodes can be groups nested groups and

00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:12,550
when they are they become no trees or

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:16,090
sub trees so getting into the shadow Dom

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:18,310
specific stuff a shadow host is the

00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:23,320
element that hosts one or more shadow

00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:25,750
Dom trees so you have basically your

00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,340
your video tag that's a host for a

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:32,230
shadow DOM and you can have multiple

00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:34,810
trees that you shove in there this idea

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:37,270
of encapsulation in web components in

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:39,970
shadow Dom this specific term for it is

00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:42,820
the shadow boundary and that is the the

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:44,950
line where scripts and styles don't

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,290
cross there are some exceptions and

00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,940
there are some back doors but for the

00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,880
most part that's the whole idea is that

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:54,310
if you define an h1 in your web

00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,620
component it won't affect the style of

00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,420
an h1 outside of the web component which

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,490
is pretty awesome because if you're

00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:02,620
working alongside somebody and they've

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:05,050
written some really general CSS and it

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,600
screws you up well wouldn't it be nice

00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,430
if you could both be as general as you

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:15,670
want your CSS but you don't run into

00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:18,310
conflicts so a shadow tree is the actual

00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:22,540
sub tree that gets inserted into the

00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:25,089
shadow host and then finally the shadow

00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:28,560
root is the root node of a shadow dom

00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:31,120
subtree and this was all stuff that i

00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,950
kind of knew and i read a little bit

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,220
about these terms but the more I really

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,390
dug into what's happening here these

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,610
things kept coming up so it was

00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,790
important at least for me to understand

00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:44,830
what is the Dom you know what are these

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:46,350
node trees and actually they come up a

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:50,309
lot not just in HTM

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:52,770
all so a little more about trees they

00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:55,380
resembled nature this graphic is from a

00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:58,020
book on scheme which i think is really

00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,110
interesting so we have a root node we

00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,720
have branches that come off of the tree

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:05,280
they have nested node groups there's

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,910
nothing here indicating a shadow

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,650
boundary or a shadow tree but it's a

00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:15,690
data structure that we're pretty

00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:22,289
familiar with already so we're going to

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:25,860
look at some shadow Dom so I have this

00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:28,559
really simple document and it has a

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,830
couple of headings it has a paragraph

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,809
and image and a link in it so I'm just

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:35,850
going to look at the source and see what

00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,980
like what does this look like it looks

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,940
like a normal document there's no

00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,289
outline there's no indicator that

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,890
anything other than a regular document

00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:51,809
is happening here so if we look at our

00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:54,419
HTML source we can see that it's just

00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:57,240
some pretty normal code we have a

00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,490
template tag that's one of those new

00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,460
items in this in the shadow or web

00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:05,250
components spec and inside of it we are

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:08,400
defining some style we have a heading a

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,860
paragraph inside of the paragraph we

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,710
have another template type tag that the

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,559
content and it has content inside of it

00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:19,320
that says meat popsicle that's a little

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,720
weird we don't see meat popsicle on the

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:25,100
rendered webpage so what's happening

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,480
there so keep going we have the image

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:31,350
and then down here at the bottom we have

00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,870
a custom tag called goat stuff pretty

00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,750
sure there is not a goat stuff tagged

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:39,059
already the only requirement with web

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,429
components and custom elements is that

00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:43,289
you add a hyphen in the middle so the

00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:46,140
word before the hyphen is effectively a

00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:50,909
namespace so I'm calling the goat

00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:53,789
namespace just to hand so what's going

00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:56,580
on here is that we have one word in our

00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:57,330
shadow host the goat stuff tagged as our

00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,190
shadow host

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,800
we have a template that has a bunch of

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:04,890
stuff in it that we're going to grab and

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,330
then insert into our custom tag but one

00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,450
thing we haven't really figured out is

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:13,830
what is this meat popsicle business so

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:17,370
if I go back to our demo we can see it

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:21,470
says I'm a goat it's got the image so if

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:21,470
I go and look at it in the dev tools

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:30,150
like this a little bigger okay so this

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,790
is a little different representation

00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:35,520
because this is after javascript has run

00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:38,250
so this is after your HTML has been

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,210
affected by JavaScript and CSS it's a

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:44,010
different representation of your webpage

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:47,190
so we drill into this goat stuff tagged

00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:50,840
we can see we've got a shadow root we've

00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:53,910
got some style we've got a paragraph tag

00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,250
it's the same stuff we've got this

00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:58,170
content it still says meat popsicle but

00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,720
I'm not seeing that I'm seeing in the

00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:02,370
ghost stuff tagged we have goat so

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,350
what's happening here is that goat is

00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:06,330
being projected into the content tagged

00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:10,170
and that is what gets rendered to you

00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:11,910
even though after rendering we're still

00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,590
seeing meat popsicle in the dev tools

00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,300
but that doesn't ever get rendered to

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,760
the screen so that's one of the really

00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:21,630
to me one of the strangest parts about

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,860
shadow Dom but I am still curious what's

00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:33,360
going to happen at a screen reader

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:36,510
they're not quite sure yet so to get

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:39,000
that shadow Dom stuff to work polymer is

00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:41,640
a really awesome polyfill and they have

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,590
a set of components that you can use but

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,350
before I got into that I wanted to build

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,510
it myself I wanted to know exactly what

00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,610
goes into this I want to learn it really

00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,830
well before I go and add a bunch of

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,510
tools that somebody else has made so in

00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:58,170
the latest chrome I could create a

00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:59,940
little bit of JavaScript I'm going and

00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:03,960
grabbing the contents out of a template

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:07,230
tag I'm creating a new element so you

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,720
extend a basic HTML element which we're

00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,170
seeing here with object.create and then

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,860
we're copying the prototype

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:17,350
just from a very generic HTML element

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,850
when that element gets created which

00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:21,370
we've registered down here on the bottom

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:24,670
we register the goat stuff element and

00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:27,760
then we set its prototype to be this

00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:29,560
goat component when that gets created it

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,690
has a callback function and that's when

00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,880
you can start doing stuff to it that's

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,400
when you can change the content that's

00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,290
when you can enable some of these back

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,470
doors for your scripts you can find

00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:44,740
events and polymer does a really great

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:47,320
job of abstract amiss away but and I'm

00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:49,180
finally ready to move to that now but it

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:55,150
was really useful to go through and see

00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:56,530
what is happening so about that boundary

00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,480
I mentioned there are some back doors

00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,520
and this stuff still trips me up a

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,030
little bit I think it's really odd so

00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,700
when you create your CSS for your main

00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,980
document tree if you define a font on

00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,110
your body tag you would think that the

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:13,780
shadow Dom would be encapsulated so that

00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:16,750
it would not get the same font face but

00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,940
it does that's one of the few styles

00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,250
that actually goes past the boundary so

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,470
it's a little unexpected but there is

00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,720
this JavaScript property that you can

00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:28,360
set called reset style inheritance and

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,540
that will wipe out any of those cascades

00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:34,570
that go through the boundary there's

00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:37,360
also apply author styles which allows

00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:40,240
your parent stylesheet to go into the

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,300
shadow Dom so you as the document

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:45,790
creator have that control you can say do

00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:48,610
I want the styles to go in or not if I'm

00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:51,340
implementing some widget that some

00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,840
third-party developer created I want to

00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,310
be able to override their styles but I

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,250
don't want them to be able to override

00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:59,800
mine so you have this control as the

00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:04,900
parent document owner and these are the

00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:07,360
the tools that you can use for that so

00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:10,240
going back to the trees and looking at

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,950
if we have a shadow host and this image

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,080
comes right out of the shadow Dom spec

00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:18,250
which I've had open in my browser for

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,520
six months so we have a shadow host and

00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:22,980
this image is describing that it has

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,340
children in it

00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:29,470
which actually get replaced by a shadow

00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,970
Dom which we're showing here on the

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:33,250
right side of the graphic there's a

00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,620
shadow boundary so that's indicating the

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:38,169
encapsulation and then we have the

00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:41,890
shadow root which is the parent node of

00:24:38,169 --> 00:24:44,890
a bunch of children and the shadow Dom

00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:50,710
spec is actually really awesome as far

00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:51,789
as specs go so we looked at our demo but

00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:53,919
we didn't answer whether it was

00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:55,900
accessible or not it looks okay it

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,299
looked like a normal document so we're

00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,250
going to go back to that demo and I'm

00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:04,150
just going to start tabbing through I

00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:06,669
could tab on to the link that's cool 37

00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:09,940
voiceover basic demo shadow Dom

00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:12,940
accessibility window basic demo heading

00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:15,010
level 1 shadow dumb down low we gotta we

00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,659
gotta heading heading level two main

00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,190
document that's still the main document

00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:21,130
so now I'm going to go into the shadow

00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:23,080
Dom heading level two goats stuff all

00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:26,740
right we went over the boundary it read

00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:30,010
it iono coat I'm a goat fancy goat image

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:33,909
goat simulator gameplay hands-on no joke

00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:36,059
all goat visited link voiceover off so

00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:40,000
that's awesome we went into the boundary

00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:44,110
cool so that kind of like all right it's

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,440
accessible and it worked but why did

00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,440
that work

00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:55,830
what what why did that work and that's

00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:57,630
what I wanted to know so a little bit

00:25:55,830 --> 00:26:00,870
about web browsers and screen readers

00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:03,450
and how they work the difference between

00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:06,510
our view source and our rendered markup

00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:08,730
was that the web browser takes your HTML

00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:12,299
it creates objects from the markup

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:14,640
that's what the DOM is the Dom has been

00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:16,760
altered by your CSS your JavaScript and

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,200
Aria or accessible rich Internet

00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:22,049
applications if you use any roles or

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,500
states or properties those affect the

00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:28,950
tree that gets created web components

00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:32,460
also create a sub tree so that is added

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:34,980
to the larger tree the screen reader

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:39,659
uses the objects in the render Dom so it

00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:41,520
gets one big tree and that is called an

00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:43,559
accessibility tree and that is what is

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,559
presented to the screen reader user or a

00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:48,419
screen magnifier I thought that was

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,110
really interesting it was pretty key to

00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:55,320
what made shadow Dom work so how do you

00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:57,330
make accessible web components you write

00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,179
accessible code it's pretty simple but

00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,890
we forget that stuff sometimes and if

00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:09,960
you don't you might get knocked by this

00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:11,429
goat like this newscaster lady boom okay

00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,610
so how do you write accessible code

00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:18,029
little recap you use native and semantic

00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:19,799
HTML so use headings inside of your web

00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:22,500
components use native and semantic HTML

00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:24,899
if you have a button make it a button

00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,059
don't make it a div like just try to use

00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:30,390
the HTML the way it was intended and

00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:33,960
you'll have a lot better time you want

00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:37,380
to make readable text content you want

00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:40,289
to provide visual feedback you need to

00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,090
use focus management and use JavaScript

00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:45,390
events to send the user around your

00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:48,600
experience and then finally you can use

00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:49,950
Aria to fill in gaps where HTML doesn't

00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,320
quite meet your needs but you should

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:56,870
have exhausted all upward all avenues

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:58,649
with native HTML first so one last look

00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:00,300
and I'm actually going to use a

00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:03,960
different screen reader this time

00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:06,420
news MV da which is on Windows and i'm

00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,310
going to use virtualbox for that and one

00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:10,440
quick note I was going to use jaws but I

00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,420
had trouble getting it installed on this

00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,030
machine but if you're going to test for

00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:18,030
accessibility you can actually use the

00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:21,840
demo version of Jaws 445 or 40 minutes

00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:24,540
at a time just a side note explode but

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,070
MV da is a free one so I'm going to

00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:29,760
hover over things and it'll read it

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:31,230
explosions explosions and a little

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,390
background of this component actually

00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:35,970
was I was thinking if I'm going to make

00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:38,640
an encapsulated component what would be

00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,350
useful and I thought that a single

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,980
button that was kind of like a nuclear

00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:45,810
detonator that you could engage and then

00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:48,030
have it expose another kind of a button

00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,770
that would be kind of cool but I didn't

00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:53,220
know how I would create that so I made a

00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:55,440
little it has a certain part of it you

00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,330
have to slide to engage it it exposes

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,050
another button and then explosions will

00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:03,390
happen one hut are you sure are you sure

00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:07,380
you want to engage it choose a

00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:10,980
percentage between 0 and 100 0 % all

00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:14,880
right I'm gonna do it yes really yes are

00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,770
you sure are we sure yes really all

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:22,620
right really we're really sure main

00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:24,720
landmark yes goats on metal jib so what

00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,630
happened there with it it was reading

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,730
out the parts of the component so the

00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,350
encapsulated parts get read aloud just

00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:33,840
fine and that's because you get

00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,580
presented with one big tree and I

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,340
thought that was really cool I learned a

00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:41,040
lot about how screen readers work I

00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:43,020
learned how browsers work and it really

00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,820
transcended just something about

00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:52,760
accessibility I thought that was pretty

00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:52,760
awesome get me out of here Rob Firefox

00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,470
alright so one little note about support

00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,810
polymer has this great matrix up on

00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:03,660
their website to show you and i just

00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:06,720
added their polyfill to extend support

00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:12,180
beyond just chrome and firefox but I eat

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:14,220
n is as far back as you can go so just a

00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,409
quick recap we want to develop

00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,880
the ideal we want to develop for people

00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:21,179
because why else are you doing it

00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:25,140
otherwise web components provide

00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:27,270
encapsulation shadow DOM is accessible

00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:30,350
and it's accessible because screen

00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:32,100
readers utilize the Dom as rendered and

00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:36,030
finally you want to pick the right

00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:38,700
technology for your audience so how'd

00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:40,440
you do on your project well your

00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:42,750
executives came in and your project

00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,640
manager and who couldn't see the screen

00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:47,039
and they demoed your project just fine

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,980
because web components are accessible so

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,980
