hello thank you so much for having me so

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,200
CSS is really really powerful tool you

00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,210
can use it for art now you can use it to

00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,910
do pixel manipulation here is an example

00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:31,070
of a code pen where I'm generating these

00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,320
random polka dots with the help of sass

00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,059
random function every time you refresh

00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,460
you get a sort of different aesthetic

00:00:35,059 --> 00:00:38,690
which is nice generative art you can do

00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,520
things like this where you're just

00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,140
playing with images applying different

00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,449
filters and blend modes kind of like

00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:47,420
lomography just seeing how creative you

00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:50,180
can get it's a really nice outlet you

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,730
can even create infrared effects so

00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,590
faking this infrared camera effect you

00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,660
don't need special equipment or tools or

00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,390
even going out into the field and taking

00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:04,040
photos when you can use CSS to recreate

00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:06,050
these effects and you can create 3d

00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,180
images through the images where you're

00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,649
applying different blend modes putting

00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,020
them on top of each other is seeing how

00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:13,759
they interact and creating these effects

00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,460
sort of mimicking how the I can look at

00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,110
an image now that there's in the browser

00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,640
you can really interact with them you

00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,920
can apply animation to them you can make

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,930
3d animated videos if you wanted in the

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,180
browser it's all possible and it's

00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,560
really cool if you want to see any more

00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,570
information about these demos I

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,510
mentioned you can check out art the web

00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:36,799
com which has posts that sort of detail

00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:39,619
more of how to do those things but then

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,210
I get this when I give this talk and

00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:43,430
this woman is saying do you make money

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,360
from your art and the boy says yes and

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,360
she says really

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,979
so I want to show you how blend modes

00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,229
are not just a little art piece that you

00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:58,390
can show off they can be implemented in

00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:00,070
your UIs and be a really nice way to add

00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:04,240
a good touch to your projects and

00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:06,250
websites so my name is Yuna and you can

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,860
find me on the internet at Yuna that's

00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,500
pretty much everywhere github Twitter

00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:13,930
I'm a UI engineer at digital ocean it's

00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,459
a server company based in New York I

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,440
started a couple of sacks meetups that's

00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:19,090
how I got involved in the scene started

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,370
to austins asked me that but I started

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,950
the one in Washington DC back in the

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,440
states and I also co-host a podcast

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,810
called tools day where it's about 20 to

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,340
30 minutes of tech tool talk a week on

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:36,760
Tuesdays roughly at two p.m. EST so

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:39,610
let's start with filters filters are

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,730
really great and super super powerful so

00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:46,209
with filters we have blur brightness

00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:49,870
contrast drop shadow grayscale you

00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:52,239
rotate invert opacity sepia and saturate

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,850
and you can also combine any of these in

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,390
a space separated list in your CSS to

00:02:54,850 --> 00:03:00,280
get multiple effects so a nice graphic

00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,320
of all of them up here you can see that

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,530
they take different values a lot of them

00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,579
are 0 to 1 inclusive like grayscale

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,980
brightness you can go higher than one as

00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:10,959
well as contrast things like learning an

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,329
absolute value so an absolute pixel

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,560
value you can use ms don't use m's it'll

00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:16,510
break your browser if you do anything

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,760
higher than like 10 pixels it's really

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,650
bad you can use an argument list and

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,519
drop shadow so familiar with argument

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,660
lists that's that's what that looks like

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,840
so just in one line of code you can

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,730
really transform your page the browser

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,260
support is pretty good and the other

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:33,850
thing is since they're just visual

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,140
effects a lot of the time there are nice

00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:39,100
bonus so with progressive enhancement

00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,140
you can just add them on top here's an

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,500
example of just using it really quickly

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:46,989
one line in a website so I i wrote this

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,180
it's just a image from my blog drew

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:51,459
these little sketches inside of an app

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,799
called paper and paper inherently has a

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,720
gray background but instead of opening

00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:58,060
all of these images individually in

00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,140
photoshop editing them putting them back

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,330
into my blog

00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,230
I just added one line of code I don't

00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,069
know if you could release it up there

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:05,780
but there was a difference between that

00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:08,990
background color and a foreground color

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,330
I just use a lightning filter liteon 1.1

00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,560
and bam if using something auto prefix

00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,420
or you don't even have to prefix the

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,959
WebKit but if you're not these do have a

00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,120
WebKit prefix to them another example of

00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,919
thing that you can do is this a really

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,890
common pattern that we see for focusing

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,390
attention on an area so a sidebar here

00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,340
this is the Dolce and Gabbana website

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:31,010
and what they do is when you click that

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,260
sidebar open a div pops up with this

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,450
semi-transparent black background that

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,460
lays over the page and it focuses your

00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,930
attention on that side bar but we can

00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,520
recreate this with blend modes we don't

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,480
need to have the additional diff we

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,510
don't even need to have a background

00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,850
color there is a property hopefully

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,640
we'll get meted called backdrop filter

00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,350
and backdrop filter is really cool

00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,050
because not only can we create this

00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,320
effect that sort of has that darker

00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,790
color in the background we can't blurs

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,890
since it's a filter we can use any of

00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,440
those 10 filters so remember he wrote

00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:05,360
eight is one of the options we can do

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,810
you know we can change the brightness

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,340
value any of that and get that same

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,210
effect but it's so interactive and we

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,540
can do it just directly in the browser

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,340
we can prototype right here so if I want

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,350
at a brightness that means I can also

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,300
make it darker if that brightness value

00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,500
is less than 1 so we don't even need

00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,240
that line of code to the background

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,550
don't need a background at all in one

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,740
line of CSS is backdrop filter we can

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:33,880
recreate this entire effect it's pretty

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,880
cool this browser support is pretty bad

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,620
it won't want however there are

00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,229
workarounds there are hacks that let you

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,760
do this here is another example of this

00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:46,400
it allows that text to be much more

00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,930
legible inside that modal window so it

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,330
has a light background but it's also

00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,479
blurring that mountain image behind that

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:55,640
text so how do we recreate this in our

00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:58,160
current modern browsers how can we do

00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,380
this it's called the fixed background

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,570
hack and it looks like this what you're

00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,700
essentially doing is applying the same

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:06,740
background to the page and the element

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:11,660
that you want to fake that blur effect

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:13,280
so I have here this fixed background and

00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,920
I have zero cover so it takes up the

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,930
entire

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,570
so whatever i'm revealing of that

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:21,150
background as i scroll will reveal the

00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:23,340
same spot as the background of the page

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,140
so since that's an element that we've

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,840
added on top of that background we can

00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:30,120
apply filters we can apply blur we can

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,280
apply a brightness filter take that text

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,620
more legible and it creates sort of that

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,270
same effect that same idea you can add

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,740
draggable to it like that previous

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:43,050
example in code pen and there we go you

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,720
can do things like revealing images so I

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:49,080
can hover over this and get whatever's

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,550
behind it you can do this with text so

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,650
making text more legible on top of

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,740
images if you had links or information

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,300
about speakers or users and it's really

00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,220
easy to do this just in a couple of

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,500
lines of code you can apply this filter

00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,700
this is you know using on a prefixed

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,770
here so it's going to add that WebKit

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:07,170
prefix and then add some content

00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:08,910
afterwards just in two divs have a

00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:11,190
rapper and do within it and you have

00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:16,200
created this effect which is a blur that

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:17,910
reveals some text as you hover on top so

00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,700
another cool thing about filters is not

00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:23,310
just is there a variety of options to

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,470
play with and choose from but you're

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,420
saving image requests with your hover

00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,520
states with whatever active States focus

00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,640
you want because you don't have to have

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,930
an image for your main view and a

00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,150
separate image that you're downloading

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,130
onto your users site for that secondary

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,770
view you can just apply a filter to it

00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:43,200
and that's saving you a lot of memory if

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:46,470
you're not sending multiple images of

00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,730
the same thing to your users so filters

00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,160
can be really really useful in that

00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:53,070
sense and here's just a good example of

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:57,330
the variety that you can apply and

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:59,280
mixing some of them so filters are

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,410
really cool but really what I think is

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,800
awesome about the web today is blend

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:07,350
modes blend modes how divs and colors

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,450
can interact on the web and this is

00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:12,360
really really powerful there's a lot

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:13,770
more variety than the filters so here we

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,990
have all these options and I come in a

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,430
couple of groups dark and multiply and

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:19,440
color burn will all make those images

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,910
darker there's the Lightman group which

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,910
is lightning screen and color dodge

00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,530
there's overlay soft light and hard

00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,060
light then there's two that are kind of

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:29,340
similar which is difference in exclusion

00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:33,650
and last four are all color properties

00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:36,479
so hue saturation color and luminosity

00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,250
browser support is decent on these so

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,810
keep that in mind there are two

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,700
different ways to apply them there's

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:43,110
background blend mode which applies

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,600
these to an element that has multiple

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,760
backgrounds so if I have an element with

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,410
a couple of different photo backgrounds

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,660
or a photo background and a color on it

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,130
then I can apply a background blend mode

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,220
to it and it mixes it with in that

00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:58,290
element itself if i use a mixed blend

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,510
mode which has very similar supports

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,400
very identical you're basically saying

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,550
that you want to mix that element with

00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:08,400
the page around it so you guys an

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,320
example of using multiply on the right

00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,880
we don't have it applied and on the left

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,670
over here we do have it applied it's

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,860
creating this really intense depth of

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,680
color because what it's doing is it's

00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,450
taking each pixel value the luminosity

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,790
so that brightness value and it's

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,529
multiplying it it's like a transparency

00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,540
if you shine a light through two

00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:29,730
transparencies the dark values will

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,380
remain was light values will shine right

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,240
through and any intermediate values will

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,460
mix and that's exactly what's happening

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,140
here so you can really see the depth of

00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:41,250
these gradients that are occurring in

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:42,510
the CSS background multiplied can be

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,550
used throughout your site to really

00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,440
unify it and bring in overall aesthetic

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,570
to it I like giving this example of this

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,400
bright yellow it makes the white text

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,500
somewhat let people on the stage who

00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,330
would have known I'm using yellow and

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,560
white could work and it's a theme that

00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,420
continues throughout the site without

00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,370
detracting from it they're using black

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:03,450
and white images and this pop of color

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:06,240
by multiplying it um what's really cool

00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,250
about CSS specifically is since it is in

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,740
the browser it is live you can interact

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:12,360
with it so your users can get the sense

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,370
of delight as they scroll through and

00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,950
the page is changing and you can do this

00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,930
in just a couple of lines of code it's

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:23,130
in effect that I think is pretty cool

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:25,050
and unique to the web today CSS comp did

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,700
a really good job of this so on their

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,950
website this is the CSS conf that's

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,800
happening in Boston this year they have

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:34,140
these SVG blobs these gradient SVG blobs

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,700
that sort of move with the page as you

00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,350
scroll and also a wiggle around the page

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,370
so you can see that they're slowly

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,750
changing shape on this page

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,640
and they're not really interfering with

00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,760
the content they're adding to it they're

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,960
bringing a little bit of color to that

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,300
later down the page there overlapping

00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:52,810
images you can also apply any of these

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,640
effects to images videos I mean so you

00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,920
can apply them on things that are moving

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,950
interactive and I'll give an example of

00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,960
that in a moment so with this we can

00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,940
also create designs like this and make

00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,260
them possible in the browser and when

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,089
you make a design like this which I

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,460
found on dribbble possible in the

00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:10,720
browser you can make that accessible to

00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,180
screen readers you can make it

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,920
searchable with search engines like

00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,300
Google and your content is being

00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,550
repeated on the page this becomes

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,750
content not just a JPEG that you had to

00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:24,550
save out or a PNG which is pretty cool

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,110
we need to stop getting our inspiration

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:28,360
for websites from other websites and

00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,740
this is something that I understand

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,050
happens for a reason people are really

00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,820
focused on flat design which is great

00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,320
for performance but now there are so

00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,839
many more options with the web and how

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,690
CSS and HTML and JavaScript are

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,370
transforming that we can do better we

00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:44,950
could get inspiration from fashion or

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,660
architecture illustration there's more

00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,370
out there than just other websites to

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,910
take a look at I would love to see this

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:53,320
trend of people experimenting war online

00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,990
another example that i found on dribbble

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,450
that's a similar aesthetic is this one

00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:01,120
so again you can recreate this in svgs

00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:03,730
and text instead of having to create a

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:08,050
separate PNG or JPEG that you're serving

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:09,070
to your users here's an example of the

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,839
next blend node I want to talk about

00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:14,620
which is the screen blend mode and

00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:17,560
screen is the total opposite of x I like

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,750
this example because it shows both so if

00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,880
and multiply we are multiplying the

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:24,339
luminosity values of the pixels in

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,320
stream we are taking the inverse and

00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:28,240
multiplying the inverse the way that you

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,459
get the inverse of a pixel value as you

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,620
subtract it from one so instead of eight

00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:34,690
times VA being active layer B being the

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,000
background layer we are taking the

00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:39,520
inverse of the active layers luminosity

00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,380
value multiplying that by the inverse of

00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,120
the background layers luminosity value

00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,560
and then inverting all of that because

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,029
we're attracting both that from one and

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,920
that's how you're getting this affect

00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:49,540
your you're basically lightening up all

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,710
the parts that you would be darkening in

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,060
multiply an example i want to show you

00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,650
how to really use this and make it

00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,170
interactive in your sights it's with

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:02,320
this portrait so here's a portrait of a

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,900
woman and say I wanted to apply an

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,660
interactive texture to it right so here

00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,570
I have a video file because this is code

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,700
I can just go here and hit screen and

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:15,970
you have this instant video effects

00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,490
created on your site again because this

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,590
is code I could just add some filters I

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:22,870
could add a blur filter and make this

00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,750
dynamic you can have this be interactive

00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:28,090
with your users and to show that this is

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:31,000
just what it looks like so something

00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:34,000
that is super super flexible they can

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,130
play with on the web also I wanted to

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,470
see what this looks like in a gif format

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:42,180
so i recreated this exact same thing in

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:44,620
a gift as you can see it's kind of janky

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,080
he leaves a lot of the colors there and

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:50,770
also the file format size is incredibly

00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,780
large so let's compare them we have the

00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,640
blend mode over here I know 3.6

00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,170
megabytes sounds large it's a huge image

00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,420
that I use for this presentation and an

00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:00,130
MOV file that's pretty long definitely

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,980
can use better video formats and smaller

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,660
images but just in this is an example so

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,080
even though that's really big when I

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:10,420
convert it to a gift it was 24.7

00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,280
megabytes nobody wants to serve that

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,950
nobody wants to pull that from the web

00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,440
so there are a few ways that you can use

00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:20,560
this to your benefit and make it much

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,090
more performant on your site this is a

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,470
really clever example of screens I

00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:26,440
wanted to share that I found online by

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,840
Yann Drewniak so he's creating this menu

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,940
where if you hover over you can see what

00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,100
those icons are individually but

00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:37,180
together it's just this really cute

00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:39,370
little circle that sits on your page you

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,440
can also create text masks with mix

00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:43,330
blend mode you can use the lighten and

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,890
darken blend modes or multiply in screen

00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,440
I wouldn't recommend this because

00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:49,630
background sorry text clip is a little

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,670
bit more well supported and performance

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,410
than this but it is an option it's

00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:56,530
something that people can play with and

00:14:53,410 --> 00:15:00,670
see online I really like this example

00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:03,280
this is a sort of profile view Emma

00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:05,470
Watson and she has this sort of gray to

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,610
blue gradient applied on top of her if

00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,290
you could see that

00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,820
and this is lightened and you can tell

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:13,480
that's lightened because in the dark

00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:15,040
areas we lose a lot of the detail and it

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,620
kind of just makes it a little bit more

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,079
murky I really like this effect I think

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,850
it's a very unifying effect so the way

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,620
that works is if we want to take this

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,560
color like this pink color and lighten

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,750
it by this blue shade we get this nice

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,779
purple and it just does it first in the

00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:35,620
browser so you can look at it pretty

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:41,200
simply if you remember that black is RGB

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:42,670
0 0 0 and white is 255 255 255 right so

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,589
when we're lightening it we're looking

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,110
at each of these RGB values and

00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:50,680
comparing them which ones lighter 190 or

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:53,709
40 it's one I need what about the green

00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,810
valley which one flight 2501 6160

00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:57,670
exactly and then 240 and if you see

00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,040
what's happening here that's how we get

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,630
this purple value at the end it's pretty

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,890
cool so it's dark and you're doing the

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:05,829
opposite where you're looking for that

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:09,160
smaller value closer to dark colors like

00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:12,550
black and that's doing the same thing

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,740
comparing those values the next thing I

00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,269
want to talk about is sort of on the

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,060
topic of this effect because it is my

00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:21,190
favorite one so using lighten you can

00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,019
create this sort of faded out vintage

00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,000
the effect that can really unify page

00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:28,060
and we're seeing this more commonly in

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,730
design and on the web so it looks like

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:33,010
this losing some of those detail in the

00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:36,670
shadow and applying serve a wash over

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:38,320
this image the way you do it here i'm

00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:41,980
using the background blend mode property

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,079
and two background images on that that

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,230
page so i have a color applied and that

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,060
background which is just the image link

00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:51,130
basically i want to mix background of

00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,949
lighten or the background blend mode of

00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,720
lighten and then choose the darkest

00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:56,860
color i want on that page so if i want

00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,449
the darkest color to be that bright

00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,680
yellow you can throw it all the way up

00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:02,140
there to wash everything out that's

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,750
darker than it if I want to be like a

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:08,319
nice navy grey or a purple that this is

00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,910
perfect for that so here's an example of

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,949
that so do a tone effect you can see

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:14,970
again in those shadows that you're

00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:18,040
losing some of that color the shopify ad

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,670
campaign that came out for their year

00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,400
interview

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:23,260
you sort of end of year you're in music

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,330
I thought was really cool like beautiful

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,920
colors really cool blend modes applied

00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:30,010
and just mash together in a really nice

00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,050
way okay so the next time I want to talk

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:33,910
about is the color blend mode and color

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,190
is really cool I mean here I'm going to

00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:39,220
use this dog to show you I'm going to

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:42,100
overlap and then apply color so

00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,800
basically what color is doing is it is

00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,960
taking the hue value and the saturation

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,240
value of the active layer so the rainbow

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,970
colors and applying that to the

00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,280
luminosity the dark and light values of

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:56,080
that dog behind it so that dog could be

00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,190
black and white and have that color

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,350
applied to it and you would never know

00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,180
it wouldn't make a difference whatever

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:03,220
color on tap you want to apply it's

00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:05,410
taking those two values if you look at

00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:07,330
this sort of ring of color you have

00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:09,580
luminosity which again is your dark to

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:11,410
light value you have your hue so that

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:14,020
shade on the color wheel and then you

00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:15,730
have how far away that color is from

00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,460
fifty percent gray which is the

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:20,800
saturation and these are all their own

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:22,960
individual blend modes so you can apply

00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,320
just luminosity of a color or an image

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,910
or a gradient to an image behind it it

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,560
will just take lightning light and dark

00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,750
values you can apply just a saturation

00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,750
of it or you can apply just the hue

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:38,230
value of it which allows for a lot of

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:40,480
different combination on the web here's

00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,100
an example of that color applied to an

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,420
image behind it don't know if this image

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,430
is colored don't know if it's black and

00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,810
white probably a smaller file size to

00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,000
send if you're sending a black and white

00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:51,190
image and it's just apply on this page

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,140
gives it a wash of color makes that text

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,470
a little bit more legible as well and

00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,850
just gives it a nice overall effect I

00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:01,150
spoke at a conference last month where

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:03,280
they use this icon system where they use

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,110
the stately a similar color of pink for

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,340
all the icons it was a nice way they're

00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:08,320
sort of blend and bring the page

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,210
together for the intro video here they

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,950
did the same thing it's a nice unifying

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,950
effect because everyone's photos are

00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,840
going to have different shades in them

00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:18,370
and I was scrolling along the speaker

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,780
page and looking at all the speakers

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,570
thinking about okay so what are the tux

00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:26,100
is going to be I noticed that one of the

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:28,810
speakers didn't have the color applied

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,700
it was just sort of missing I thought

00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:33,740
well if we had you know CSS this

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,630
really easy cascading change to make

00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,309
just in case this ever happens you don't

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,049
even have to open any of those images in

00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:41,570
Photoshop and edit them manually you can

00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:43,309
apply a single class to them and have

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:46,429
them all get that effect throughout the

00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:48,529
entire page so we can do here is use

00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:50,570
color I'll use that color blend mode

00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:52,279
create this pseudo element this after

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:55,639
soo development to sit on top of the

00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:57,260
image and because we're doing this in

00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:59,360
the browser we can even open up devtools

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,580
and see what's color we like the best

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,289
this is like prototyping in the browser

00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,419
instantly as fast as you can do it

00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:08,029
wherever you are presenting your site to

00:20:05,419 --> 00:20:11,809
your users so then you have this uniform

00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:13,880
effect throughout your site but you know

00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:15,409
you got to be wary of browser

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,200
differences maybe not all browsers

00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:20,179
support this sort of thing and if you

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,580
think about it what we just did was we

00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:24,679
applied a block of color on top of this

00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,809
image of a person so if the browser

00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,029
doesn't support blend modes you're just

00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:31,159
going to see a block of color we can

00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:34,610
mitigate this thing to embrace the

00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:36,649
Cascade we can mitigate this by using

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:39,289
one of those hue saturation luminosity

00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:41,659
values we can create the same pseudo

00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:44,799
element this after pseudo element put it

00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:47,779
behind the image apply a luminosity

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,269
blend mode of the image on top of the

00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:52,010
color and so that is going to apply the

00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:54,200
lightness and darkness values of the

00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:56,029
image to the color behind it so if the

00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,970
browser doesn't support blend modes

00:20:56,029 --> 00:21:00,230
you'll still see the original image so

00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,149
that's sort of how you take the inverse

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:05,389
of color and you are applying it in this

00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:07,519
manner you can still edit this with

00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:09,350
color throughout with your dev tools and

00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:10,970
see what shades you like what you get

00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:16,100
interact with it it all works the same

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:18,169
way so if you have an idea in mind here

00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,059
the streak rating Instagram filters you

00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:21,679
can really create anything and the way

00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:23,750
that you can recreate any sort of filter

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,029
effect is through gradients because

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,789
gradients allow you to create multiple

00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:29,990
blocks of color on a single plane and

00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,789
that means you don't have to have

00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:34,490
multiple divs to create these elements I

00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:36,740
really like this idea of recreating i

00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,419
just used instagram as an example but

00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,159
figuring out how those gradients can

00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:41,960
interact and work so here i have a

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,370
radial gradient some of the filters

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,290
didn't even need a blend mode

00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,910
so here I have just a color a solid

00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,280
color with a few different filters

00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:52,470
applied so you can go through and really

00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,100
use that as a baseline to compare and

00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:58,380
create so create this open-source

00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,480
project called CSS Graham which has a

00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,220
variety of these filters applied and

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,800
they do have animatable properties

00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,180
somewhat to them and it's totally

00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,380
available open source if you want to

00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,690
contribute if you want to grab this

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,960
available via CDN and apply it to your

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,790
images I've seen it in videos I've seen

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,410
it there's a coffee shop that has like a

00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:18,450
little Minneapolis anything is this

00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:20,910
which is pretty cool um but just

00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,740
experiment and explore CSS Graham is not

00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:27,030
the only thing out there there is now

00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:29,070
vscocam which is CSS Co the CSS version

00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:31,080
of it it uses the visco camp images and

00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:32,780
recreates those and there's this one

00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,760
that I think is pretty cool and unique

00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:38,040
color filter which is same idea but

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,280
they're kind of returning that bright

00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,690
Spotify effect and the URL is sort of

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,309
long so if you want to go back to this

00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,050
one I would take a picture of it but

00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:48,000
lucky video duck it helped that I 0 /

00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:51,600
color filter you could write that

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,250
dentally fast so next I'm I want to talk

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,350
about is a mix of a few blend modes and

00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,870
that is the overlay blend mode so here

00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,820
you can see that applied to the text of

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:01,530
that calculator and overlay is

00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,300
interesting because it takes to the

00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:05,280
screen blend mode and the multiply blend

00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,200
mode applies the screen blend mode to

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,920
the light values at fifty percent and

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,830
the dark values get the x 1 mode applied

00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:16,110
and it really makes us like nice sort of

00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:19,170
not dramatic effect looks like this

00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:21,450
closer up the calculator as it's darker

00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:23,309
on top the numbers on our darker and

00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:25,860
lighter ones are lighter so it creates

00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:27,840
like a little smooth effect a little bit

00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,760
better seen here in this border so in

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,380
the light values it's it's lightning

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,179
that image by the same percentage as it

00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:34,980
is in the dark values so instead of just

00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:39,960
like a white border around it it makes a

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:41,850
more unified visualization all right so

00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,890
the difference blood mode the best way I

00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:45,750
like to explain this is with these

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:48,990
little games do you remember these games

00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:51,480
from childhood can you spot the

00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:58,070
differences between a number one number

00:23:51,480 --> 00:24:01,590
two well the CSS we can just keep

00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:04,050
so what difference does is it looks at

00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:06,840
all the pixel values it looks at the

00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:08,610
difference between all the colors RGB

00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,170
and a from the active layer and

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:12,930
background layer and takes absolute

00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:15,570
value so with difference similar pixels

00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:17,760
will turn black with exclusion they'll

00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:19,350
turn that fifty percent gray and this is

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,490
really used for lining up transparencies

00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,900
in the past making sure they were

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,960
perfectly aligned and I'll show you why

00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,730
I hover over this you can see oh we're

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:33,330
cheating those are all the answers all

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:35,760
the differences so Sarah drives are

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:37,770
capable this idea of visual regression

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,120
testing with the difference blend mode

00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,250
because you can just look at your before

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,950
look here after apply one line of code

00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:46,920
and see what the differences are pretty

00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,900
cool took that idea and sort of expanded

00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,570
on it and created this site called

00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,300
Tiffany which allows you to do visual

00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:57,540
regression testing in your browser with

00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,100
CSS just one line of CSS code works

00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,180
locally because just behind your

00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,980
firewall if you want to compare a

00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:04,770
staging site to anything you have local

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,110
or an active site and see what visual

00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:13,350
regression you've introduced into that

00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:18,230
site CSS pretty cool so in review CSS is

00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:23,100
awesome we all do that when it works

00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:25,290
that's the caveat so don't do these

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,760
things because you know browser supports

00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:28,830
not fully there yet if you really need

00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,250
to support older browsers not highly

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,630
recommend this if you do need to support

00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:35,610
other browsers and you want to try the

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,290
blend modes consider the ordering of

00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:39,570
your divs and your images because it's

00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:41,520
still really possible to apply this and

00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:45,300
progressively enhance your website to

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:48,300
use these effects performance it is

00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:50,130
still faster to use a pre edited image

00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:53,340
that you're sending to your page rather

00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,230
than edit them on the page itself

00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,970
because you have to paint that image and

00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,650
then apply the filter so you have to

00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:00,270
repaint it repaint the pixels on top of

00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,890
that your browser is doing calculation

00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:04,980
so there's a little bit of a performance

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,660
hit to this you also can't save the

00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,160
images which could be a good thing

00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,170
depending on if you want your users to

00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,010
grab your images but if somebody right

00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,180
clicks and save

00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:14,850
it they're going to get the unfiltered

00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:16,520
unedited version of that rather than the

00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,960
nice filter that you applied on the page

00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:22,950
unless they take a screenshot of course

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,660
and there's no thumbnail support so what

00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:26,910
I mean by this is if you hear it on

00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,620
Twitter or Facebook people can see your

00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:30,000
content but they're not going to see the

00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,580
filter that you applied to it because

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,940
it's not native to the page so consider

00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:38,040
that as well but do try this because

00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:40,830
performance I know I just said this and

00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,990
they don't try this category but um we

00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,910
did show how it is good for performance

00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:46,230
in terms of that video if you wanted to

00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:48,000
make something really dynamic there are

00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,820
certain cases where this is a lot better

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,750
in performance that one was a big one

00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:53,520
also you don't have to send multiple

00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,890
image requests so that could be a place

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,360
where if you look at sort of what you

00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,340
gain and what you lose from doing these

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,200
filters you probably will gain a lot

00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,240
more if you're sending two images to

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,410
your user for your hover effects or

00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,810
focus effects flexibility hovering

00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:11,700
interacting this provides for a lot of

00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:12,870
interaction on the web natively you

00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:16,050
don't have to use JavaScript for this

00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:18,360
it's really cool I'm consistency so

00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:20,370
embracing that cascade allowing for all

00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,490
those styles to be generated from one

00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:25,290
bit of code keeping your code really dry

00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:27,210
speed of prototyping because we can do

00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:30,300
this directly in our browser we don't

00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,800
have to worry about doing in Photoshop

00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,090
sang into the developer having them

00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,950
apply it you can just work with

00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,050
designers sitting next to each other

00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,520
doing pair design pair programming and

00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,630
sort of figure out what you want on the

00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:41,760
spot which is great for those

00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:44,790
last-minute changes to always happen

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,350
always happen but it's nice you can see

00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:49,110
it directly in the medium which you're

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:51,720
presenting accessibility for those

00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:53,610
artistic designs not just accessibility

00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,710
with text and screen readers but

00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:57,840
allowing that to be searchable by web

00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:02,280
search engines making your site a lot

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:05,190
more semantic and exploration this is a

00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:08,880
big thing the ability to sort of explore

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:10,980
with coming up in CSS and seeing what we

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,660
can do to push that further because the

00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,810
only way to push the web forward is to

00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:17,310
build something that pushes the web and

00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:21,060
using things that push the web is how we

00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:23,190
can do that so this is sort of like an

00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:24,900
awesome website it's called evolution of

00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,290
the web and here we can see sorta

00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:31,320
we're technologies have come in and go

00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:34,340
and right there is CSS animation and

00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,570
it's kind of hard to see it's pretty new

00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,940
flexbox is also really really new in

00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,580
comparison to all this the filters are

00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,710
like baby they're like toddler stage you

00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,780
know but they're brand new so browsers

00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:47,220
are still really really working on

00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,890
implementing these making them really

00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,480
perform it in the browser and so now is

00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,830
the time to sort of explore and see what

00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,070
we can do with them and help the

00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:57,870
browsers open bugs there's a big queue

00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,720
they can really participate with like

00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:02,160
Mozilla tweet at browsers they often

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,620
will like reply and say okay we're

00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,120
working on this or tree off it that way

00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:08,340
there was like a little trend lately

00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,120
that was like hashtag edge bugs they

00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:14,850
could tweet at them pretty pretty cool

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,620
so be an explorer and art the web try

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:23,120
these things out thank you

00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:23,120
