lotto dosia tolas gracias por que dar se

00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:26,170
hasta esta hora creo que juega las

00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:30,410
direcciones not ova ck dobra gracias a

00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:37,070
un saludo para mi familia que esta acha

00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:41,510
creo hola familia ah bueno vamos a pasar

00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:43,790
in des por que ama facil para me ah so

00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:47,089
yeah add my talk is called sleepy map

00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:49,550
style geo canvas design with caro CSS

00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:51,140
and my name is a vaguely moser and i'm

00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,690
from the mozilla science lab which is a

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,489
part of mozilla that build open-source

00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,860
science software and its includes

00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:01,220
geospatial geospatial scientific

00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:03,050
software so this is making maps and all

00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,850
of my slides or down at that link there

00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,650
too so if you want to follow along I

00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:09,770
have all of the links in the in the

00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,290
notes below so the backgrounds isn't a

00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,659
map you might have noticed it's a comic

00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,120
so I'm going to reference comics as well

00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,250
just like Rachel did in her talk kind of

00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,759
except I'm not a comic creator i'm more

00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,590
of a comic consumer but i like comics as

00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,469
a metaphor for framing how we design

00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,780
maps because maps are kind of built with

00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:32,359
this similar story like cell structure

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,890
right maps are composed of tiles usually

00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:35,600
if you're dealing with raster maps and

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,140
they kind of compose next to each other

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,369
to build a story and CSS supplies style

00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,219
to that and so i'm going to talk a

00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:46,340
little bit about how Carlos CSS kind of

00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:52,159
gives a lot of punch and and and beauty

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:54,740
to maps so uh I like to start talks

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,829
talking about how we process things with

00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,539
our vision our eyes are kind of

00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:01,189
reflexive processors right they're

00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:03,020
pretty sophisticated process or is much

00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:06,439
more sophisticated than the machines are

00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:09,740
at processing our 3d world understanding

00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:12,890
depth perceiving what areas need to be

00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,970
prioritized and also colorizing our

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,830
world and you don't have to write a new

00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,940
rules for it depending on the quality of

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,440
your vision your eyes just kind of

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,600
naturally adjust to this right and

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,860
that's the kind of reflexive design that

00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,540
we hope to achieve on the web but

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,250
there's usually some latency right

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,540
there's usually some loading screen with

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:27,400
web

00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,980
visualizations things are kind of slow

00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,900
so it's not as reflexive as with your

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,069
eyes but we'd like it to be and I'm

00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,250
going to show you how we can make it

00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:38,500
better with vector mapping too so this

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,709
is where I'm from from New York this is

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,900
a map from Wonder Woman comic I like to

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:46,650
start out with this too because it kind

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:49,239
of brings up the mythology of maps so

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:50,439
when you design maps you know or when

00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,040
you use maps you don't really think

00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:55,780
about how accurate they might be right

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,010
unless it's inaccurate and you know it's

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,069
inaccurate because you're in the place

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,500
that is inaccurate but really someone

00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:04,959
had to draw that at some point even if

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,329
they had machine aids someone had to

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,530
kind of design the way we appreciate a

00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:13,450
3d globe in a flat 2d canvas and so

00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,129
there's a mythology beyond it behind it

00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,780
that not a lot of people really

00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:18,220
appreciate or they don't you know really

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:22,409
think about when they use maps for

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:26,230
navigation so it's not unlike designing

00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:28,450
mythological maps for comics either real

00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:32,739
mapping also relies on some assumptions

00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:34,599
and some constraints and you kind of

00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,970
have to give in to some of the errors

00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,579
that are quite natural in building 2d

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,159
maps so this is the canvas that I

00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:44,500
typically work on this is cardo or this

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,620
is osm openstreetmap who knows about

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:52,000
openstreetmap everyone almost hopefully

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:53,680
some people okay openstreetmap is kind

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,260
of like the Wikipedia for base maps

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,370
right people can go in and edit their

00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,340
own communities so it's a

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,199
community-driven project and it's quite

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,629
robust in some areas and not so much in

00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,400
others but I like to show this as an

00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:07,870
animated chip because it shows me

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,599
panning and zooming left and right and

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,060
also zooming in infinitely and I don't

00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,609
think people who design for the web or

00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,949
even just regular you know charts and

00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:19,989
bar graphs really think about how

00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:22,599
complex this canvas is because you have

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:25,539
to design for the zoo II interface that

00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:27,460
people expect to naturally adjust as

00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:29,800
they zoom and they have very little

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:32,110
patience for it when it doesn't work and

00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:36,190
then they pan infinitely left and right

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,470
so the canvas is infinite and and that's

00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,690
a pretty serious

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,790
straight for development and also to

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,370
when it pans left you'll also see that

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,040
there are these blocks of gray let you

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:49,230
see right now so those are tiles loading

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,770
right so you appreciate the canvas as

00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:54,270
being infinite because you can move but

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,770
but it's actually limited to your

00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,800
browser screen usually if you're dealing

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:04,140
with raster maps or maps that use tiles

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,280
so this is from a talk that I saw in New

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:10,920
York very minimalistic slides but the

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:13,950
developer of a small mapping library I

00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,050
think called simple tiles at ProPublica

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:20,280
which is a news investigative journalism

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:23,280
organization in in New York and he did a

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,290
lot of work with satellite imagery for

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,640
maps so he was talking about how slippy

00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,070
maps which are the maps that you saw

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,220
here because you can slip around right

00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,560
slippy mats slippy maps are optimized

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,680
for location and wayfinding and not for

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,390
aw which is so sad when that's what you

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,220
do for a living right you think that

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,800
someone just said at a conference that

00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:46,919
your stuff is boring and not awesome and

00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,540
it's usually utilitarian so this is a

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,580
similar block so I make a lot of maps

00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,580
but I also make a lot of charts and

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,410
graphs with geodata and and I started

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,360
thinking a lot about this idea that maps

00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,880
weren't particularly awesome and how we

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,770
could convince people otherwise so this

00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,419
is a slippy map you can't see it sliding

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,550
because it's just an image but it's an

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:08,010
iso map of iceland and what that means

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,500
that has little iso lines that indicate

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:12,030
elevation so if you zoomed in you could

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,290
see those little iso lines you can kind

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,590
of see them over there where it's more

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:17,940
yellow but this was built in card ODB

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,360
which is the company that I worked for

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,890
before Mozilla and I worked on a bunch

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,930
of educational materials to teach people

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:27,600
how to build maps like this and a lot of

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,960
documentation on CSS to teach people how

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,370
to design maps like this it's beautiful

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,470
right you wouldn't necessarily use it

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:38,300
for location or wayfinding you wouldn't

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:40,890
hike across Iceland using this map but

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:44,010
but you can appreciate how beautiful and

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:46,710
artistic is and this is another one it's

00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:49,230
a really bad jiff of

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:52,200
app that uses torque j/s which is a

00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,700
library developed by cart 0 DB which is

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,290
now called card oh they just changed

00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:59,310
their name like a couple of weeks ago

00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:01,860
but it's a time series data map or

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,410
mapping library and what that means is

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,880
you can animate time series information

00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,310
across a map if you have a time stamp

00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,630
associated with any of your data so

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,700
these are tweets about the Indian

00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,320
elections and they're colored according

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,090
to the candidates when people are

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,160
tweeting with certain hashtags you can

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,510
see like plumes of activity and where

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,550
people are pocketed that are more

00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:22,860
interested in talking about a certain

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:24,960
candidate so you can also create these

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,910
kind of dynamic maps oh I'm sorry iTunes

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,560
I'm gonna have to quit you because

00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:36,690
you're destroying the slides um yeah so

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,640
you can even do special cardo CSS hacks

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,690
for time series data which is very

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,330
exciting and I'll show you that in a bit

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,030
and mapmakers are really big on

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:48,360
mythology's like I talked about before

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:50,550
we kind of create stories that maybe our

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,260
little known in the wider web community

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,810
but are very well known in ours so this

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:57,810
is a place called null island it's at

00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:00,030
0-0 coordinates so zero latitude zero

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:03,720
longitude which kind of falls just

00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:06,150
beneath this little lip of Africa here

00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,490
and it's kind of where everything geo

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:11,220
rectifies when you incorrectly set it up

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,200
in your data it will zero out and go to

00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,690
the center and the center is Nell island

00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,910
and it's this fictional place that we've

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:20,370
defined in most of our Maps so if you go

00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,620
a nice easter egg on a lot of base maps

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,840
is if you zoom in really close to this

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,430
area you can find a null island and it's

00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,400
usually shaped like this conventionally

00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:35,460
people make t-shirts for this it has its

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:39,090
own Twitter it has its own flag you can

00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:41,940
make it in sequel in cart 0 we built

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,860
this little example that uses sequel to

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,050
design an ISO map of null island that

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:50,280
you can then fork and use your

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:52,770
developments and somebody postulated on

00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,750
the internet that because there are so

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,400
many projections on maps which are

00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:58,380
different ways of viewing the world like

00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,700
Mercator versus something else because

00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,180
there are so many projections that are

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,830
actually

00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,770
infinite null islands and it's a null

00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:06,810
island archipelago and not an island so

00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,450
people get really into the nerdiness of

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,760
it and and we love like building these

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,950
kind of stories right so it's not

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,529
necessarily as simple as a comic with

00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,209
like very separate tiles we try to make

00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:19,709
them as seamless as possible but the

00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:21,930
story that you build in maps is very

00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:25,649
analogous so I chose this just because

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:27,720
it's a part of a longer XKCD comic but

00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,610
it includes a map and then also i

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,149
replaced the cryptography up there with

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:35,399
cartography because the way that you

00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:38,850
built web maps a few years ago or 10

00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:42,060
years ago is ah was very much like a

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,290
cryptographic a complex process and I'll

00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,810
talk about that in a bit and how we

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,790
improved on it so how is this related to

00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,970
comics well cardo CSS is kind of like

00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:53,750
the onomatopoeia of maps it applies this

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:56,310
wow factor this POW this like

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,920
stimulation of movements and a dynamism

00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,660
in ways that maps wouldn't have

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,940
naturally without some kind of CSS

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,860
properties and it makes it easier to to

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,810
access those kind of styles which we're

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,240
available before in XML and in other

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:14,070
formats but not as easy for developers

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,870
to grog so origin stories you talk about

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:17,430
origin stories with Superman or with

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,220
Wonder Woman so we'll talk about them

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:25,620
with Curtis ESS this is an architectural

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:27,390
diagram of components of osm and so I'll

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,459
talk a little bit about map Nick which

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,860
is the renderer of the tile renderer for

00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:34,260
typical raster maps and I know what some

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,600
in particular post Chiss is like a

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,680
querying add-on on top of a Postgres

00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,790
database and then up here openlayers and

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,560
leaf litter things you might be familiar

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,070
with if you've done any map development

00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,959
on the web there is libraries and layers

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,150
that you can use for your base layers

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:53,790
and you can also swap in a lot of other

00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,529
base maps so this is the kind of no

00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,420
pseudo architecture that we dealt with

00:10:55,529 --> 00:11:00,779
before and this part over here is kind

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:03,029
of how people edited osm or used to edit

00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:06,209
osm now I think Matt box built a fancy

00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:09,350
or GUI for it but ja 'some and pull

00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:12,959
latch they have very tough names to say

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:14,670
but I just pulled this from and you can

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,540
get the link from the slides in the

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:20,999
comments this is part of a I think 54

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:24,240
slide deck that describes how to set up

00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:26,490
a web map with osm and this is just the

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,860
part that talks about math Nick style

00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,259
sheets so the XML style sheets that I

00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,209
described before it's I think 10 some

00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:34,980
slides and at the end of all of these

00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:36,389
slides you finally get something that

00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,699
says now that we've got all the

00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:40,559
necessary software installed you need to

00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,509
configure some of the software to work

00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,819
correctly so even after installing it

00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:46,559
it's still not going to work for you and

00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:50,189
this is the kind of the process that you

00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,379
had to go through with maps before right

00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:53,899
so then came along all of these

00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:57,720
companies that are super pro web

00:11:53,899 --> 00:12:01,110
mattebox developed cardo CSS which is a

00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,389
map Nick style preprocessor that

00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,009
inherited from cascade Nick which is

00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,920
like cascading style sheets but with the

00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:10,290
map Nick end so they developed it and

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,029
developed a kind of gooey for dealing

00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,920
with it called tile mill which they've

00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:15,839
been deprecated and recently deprecated

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,629
crow CSS but other people have picked it

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,910
up so it's not totally dead stamen

00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:22,769
designs beautiful base maps and they do

00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:25,920
a lot of tutorials and things in carlow

00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:27,509
CSS too so they make some very

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,339
sophisticated designs and they are

00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:30,720
actually a contract company for places

00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:33,839
who want to make very distinctive base

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,799
maps maps n is cool they're a company

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,730
that does a lot of WebGL like really

00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,769
experimental advanced things under a

00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:44,369
samsung grant that seemingly is endless

00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:46,139
and there are awesome people who also

00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:48,749
contribute to cart 0 CSS and then cardo

00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:51,059
is a company that i used to work for

00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:52,740
used to be called card ODB but they now

00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:55,139
maintain the documentation and have

00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,910
integrated cardo CSS into their default

00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:59,819
GUI so those are the companies that are

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:02,249
kind of contributing to to this

00:12:59,819 --> 00:13:05,189
processing community so if you're

00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:07,799
editing in it in cardo if you're editing

00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:09,990
a map in card oh I should say then you

00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,939
get a GUI interface like this if you log

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:14,730
in you can also use the JavaScript

00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:17,910
libraries and api's to access all of the

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:20,490
features of post just querying and cardo

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,030
CSS but but if you're just a regular

00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,620
user trying to make a map

00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,660
on the web in the browser then you can

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,050
use this interface which will let you

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,940
select different like buttons and colors

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,800
and things and then it will generate

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,480
curto CSS for you so you don't

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,820
necessarily need to know how to write it

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,250
but you can also edit CSS directly in

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,390
the kind of pull up tree on the side so

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,340
it looks sort of like this so you get

00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,230
some like CSS where you have a sequel

00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,960
tray as well that allows you to query

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:49,270
the data in your database in your

00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,880
Postgres database and you can style it

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:54,190
and view it on the fly so the tiles kind

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:58,750
of update on the fly as you're editing

00:13:54,190 --> 00:14:01,000
those things so this is the architecture

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:03,490
of that set up and I'm only mentioning

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,710
it because people like to know how

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,050
things are developed so this is how

00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:10,360
cardo works at least they has an editor

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:13,480
interface on the right side and then

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,980
there's all of the libraries and api's

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,620
and set up for if you were going to

00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:21,100
install cardo yourself and you don't

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:23,290
want to use the company as a host so

00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,680
postgres posts just math neck you'll see

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:29,830
here to torque has its own render it's a

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,090
special renderer for time series data so

00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,910
that's there there's red is for some

00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:36,640
other things Maps API and sequel API

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:39,040
allow you to query your data as its

00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,690
sword in Postgres and pull it into

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,580
anything so you could technically pull

00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,670
it in as JSON and make charts and graphs

00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,800
to you don't have to be bound to maths

00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,360
and then the Maps API allows you to pull

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,100
particular maps that you've already made

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,590
in the GUI for example or that you have

00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,170
stored and styled and here are a bunch

00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,640
of JavaScript libraries this that jumps

00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,360
around your map so you can create these

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:03,130
narratives torque is for time series

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,180
data Beck Nick is the vector tile

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,750
library that I'm going to be talking

00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,430
about a little bit and then card ojs is

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,770
just the basic library for making maps

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:15,880
and cardo CSS fits somewhere along here

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:18,340
right it also is in the editor but but

00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:21,370
if you're using the library's then you'd

00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:24,060
want to include it so anatomy of

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,710
courtesy of that structuring your styles

00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,870
courtesy SS is a little bit different

00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,540
than regular CSS so with regular CSS you

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,100
have selectors for elements but with

00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,080
carlos es su have selectors four

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,590
elements and data sets so if you have a

00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,900
data set

00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,640
null Island you can call that here and

00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:42,430
then you can style particular aspects of

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:44,290
the data set and it allows you to do

00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,600
nested styles you can create named

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,830
variables you can have attachments or

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,090
pseudo elements and I don't think

00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,410
there's one here but I'll show one in a

00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:55,180
bit that allows you to create glow

00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:59,790
effects and it's pretty awesome when you

00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:03,250
can kind of write pretty complex CSS

00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,080
formats so here's an example for the

00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,420
null island map this is an election map

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:10,990
for Knohl Island so we divided it into

00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:13,690
districts and created a mix and another

00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:16,360
party and each of those parties was

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:19,900
vying for election writes an island or

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,360
vote in el island and here's the CSS for

00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,920
that it looks a little bit messy but but

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,910
it isn't and here's the pseudo elements

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,980
that I talked about so you can also

00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,540
style labels I'll talk a little bit

00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,290
about the symbolize errs to that you can

00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:34,720
access in kurtal CSS I mentioned tidal

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:36,460
mill before it's been deprecated you can

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,530
still run it locally and you can still

00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,000
create batch tiles but if you want to

00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,790
create tiles on the fly you can use

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,310
cardo and they have a more sophisticated

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:47,190
setup now called turbo cardo which I'll

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:51,070
show you in a bit that allows you to

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:54,340
create automated ramps for CSS that are

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:56,620
quite sophisticated and I'm very cool so

00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,330
turbo kardos like this you can create a

00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,430
simple instead of having message styles

00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,170
or if then statements like you see well

00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:06,730
you don't see me if then but there's

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:08,350
lots of CSS there whoops and you can

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:12,700
collapse that into two one or two lines

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:14,800
with turbo cardinal so here's an example

00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,740
to and if you look at the slides and

00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,680
I'll also share the links at the end and

00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,959
there's kind of this block that Raul

00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,270
built that allows you to generate a lot

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,620
of different colors and styles and shows

00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:30,520
you how turbo cardo kind of makes your

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:34,150
CSS more concise so symbolize errs are

00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,560
superheroes with special properties maps

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:37,600
are composed of points lines and

00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,820
polygons mostly if you're applying data

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,410
you're either creating countries or you

00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,880
have points that your marketing or you

00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,330
have lines like bike lanes or something

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,530
and then attached to each of these

00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,140
symbolizes which have properties

00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,850
are the geometries that they correspond

00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,890
with so points lines and polygons or

00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,800
sometimes raster's which are the image

00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,240
ones that I mentioned before so you can

00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,920
also style buildings you can style a lot

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,280
of components of your maps or your map

00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:05,110
data in interesting ways so here's some

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,300
awesome maps let's go over some examples

00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:11,050
of what you can do with cardo CSS for

00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:13,090
simple styles this is a project very

00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:15,970
simple project that I worked on in

00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:18,070
Madrid there's an open data portal and

00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,440
you can download a bunch of things but

00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:23,320
they have a different spatial reference

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,300
system in Madrid then everyone else uses

00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,100
and so they give you data but it's kind

00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,660
of useless because when you load it on

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,030
to anybody's base map it's going to be

00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,950
off slightly and in weird ways like

00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,420
sometimes it's off this way sometimes

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,840
it's slightly moved over so when I

00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:40,150
downloaded all of these bike lanes they

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,590
were slightly moved to the right and up

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:43,810
a little bit so I had to write some

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:47,320
sequel to move them back down but with

00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:49,380
CSS you can also allow people to see

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,120
kind of glow effects around the biplanes

00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,950
or at different zoom levels you can

00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,860
create conditionals that allow people to

00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:59,560
see more of the information at certain

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:03,520
zoom levels so what I have here is just

00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:05,860
the CSS or the sequel for transforming

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,080
all of that data into the correct

00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:12,160
spatial reference system and then some

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,870
simple CSS with a glow effect so this is

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,460
kind of the CSS that you would write for

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:19,050
something like this with red lines and

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:22,450
like a yellow an ugly yellow halo and

00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:24,520
it's used in a project it's actually out

00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:27,940
of 10 site is called bike storming or

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:31,060
spoke now they've renamed it but they

00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,560
use glow lines in in their design of

00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:35,020
bike lanes in different places this is

00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,960
New York and you can apply layers of

00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:39,310
data but all of their lines glow and

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,870
that's because they use those pseudo

00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:45,760
selectors so base Maps base maps are

00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,980
very cool stamen designs a lot of really

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,450
awesome ones the watercolor base map is

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,460
at the top and over here there's a

00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,140
terrain base map and there's a

00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,200
toner-based map and base maps are kind

00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,300
of just like the base layer of of any

00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,980
map without necessarily applying data on

00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,070
top of it so sometimes it'll include

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,809
labels like the one

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,309
the center that has like places labeled

00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:06,500
and sometimes it'll just include

00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:11,090
features like the watercolor base map

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:13,220
and toner is the most basic of base maps

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,779
kind of like toner that you would I

00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,309
don't know apply to your skin right to

00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:18,259
clean the off it's like the most basic

00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:21,970
and I picked these images from comics

00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:24,950
because it shows some of the like

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:27,409
complexity of toner as a base map it

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:30,440
allows you to create patterns and to

00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:33,710
erase patterns in buildings or roads or

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,659
whatever so you get different levels of

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,370
resolution with your map so for example

00:20:35,659 --> 00:20:40,159
this one is kind of a little bit of a

00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,960
hack but because the same and base maps

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,450
are built with cardo CSS you can also

00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,009
use cardo CSS to override their defaults

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,570
so in this case you could make the

00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:51,350
background colors transparent and only

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:53,450
save the labels or you could make like

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,710
the labels transparent oi that's a typo

00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,600
but you could make the labels

00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:59,840
transparent and only have like the rows

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,730
and features and this one is a little

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,679
bit more complicated but it's just

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:05,450
applying a pattern to the buildings

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,909
because remember buildings or symbolize

00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,669
errs in cardo CSS so you can apply this

00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:12,980
little hash pattern on them and you can

00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:14,120
specify it as a PNG or whatever you can

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,100
also create some pretty interesting

00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:17,870
patterns with sequel but that's apart

00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,850
from caro CSS and here you can see the

00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,700
zoom conditionals that i talked about

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:25,100
before you can also style on like if the

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,259
data if the area that's in a column in

00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:30,799
your data set is above a certain amount

00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:32,809
then you change the pattern or you apply

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,110
a different CSS style so you can create

00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:38,570
this very interesting and complex

00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:41,330
situations this is a project at a stamen

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:43,429
that's actually a browser-based project

00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,500
you it limits you to four layers but you

00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:47,720
can generate cardo CSS in the browser

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,220
and make your own base maps and then it

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,500
batch creates the tiles kind of like

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:52,460
what tile mill used to do so you should

00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,029
check it out if you're interested in

00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,379
that label magic so a lot of times when

00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:59,899
you're zooming on maps you don't really

00:21:57,379 --> 00:22:01,879
think about how everything adjusts so

00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:04,159
naturally and seamlessly right all of a

00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:06,049
sudden labels are appearing for certain

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,450
things as you're zooming closer and how

00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:09,919
does that happen there are lots of

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,200
different ways to make it happen these

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,060
are a series of base maps that I'll show

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,440
that are used for Pinterest

00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:22,780
so they have their own map design and

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:27,170
you can write little regex like rules in

00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:29,810
CSS to say you know keep or hide the

00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:32,480
text name keep it blank at a certain

00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:33,710
level or in a certain circumstance with

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,470
a certain number of characters for

00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:38,900
example so if there are too many

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:40,640
characters like maybe if this were a bit

00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,050
longer and it wouldn't fit or conflicts

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,150
with another thing or there's not enough

00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:47,600
space between the other two labels it'll

00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:49,460
collapse them out and then also for

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,560
orientation sometimes there are places

00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,900
that are a bit longer like California

00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,330
Chile how are you going to write the

00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,130
same name as you would for the other

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,590
states if it doesn't fit or for example

00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:02,420
United States is here Kansas has to

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:04,370
twist to the side so you can create

00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,800
rules that say like if the characters

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:10,280
are a certain amount twist it a certain

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:13,040
way and that's kind of a hack but but

00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,990
you can do it composite operations

00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,990
they're kind of like blend modes like I

00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:19,610
think we heard about earlier today and

00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:21,350
there are many of them that you can

00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:24,710
apply you can create your own base maps

00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:26,540
this way by layering data on top of the

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,370
regular base map so this is just several

00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:32,360
I think it's for data layers with

00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:34,100
different composite operations and it

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,070
creates a kind of bath you metric maps

00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:39,260
so you can create depths in oceans based

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,870
on scientific information so that's

00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:44,120
pretty cool and you should totally check

00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:46,190
it out and then this is just an example

00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,840
of the kind of base map effects you can

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,610
do so this is the base map I made very

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,300
quickly by just painting the whole

00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:55,490
canvas blue applying a layer of polygon

00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,770
information for countries and then

00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:59,930
styling it white and then on top little

00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,580
Argentina is like here you can see that

00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,170
it has a little glow around it if you

00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,180
look closely actually there's like a

00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,100
blue glow around the so it stands out

00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:10,220
from the rest of Latin America and this

00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:12,920
is people tweeting about the elections

00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:15,020
during the first election of Maori

00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:18,530
Samaki and there's their hashtags

00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,090
cambiemos I feel braver and so there was

00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:21,560
an explosion of being lost at the

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:25,160
end

00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:27,050
oh and here's the CSS for it so you can

00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,820
create fills and backgrounds and blurs

00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:31,970
so the image filters that you see here

00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:34,040
too you can apply in curto CSS so

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,020
conditional zooms I talked about it a

00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,640
little bit earlier so I won't really go

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,590
into it but you can create these kind of

00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,270
conditional rules and you can do the

00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:47,150
same for zoom levels so for the Madrid

00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:49,430
cycleways at certain zoom levels lesser

00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:52,250
than or equal to 16 for example it's one

00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:54,650
color and then at 14 it's a different

00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,060
color that's a pretty simple basic

00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,200
example but there are lots of other

00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,400
things you can do at different zoom

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,430
levels that you might want to do like I

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,980
said make make the labels disappear or

00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:05,950
something and this is an example with

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:11,900
torque it has its own special properties

00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:14,270
on pseudo properties and this is tweets

00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:16,490
about Nepal it wasn't a kind of an

00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,610
experiment we did to see how we could

00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:21,410
maybe make the torque CSS of it easier

00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:26,060
so I different zoom levels you want the

00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:28,670
plumes are the offset of the bubbles to

00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,230
be different because at some Zumba you

00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:31,550
might want them to kind of overlap and

00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,630
occlude each other and that another zoom

00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,210
levels you want them to get kind of

00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:37,130
smaller so they don't totally overwhelm

00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:41,360
the screen so this is the kind of setup

00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:45,290
that you would have for that a color by

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:49,070
category so for the null island election

00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:50,750
map you would kind of create categorical

00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,910
rules so there's a type of map called a

00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,280
chloroplast map that maybe people have

00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:58,130
heard of that colors regions or polygons

00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,770
or points or even lines based on their

00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,660
numerical value in the data set but for

00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:05,570
categorical maps say you have votes that

00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,160
are like yes or no those are strings you

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,540
can't create a claw reply that of that

00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,280
you have to create a categorical map

00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,170
which in this case is what happened so

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,940
the winning party column in the data set

00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:16,130
if it was Nick's or if it was not it had

00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:19,370
a different color and the labels were

00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:22,040
the same so you can create those kind of

00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:25,460
conditionals that style the the map that

00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,910
way with not so much the SS and that's

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,490
then the result

00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:32,080
so torque tile styling so I'll show a

00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:34,210
few examples of what torque looks like

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,840
this is a project from info Amazonia in

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:40,270
Brazil they were tracking wildfires and

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,060
they wanted to kind of give these glow

00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:44,830
effects to the torque points so you can

00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,900
do this in CSS it's not just like the

00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:50,440
plumes that you saw before with the

00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:53,920
Nepal map it's a bit more like brilliant

00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:57,160
and ensigns a bit you can also create

00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:00,040
heat maps so this is a activity of snow

00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,260
plows in Chicago with a tracker attached

00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,720
to them and the person who designed the

00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,250
map wanted to track to see where the

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,340
snow plows were going during snowstorms

00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:11,050
because maybe an elected official lives

00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,940
in an area that gets plowed all the time

00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,410
and someone you know they don't plow the

00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:18,700
poor areas because they don't care about

00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:20,410
them so they ended up finding that there

00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,210
was like a cluster over here I think

00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,920
where there's a lot of activity and he

00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:26,200
thought oh I bet there's an alderman or

00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,670
governor who lives there and it turned

00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,380
out it was just like a little snow plow

00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:32,230
car park it was like where all the snow

00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:33,910
plows went to bed and so it wasn't

00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:37,300
actually a real story but it's still a

00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:41,220
beautiful map right so this is a project

00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:44,260
a euro bird portal that allows you to

00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,400
kind of side by side view the migration

00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:47,370
of certain birds as they've been

00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,590
observed by the community along with

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:52,000
environmental factors like temperature

00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:55,180
rainfall so you can see as it gets

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,880
warmer the birds move north and then as

00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,080
it gets colder they move south again and

00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,820
you can apply a bunch of other features

00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,050
but you can do these the same kind of

00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,940
things in torque you can do side by

00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,520
sides you can coordinate them with the

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:09,940
open libraries with card ojs for example

00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:12,430
and what else is looking to say about

00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:13,900
this oh you can also do custom

00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:16,480
projections so this is a custom

00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,430
projection a group out of Catalunya was

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,530
leading this project and they wanted the

00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:23,290
projection that makes Catalunya look the

00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:25,690
biggest and the most profound so they

00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:27,400
picked a different projection and this

00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,860
is a project that layers torque on top

00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,560
of a categorical map so the CSS rules

00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:35,050
would mix between the two and it's just

00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:36,730
openstreetmap edits of roadways in nepal

00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:40,940
after the

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:42,290
after the earthquake so you can see kind

00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,270
of like little plumes of activity this

00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,850
is just an animated gif as people are

00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:49,160
editing and all of the osm data is open

00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:53,720
so you can download everyone's edits I

00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:55,730
had to order it according to the time or

00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:57,380
like the entry number that is

00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,360
auto-generated and no sm because they

00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,190
don't allow you to see the timestamps so

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,710
it's a bit of a hack to see where people

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:05,840
are editing over time but but these are

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,570
the kind of CSS rules so you have types

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,940
of different roadways as they're

00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,740
categorized or tagged in osm and you can

00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,220
apply colors to them so the CSS rules

00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:20,210
would look like this and the sequel like

00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:22,010
i said is ordering by the osm ID and for

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:24,169
the torque component it's doing all of

00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:26,540
these things so there's a lot of like

00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:29,630
special properties on the map element

00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:32,179
for torque and mostly controlling like

00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:35,299
the offset and the how big like the

00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:39,650
trail is of the plume right now torque

00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:41,840
is really good for points it's not super

00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:44,679
great for polygons or lines you can't

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,850
like animate lines in the same way but

00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:49,400
you can kind of do a hack that I'll show

00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:52,549
you in a bit to sort of mimic polygons

00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:55,040
with points so map Nick and Beck Nick

00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:58,400
Beck nick is a vector tile render so

00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:59,900
unlike map Nick which relies on tiles to

00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,910
like forward next to each other and has

00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,490
this slow load time vector mapping is a

00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:07,940
lot more fast and sophisticated it also

00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,679
allows you to the the geometries are

00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:12,860
kind of more amenable to interaction so

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,080
you can apply like hovers and a lot of

00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,880
other features that would be kind of

00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,760
kludgy and difficult to get to render

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,950
with a raster map so you can do a lot

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,980
more animated things without loading

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:26,840
tiles so you should check out bec Nick

00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:30,559
if you're interested so JavaScript

00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:33,559
library and torque bubble maps so this

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,720
is kind of the hack that I talked about

00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:40,460
that's sort of related to points so by

00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:44,540
changing some aspects of of the torque

00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:46,549
properties you can make points below to

00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,600
cording to the data and look a little

00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:48,530
bit bigger a little bit more like

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,560
polygons so it's

00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:53,000
kind of more artistic interpretation of

00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,470
what would be the default for torque

00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,960
which is just everything kind of grows

00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:03,670
in the same or plumes in the same way so

00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:05,870
pop maps cardo CSS and it's compliments

00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:08,270
because we're talking about pop art and

00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:09,940
about comics I think this quote from

00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:12,110
andy warhol's pretty good at

00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:15,560
encapsulating how we behaved when we

00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:17,510
worked on Carlos CSS at cardo there were

00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:20,210
a lot of experiments torque was a like a

00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:23,960
side project on the weekends a lot of

00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:25,730
our some our core features were actually

00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,950
just built over a few days with a few

00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:29,240
friends so it's kind of whatever you can

00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,290
get away with and a lot of the hacks

00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,210
have been showing are things that

00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:34,670
wouldn't necessarily be best practices

00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:36,800
in cardo CSS but are definitely a way to

00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:38,300
get something done if you need to and

00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,740
there's a flexibility in what it will

00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:44,980
allow to render so that's pretty awesome

00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:47,810
so this for example this is not a map

00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:50,840
but it's made with mapping software so

00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:52,700
this is cardo the GUI interface i showed

00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,070
you before but instead of having a base

00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:57,890
map they just load it in a PNG an image

00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:59,540
and then use torque to animate an

00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:02,240
animated gif of a guide like jumping

00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,860
over a thing so you can make stuff like

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,650
this to you can make web art with

00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:11,990
mapping software and mapping libraries

00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:16,280
so just for fun and for the pop art

00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:20,060
example here's kind of weird map pack

00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:22,430
that uses a click events to kind of

00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:24,130
create onomatopoeia on a map so when you

00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:29,270
click on certain states they kind of pow

00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:31,220
like that but the cardo CSS for it

00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:34,490
applies a pattern to the polygons so it

00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:36,350
applies the under layer has this kind of

00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:39,470
yellowish Ronald McDonald pattern and

00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:42,380
then the other one on top is a bit more

00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:44,630
red and creates like more contrast so

00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,970
you can see them referenced here as P n

00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:50,680
cheese you can do that in cardo as well

00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:54,650
and this is the sequel to make it work a

00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:57,080
lot it's pretty ugly it's pretty ugly

00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:59,060
post kiss but on the credits gives us is

00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,040
easy right let's like super simple and

00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,050
concise

00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:07,280
is kind of like glass but if you want to

00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:10,610
do map interactive like click events

00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:12,920
without using javascript you can do it

00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:14,180
so I think this is a jiff that will

00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,620
allow you yeah so you can see it just

00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,800
like reloads it's not super

00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:20,090
sophisticated but um but it does work so

00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,980
you can do like weird stuff like that

00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:24,530
like weird experimental art that isn't

00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:28,700
really useful for navigation like we saw

00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:30,290
before but is kind of fun I also run a

00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:32,330
Twitter with a few co-workers called

00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:35,270
Cardosi SS ponds that you should totally

00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:39,290
follow that has a bunch of puns related

00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:42,290
to cart 0 CSS some political pawns it

00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:47,930
was one about Nell island somewhere down

00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:51,890
here oh yeah but yeah display none you

00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:52,970
should check it out and also I want to

00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,670
plug if you're interested in learning

00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,650
more about courtesy SS something my team

00:33:55,670 --> 00:34:00,410
worked on a lot when I was at card ODB

00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:03,700
was the math Academy and so we teach you

00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:06,650
how to write post just functions how to

00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:08,600
setup postgres yourself if you wanted to

00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,730
self host we teach you about JavaScript

00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,230
for maps we teach you about cardo CSS

00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,970
and this particular lesson is about how

00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,860
to make the election map for an

00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:17,630
all-island so you should totally check

00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,850
it out it has a video and a lot of cool

00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:22,910
like demos and downloadable code so it's

00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:24,860
very easy to approach and then at the

00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:27,380
Mozilla science lab we also host a lot

00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,929
of fellows so we have a fellowship

00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:32,720
program that supports developers and

00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:34,970
designers who want to write open source

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,470
software for science and this includes

00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:40,190
the geospatial sciences like i said

00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:42,290
before so if you want to make maps for

00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,669
science or with scientific data then you

00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,590
can totally do that one of our current

00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:48,650
fellows worked on a project throughout

00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:51,590
his fellowship called arial bold and it

00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:55,010
uses satellite imagery and computer

00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:58,100
vision to detect letter shapes from the

00:34:55,010 --> 00:35:00,350
alphanumeric alphabet in natural

00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:01,910
phenomenon like you know maybe a crop

00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:04,580
circle that looks like as you know and

00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:08,810
oh and then they built a web font arial

00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:11,570
bold it's kind of a joke and if you go

00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,180
to their little website you can type

00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:16,050
message

00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:19,200
is in satellite images and then send

00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:22,140
them to your friends and so this kind of

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,609
like mapping hack projects is something

00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,210
you could totally do with Mozilla

00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:29,520
funding and we would invite you to do

00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:32,369
really cool experiments for scientists

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,780
so please check out our fellowships and

00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:37,290
come talk to me if you have any

00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:39,900
questions about that and I guess in

00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:42,690
summary i guess i would say try to make

00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,970
pop maps as in pop art maps you know

00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:47,670
maps that have a lot of onomatopoeia and

00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:50,010
a lot of wow because those experiments

00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,680
lead to sometimes the most awesome and

00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:55,559
sophisticated features and aim for

00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,359
awesome so before when I said that you

00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:59,190
know maps were not built for all they

00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,109
were built for navigation and

00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:04,800
utilitarian purposes that's totally not

00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:06,030
true and try to render with reflex which

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,180
i guess is more like how your eyes

00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:11,460
render right try to think about how your

00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,369
map is going to process for a user I

00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,559
didn't talk about browser issues or our

00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:18,030
support for low bandwidth situations

00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:21,270
which can be really difficult for torque

00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:24,150
or certain libraries but you can ask me

00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:27,420
after if you're interested and so try to

00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:34,170
do that and that's it

00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:36,230
[Applause]

00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:36,230
