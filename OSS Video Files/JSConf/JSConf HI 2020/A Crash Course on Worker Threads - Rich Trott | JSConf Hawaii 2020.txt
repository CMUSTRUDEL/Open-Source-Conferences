Title: A Crash Course on Worker Threads - Rich Trott | JSConf Hawaii 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-26
Playlist: JSConf HI 2020
Description: 
	Node.js 10.5.0 introduced 'worker_threads', enabling the creation of simple multi-threaded applications in JavaScript. This may sound daunting if you've never dealt with threads before in another language. But JavaScript threads are pretty simple and, very importantly, fun. This talk will be a quick introduction to the fun of worker_threads.

I promise not to make any "you got your multi-threaded chocolate in my single-threaded JavaScript peanut butter" jokes.
