Title: Using Machine Learning to Improve UI UX - Milecia McGregor | JSConf Hawaii 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-24
Playlist: JSConf HI 2020
Description: 
	The world of UI/UX is changing every month. It can be hard for developers to keep up with the newest trends and frameworks because of all the responsibilities they have. What if you could use machine learning to help you keep up with all of the changes? While it’s far from taking all of the programming jobs, machine learning can help developers make more user-friendly web applications. With the use of Brain.js, you can do text prediction, make small layout changes, check for malicious users, and more.

In this talk, attendees will learn some background on machine learning and algorithms and see examples of where Brain.js can be used in real applications. We’ll cover business cases in web development where machine learning can help, how neural networks work, and how JavaScript can be used to train a model and make real-time updates for users. By the end of the talk, attendees should have a good understanding of basic machine learning concepts and an idea of how they could get started with Brain.js.

alright hey everybody my name is Melissa

00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:17,420
McGregor and I'm a senior UI engineer

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,460
right now but in a past life I used to

00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:23,540
be a mechanical and aerospace engineer

00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:26,720
which is how we get to using machine

00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:30,680
learning to improve UI UX roundabout

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:36,200
ways so the goal of this is to make our

00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:38,540
Skynet future more user-friendly so I

00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,399
like to give a quick overview of what

00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,280
I'm gonna talk about before we get into

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,710
it so first how many of y'all know about

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,570
neural networks like how they work

00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:54,260
oh yes ok how many people have heard of

00:00:50,570 --> 00:01:01,570
brain jeaious that's more than I've seen

00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:04,640
ever so great it's Charlie here oh yes

00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,030
no anyways you'll get to see why I ask

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,510
later

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:11,270
so then we'll get into more of like how

00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,579
you actually do machine learning so

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:16,759
we'll talk about choosing features to

00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:20,170
use how you actually train a model to

00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:23,600
understand our wonky user behavior and

00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:26,689
how you actually use a machine learning

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,100
model to make updates to your DOM and at

00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:31,729
the end of course there's some little

00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,290
takeaways so just to get you kind of

00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:36,740
warmed up and started with neural

00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:40,100
networks a neural network is basically a

00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:44,149
math equation that makes predictions you

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:47,780
put in stuff you get out stuff so one

00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:52,039
thing that I think personally machine

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,770
learning has a really bad I guess thing

00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:57,500
with is jargon so I'm hoping to break

00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:01,670
some of that for you guys so a neural

00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:05,090
network is basically just a brain made

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:08,119
of layers of nodes and this is what I

00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,729
know it looks like so you have as many

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:13,130
inputs as you want you assign those

00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:17,780
inputs a certain weight to give them

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:20,870
like I'd say so you give them a weight

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:24,349
so that they know which

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,629
input has more value to the prediction

00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:28,879
you're trying to make and then you run

00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:31,129
it through some crazy math equation that

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,560
a lot of people don't really want to

00:02:31,129 --> 00:02:38,090
know about and then you get a predictive

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,190
value or values so another thing that

00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,430
comes up a lot in machine learning is

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:46,700
deep learning hmm it's so scary and

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:49,819
fancy but the only thing that deep

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:53,900
learning means is that there are more

00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:56,900
than one node in your neural network so

00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,540
you can have two nodes and you have a

00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:05,480
deep learning model oh you can have

00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:08,209
three nodes and it's super deep so some

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,200
of the places that you might see neural

00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:14,319
networks in the wild would be with like

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,540
predicting user intent so your user

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,239
clicks on a button or a certain part of

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:23,659
the screen and you have certain content

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,389
over there that means that that user is

00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:28,340
probably interested in whatever you're

00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:31,660
showing them that they keep hovering

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:35,329
over or clicking on and based on that

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:38,060
fact you can make adjustments to what

00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:40,910
that content is you can change the

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,879
jargon or the language around it you can

00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:46,310
even throw in memes if you want to just

00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:49,280
based on the inputs that you get from

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,889
your user and something else you can do

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,590
to help our Skynet future is to make

00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:57,230
personalized interfaces so let's say

00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,709
that you have this large deadest data

00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:05,599
set of user behaviors and it shows you

00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:08,810
that on Tuesdays at 3:05 p.m. all of

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,819
your users are drinking mimosas so you

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:15,590
might want to throw in something that's

00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:17,750
maybe orange or something that might not

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:21,769
have slipped through they're more sober

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:23,960
minds and then of course you can always

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,900
use machine learning to find areas of

00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,630
improvement so when you get all of your

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,030
user data you can take that and look at

00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,960
some of the problem areas they have so

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,950
maybe you're trying to increase

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,680
conversion

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:39,200
or you're trying to get more people to

00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,620
come to your website or you just want

00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:46,010
more people spend money on your website

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:50,000
whatever it is you can take your user

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:54,380
behavior data and skim it for any type

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,410
of behavior that you're trying to make

00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,320
them do so basically neural networks in

00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:02,990
the wild are a way to kind of implant

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,260
little ticks into our users so that they

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:09,200
don't have to worry about as much it

00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,060
just does stuff for them and that's what

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,330
I'll users want and that's what we want

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,910
so that they don't break our stuff so

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,910
gonna talk about brain jeaious for a

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:22,520
little bit it is another JavaScript

00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,620
machine learning library and I

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,560
deliberately chose the silver tensorflow

00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,620
a while back when I tried to learn

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,410
tensorflow jeaious it confused the

00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,470
absolute crap out of me so I found brain

00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,820
juice and it's so much easier to use how

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,570
many people know how to work with

00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:46,460
objects arrays objects with arrays and

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:51,020
arrays of objects then you can do

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:53,500
machine learning so one of the best

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,340
things about brains is if you aren't as

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,400
interested in getting into like the

00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,890
mathematical stuff or you don't really

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,960
want to dig too deep into machine

00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:05,810
learning you just want to say hey I have

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,060
this data and I need a prediction this

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,540
is a really good library to do that with

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:15,530
just because objects and arrays are

00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:17,780
really easy to work with and again the

00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:20,180
tutorials are really straightforward

00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,810
they get you up and running pretty much

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:27,170
from square one so you can start using

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:30,890
sequential models you can use some RN

00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:33,350
ends is just all built-in for you and I

00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,240
don't have anything to do with brain J s

00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:39,019
I'm just a little bit of a fangirl for

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:41,119
it so just throw that out there

00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:43,969
so we'll get into the best part choosing

00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:46,969
your features so features are basically

00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:49,969
the data points that you're trying to

00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:53,899
collect from users or from whatever

00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:56,299
other hardware systems you have but for

00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:59,419
this talk in particular we're focused on

00:06:56,299 --> 00:07:01,909
our UI UX so one of the biggest

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:05,049
questions you have to ask is what is

00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:07,699
gonna add the most value for a user I

00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:09,199
know a lot of us find these new tech

00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:11,539
tools and we're like oh my gosh this is

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,119
so cool and then we start throwing stuff

00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:16,999
into the application that really doesn't

00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:19,699
do anything for the user so make sure

00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:21,469
that when you're looking for those data

00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:25,189
points you're trying to get from your

00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:29,889
user that the prediction you get from

00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:32,539
that data will add value to the user

00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:35,179
then you have to figure out how are you

00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:37,819
gonna get that information are you gonna

00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:40,219
hook them up to some kind of EEG sensor

00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:43,219
and monitor brain waves are you gonna

00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:46,459
hack into their webcam and watch them do

00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:48,889
whatever people do or are you just going

00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:52,309
to get like some Mouse inputs or some

00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:56,269
information from input boxes probably

00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:59,869
the second one hopefully and then

00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:02,179
another thing that a lot of machine

00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:04,759
learning projects lose sight of at some

00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:08,269
point is what exactly are you trying to

00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,699
predict so you have all of this data you

00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:12,829
have terabytes of data and you're like

00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:14,779
yes machine learning we need to use it

00:08:12,829 --> 00:08:18,409
okay what are you trying to do with it

00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:21,139
so make sure that you actually know what

00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:25,399
you're trying to predict before you just

00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:28,610
dive into data analysis and then this is

00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:32,059
my favorite will anybody care if you

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:34,250
make this update so yeah it's cool to

00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:36,829
use machine learning and stuff yeah it

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:40,519
has this applications but at the end of

00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:43,399
the day if your users don't care was it

00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,610
really a successful project just

00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,820
something there

00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:50,800
ponder about so this is the fun part

00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,440
we're going to get into actually

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,640
training a model to understand user

00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:01,300
behavior and I have code and a demo that

00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,640
is supposed to be running right now it

00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:07,860
worked a few minutes ago which is why

00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,860
this is commented out instead of deleted

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,779
okay can you guys see that okay

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,870
[Music]

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,570
and we can ignore the comment for now

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:24,600
but anyways we're gonna go into the

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,880
backend so this is one of the ways you

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,720
can create a machine learning model

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,990
using nodejs with the brain jeaious

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,060
library and basically what we do the

00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:41,360
main things I mean how many of you are

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:43,890
back-end engineers or full-stack okay

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,560
everybody knows about node and servers

00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:49,080
then so pretty much the only thing you

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,410
really need to do is import this brain

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:56,010
j/s library and blah blah blah okay so

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:59,400
now this is the fun part so this is our

00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:03,630
training data for the neural network

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,810
model and it's very small because I made

00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:09,420
up all of these values you know demo

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:13,260
data set but basically what we're doing

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:17,340
is we are going to make this UI

00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,440
interface that it kind of bothers people

00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:22,680
who might be trying to hack our website

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,930
so based on what they type into our

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,880
input box there are certain things that

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:28,920
a normal user wouldn't like I don't

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,580
expect a user to type in something like

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:36,240
having or group or select especially in

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:39,120
any type of combination so based on

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,980
these values which you see it's an array

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,190
of objects Oh

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:48,940
and down here that is our input data so

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:52,540
this is what we are saying that hey if

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:56,680
you see any of these inputs we are going

00:10:52,540 --> 00:11:00,460
to use them to predict if our our user

00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,980
is malicious or not so basically if they

00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,550
use any of these words or terms it

00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:09,670
assigns a maliciousness rating and that

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:12,280
is our output data so the way the

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:15,040
machine learning model works is that you

00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:18,610
have to have a training input data set

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,620
and a training output data set because

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,990
machines aren't people they don't really

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,060
feel in the blanks yet so what we're

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,640
doing is called supervised machine

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,310
learning and that's just where you tell

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:32,920
it hey if you see this combination of

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:35,710
things you can expect it to mean this

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,410
and that's how we teach our model to

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:41,080
make predictions based off of inputs so

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:44,440
basically we're going to use these two

00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:49,180
data sets to train our model which is

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:51,610
incredibly easy so little little jenkin

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,280
is here again I wanted to make sure this

00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:56,710
actually worked this morning so what

00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,930
we're doing here is just combining the

00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:04,360
input and output data into a single I

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:06,340
think this is an object object or array

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,370
whatever we combine it into a single

00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:13,630
entity and we do that because that's how

00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:16,720
the brain Jas library works and tada

00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:20,110
this is how you make a neural network

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,960
this one line right here you have a

00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:26,620
neural network and basically we just

00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:29,650
kept it really simple and went with the

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:32,980
neural network so there's like recursive

00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:35,830
neural networks there's some other crazy

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:39,160
things you can use but this is easy and

00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:42,520
we gave it three hidden layers what that

00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,830
means is that basically we give it the

00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:47,950
inputs those inputs have weights and

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:50,590
then the model takes over and it's like

00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:52,570
this combination of inputs equals this

00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:55,180
and it just pushes it through to the

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,660
prediction so hidden layers are good

00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,530
when you

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:02,680
more accuracy but remember that you

00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:06,580
don't want too many because it'll slow

00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,560
your results down it'll it'll just be

00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,840
really really slow you don't want that

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,089
when you run in a server that people are

00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:18,179
hitting you know millions of times a day

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:20,459
but this is the best part so you see

00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:25,079
this this is how you train a neural

00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:28,139
network one function call and we have

00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:33,569
our model made that is it in brain J is

00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:35,969
easy so we have our model made and now

00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:39,139
all we have to do is make predictions

00:13:35,969 --> 00:13:42,809
and the way we're going to do that is

00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:45,959
we're going to use our model to make

00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:50,099
updates to the Dom based on some of the

00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:53,759
inputs that our users put in again deep

00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:54,119
breath it's demo time so hopefully this

00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,039
will work

00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:59,669
first though how many of y'all have

00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:04,199
heard of slip 'some there's a couple

00:13:59,669 --> 00:14:09,029
people but okay it's Lauren it's my wife

00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:11,789
I disconnected but you should definitely

00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:14,819
google slip 'some I don't know why my

00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:18,719
wife I disconnected it but such is life

00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:21,479
when AV stuff happens but just to show

00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:25,319
you kind of what it would look like if

00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:28,649
you start typing in words you kind of

00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:30,749
notice the colors change and you see my

00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:33,929
maliciousness rating is definitely

00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:35,819
pretty up there you really don't want

00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:37,229
people to be able to type this in so

00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:39,149
you'll probably have some kind of

00:14:37,229 --> 00:14:41,789
security blocks on the back end and

00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:43,679
that's cool but why not start messing up

00:14:41,789 --> 00:14:47,219
the user interface for somebody trying

00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:49,559
to type it in said it comes from that

00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:52,439
principle have you guys seen the like

00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,569
bootlegged video games where they start

00:14:52,439 --> 00:15:00,509
really messing up the deeper you get

00:14:54,569 --> 00:15:02,639
into it's basically the same concept you

00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:04,499
just make it difficult for them to keep

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,509
trying to hack you even though you

00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:08,369
already have all of you back in secure

00:15:06,509 --> 00:15:12,399
in your database and nobody's using

00:15:08,369 --> 00:15:16,639
admin admin so you're good to go

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:20,180
but the way that we do this is on the

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:23,680
front end we have a very small piece of

00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,680
code somewhere in here

00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:32,850
yes here we go so basically what we're

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:36,450
doing here is we get the input from the

00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:39,960
user we send it to our back end it goes

00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:43,890
through our machine learning model right

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:46,380
here and what it's looking for is it's

00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:48,930
going to split up all of the words that

00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:52,560
the users typed into the box and it's

00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:55,920
going to make a new training input data

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,370
set so instead of our original which was

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,920
just some made-up stuff to set the base

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:05,430
for our model we actually have real data

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,580
now it's wonderful but all that's

00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:12,720
happening here is we are assigning some

00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:16,640
kind of value to it and we rerun the

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,790
model so this line right here

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,120
is it this is how you get a predicted

00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:25,810
value from a machine learning algorithm

00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:29,120
you do another function call that's it

00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:32,330
it's pretty great but back on the front

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,340
end we get that function well we call

00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:38,390
that function it passes the data back

00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:41,240
and then we start to mess with our user

00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:45,110
so this is where I like to ask you guys

00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:47,390
what do you want to change on the screen

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,700
when somebody tries to hack you do you

00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,890
want it to like add a style where they

00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:55,700
can't type in anymore do you want it to

00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:58,910
move everything around doing live coding

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:01,150
here so what do you guys want to see

00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,150
today

00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:12,210
Comic Sans

00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,210
[Laughter]

00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:19,310
I couldn't hear a lot of them but I

00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:21,589
think Comic Sans might be it so we'll

00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:26,319
just do something simple I think I have

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:26,319
that installed to font-family

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,360
let's see if that's actually going to

00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,360
work

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,320
mmm is it still running

00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:59,260
okay still running just so let's see if

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:59,260
it's gonna do Comic Sans hopefully

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,630
can't tell if they're changed can you

00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,080
guys

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:07,080
Thanks

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,710
I don't think it changed it to Comic

00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:15,440
Sans but basically I think you kind of

00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:18,980
get the idea here that you can pretty

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:22,880
much wreck someone's day just with

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:26,330
machine learning and UI UX but on the

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,500
flip side of that I see if the other

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,500
demo is running

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:39,080
oh I think it might actually work

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,730
it's always nerve-racking when you get

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,999
up here and it's like I think my demo

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,999
works

00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,920
stupid stuff

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:58,760
okay so this time instead of us you know

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,770
making life hard for the user one of the

00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,910
things we're gonna try to do is make it

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:07,130
easier but I will throw in a caveat this

00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:10,190
is just a fun thing you should probably

00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:15,140
never make live updates to your UI UX

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:16,910
when a user is actively using it you

00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:21,110
don't really want buttons and things to

00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:24,440
move around just run that out there but

00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:30,040
basically when a user types in something

00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:30,040
so tell me something good in Hawaii

00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,760
no of course one of them wouldn't work

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:41,190
but that's that's fine we roll with you

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,780
but anyways I'm not gonna stand up here

00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,140
and try to debug that all morning for

00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:49,170
you guys but basically what that one was

00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,030
supposed to do is as a user types it

00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:53,880
starts to pick up kind of their

00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:56,730
sentiment on how they feel today and

00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,220
based on that it'll either bright color

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,840
of the screen - like a yellow because

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,480
they're really sad and they need some

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,890
sunshine in their lives or it'll darken

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,420
it a little bit because they're a little

00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,420
bit too happy and need to bring it down

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:15,930
but um that is pretty much it for the

00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:19,350
code side I'm really glad at least one

00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:24,120
out of two worked so I will go ahead and

00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:26,460
wrap up so the key takeaways try to find

00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,860
uncommon ways to implement machine

00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,420
learning so one of the other projects

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,640
that I've worked on with machine

00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,670
learning is like this EEG sensor that

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,300
picks up brainwaves and you can use it

00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:42,420
to control stuff like real life stuff

00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:44,610
like drones and freaking robots that

00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,040
climb up the wall just from your brain

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:51,540
signals it's awesome and it uses

00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:53,400
JavaScript and then use brain jeaious

00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:56,570
because tensorflow j/s is really

00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,570
difficult for no reason

00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:03,279
and of course one of our goals is to

00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:05,889
always improve our UI and UX but try to

00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,529
think about how you could use your data

00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:11,710
to improve the UI and UX on an

00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:16,629
individual level so one of the things

00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:20,649
you can do is get just this large data

00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:24,309
storage factory of user data and say hey

00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:27,429
I think I want to see if my users will

00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:30,100
actually buy stuff on this day in this

00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:32,590
country at this time when the weather is

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:34,690
like this machine learning isn't that

00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:37,240
powerful and you can get those

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:39,309
predictions just don't jump into buying

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,990
a lot of data before you actually know

00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:43,840
what you want to use it for because a

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:46,539
lot of companies have done that and then

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,909
their machine learning stuff didn't give

00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:53,430
them any results so just some takeaways

00:21:50,909 --> 00:22:00,099
yeah that's it for me

00:21:53,430 --> 00:22:00,099
