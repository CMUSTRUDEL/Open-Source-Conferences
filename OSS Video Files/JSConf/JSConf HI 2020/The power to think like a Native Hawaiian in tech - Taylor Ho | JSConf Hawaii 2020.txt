Title: The power to think like a Native Hawaiian in tech - Taylor Ho | JSConf Hawaii 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-09
Playlist: JSConf HI 2020
Description: 
	Diversity, in both small and large tech companies, is now understood as a critical component to innovation. In the same way individual generalists are able to make connections across disciplines, members of a diverse team contribute perspectives that would have otherwise been unknown. This is perhaps what Steve Jobs was referencing to when he eloquently recited “Think Different”. This talk uses my experiences as a Native Hawaiian programmer and designer working at Twitch as a launching point to discuss the benefits of introducing cultural and thought diversity into an organization.

This talk will also discuss core concepts I’ve learned from a Hawaiian upbringing that I believe can lead to positive contributions in the tech space, such as the benefits of being kolohe(having a rebellious nature), encouraging ‘imi ‘ike(the pursuit of knowledge), the complementary forces of a‘o aku and a‘o mai(to learn and to teach), committing to aloha(in part the generous spirit of giving without expecting), favoring laulima(group cooperation) over personal gain, the practice aloha ‘aina(the love of one’s environment) and more.

along my hole my name is Taylor

00:00:11,129 --> 00:00:14,519
hole

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,260
designer I have

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,880
speaking with you all today a little bit

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,070
about myself but more importantly

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,779
something I'm very passionate about my

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,610
Hawaiian culture and how it's paved the

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,480
way for Buddhist for me to be successful

00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,539
in fact

00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,189
so today I'm a senior senior UI UX

00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:33,100
designer at twitch other headquarters

00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:34,390
over at San Francisco in my past I

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,489
worked at companies like Unity

00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:38,949
Technologies have actually started my

00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:41,290
career not too far from here now in Ala

00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:44,220
Moana Boulevard in downtown Honolulu at

00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,220
wall-to-wall studio

00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,140
show of hands who here considers

00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:50,140
themselves

00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,210
alright ok ok so now for the rest of you

00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,650
that didn't raise your hands what about

00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:02,810
your work is what you do create alright

00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,810
lots of nodding heads ok cool

00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:08,960
I'm in the right room that's majority of

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,760
us here so because of that I'm really

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,520
excited to spend these next few days

00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,200
with everybody here at JS comp

00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,720
harnessing creativity I guess has been

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,260
this ongoing adventure of mine from

00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,760
printing my earliest sticker slaps to

00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,520
producing on the street interview shows

00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:27,500
to working on short films and making

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,820
surfboards and making t-shirts and

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:34,400
producing graphics now amongst amongst

00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:40,190
the many there's one craft that has

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:42,080
always had my heart web design a web web

00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:44,570
design I mean if you could call this

00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,790
that so like many of you I started

00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,009
building websites at a very early age I

00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,380
was 14 at the time when I published this

00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:53,119
work of art to the World Wide Web

00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,910
it was a mix of boilerplate PHP

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,740
templates FTP applications that I just

00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:01,190
kind of learned as I went and Photoshop

00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:02,600
tutorials on pirated software it was

00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:06,190
kind of like all just duct-taped

00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,190
together barely holding on

00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:10,350
now fast-forward 15 years I work on

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,260
designing products that touch millions

00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:15,150
today twitch is a popular live streaming

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,800
platform most well-known for gaming and

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,830
eSports but it also has growing

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,440
communities within our IRL or in

00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:26,010
real-life categories like travel art and

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,040
exercise it's the kind of place to work

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,550
where culture fit means identifying

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,930
memes it's amazing so now I decided now

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,960
I design products what does that

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,520
actually mean so you think this design

00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,250
software like Big Ma I come up with

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,680
interfaces and user flows for the things

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,320
that we ship to our users a couple

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,730
examples include on the left the email

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,360
verification step during new user

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:53,310
onboarding and dead-center is our new

00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,800
channel profile page this is kind of

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,510
like cutting-edge stuff I think we ran

00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,680
it to an experiment group so far so it's

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,680
technically public

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,980
also dip into my roots as a developer

00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,590
using internal built systems like our in

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,900
a house divided prototype tool I built

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,940
in browser prototypes using knowing

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,340
react and typescript has allowed me to

00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,260
be just dangerous enough the biggest

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,930
benefit is deeply understanding how our

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,600
primitives work together in a kind of a

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,640
production like environment these

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,120
prototypes are used as proof of concepts

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,680
as well as tools for user testing but

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,270
I'll okay just like flexing on my

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,270
engineers every now and then

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:37,240
uh I'm also the designer responsible for

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,460
the great round if occasion of user

00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,190
avatars but something we did some eight

00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,480
months ago you'd expect this that I've

00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,550
been a fairly straightforward process

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,370
just update the default border-radius

00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:50,170
unum that's on our avatar component but

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:54,040
half of design is building support for

00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:55,750
your ideas so and and that's which don't

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,900
expect don't expect things to be that

00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,900
easy

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,020
now I've often wondered what has helped

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:06,090
inspire my creativity in these last 15

00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,100
years a lot of life and a lot of

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,360
learnings have happened how did I end up

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,270
working in such a rapidly growing

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,790
industry now I think it has a lot to do

00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:16,260
with very fortunate timing I grew up in

00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,329
the Internet age I had a computer at

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,100
home but above all there was one thing

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,670
that has continued to inspire me

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,670
creatively

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,590
do believe being born and raised with

00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,930
the values and hard knocks of a Hawaiian

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,630
culture that any impact I've been able

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,840
to achieve has been rooted in my

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,840
upbringing

00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:43,000
I'd like to share with you all today is

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:45,170
Cola here repeat after me :

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,990
so you could define Cola Hijaz

00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:50,050
mischievious rascal rogue or to be a

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:53,080
prankster

00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:57,970
one thing I know for sure Hawaiians are

00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:59,860
hollow here ah the invent of the flip

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,599
camera phone

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,849
amazing

00:05:02,599 --> 00:05:07,710
it's so cool oh hey it's in the Kona our

00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:10,830
metaphor in our music it's in the

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:13,050
stories retold in our history it's in

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,869
our nature a lot of growing up was about

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:17,189
having fun and going against the grain

00:05:14,869 --> 00:05:19,139
we'd always follow up talking story

00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:21,499
about our miss house either at each

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:24,119
other's houses or at the lunch table

00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:26,689
we'd always have a laugh at whose antics

00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:26,689
stop the rest

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,580
this one is allegedly me I say allegedly

00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:36,550
because you know statutes of limitations

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,070
and stuff I apologize if some time back

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,910
in 2009 you were randomly missing a

00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,910
rubbish can cover

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,350
now in hindsight maybe it was an

00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,840
interest in taking risks it was all

00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:53,500
about what stories would stick we're all

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:57,400
excited about pushing the boundaries and

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,400
seeing what we could get away with

00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,290
growing up Kahlua has taught me about

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,700
being calculated when taking risks what

00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:05,950
better way to grow comfortable with

00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:09,010
risks then throwing rationale at it

00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,690
right nowadays the consequences can take

00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:13,270
the business down so for that reason

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,870
I've come up with the framework on how

00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,870
to approach this

00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,850
so first set out what you're going to do

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,490
this is the fun part decide what you're

00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,380
going to try at work this is driven by

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,960
team goals and things that impact their

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,910
users in my former life this was

00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,570
probably driven by peer pressure and a

00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,570
lack of self-awareness

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,760
next step is the careful balance of risk

00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:42,910
and reward this is the exact part that

00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,430
we skipped when we were younger so you

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,110
know apply to tech with a B with an a/b

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,760
testing framework set up you can

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,040
actually mitigate risk by sending a

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,490
limited set of users to a specific

00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,490
variant

00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:00,790
now given you've thought about it adjust

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,790
your approach or just go for it

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,380
now assuming you did it learn adjust and

00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:08,680
depending on the type of project try

00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,680
again

00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,310
one of my first projects at twitch was

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,660
supporting the marathon team the

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,280
engineering team would take hard drives

00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,720
of episodes and stream them back-to-back

00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,830
for days on end using tools like ffmpeg

00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,300
we would also build out unique

00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,300
experience for these channel pages

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,650
marathon hit home for a lot of us the

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,539
marathon was unique because it added a

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,840
fundraising component for local PBS

00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:41,069
stations the marathon happened to add a

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,900
very critical time in 2017 of public

00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:45,300
broadcasting funding was under threat by

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:49,889
the new acting president I won't mention

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,229
names we wanted to see if we could for

00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:54,030
lack of better word manufacture delight

00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:56,669
for our users he had an ongoing

00:07:54,030 --> 00:08:00,479
hypothesis that getting users to meme in

00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:03,810
Chad would lead them to coming back who

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,490
wants to miss the next inside joke we

00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:07,349
did this by applying a black and white

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,000
CSS filter to the entire interface

00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:12,000
during the black-and-white episodes that

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,409
aired during the 1960s needless to say

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,779
we learned a ton from this experiment

00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:21,159
we indeed did get a negative feedback

00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:23,389
for one chat complain from telling

00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,369
others you know they did some like

00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:28,129
rationale calculation for how many eight

00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:29,419
seasons were left how long they had to

00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:31,489
wait until the black and white would go

00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:33,879
away or they just like stayed up

00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:36,099
complain because that's what chat does

00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:39,110
then we started seeing interestingly

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,699
YouTube tutorials start popping up for

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:42,940
how to actually open inspector and

00:08:40,699 --> 00:08:44,990
disable our CSS

00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,940
you

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,010
I had to hear I had to clear out

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,019
co-workers that weren't so amused by our

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:54,610
active Jess

00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:57,790
but then again we also got positive

00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:00,100
feedback that did what that does and it

00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,009
means in all of its glory there were

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:05,259
jokes about black and white TV and

00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:07,899
invention of color not only that but our

00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:11,790
fundraiser was largely successful we

00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:14,199
raised over 42,000 dollars for local PBS

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:17,170
on top of that we got really good

00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:18,759
feedback internally I had a director

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:23,490
reach out excited about our team being

00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,490
bold in finding ways that the later used

00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,940
making an impact on the world is just

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,450
going to take a little below

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,450
that's my boy

00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,930
okay so the next concept that I'd like

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:43,260
to share with you all is rooted in Aloha

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:46,120
repeat after me Aloha mine

00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,820
in our Aloha

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,680
very good so you could define Aloha as

00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,060
hello or goodbye I'm sure when you

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,280
walked in the airport you heard all

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,370
kinds shock about is like oh no Hahn's

00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,700
oh but it also means love affection

00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:03,570
compassion mercy sympathy kindness

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,570
sentiment in Greece

00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,570
here's a quote from probably the most

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,240
renown ambassador of Aloha Duke

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,590
Kahanamoku here he talks about his

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,480
perception of Aloha

00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:17,950
but distill it down Aloha is about love

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,850
understanding making friends and taking

00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,920
care of one another

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,840
he leaves us with the call to action to

00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,740
meet and leave people with Aloha

00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,740
everywhere you go

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:33,930
is a directional marker from my vocab

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:36,150
things out there so Aloha and off go

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:38,370
together means putting good vibes out

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,560
into the world be generous with your

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,320
time when people reach out for he'll be

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,670
happy to me a part of a part of it is

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,490
remembering where you were a year ago

00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:50,280
say five years ago think back to when

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,710
you just got started and be friendly

00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,210
smile make eye contacts day what's up to

00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:56,510
the guy that you see in the hallway all

00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,510
the time

00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:01,930
contrast the suffix my me reverses the

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:04,149
direction if done right opportunities

00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,800
will start to conquer where he opens to

00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:07,870
them that's the people you meet by

00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,779
default then calibrate by learning to

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,680
tell the bad from the good have an error

00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:14,470
of receptiveness

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,790
in to be an antenna for good things and

00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:17,790
good things will come

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,670
so for all my visual thinkers first you

00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:29,860
must carry Aloha with you everywhere you

00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:31,990
go this is the exact concept of Aloha oh

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,110
I don't like putting it out into the

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,110
world

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,600
surely people will reciprocate its kind

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,260
of the idea of Aloha money you'll end up

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,260
receiving it

00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:47,010
and you'll find that aloha propagates

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,980
aloha impact what's around you and

00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:52,700
what's around you will impact you that's

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,700
just how it works

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,140
in San Francisco its this hustle and

00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,030
bustle being surrounded by hundreds of

00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,760
thousands of people kind of all packed

00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:03,290
in this 40-something square miles it's

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,560
easy to forget the importance of being

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:09,380
kind generous and thoughtful but by

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,060
carrying aloha you stand out and it has

00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,060
even more of an impact on people

00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:21,079
how you would order one of these and

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,079
help by email

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,579
what would you call it

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,100
Oh bra plate lunch that's my dog with

00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:31,879
someone dog plate lunch mixed plate is

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,499
another word too so here is one of the

00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:35,600
more famous examples of a mixed plate

00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:36,889
over at rainbows drive-in it's about ten

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,439
minutes from here right off Kalakaua

00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:41,239
Avenue we can go check them out later

00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:44,359
tap me on the shoulder we go I get my

00:12:41,239 --> 00:12:47,959
4runner considered the variation of food

00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:50,499
here from mahi-mahi - chicken - Terry

00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:52,519
beef potato salad all over a bed of rice

00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:57,709
continue it on your plans that afternoon

00:12:52,519 --> 00:13:00,129
gravy all over all together this mix is

00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:00,129
heavenly

00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,120
a plate lunch is a artist sorry a mixed

00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,640
plate is a plate lunch with several

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,350
types of main or entree servings put on

00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,570
the same plate it's also how you

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,769
describe someone with multiple ethnic

00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:17,309
backgrounds

00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:20,790
California so a lot of us here have rich

00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:22,230
mixed Heritage's a quarter of us here

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,069
are mixed essentially in one way or

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,809
another

00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:27,179
researchers at Pew Research Center

00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:31,309
actually found that Hawaii has the most

00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:31,309
mixed people in the United States

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:36,160
one em a mixed plate

00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:42,140
Native Hawaiian Chinese Japanese

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:44,450
Portuguese Jeremy and all those squashes

00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:50,170
what we call it that's kind of like all

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:50,170
of the best foods all in one that's me

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,550
so I tend to also follow this path in my

00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,800
professional life UX designer UI

00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:02,329
developer motion graphics graphic design

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:08,389
data visit visualization it it tends to

00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:10,660
lead to a lot of inner turmoil but I

00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,660
digress

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,380
so this diversity range is a strength

00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,690
it's kind of like having more tools in

00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,120
the tool belt so to say and a recent

00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,250
piece published in The New York Times

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,340
the title says it all want to be less

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:30,240
racist move to Hawaii the articles point

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,240
expands beyond race

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:37,190
it talks about how navigating multiple

00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:37,190
worlds enhances mental flexibility

00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,839
of mental flexibility is what we call a

00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:46,200
cognitive bias it's known as functional

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,810
fixedness it's the inability to think

00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,820
outside of the box it's essentially the

00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:54,110
expectation that people have when they

00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,029
approach new problems with old solutions

00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:59,250
expecting different results

00:14:56,029 --> 00:15:02,100
even those arguing about texts have the

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:05,149
Paramount success as they say what got

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,149
you here won't get you there

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:12,090
Timur leading one remember the things

00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:15,330
that make you you it takes every one of

00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:18,740
us all aspects of us to create to

00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,740
produce creative solutions

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,650
at a mackerel or team level it's all

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,880
about finding you're surrounding

00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:29,310
yourself with people who think

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,140
differently than yourself during Hawaii

00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,900
we're constantly faced by different

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,110
thinking people from your friends to

00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,520
your neighbors to your classmates their

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,290
distant family members whatever and my

00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,430
cousins auntie's brothers husband's

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,640
husband's boyfriend

00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:47,160
oh we're constantly face to face with a

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,060
diverse population context switching

00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,060
becomes natural

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,310
not about hiring diversity to meet quota

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,440
hiring goes with novel problem-solving

00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:59,690
will improve your ability to innovate

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,490
and because we don't have the ability

00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,160
because we don't have the brilliant

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,690
minds of marginalized people

00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,529
contributing we need to start welcoming

00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:08,529
the man-boy

00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:16,870
concept I'd like to share is more

00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,870
clucking repeat after me both bye

00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,940
lokahi as unity agreement or harmony

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:27,860
Mulcahy in the canoe

00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,530
in canoes in my early teens to my

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,850
twenties we were super competitive

00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,850
we were absolutely obsessed

00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:39,360
in the troop in the canoe everyone

00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:42,030
serves a role there's no dead weight in

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,980
the boat once it's the pace and other

00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,460
watches closely to keep the canoe in

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,430
sync

00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:50,310
a couple stay true and just blast the

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:52,400
next works as utility man and the last

00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:55,820
controls the direction of the boat just

00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,820
like in

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:03,200
when applying lokahi at work consider

00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,200
the Triforce

00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,829
I'm

00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:14,620
really good Olivia it's a mix of experts

00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:18,500
in multiple disciplines at work it's the

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:20,360
mix of product engineering and design

00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,339
just like in the canoe we all rely on

00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,560
 on each other for what we bring to

00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:26,420
the team for example design brings

00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,670
visual thinking and a passion for the

00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,530
user experience engineering brings

00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,060
systems thinking and a deep

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:34,160
understanding of the feasibility of

00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,680
building a thing and product brings

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,160
coordination and an understanding of

00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,160
product liability

00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,120
to dependent dynamics between each of us

00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,120
it's critical that we trust each other

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,650
and gift me back when it's needed the

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,429
improvement of one of us strengthens the

00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,429
whole system

00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:59,279
in the end when we work together magic

00:17:56,759 --> 00:18:01,440
is the result at work it's building

00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,499
things were proud of in the canoe it was

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,919
state championships humble brag we won

00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:06,919
three

00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:14,920
so now it takes more than just the three

00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:17,770
of us at work like a child a good

00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,420
product takes a village consider how any

00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:21,250
of these affirm engines dynamics can be

00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,990
applied to the multitude of supporting

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,990
functions that exist on our team

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:35,830
you know you're my arnica wanna and that

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,630
means and so the story is told but what

00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:39,400
