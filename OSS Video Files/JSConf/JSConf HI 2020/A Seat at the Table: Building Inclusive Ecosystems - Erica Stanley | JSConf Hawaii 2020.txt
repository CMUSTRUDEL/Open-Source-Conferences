Publication date: 2020-03-22
Playlist: JSConf HI 2020
Description: 
	Inclusion doesn't just happen. It has to be intentionally and continuously cultivated. In this session, we'll discuss the ways we can all be responsible for building communities with an inclusion-first mindset. I'll describe my lessons learned and walk through a framework for optimizing for inclusion.

JSConf Hawaii will return in 2021

	00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,600
so I'm here to talk about creating space

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,730
creating a seat at the table and kind of

00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,980
taking some things away that we can use

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:25,560
to build more inclusive tech ecosystems

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,920
as anyone in here ever felt isolated in

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,900
a room full of people

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,329
have you ever felt the distinct feeling

00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,190
that you didn't belong in a space even

00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:36,770
though you have similar experiences and

00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:39,770
credentials as many of the people in the

00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,780
room to hold those thoughts because I

00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,600
want to tell you a story that kind of

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,820
shapes how I think about inclusion one

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,040
day long before diversity equity and

00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,290
inclusion were ever even conversations

00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,510
that we had in tech I learned what I

00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,030
feel is the foundation of inclusion from

00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:57,769
one of my best friends from college we

00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,170
were at an event that she was hosting

00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:02,539
and at one point I sat back and watched

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,660
her find ways to engage with everyone in

00:01:02,539 --> 00:01:08,390
the room as a raging introvert myself I

00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,190
was in all at the end of the night I

00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,700
asked her why does she put so much

00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:15,590
effort into engaging with everyone there

00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:18,830
to my introvert eyes it just seemed

00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,420
exhausting and she said I know what it's

00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,970
like to feel alone in a crowd full of

00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,800
people loneliness is the worst feeling

00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,289
and I don't want anyone to feel that way

00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,479
when I'm around that really stuck with

00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:31,909
me but it would be years before I would

00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,189
fully relate to that and could also do

00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:37,009
something about it I've worked in tech

00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:39,409
for over 20 years and while I've had

00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:42,439
some amazing experiences I could only

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:45,020
have had in tech as a black woman it has

00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,780
been at times isolating and also

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,030
honestly spirit draining and as long as

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:53,090
I'm here I don't want anyone else to

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,030
ever have to feel like that

00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:58,220
so almost seven years ago I started this

00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,380
journey of making room for people who

00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:03,590
are underrepresented or as I like to

00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,539
think underestimated in tech by creating

00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:08,420
organizations and events meant to

00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:11,709
empower and showcase marginalized people

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:14,050
so arlene hamilton bc extraordinaire

00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:16,370
created these t-shirts for people

00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:18,800
underrepresented people in tech with the

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,870
underrepresented part striked out and

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,730
replace what underestimated so i didn't

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,690
come up with that but but that's the

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,690
term that i like to use

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,970
so kind of at the

00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,980
this journey I started the Atlanta

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:34,070
network of women who code in the summer

00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:36,350
of 2013 and I'd love to tell you this

00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:39,290
was an intentional part of my journey

00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,910
but it wasn't a friend of mine was going

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,860
to start it and then found that she

00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,140
would be moving to the Bay Area

00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,090
shortly after so she was trying to

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,550
convince me to start it in her place but

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,350
I was doing my best to run from it I had

00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,120
worked with nonprofits and user groups

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,550
and meetups and I knew how much work it

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,170
would be but I also didn't want Atlanta

00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,730
to be excluded from the very important

00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,400
progress we were making with women and

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,950
tech simply because I wouldn't step up

00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,930
and organize women who coat their so she

00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,450
brought down the big gun Elena who's

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:10,400
originally from Atlanta came down from

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,990
the Bay Area and together they convinced

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,070
me that I wouldn't be completely

00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:18,290
terrible at it and then even after I

00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:20,720
started it I plan to just start it and

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,830
not mess it up long enough for someone

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,830
else to take it and run with it

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,780
but six and a half years later I'm still

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,780
a director there

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:37,239
and something I started noticing soon

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,519
after women who code Atlanta started

00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,260
really growing is that our presence in

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,700
the Atlanta tech community started

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,280
changing the conversations and

00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,019
experiences people were having and now

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,150
the Atlanta network of women who code is

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:51,670
one of the most diverse and active

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,980
networks globally our local leaders have

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,500
worked really closely with the larger

00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:59,019
Atlanta tech community for six and a

00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,170
half years to make sure our members over

00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,790
4,000 strong have a seat at the table we

00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:05,650
are making our mark on one of the

00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:09,250
fastest growing tech and startup

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,140
ecosystems in the country from women who

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,450
code we created this conference called

00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,150
we rise which was a women in tech

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:19,060
conference in Atlanta and the goal there

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,340
was this actually came about strictly

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,039
from listening to our members we had had

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:26,590
a hackathon all-women hackathon that had

00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:27,820
a day of workshops that I was telling

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,160
everyone like this is not a conference

00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,210
this is not a conference but everyone

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,530
was like that that a lot like a

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:37,030
conference Erica and so after it people

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,289
started asking for like okay so when are

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,270
we really gonna do a conference if

00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:42,430
that's not if that wasn't it and so

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,260
that's where we rise came from and we

00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,760
had a great time doing we rise we really

00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:49,840
wanted to make it an intersectional

00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,280
event and I think we did that but there

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,639
were still some issues and some

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,380
conversations we weren't having and so

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,780
we created a completely different event

00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,930
that started last year refactor tech and

00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,580
we really wanted to make this make sure

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,370
that we went beyond the conversations

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,470
around women in tech something that we

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,820
find a lot is that when we have

00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,130
conversations around women in tech

00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,870
people don't dig into the intersections

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:17,190
and the different groups within women in

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:19,930
tech and when you stop at one say

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,660
identity the largest group and that

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,000
identity is going to have most of the

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,010
benefits so a lot of times when you hear

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,389
women in tech what really happens is

00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,490
that you make games with white women in

00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,530
tech but you don't make a lot of gains

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,990
with different ethnicities people with

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:38,080
disabilities people who are members of

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:40,870
the LGTB community so we really created

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,539
refactor to really dig deeper and go

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:46,639
beyond kind of just surface level

00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:49,250
diversity and inclusion

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,689
and then from there I also started

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,129
getting involved with a lot of the

00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:54,020
incubators and accelerators in the

00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:57,530
community and really trying to find ways

00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:01,280
to make founders and funding more

00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:04,370
diverse and inclusive as well so what

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,099
this is is the story of my experiences

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:09,409
and how I have used them to create more

00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:12,909
inclusive spaces in Atlanta and in a lot

00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:12,909
of the organizations I'm a part of

00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,140
so the first thing is you have to find

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:21,010
and listen to your audience

00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,420
this is deceptively crucial point so I'm

00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,750
going to spend probably the most time

00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,700
here and you're probably wondering like

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:30,220
Erica you did you submit this talk come

00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,410
all the way to Hawaii walk on this stage

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,030
and just tell all these beautiful people

00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:36,940
to listen like we don't know how to do

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,700
that the thing is that this is low key

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,140
high key the most important part about

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,300
getting involved with diversity equity

00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,420
and inclusion finding your audience

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,770
means that you individually may not

00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,320
represent the audience that you're

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:52,750
trying to be more inclusive of if for

00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:55,180
instance you are a white sis header or

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,740
sexual men or woman in tech you may not

00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,930
be representative of the audience you

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,730
need to listen to to make a space more

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,280
inclusive for marginalized people in

00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,710
tech I do a lot of work with career

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,870
changers boot camp grads and people who

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,000
are new to tech but I've been in tech

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:12,370
for 20 years and I came through what

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,530
many would consider a traditional path

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,000
in tech so in the case of working with

00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,100
career changers and folks who are coming

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,620
through Tech and non-traditional ways

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,360
I'm not representative of the audience

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,880
I'm seeking to include so I have to

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,800
listen really well there and then you

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,410
have to actively listen to that audience

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,260
not just hear not just make them feel

00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,419
heard but take in and process what

00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,340
they're saying I don't know how many

00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:38,290
times this happened to me personally or

00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,450
I've heard it happen to someone else

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,669
from a marginalized background where

00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:45,070
they will share a uniquely hurtful or

00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:46,630
maybe discriminatory experience that

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:49,180
they've had and the people they're

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:51,700
talking to will immediately respond but

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,800
I've never seen that now let's dig into

00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,540
that a little bit just because this

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,760
person trusted you enough to share their

00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,850
lived experience a piece of their trauma

00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:03,910
with you doesn't instantly make you the

00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,800
expert on their lived experience so how

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:09,100
does immediately asserting your live

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,720
experience help them well you may have

00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,310
inadvertently helped them understand

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,710
that they can't trust you to respect

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,200
their story what you may have

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:18,880
unintentionally done is invalidate their

00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,210
experience because it's not one shared

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,090
by you or by the larger group and

00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:27,820
listening includes taking it all in

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:31,900
ideas suggestions feedback and

00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:34,390
I follow franklin leonard on twitter and

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,099
he recently tweeted if you aren't ready

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:38,110
for criticism from a community you make

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,690
art about maybe you're not ready to make

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,400
art about that community and that really

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:45,040
made me think on my experience as a

00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,180
community organizer and also just some

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,920
of the recent events that have been

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,800
happening in the local Atlanta community

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,290
and I responded with this this is also

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,880
true of organizations and events taking

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,760
and processing feedback is a

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,710
prerequisite to a lie ship if you can't

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,630
take him and process feedback from a

00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,950
marginalized community and work with

00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:05,020
that community to come up with solutions

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:08,910
that address their feedback

00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,910
you are not allied to that community

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,560
thing is you want to build for your

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,200
audience you want to Center the people

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,930
that you are making space for don't make

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,310
it about you or your sponsors or local

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:23,250
tech companies unless that's your

00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:26,010
audience focus on the people you are

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,840
making space for and I have found that

00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,910
you can't go wrong if you optimize for

00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,250
the most marginalized among those

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,950
communities you also want to make sure

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,630
that you build for intersectionality you

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,760
may have portions of your audience whose

00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:41,790
identities are at the intersection of

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,710
various marginalized communities there

00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,780
may be women who are also part of an

00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,210
ethnic minority for example my

00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,910
experiences as a black woman would not

00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,590
would likely be very different than the

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,680
experience of a white woman or a black

00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:58,050
men you might have someone who is

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,420
non-binary but also has a disability and

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,090
their experience at the intersection of

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,360
both non-binary and disabled is

00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:10,020
different from identifying as either

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:12,120
non-binary or disabled and again this

00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:14,280
was a big reason for kind of moving from

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,960
and event like we rise to an event like

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:20,230
refactor where we could really dig into

00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:23,110
some of those intersectionalities

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,329
you want to build for impact you don't

00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,399
want to allow the status quo to limit

00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:29,470
your impact you don't want to not do

00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,089
something because this it hasn't been

00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:32,589
done before maybe you're the person that

00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:35,639
has to do it maybe you're the one that

00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:35,639
has to push those boundaries

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,940
in listening and building for

00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,610
marginalized communities I have found

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,950
this to be true intent is much more

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,840
important than your ego you will mess

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,910
this up I have definitely messed it up

00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:52,130
you will mess it up with the best of

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:54,650
intentions but if your good intentions

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,420
are stronger than your ego this will

00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,880
allow you to listen to your audience and

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,650
apologize sincerely with the focus on

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,110
the community instead of centering

00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:05,810
yourself rather than the ill-fated

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:09,200
self-centered DoubleDown we so often see

00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:11,750
today and far more important than even

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,750
intent is impact and you can only

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:17,740
understand your impact by listening and

00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:20,140
working with that community

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,330
so this is a tweet from a good friend of

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:25,330
mine Mecca who's talking about how

00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,280
companies have been working to bring

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:29,260
more black people to their organization

00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:31,120
without talking to black communities and

00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,070
he's talking about another organization

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,050
deaf color being different and so I'm

00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:37,180
also commenting on this by saying you

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,250
have to listen to the groups that you

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,930
are trying to make an impact with you

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:42,400
can't claim to do great things for our

00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,830
community just because you do a thing

00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,110
you have to understand from the

00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:49,450
community's perspective the impact you

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:53,200
make the things actually get better

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:55,870
how are your results reproducible if so

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,970
how do how do we scale to understand

00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,980
those answers to the questions you have

00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:02,910
to listen and work with that community

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,910
that you're trying to include

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,320
and another point on impact if you cause

00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:12,050
harm it doesn't matter that it wasn't

00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,300
your intention to cause harm your impact

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:17,420
was harm telling me about your good

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,950
intentions does not remove that harm you

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,420
can only repair the harm caused by

00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:25,449
listening and then building with

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,449
positive impact not just positive intent

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,490
then the next thing is you want to get

00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,260
aligned with your team you want to

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:35,300
determine your mission and values

00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:39,110
together and make tough decisions with

00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,880
your mission in mind so for most of the

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,100
events that I do in the Atlanta tech

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,100
community these are the members of my

00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,440
team I'm wise and fearless team and by

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,140
saying my team I don't mean like they

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,210
are under me I am I am one their team

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:55,490
they are amazing

00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,530
and for about 90 percent of the

00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,090
decisions we make we almost always agree

00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:02,030
we can almost read each other's minds

00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:04,370
but it's that 10% that we're not quite

00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,140
aligned on all the time that really

00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:08,720
makes like coming up with your core

00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,340
values and really writing it down it

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,560
helps when you're trying to make some

00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,210
decisions decisions like if you want a

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,360
certain sponsor to be involved with an

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:20,480
event this has come up a few times with

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,150
us we have a sponsor in Atlanta that has

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,890
reached out reached out to us as almost

00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:29,290
the beginning of women who call it

00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:32,180
Atlanta and they are a company that is

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:35,240
that works in opposition to the LGBTQ

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,130
community community and we have not had

00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,080
them sponsor any of our events because

00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:41,540
we want our members to feel safe no

00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,460
matter what their background is to feel

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,810
safe at our events and so those are the

00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,090
kinds of things that having a core

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,710
values having your core values written

00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,060
out and having something you can refer

00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,460
to whenever it's a tough decision

00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,990
because nonprofits need money and so

00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,370
saying that you're going to turn down a

00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,990
sponsor and you're going to turn down

00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,640
this bouncer every time they come to you

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,920
that's a that's a big decision to make

00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,690
and saying that you have a mission and

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,830
core values that support making that

00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,830
decision is really important

00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,149
you want to be consistent you want to do

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:12,860
things like if you're a meet-up or a

00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:15,260
user group you want to meet in roughly

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,570
the same place roughly the same time you

00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,839
want people to understand what you stand

00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,820
for

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,490
so you want to have the same kind of

00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:25,070
messaging so you need to be consistent

00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,959
but you also going back to building for

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:30,220
impact you you need to be consistent but

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,220
not afraid to push the envelope

00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:35,490
and the next you want to empower a new

00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,350
leaders to help you scale your

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:41,840
collective efforts

00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:44,540
so this this graphic here is the current

00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:48,020
leadership of women who code Atlanta it

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:49,730
started with just me in 2013 and you

00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,290
know we were doing pretty well for a

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,330
couple of years there we could have just

00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,100
let it be one of those meetups that just

00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:56,960
has one organizers it just has one

00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,610
leader but we would not have been able

00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,100
to do all of the amazing things that

00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:03,620
we've done if we had not brought on new

00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,030
leaders and they have gone on to do even

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,520
more amazing things than I could imagine

00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,640
because they have their own you know

00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,530
goals and dreams that they wanted to

00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,320
aspire to more than half of these people

00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,160
are conference organizers themselves

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,840
conference organizers conference

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,970
speakers they've started their own

00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,250
meetup groups they've they've made their

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:25,670
impact on the community as well and so

00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,650
if you're trying to do more sometimes

00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,360
you you if you're like me you will try

00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:31,550
to do all the things and you will try to

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,500
do all the things at the same time but

00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,600
we are human and so it's impossible to

00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,550
clone yourself and try to do everything

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,120
at one time one of the best ways to do

00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:43,130
that is to train other people to lead so

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,380
that is what we have done with women who

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:48,350
code Atlanta

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,090
and then you want to scale selectively

00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,150
whether you're working with your team

00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:55,010
new leaders sponsors or partners you

00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:58,550
want to be selective and who you expose

00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:00,830
to your audience so again I told you the

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,390
story of the sponsor that we have not

00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,800
worked with and probably will never work

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:06,040
with unless they change their policies

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,170
around the LGTBQ community community

00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,480
there are other sponsors that would help

00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:14,540
us do amazing things but they don't

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,680
align with our mission our event

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:20,210
typically stays around 500 to 600 people

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,130
and there have been questions of if

00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,810
we're going to scale it larger but one

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,910
of the other questions we have to answer

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:28,310
is can we scale the tone along with

00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:30,560
scaling it up to being a much larger

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:32,510
event and so I would just say that if

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,120
those are questions make sure you can

00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:37,130
answer the questions around supporting

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,220
your marginalized communities first and

00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:43,040
if you can scale and still keep your

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,710
your communities that you are supporting

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,180
at the at the center of what you're

00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,920
doing they're not then it might be a

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,920
good decision to scale up but that

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,780
should always be what you think of who

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,820
are you exposing to your communities and

00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,290
how are you scaling in light of those

00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:00,540
communities

00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,129
so those are just a few ways that I

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,799
found to make room for the

00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:06,750
underrepresented and marginal

00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:09,750
marginalized folks in tech and anytime

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:11,880
you're involved in an event community or

00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,740
an organization these are things that we

00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,500
can all do to make our spaces more

00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,929
inclusive I feel like so many of us have

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,089
been waiting for a tech to become this

00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:23,549
inclusive industry that changes the

00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,199
world for the better but we are the tech

00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:27,179
industry that we've been waiting for it

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,250
won't happen by accident

00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:31,530
we have to intentionally do the work to

00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,990
make it more inclusive

00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,190
