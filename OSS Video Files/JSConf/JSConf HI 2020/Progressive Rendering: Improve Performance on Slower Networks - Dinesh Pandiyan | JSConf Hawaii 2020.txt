Title: Progressive Rendering: Improve Performance on Slower Networks - Dinesh Pandiyan | JSConf Hawaii 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-29
Playlist: JSConf HI 2020
Description: 
	Modern web applications have become increasingly costly in terms of size resulting in slower page load times in slower networks. Client Side Rendering (CSR) becomes a bottleneck in slower networks whereas Server Side Rendering (SSR) becomes a bottleneck when large volumes of content need to be generated in one-go.

Progressive rendering is a technique that allows us to flush portions of a webpage to the browser in chunks as soon as they are rendered on the server without having to wait for the whole page to be rendered. This will massively improve the FCP (First Contentful Paint) and FMP (First Meaningful Paint) metrics and reduce page load time in slower networks.

This talk will demonstrate effective ways to progressively render a webpage from the server to the client and highlight important performance aspects of rendering modern websites.
