Title: The Asynchronous Enterprise - Brendan O'Leary | JSConf Hawaii 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-16
Playlist: JSConf HI 2020
Description: 
	The one question I'm asked more than any other when talking about working at GitLab is: wait, you don't have any offices? That is often followed by a confused look or the direct question: How?

Writing down decisions, asynchronous communication, measuring results, not hours. Companies often aspire to these goals...however in an all-remote company, they aren't aspirational - they are requirements. GitLab has grown from 9 people in 2014 to over 900 people in 55 different countries with a valuation of almost $3 billion.

In this talk, we'll discover some of the not-so-secret sauce that GitLab has leveraged to achieve this growth. On this journey, our values have remained the same. We value collaboration, results, efficiency, diversity & inclusion, iteration, and transparency. And we've done all that without having any office, headquarters, or anything that looks like one.

	00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,380
so just tell a little bit about gitlab

00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:16,180
story first

00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,340
that's its kind of central to what I

00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:21,730
want to talk about and our history I

00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:25,260
think is a big part of that so let's

00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:28,750
let's talk a little bit about that so DZ

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,020
Demetri who originally wrote gitlab in

00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:35,260
2011 was actually from the Ukraine and

00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,239
the wasted our CEO who you learn about

00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,400
next tells the story is he had two

00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,690
problems he had no running water and he

00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,210
didn't have a tool that he could use to

00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:46,480
collaborate with his fellow developers

00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:50,580
at his job and he solved the most

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,580
important problem first and wrote gitlab

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:58,690
so then then later on an unnamed orange

00:00:56,470 --> 00:01:01,809
website CID was in the Netherlands and

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:04,269
Seoul get labs existence and thought wow

00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:06,670
an open-source alternative github this

00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:08,860
is a really cool idea like there's 300

00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:11,140
contributors like why wouldn't we have

00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,659
the thing that we all use to write code

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:17,650
be a thing that we can all contribute to

00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,420
this is really smart and he said Dimitri

00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,950
hey I think I'm gonna start get lab calm

00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,189
is that cool when Dimitri said it's

00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:28,030
open-source what you want and so Sid did

00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:30,369
and then again more lore goes that in

00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:33,130
about 2013 Dimitri tweeted I wish I

00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:35,979
could work on gitlab full-time and Sid

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:40,180
called him and offered him a job and

00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:42,700
Dimitri said yes and the story goes that

00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:46,450
said went down to the like Western Union

00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:49,420
in Amsterdam to wire some money to

00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,189
Dimitri to get it started and the person

00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,399
who Western Union said do you know this

00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:57,600
person and he said mmm no they said you

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,600
didn't meet them on the internet did you

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:05,759
anyway but it worked out it worked out

00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:09,110
and then another another huge

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,190
contributor contribution came from a

00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,700
gentleman named Camille who was in

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:18,780
Poland we never heard of him but he

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,190
contributed what is now the main runner

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,340
forget lab CI which is one of our

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,660
foremost products and so from the very

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,250
beginning we're kind of this very

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,680
distributed nature and you know in 2015

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,709
we went to Y Combinator and and now I

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,299
say we like I was there I was not there

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,799
we had the there was the typical Y

00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:38,640
Combinator experience everyone living in

00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:43,650
a house together

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:46,829
also a bus the gitlab bus which if you

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,640
look has our old logo on it which I

00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:50,579
don't know if any of you were around

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,069
when get live had that logo but there

00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:54,810
was a user at the end of Y comma R that

00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:59,549
said that they had nightmares about that

00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:01,280
logo though it's really bad UX to have

00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:05,010
your logo giving people nightmares so

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,660
change that one and then and then we had

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,950
our first office Radio Y Combinator says

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,060
well you have to have an office in that

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,530
office shall be in San Francisco so one

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,359
two three three Howard Street San

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,819
Francisco was our first office and you

00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:22,620
can see the team there that was also our

00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:24,410
last office and this is because people

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,720
stopped showing up to work at the office

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,400
so in the corner there I bet you can bet

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,890
which one of these people is the

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,780
salesperson

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:38,340
oh I love Hayden great but he was

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,040
driving in from Alameda and he decided

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,400
to stop driving in from Alameda because

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,170
that's crazy commute and oddly enough

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,400
work kept getting done right and today

00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:57,660
we've grown to where I have 1200

00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:00,930
co-workers at gitlab and they're in 65

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:06,290
different countries and we still have

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:09,660
exactly zero offices and yes exactly

00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:12,239
and I'm really proud of this fact like I

00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,520
love telling people about having

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,980
colleagues all over the world we have a

00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:20,180
map this map is on our website which

00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,500
shows you where everyone is so it's all

00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,800
six occupied continents there's nobody

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,940
on America and and like I said all over

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,320
the world when we added people in

00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,600
Greenland I noticed because it's like

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,450
they are in Iceland they popped up and

00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,450
and you see it there and I do mean

00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:40,470
everywhere I have two colleagues on the

00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:41,700
islands here in Hawaii and although I

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,700
don't think there's anyone in Alaska yet

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,710
so Hawaii you beat you beat Alaska to

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:48,840
the punch on this money

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,130
and so just to give yourself a little

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,650
that's kind of the background in the

00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,610
history of get lab and I'm just

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,950
wondering like how many people have

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,010
heard of get lab before today awesome

00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,690
good fantastic

00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,570
why Brendan O'Leary I'm a senior

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,160
developer evangelist forget lab and I'm

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,410
not going to talk a lot about get lab

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,380
the software today but talk a lot more

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,910
about get lab the company because as

00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,670
much as I believe in the product I was a

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:17,310
kid lab user before I was a kid lab er

00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:19,560
I'm more interested in the impact that

00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,900
we can have on the way people work

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,870
together with this this distributed all

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,120
remote model and so that's why I'm

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,630
making the case for what I'm calling two

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,390
asynchronous Enterprise and why is that

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,400
well technology excellence is clearly

00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:38,400
the new operational accident excellence

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,260
in business and the few tech world's

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,330
tech hubs that exist in the world are

00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:46,080
really not sustainable as the only

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:48,780
source of talent but it's also massively

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,750
complex the scale outside of those hubs

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:55,110
unless you have a map massive capital

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,510
investment right like so how has gitlab

00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,220
made this happen without either of those

00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,740
and I think the answer is a very simple

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,320
one and and that answer is trust but I'm

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,380
gonna I'm gonna define that a lot more

00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:10,470
as we go through it but first what's the

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,210
situation again I think you know eight

00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,590
years ago maybe nine years ago Marc

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,030
Andreessen said that software is eating

00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,500
the world I would say it's eating the

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,140
world

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,180
more recently still Marc Andreessen

00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,310
talked about cycle time compression

00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,900
being the most underrated underestimated

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,470
force and determining winners and losers

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,120
in tech and competitiveness of today's

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,700
businesses depend on how fast they can

00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,650
have their teams deliver code and which

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,230
is to say how fast can they deliver

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:39,180
value to their customers so accelerating

00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,390
the rate of innovation in all industries

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,800
has increased the competitiveness or

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:46,560
those industries and compute increase

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,420
the competitiveness for talent and and

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,430
leaders are slowly coming around to see

00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,010
this to be true

00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:55,050
and traditional tech hubs like in

00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,970
Silicon Valley or in San Francisco or

00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:59,250
New York are thought of as the center of

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:02,010
these types of revolutions and its

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:04,560
really it is still true to some degree

00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,870
but this latest data from indeed shows

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,100
us that the dominance is waning if you

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,680
look at the data over time which I

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,480
haven't graphed here you can see that

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,750
the dominance of these areas is starting

00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,180
to wane and companies are required to

00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:22,080
seek talent outside of your traditional

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,970
tech hubs and I think remote is part of

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,620
that solution so being remote right

00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:28,110
that's what we believe in a good lab we

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,430
are a hundred percent remote we don't

00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:33,330
have an office that's part of the

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:35,130
solution but I think and some folks will

00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,140
say distributor workforce I think

00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,610
there's a lot more to it than that and

00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,100
that's what I want to talk about so just

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,680
as important is working asynchronously

00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:46,710
right so sometimes you'll find a company

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,440
that may have remote workers but talks a

00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,120
lot about the time zones and really that

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,260
doesn't get you the full benefit of

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,750
remote because you want to be able to

00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,070
work asynchronous together and working

00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,780
across those time zones allow you to

00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:01,640
then have a lot more cultural diversity

00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:04,080
and ideas and new perspectives and

00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,700
includes different ways of working

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,980
together right there's folks of us that

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,230
will stand up on stage and talk to a

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,490
group of 200 people and folks I don't

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,800
want to do that right lay those we need

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:15,720
all of those viewpoints and different

00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,720
ways of working together to be

00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,880
successful and I think all those things

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,650
are what have enabled our kind of

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:27,900
unprecedented growth and then also I

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,240
like to caveat it with even though it

00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,950
seems like we have it figured out it's

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,290
definitely a journey for us as well and

00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,360
it's one that given our values you can

00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:37,550
watch and we'll talk about that in a

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,070
second

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:43,470
and so I think more boldly than just you

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,680
know let's work asynchronously I think

00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:48,000
that remote work is the future of work

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,050
and I thought I was the first one to say

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,010
no I didn't think I was the first one to

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:54,900
say it but I noticed when I was flying

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,750
over here

00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,920
I rewatched the Steve Jobs movie with

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,930
Michael Fassbender as Steve Jobs

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,320
certainly seem that Michael Fassbender

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:06,920
Aaron Sorkin only a few people okay

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:11,640
an interesting portrayal of Steve Jobs

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:16,920
and its opens with a News interview of

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:18,060
arthur c clarke in 1974 and he says you

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,250
know they're in a room with a massive

00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:23,880
room sized computer and there's a

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,830
reporter and his young son and arthur

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,770
c-- clark says well when he's in 2001

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,720
when he's grown up we'll be able to live

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,910
anywhere and well you won't have to be

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,840
worked stuck in cities we'll still be

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,900
able to interact with each other through

00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,210
computers and so that's kind of a bulk

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,840
prediction in 74 and makes me feel like

00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:44,520
i'm a little late to the game but this

00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:49,020
is not without its complications right

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:51,350
so there's a lot of challenges that come

00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:54,030
in in scaling a business to this side

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:56,460
and you know there's cultural

00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,690
differences there's countries and you

00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:01,470
can talk to our legal department about

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,760
how fun that is and there's time zones

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,450
right sometimes those are the really

00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:09,180
hard thing time zones are so hard

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,620
because asynchronous work is hard right

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,490
coordination with each other actually

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:19,310
takes longer than asynchronous work so

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,310
the real question is but will it scale

00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:27,059
which is the classs classic software

00:10:23,939 --> 00:10:29,639
question right how does one scale a

00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,739
distributed workforce without this

00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,499
capital investment because people don't

00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:35,879
have that kind of cash line around

00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:38,279
well there's gate lab business also not

00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:41,999
the only business to have looked at this

00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:43,769
so Basecamp is another company focused

00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:45,179
on remote and they have an interesting

00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:47,009
thing in their handbook both base camp

00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:49,709
and get lab have our handbooks published

00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:50,939
publicly I can't remember what there's a

00:10:49,709 --> 00:10:54,149
license that ours is actually Creative

00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:56,699
Commons licensed and they have a great

00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:58,769
statement in there that in order to work

00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:02,459
this way there's as much to unlearn as

00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:04,199
there is to learn and there's other

00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:06,019
companies that have done this as well

00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:08,489
automatic the company behind WordPress

00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:11,279
envision these folks are embracing

00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:12,719
remote but there's a lot of things that

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,329
you have to learn in order to make that

00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:17,029
work

00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:18,739
a more direct way that we put it and

00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:21,369
something that we always default to is

00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:24,829
our mission that everyone can contribute

00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:26,449
and everyone really means everyone you

00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:28,129
don't have to be in the same place and

00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:31,249
once you don't have that constraint of

00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:34,179
place it opens up the world in in ways

00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:34,179
that you wouldn't think otherwise

00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:39,320
out that's constraint of place our our

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,240
core team is right in our slack and

00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,470
that's on our zoom calls and just the

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,240
way we work working with the wider

00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,680
community with the open source community

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,360
becomes a lot more natural because

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,360
that's how open source works together

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:54,920
have a very clearly articulated set of

00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,420
values that we really stick to and when

00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,370
I first read about get lab again I

00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,839
admitted get live user and I kind of

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:03,080
thought okay this handbook it's a pretty

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:06,200
good marketing come to find out it's

00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:08,089
actually like 4,000 pages long and it is

00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,050
exactly how we operate the business like

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,050
if you want to figure out how our

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,300
finance people calculate every metric in

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:16,040
the company it's there

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,529
because that's that's the only source of

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,060
truth that exists and so the same is

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,490
true of our values and we talk about

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,649
them all the time so that's

00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:26,240
collaboration results efficiency

00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:28,430
diversity inclusion iteration and

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,430
transparency I want to talk about our

00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:33,769
each of these enable us to scale this

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:36,709
this asynchronous enterprise so this

00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:38,839
graph will see again right iteration is

00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:41,019
a huge thing that we talked about there

00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:43,399
the ability to take small steps and

00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:45,500
constantly adjust scope to make the

00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,060
smallest step possible allows you to

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,070
kind of skate to where the puck is going

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,730
to be to give a hockey analogy which

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:55,370
works really well in Hawaiian crowd but

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,810
but that's what it is right you reduces

00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,339
the need for coordination because the

00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,360
steps are a lot smaller the decisions

00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:04,490
you're making the changes you're making

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,380
are a lot smaller and how we do that is

00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:07,910
we focus on something we call the

00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,190
minimum viable change so you hear a lot

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,610
of folks talk about the MVP and Minimum

00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:15,110
Viable Product we break it down further

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:17,420
to say the minimum only valuable feature

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,550
and they break that down even further to

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,990
say the minimally valuable change this

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,209
is the labels really fast iteration

00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,920
because once you're focused on that you

00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:27,040
say well if this is change is

00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:30,800
objectively better than it is today

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,300
ship it so talk a lot about who's

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,670
directly responsible for a decision

00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,750
right so we have not a lot of command

00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,730
and control and not allowed to run

00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:40,130
something up managers and then down

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,230
another set of managers someone is the

00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:43,480
DRI for making a decision and they're

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,470
going to make that decision and

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,260
especially going to make that decision

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:51,829
if it's a two-way door decision so if

00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:54,920
it's decision that's easily changed then

00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:56,570
making that decision now is a lot better

00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,010
than waiting or someone on the other

00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,339
side of the globe to wake up to see if

00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:03,189
they agree with your decision

00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:04,959
and then we open merge request so we

00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:08,139
manage the company through our handbook

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,689
it's in get we make merge requests to it

00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:11,860
we call other people call them pull

00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:13,180
requests but you're requesting to get

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,209
merged that's a different story but

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,860
anyway we call merge requests it's

00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:23,019
already pulled no sorry I'm sorry I'm

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:24,910
off topic I'm off topic anyway but

00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:26,410
that's how we can collaborate async a

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,809
synchronous late because when we want to

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,490
change something that's not a PowerPoint

00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:32,740
that then has to get approved and

00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,480
thought about and those things we're

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:38,800
actually changing how we're doing

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:40,240
business through merge requests and the

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,029
second is transparency so we're gonna

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,199
record everything by default and we have

00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:46,019
to do this because we don't have the

00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:49,629
time to afford to train people in

00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:51,129
meetings we've said this every year and

00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:58,839
it's been true every year so I started

00:14:51,129 --> 00:15:01,120
in October of 2017 and I was about 150

00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,809
hundred and sixtieth and now there's

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,949
1200 of us in 2020 so the thing we've

00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:08,019
said at the beginning every year which

00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:09,910
sounded crazy is at the end of this year

00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:12,339
there'll be more people who have been

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,889
here for less than a year than the

00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:19,600
entire rest of the company right now

00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:21,279
and so that's massively a massive change

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,499
and without writing everything down and

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,259
recording by default you just wouldn't

00:15:23,499 --> 00:15:27,639
scale and and those are things that a

00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,870
lot of companies talk about wanting to

00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,129
do I hope I should write down decisions

00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,420
more often right oh we should be more

00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:34,029
transparent about how we're making those

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,040
decisions well when you are asynchronous

00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:40,569
and when you are all remote you don't

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:42,220
have the luxury to not do that and the

00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:44,529
other thing is then the receiver can

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:46,029
move a lot faster have the best most

00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:48,129
accurate most recent version of the

00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:50,430
information and get the message from the

00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:52,680
most reliable source

00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:54,540
and that's where part of the talk for

00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,820
Jay s cough come up with came I came up

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,830
with the title because it looks sounds

00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,330
familiar right

00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:02,100
you want to have the receiver receive

00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,480
the information when they're ready when

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,300
it's done and when it's were most

00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,340
reliable right so just like we'd want to

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,130
you know have our functions be

00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:13,350
asynchronous that's the same kind of the

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,650
same thing we do but with our

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:20,550
communication and also efficiency so

00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:24,300
this is another big key to what we focus

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,970
on so writing down down promises making

00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,170
sure that they're measurable goals

00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:30,540
having a bias for action so I talked a

00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:33,120
little bit about this but yes you should

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:35,940
have a thoughtful decision process but

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,680
she should make the decision and instead

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,140
of being fearful about making mistakes

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,230
make the decision make the mistake and

00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:44,980
learn from

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,970
and then again responsibility over

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,040
rigidity we talked about this a little

00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:50,540
bit we want to give people a

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,860
responsibility to make the decision and

00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,570
then hold them accountable for that

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,070
right the results right that's one of

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,250
our values is how we're going to be

00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,930
accountable and we do that by hiring

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:02,690
people that are that want that

00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:04,790
responsibility and it works out a lot

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:09,640
better than a lot of rules and approval

00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,640
processes to manage people with

00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,500
so talked a little bit about the

00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:15,950
handbook but that's where our writing

00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,870
down promises really start so it is the

00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:22,490
single source of truth the story I tell

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:23,990
about that typically is so the long

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:28,339
story you will have met me after this

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:30,020
because I'm gonna tell a story and so we

00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,400
once a year we get together somewhere in

00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,870
the world where he was the money we

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,930
saved from San Francisco office we get

00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:38,210
together and a week after I started we

00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,860
were going to crete greece right

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:42,410
actually bought a plane ticket for crete

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,610
before i started with a company I bought

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,400
my Mac because we didn't have an IT

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:49,330
department back then like Monday I was

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,600
like how do expenses work

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:57,309
not like $5,000 on my credit okay so

00:17:52,600 --> 00:18:01,000
anyway I went to went to Crete and I met

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:02,380
Sid there our CEO who you will remember

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,649
is Dutch which is important for the

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,649
story

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,150
and I'm like Hamid of getting good with

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,250
this guy because I love the handbook I

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,950
had read the handbook it convinced me to

00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,060
apply say day it's nice to meet you it's

00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,930
nice to meet you he's really tall so

00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:20,900
it's more like and I said I really like

00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,850
the handbook I just is amazing but good

00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,840
now that you're here what's written one

00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,840
way but we do it the other way

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:32,029
I don't know but I can get back to you

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,190
he said I expect you will you can slack

00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:35,870
me when you do flash-forward to me in my

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,789
hotel room the week after I started to

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:39,139
get lab in Greece like frantically

00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:40,909
trying to find something that's wrong in

00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:43,490
the handbook or what little I know about

00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:45,980
the company but that really instilled in

00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,750
me the fact that this is how we run the

00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,120
businesses is our source of truth for

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:52,710
how we're how we operate together

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,500
and then the other thing I always say to

00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:57,990
people is we communicate more about how

00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,390
we communicate with each other than any

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,710
other company I've ever worked for right

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,140
so we have a huge communication

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:07,680
guidelines it's again handbook gets down

00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,720
there oh one everything's in draft right

00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,740
there's nothing there's no final version

00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,840
of everything

00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,220
there's no proposals everything's always

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,500
in draft and always subject to be

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,670
changed

00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,410
next everything starts with that merge

00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,690
request so we talked about how the the

00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:23,630
merge request that makes it really

00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,250
obvious what exactly you want to change

00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:28,029
is proposed and transparent for everyone

00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,859
to see

00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:32,289
we use public channels so obviously we

00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:35,139
do also use a lot of slack but we're

00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:37,059
very focused on public channels so that

00:19:35,139 --> 00:19:38,799
if you're talking about something you

00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:40,379
need to bring someone else in

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,119
it's really quick to do that it's not a

00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:44,830
group DM which is like the worst UX ever

00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:49,719
if anyone to hear works for slack anyway

00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:51,129
um we we say thanks so we also have a

00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:52,539
public thanks channel where we're very

00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:54,849
intentional about thanking people

00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:57,729
because there is no you know slap on the

00:19:54,849 --> 00:20:00,580
back in the office or high-five and then

00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:03,609
we have this very horrible term we're

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:07,119
using very specific but Sid loves it so

00:20:03,609 --> 00:20:08,769
you know so we call Missy foo and so

00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:12,869
it's mutually exclusive collectively

00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:12,869
exhausted few words ubiquitous language

00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,970
so that we can communicate more simply

00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:24,640
but what it is is you know words mean

00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:27,070
something and we need to all have a

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:31,810
mutual understanding of those words so

00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:32,860
when we say in finance when we say a a R

00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:35,310
we know what that means

00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:39,190
ARR we know what that means or if in

00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:41,410
engineering we know we say you know what

00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:43,150
is a senior engineer when it comes to

00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,440
defining everything you can find a

00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:46,360
definition for it on the handbook and

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,960
it's critical and we don't we try really

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:54,700
hard not to have terms overlap any and

00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:57,700
all those things really add up to trust

00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:00,660
right so this is about trusting each

00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:03,920
other and kind of having a common ground

00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:08,510
where a trust can start

00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:10,280
and building that trust again is not not

00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:14,270
easy right it's not just you write it

00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:16,670
down and it's done as much as you'd want

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:19,250
it to be you have to actually also

00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,260
invest in individual relationships and

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:24,020
invest in group work relationships and

00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,580
so we're just as intentional about

00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:28,460
informal communication as we are about

00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:31,040
formal communication so we have video

00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,570
calls a lot of zooms happening we have

00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,450
virtual coffee breaks so that you can

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:37,580
actually you're asked to spend some of

00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,050
your time socializing and talking about

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:40,220
something outside of work or maybe

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:42,800
meeting someone from the other side of

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:46,010
the world and then the time in person is

00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,750
very important right so we want to focus

00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:50,120
that time in person on relationship

00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,310
building not on work so one there's a

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,050
travel stipend if you

00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:56,810
I think it's $150 the handbook would

00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,830
tell you but for every gitlab ER if

00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:01,640
you're going somewhere and you're gonna

00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:03,620
meet a gate lab team member you get $150

00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,540
towards your travel for every remember

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,640
you're gonna meet so there's 15 people

00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,290
in Amsterdam and you live in the US any

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,100
when I go to Amsterdam didn't get your

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:15,890
flight paid for we also focus a lot on

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,810
local meetups so there's a lot of Lok

00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:19,610
underscore channels and our slack that

00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:22,040
have the different areas where we have

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,960
you know concentrations of team members

00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,540
and then contribute which I talked about

00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:30,710
so we went to I've been to Crete Greece

00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:34,640
to Cape Town South Africa to New Orleans

00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:38,570
and we're going to Prague in March and

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,550
this is critical and also not a bunch of

00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:43,990
executives doing powerpoints right it's

00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:47,740
about forming relationships together

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:49,270
and when you build this trust I think

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,390
your employees and your co-workers

00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:54,429
aren't the only ones who benefits so I

00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:55,929
didn't stage this Aloha call for the

00:22:54,429 --> 00:23:00,460
conference although I definitely would

00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:01,929
have so but we had an Aloha call you got

00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:06,100
to have a Hawaiian shirt Friday somehow

00:23:01,929 --> 00:23:08,740
even if you're a mode right yeah exactly

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:13,480
but again it's not just the company that

00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:18,510
benefits it's a huge benefit for us as

00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:23,650
individuals right so there's a there's a

00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:25,030
stat from an academic journal about if

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:27,010
one spouse commutes longer than 45

00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:31,300
minutes that couples 40% more likely get

00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:33,550
divorced in the end our you know the

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,740
remote work allows flexibility and time

00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:40,750
for spouses and kids and partners and

00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:42,790
and where you need to live and in fact

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:45,130
we write this down of course then our

00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,620
values there's a term says family first

00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:50,470
a family and friends first work second

00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,970
and I experienced that myself this is an

00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:54,160
actual thanks I thanks to said to my

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,140
thanks channel so as I mentioned I have

00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,110
four kids

00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:00,280
my fourth I had while I was at gate lab

00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:03,220
and the transition coming back was just

00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,980
amazing I used to commute 45 minutes and

00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:11,920
it would be like okay going to work good

00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:14,140
luck versus being downstairs it's just

00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,100
unbelievable to be able to step away and

00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,290
help for 10 minutes is just

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,790
life-changing for for a family or

00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:21,340
anybody needs to take care of friends

00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:25,500
alone so thank you so much for your time

00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,500
you can follow me at a Leary crew and

00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:31,800
I'll post in the jobs channel too so

00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:31,800
