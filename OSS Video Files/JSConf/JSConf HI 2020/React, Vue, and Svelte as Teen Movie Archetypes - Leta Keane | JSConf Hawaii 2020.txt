Description: 
	Who's the jock? The nerd? The misfit? Who's the type A overachiever, or the moody artist, or the partier? Get to know each of these JavaScript frameworks through the hallowed medium of the teen comedy.

In this talk, we'll dig into what makes these frameworks unique, as well as the things they have in common. And, as in every good millennial teen movie, you'll leave with a better understanding of each one.
