Title: Impactful Accessibility: The Changes that Mean the Most - Lindsey Dragun | JSConf Hawaii 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-22
Playlist: JSConf HI 2020
Description: 
	The sad truth is that even companies that wish to have accessible websites often only dedicate the time and effort to create SOME accessibility. What they choose to make accessible is often based on what a handful of people, often abled bodied ones, decide, and doesnâ€™t always reflect what users want or need.

Using a series of surveys and discussions with other disabled people, I have synthesized suggestions and examples of what makes the most impact for many users or gigantic impacts on usage for smaller groups.We'll go over the look, feel, and functionality of websites and some basic design changes that can be used to great benefit.

okay this is impactful accessibility the

00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,780
changes that mean the most

00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,210
so a little belt me to get started I'm

00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,590
an accessibility engineer I'm a former

00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,290
technology evangelist

00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:26,360
and a full stack web developer I have

00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:29,510
multiple disabilities that actually make

00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,400
using the web a little difficult and I

00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,410
have an MA in international peace and

00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,870
conflict resolution which means I've

00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:39,470
done like a lot of studying of how

00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:41,930
people's worlds affect how they interact

00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:46,520
with other things and you can find me at

00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:48,980
tech Evangelista on Twitter I also added

00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,430
a bunch of puppy pictures to my slides

00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:56,659
like just now because I felt bad for not

00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:59,839
having more puppy representations he's a

00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:02,449
little sleepy because I'm on benadryl um

00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:05,030
about this talk this is not really an

00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:07,630
intro to accessibility talk I'm not

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,400
gonna be going over what a disability is

00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,310
what alternative input and outputs are

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,479
or anything like that it's pretty easy

00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,270
to find online

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,670
there's tons of intro talks around I've

00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:22,369
given them but even if you don't have a

00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,890
background in this there should be a lot

00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:28,130
of things that you can understand and

00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:30,049
take away from this talk I've also tried

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:32,149
to focus on the parts of accessibility

00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:34,430
that developers actually have some say

00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:37,579
in because there's some things that you

00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:39,409
need a designer to be willing to work on

00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:44,030
like color contrast or you need a

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:47,149
product owner to agree on and um I have

00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,579
a page with these exact slides like just

00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:52,759
a link to this google slide presentation

00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:55,399
and a bunch of resources on disability

00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:59,350
and accessibility at Dragon with a you

00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:03,079
like my last name dot tex /gs comp ye

00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:06,049
and just a disclaimer before we get

00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,810
started this talk is not the end-all

00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:11,090
be-all of accessibility obviously it's

00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,520
like 25 minutes long I had to cut out

00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,190
three sections it's it's not a lot um

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,770
even if you do everything I talked about

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,450
here if you do nothing else for

00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,300
accessibility you'll probably still have

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,310
bad accessibility and what is or isn't

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,480
good accessibility is also very

00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,180
dependent on your site and your

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,159
users even things like with Ag which is

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,930
the web content accessibility guidelines

00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:38,310
which are the standards lob government

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:41,610
uses can be wrong for your specific use

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:44,040
case users especially disabled users

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:48,110
obviously have a variety of needs that

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,879
might you might not think about it first

00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,250
probably one of the biggest issues for

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:57,659
accessibility on the web is giving users

00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:00,690
the information they need right so for

00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:03,120
example you as a developer probably

00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:07,470
shouldn't be writing the alt attributes

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,540
on your images it's copy unless you're

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:13,049
writing other copy you probably

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,799
shouldn't be doing this but let's say

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:18,629
that you have to because you probably do

00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,420
I'm gonna do like a brief exercise to

00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:24,510
get you into that mindset this is a

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,670
picture of my puppy Colby who's on a bed

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,440
playing with the toy and I want you to

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,900
study this for a few seconds and think

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:36,269
about what the relevant information in

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:37,919
the picture is okay so the problem is

00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,950
that depending on what your site is

00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:44,130
doing what is relevant is completely

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:47,669
different if you're doing a dog adoption

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:49,709
site and you need alt text for this

00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:51,959
picture you're gonna focus on the

00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:55,760
details about the puppy you're gonna say

00:03:51,959 --> 00:04:00,269
maybe long-haired miniature dachshunds

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:03,389
puppy of 14 weeks plays by himself

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:05,549
inside or something like that and then

00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:08,549
for the dog story you're gonna focus on

00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:10,079
the toy you don't really care so much

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,450
about the puppy you can be like small

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:15,930
breed puppy plays indoors with our

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:18,180
rainbow puzzle toy or something like

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,669
that and it's going to be a completely

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,490
different mindset depending on who your

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:26,930
audience is

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:29,639
because alt text is very dependent on

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,520
that sort of thing it's supposed to be

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:36,780
what your users would get from that

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:39,690
image if they could actually see it you

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,790
should also make sure not to use words

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,080
like image

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,970
I didn't use it in my little like

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,190
examples there because screen readers

00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,500
actually say image so what you end up

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,770
doing is like image image of a puppy

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:57,660
image image of a toy over and over again

00:04:52,770 --> 00:05:01,230
and it gets really annoying and also I

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:06,210
know like there's a big debate over what

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:08,430
is trivial images or not if you're doing

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,980
alt text you need to remember that like

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,470
there are people who have low vision who

00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,900
are also using a screen reader so they

00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,770
know that something's there but if you

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:22,620
remove it from the screen readers like

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,600
ability to tell them that you're going

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,670
to have people really frustrated because

00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,140
there's like this spot on the page that

00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,140
they just don't know what it is

00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,700
complimenting alt text is long

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,890
description so if you have an

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,530
infographic like this one I took from

00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,990
the web accessibility site dequeue or

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:47,340
you have a chart like this pie graph I

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:48,720
made the last night using Excel a long

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,390
description gives a way to fully

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,350
describe these all that information

00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:57,780
needs to be accessed by people and who

00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:00,150
can't see it or maybe can't understand

00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,650
it in the format it's in and I thought

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,730
it was appropriate to have a dachshund

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:07,560
for this one a long description can be

00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,950
accessed through like placing a link

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,070
next to the image or by providing a link

00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:16,410
using what's called longdesc attribute

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,750
like description that cut off because

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,100
all these things are really obvious and

00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,890
there's other options like the

00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,930
infographic that I showed just has the

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:28,170
page after it have the text from the

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:30,840
infographic and charts it's highly

00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:33,930
recommended to have a table with that

00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,430
same data like right with the chart so

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,390
people can figure out what's going on

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:42,150
and I did some web stuff during the 90s

00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:44,520
I know tables aren't really like a thing

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,250
people want to think about but this is

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,730
actually tablature data so it's actually

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,800
the point where you'd use a table which

00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,900
of course brings up this idea of like

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,360
semantic markup in general

00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:01,380
which can be very accessible on its own

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,770
right um sometimes using HTML just

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,900
better accessibility than CSS naturally

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:09,480
so when some people use spans or classes

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,660
to change how the letters or words look

00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,240
on a page that means that screen readers

00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,830
can't really access that so if it's not

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,540
just purely for design if you're

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,780
actually trying to get across something

00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:25,100
like say you're emphasizing a word well

00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:28,950
if you use CSS instead of like the e/m

00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:34,950
markup the screen readers can completely

00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:38,370
miss that another thing is using HTML

00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:41,910
properly like how can there be two main

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:45,240
sections on a page or like why would an

00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:49,260
h4 heading come before you even see in

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,200
h2 screen readers and also web scrapers

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,510
which are like search engines are

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,630
relying heavily on the structure of the

00:07:54,510 --> 00:08:02,670
HTML document so it's really important

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:05,430
to have actual proper structure and you

00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:09,120
shouldn't just use semantic markup but

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,580
use the right HTML right um don't just

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,860
make something look like something else

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,970
this is common with checkboxes list

00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,570
buttons

00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:21,540
Kolbe likes to pretend he's a bagel all

00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:23,700
different things so like usually it just

00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:25,980
makes it harder for screen readers and

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,780
can also make it harder for others

00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,930
depending on how their browser add-ons

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:34,800
or phones treat the elements on my phone

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:36,870
I have a option turned on to make the

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,760
buttons like way more obvious it puts an

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,490
outline around them it gives me a little

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,490
more space to press them but it works

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:48,960
for buttons not for divs that are used

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:50,730
like buttons and like buttons are not

00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,780
just for forms buttons are actually

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:56,370
really great they do things and people

00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:58,500
know they do things and there are

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,870
announced by screen readers as buttons

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,600
so if you're looking to do something on

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:07,710
a page you might just be skimming for a

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,730
button if you're going to do something

00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,310
that like trigger

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,380
is when a user presses something the

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,490
buttons generally your best option

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:19,230
and along with buttons you want to make

00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,720
sure you're giving like all the proper

00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,699
information right it's the whole I don't

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,370
want to just style something with CSS

00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:28,709
and have it actually have meaning if you

00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,260
disable a button if you make it say like

00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:33,240
really faded out or flat when your other

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,850
buttons aren't to tell people hey you

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,399
can't use this button you also need to

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,230
use the attribute that will let other

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,529
people who can't see the button know

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:48,180
that which leads into what's called Aria

00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:50,130
which is like markup like extra

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:55,320
information in your markup to give to

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:57,690
your screen readers it basically can

00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,790
give screen readers information about

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,040
the visual aspects of the page about

00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,260
steps in our process even about changes

00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,630
made on the page so like your login

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,370
screen maybe the only change you do when

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,320
something goes wrong is you put some red

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:13,800
text at the beginning to tell them that

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,870
their informations wrong well Aria lets

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:21,329
people know hey something changed you

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:24,930
can't see that red text Aria also gives

00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:27,720
you a way to turn that div into a button

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:30,750
as far as your technology is concerned

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,610
you can give it the role of button and

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,709
then it will be treated more like that

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,220
and for whatever reason you wanted that

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:40,620
div and sava button you can have it I

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:44,010
think it also provides alt text

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:47,100
equivalents right so um this is really

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,050
good for anything where it might be

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,180
ambiguous like say you have a button

00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,959
that has an X because it's gonna close

00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,480
something so you can tell people hey

00:10:53,959 --> 00:11:00,120
Aria label closed this isn't just a

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:04,050
random X sitting on your page you can

00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,740
use this but of course like it has its

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,130
downsides

00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:10,980
so one thing everyone who uses screen

00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,170
readers tells me about Aria is that the

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,949
worst thing then under use is overuse

00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:19,769
some things do not need labels some

00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:22,499
things don't need alerts and for some of

00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:25,799
this stuff it has no like

00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:28,709
character limit so you could really just

00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:32,189
take an icon of a house and explain it

00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:33,809
in details for paragraphs when all

00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:38,279
anyone really wants to know is it's a

00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:40,769
home button the w3c who made Wicca

00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:43,019
itself says that like no aria is better

00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:45,059
than bad aria because you could end up

00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:48,989
overriding actually good accessibility

00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:51,179
by using bad Aria which is like hard to

00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:53,789
imagine but browsers actually have some

00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:55,859
pretty good defaults going on that you

00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:57,389
can take advantage of so like if you

00:11:55,859 --> 00:11:59,279
don't have a designer giving you any

00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:01,229
specifics or you don't have a designer

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,109
at all and you're not sure what to do

00:12:01,229 --> 00:12:06,959
falling back on the browser defaults is

00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:09,089
actually not only just easy but it can

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,249
be better all right they have a focused

00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:13,619
indicator that's when you like keyboard

00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:15,869
navigate into a page like with your tab

00:12:13,619 --> 00:12:18,149
and it gives like an outline around

00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:21,539
something they have cursor behavior

00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:22,979
button appearance and all of that is

00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:26,970
something that people are familiar with

00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:29,249
who use these options just like seeing

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:33,779
an underlying link seems familiar to

00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:35,849
most people and not only do browsers

00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:38,099
have defaults but there's also a way

00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:40,229
that users can set them to perform

00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:42,959
better for them in certain ways and have

00:12:40,229 --> 00:12:47,729
it affect every page they go to such as

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:49,649
minimum font size ah so font size is

00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:52,199
obviously kind of important for how

00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:54,839
people read your page but even if you

00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:57,359
have like a reasonable font size it can

00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:00,179
also not be enough for people so they

00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:03,389
set a setting in the accessibility

00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:07,229
options in their browsers to never go

00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:09,899
below a certain font size which of

00:13:07,229 --> 00:13:11,939
course there's some like horrific CSS

00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:15,329
properties that allow people to keep the

00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:17,789
font very small which keeps people from

00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:20,639
being able to read the site because

00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:23,539
overriding the minimum can cause it to

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,889
just be unreadable

00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:29,129
there's also choices that you can make

00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:31,109
in the CSS in HTML that can mean that if

00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:33,439
that text expands it gets hidden by

00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:35,910
another element or goes off the page

00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:38,370
meaning that people miss out on him

00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:42,300
that you don't allow for your pages font

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:44,580
size to go so try to make sure your

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,430
users have the information they need in

00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,770
a format they can read it in whether

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:51,540
that's adding more code or leaving it

00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:54,630
out whether it's communicating directly

00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:57,840
with a screen reader or creating

00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:02,010
something any user can access it's

00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:03,990
really an important step but also in

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:07,860
order to get that information they

00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:09,870
actually have to navigate to it so with

00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,570
accessibility specific methods like a

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:15,270
skip menu link sometimes called a skip

00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:18,870
to main content link they can do that

00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:20,880
really easier so what is that it's like

00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,730
an internal link at the top of the page

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:26,790
that gives people the choice to skip

00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:29,910
navigation like say they're really

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:32,760
hardcore Amazon now that's like a bunch

00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:35,850
of menus there's a bunch of buttons it's

00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,640
just really complicated so when you tab

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,710
into the Amazon website they actually

00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:43,970
have a skip to main content link that

00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,970
just lets you skip all that

00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:50,340
so if possible like have it always

00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:52,380
visible but most people don't if you

00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,180
have designers working on this who agree

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,560
to do a skip content link they'll

00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,930
probably want it to disappear when

00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,790
people lose focus of it so make sure

00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,610
that people can get back to it and it

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:05,190
will be visible again also make sure it

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,140
appears really high up in your page so

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,840
that like they don't have to go through

00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:13,950
half your menu in order to skip the last

00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:15,720
half of your menu most people who are

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:17,730
familiar with us are also used to the

00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,880
language of it so something like skip to

00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,980
main content is really familiar to them

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,690
and you probably shouldn't mess too much

00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:28,740
with the wording search bars which we

00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,050
don't really think of as an

00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,300
accessibility need are actually a very

00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:35,490
similar deal people will just go

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,990
straight to the search bar instead of

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:39,000
messing around with your navigation

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:43,170
they'll type in what they need to search

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,910
for and they'll go to it right away this

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,580
is the same deal you want it to be like

00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,810
literally you want to be noticeable you

00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:52,689
definitely want a keyboard to be able to

00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,879
to it and use it and you definitely

00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:57,490
don't want it to disappear like I think

00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,319
probably all of us have had experience

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:01,209
where something we hover over needs to

00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:03,699
be like the cursor needs to be in the

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:06,999
exact right spot in order to have it

00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:11,889
stay up and that's really bad for a lot

00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:14,620
of people another one that people really

00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:17,499
don't think much of is sitemaps so

00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,449
there's not much to add to it it's like

00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:21,550
you normally Auto generate it and shove

00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:22,959
a link in the footer right but some

00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:25,809
people actually just use this to

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,550
navigate your site it they don't know

00:16:25,809 --> 00:16:29,649
exactly what they're searching for if

00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,259
they're like you don't have a search

00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:34,059
they might use your sitemap you want it

00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:36,309
in the footer you want it to be called

00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:39,339
sitemap like you don't want to do some

00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:41,259
cutesy thing with it and you want to

00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,149
make sure people can navigate to it so

00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:45,699
if you have something like infinite

00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:50,620
scroll and people never access your

00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:52,779
footer that's not accessible and there

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:56,559
are special features that you add that

00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:58,420
can go beyond the basic site that you

00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,189
might be implementing the are big

00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:05,140
headaches for literally everyone

00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:06,850
involved like modal's so um there's two

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,250
main issues with modal's for

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:13,000
accessibility that like everyone talks

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:16,539
about and the first is what we call a

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,970
reverse keyboard trap and it's when a

00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:21,069
motor pops up and the person's on the

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,929
page behind it and their keyboard

00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:25,600
navigating or they're using something

00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:28,830
similar to that and they cannot get to

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,330
your modal the two ways to solve this

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:34,090
all the easiest two ways to solve this

00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:36,429
or to just put the modal code physically

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:39,850
with the trigger like it should be the

00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:42,669
next code in your page so people just go

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:45,580
naturally to it but also there's a

00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:49,600
JavaScript answer and it's the really

00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:53,200
hard to think of focus method that you

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:58,000
just used to pass focus to something and

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,409
the second way is exiting so probably

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,659
even if you don't have accessibility

00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:03,280
needs you've experienced a modal that

00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:07,330
you cannot get rid of

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:10,000
and it's especially bad if you don't

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,160
have a mouse or if you don't have fine

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,950
motor control to like get a tiny little

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,350
button somewhere so the main way to do

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:21,190
this is you should have an event

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:23,230
listener for the Escape key and you

00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,820
should also have that X button we

00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,670
mentioned earlier for closing things

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:30,460
somewhere on the top which should be one

00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:32,800
of the first things people hit and if

00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,230
you can having an exit button at the end

00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,060
is very good too so people don't have to

00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:40,300
go back and forth to different buttons

00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:42,430
to get out of that modal and remember

00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,580
mobile users because that's where people

00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:49,570
have the most problem with it and that's

00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:51,160
where like a mobile a modal popping up

00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:53,470
that they can't close will just

00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,170
generally make people shift to a

00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:57,720
different site and just not come back to

00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:01,270
yours

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,490
so users must be able to navigate to the

00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:09,460
information they need and be able to

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:13,900
perceive how to navigate to so what's

00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:15,580
the general takeaway from this users

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,280
navigating websites to access

00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:21,910
information is basically what the web is

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:23,800
for there are many ways to make the that

00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:27,490
better for people with accessibility

00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,990
needs as a developer you have some say

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:31,240
in what you do with the code you're

00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:31,780
writing right maybe you can't change the

00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,330
colors

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:36,700
maybe you can't stop autoplay from

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:39,040
happening but you can make some

00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,560
decisions and by working in areas that

00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:45,240
will never even affect the design of the

00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:48,520
page you can improve the usability of it

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,980
by adding a little accessibility you can

00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,330
make a stressful process which is which

00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,780
for some people is going to be like

00:19:52,330 --> 00:20:01,980
nearly every website they go to easier

00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,980
on your users yeah thank you

00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,760
