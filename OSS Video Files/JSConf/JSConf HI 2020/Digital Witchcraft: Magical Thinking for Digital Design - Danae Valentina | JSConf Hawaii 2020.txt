Title: Digital Witchcraft: Magical Thinking for Digital Design - Danae Valentina | JSConf Hawaii 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-24
Playlist: JSConf HI 2020
Description: 
	This session present several examples of magical thinking as a design methodology for technological innovations.

Did you know that hackers and shamans have a lot in common? What does the practice of Santeria can teach us about digital security? Did you know that there's an android in a temple in Kyoto teaching Buddhism? Which elements of ancestral knowledge can we borrow in order to design solutions for migrants and refugees?

We will review the answers to these questions and will elaborate on the potential of magical thinking as a fundamental resource for innovation. "Magic is the mother of technology" said Peter Sloterdijk, thus we definitely shouldn't be afraid of combining this two realms in order to promote scientific innovation to its maximum potential.

I've been doing this research thanks to several sources of funding, mostly through my Mozilla fellowship and other sponsors I had in the last two years. Therefore, specific parts of this session have been presented in conferences such as HOPE in New York City and the Internet Freedom Festival in Valencia, Spain. JSConf Hawaii will be the first time in which my research on digital witchcraft will be publicly presented as a finalized product.

well hello my name is Vinay Valentina

00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:20,060
I'm a writer researcher

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:24,650
I'm originally from Chile and I'm based

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:27,320
in Rotterdam the Netherlands first I'd

00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:31,040
like to let you know a little bit about

00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,920
my background and so you know where I'm

00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,340
coming from

00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:42,859
well feminist writer I was born in Chile

00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:46,340
and in 2012 I moved to the UK to study

00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:47,989
at the University of Bristol and now I

00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:51,879
live in Rotterdam where I'm a

00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:54,850
postgraduate student in literary studies

00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:58,219
the topics of my research are

00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:02,719
posthumanist literature altered states

00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:06,080
of mind and the cyberspace but to study

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:10,130
all the stuff I needed money to afford

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,590
this kind of elitist education so that's

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:15,860
why I have been working since I was very

00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:18,740
young to get all sorts of gigs and

00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:21,890
scholarships and I've always been around

00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:24,890
technology around the internet I started

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:29,260
as a web developer in Santiago and then

00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:33,260
as project manager in several advocacy

00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:36,890
organizations of digital rights in Chile

00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,750
and in Brazil after that I joined the

00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,440
rights of collective I don't know if you

00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:46,130
know it is this where we provide secure

00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:49,400
communication channels such as encrypted

00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:52,400
email encrypted file sharing and we're

00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,140
mostly oriented to activists all over

00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,610
the world this journey hasn't been easy

00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,010
but I think that after all these years

00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,290
have learned a thing or two about the

00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:06,890
internet and at some point I became

00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:09,769
progressively more interested in its

00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:12,200
artistic literary possibilities and

00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:16,190
about how the Internet can become a

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:19,130
source for posthumanist thinking rather

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:22,160
than this worrying completely surveilled

00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:26,960
space that we feel the web is

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:30,620
today so in 2018 I joined the Mozilla

00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,620
Foundation as an open web fellow to

00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,280
study in non-western non conforming

00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:40,370
approaches to digital technologies and

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,640
from that experience emerge this the

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:47,360
digital witchcraft project which right

00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,220
now is an organization registered in the

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,070
Netherlands under the name of the

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,050
digital witchcraft Institute and well

00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,480
I'm extremely happy to be here with you

00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,730
all to present this experience of magic

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,230
and technology I'm super grateful that

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,350
you invited me to this beautiful

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,660
beautiful place and I know this might

00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,760
not be the usual kind of topic you see

00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,610
in this Czech conferences especially

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,480
because my outputs involved techniques

00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:17,060
from humanities and Social Sciences such

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,160
as interviews fieldwork critical

00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,400
discourse analysis so I would like to

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:26,630
invite you to look at this presentation

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,250
with an artistic literary lens rather

00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,850
than something that's coming strictly

00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:37,430
from the realm of computer science so

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:40,280
that's my huge disclaimer sorry well

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:43,790
these are witchcraft was a one year it

00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,190
is I want started as a one year artistic

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:49,310
research project with a strong

00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:52,690
connection to activism and notions of

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:55,420
non traditional modes of thinking and

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,700
everything started with this quote by

00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:03,290
Peter slaughter life he's a very famous

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:07,520
theorist on aesthetics magic is the

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:10,880
mother of technology this means that

00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:14,060
every technological advance started as

00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,340
an idea that seemed like magic in the

00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:20,600
first place like something supernatural

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:23,750
and I feel this kind of easy to confirm

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,720
this premise for our generation since we

00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:30,430
have experienced advanced in relation to

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,590
digital technologies in a very fast way

00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,220
for example picture your 10 year old

00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,800
self

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,810
begin to Siri every morning to ask about

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,870
the weather that's what I do almost

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,150
every morning after living the UK you

00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,610
became kind kind of obsessed with the

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:50,160
weather so every morning I'm like hey

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,520
Sarah what's the weather today and Siri

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,460
replies and I take my decisions for the

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,540
day according to series sensor my

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:02,520
younger self will have freaked out

00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:06,480
seeing that kind of thing witnessing

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,870
that kind of sorcery and I took this

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,420
quote magic is the mother of technology

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:15,420
very seriously thought a lot about it

00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,390
and started to realize that the

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:21,510
supernatural and the mystical references

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:24,180
are all over digital technologies it's

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:26,730
just such as magical references in

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,410
software releases the other day someone

00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,550
told me that there's a Linux

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:35,190
distribution called sorcerer sorcerer

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:42,930
also realistic software exchange I don't

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:45,600
know a makerspace pirating party ideas

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:47,100
of Technol shamanism there's there's

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,760
stuff like that all over digital

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,010
technologies so with the support of the

00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,710
Mozilla Foundation I traveled the world

00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,770
to see examples of this magic and

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,590
Technology intersection and to see if

00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:04,200
those cases could tell us new insights

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:08,780
for the technologies of the future also

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:14,850
that's the address of my brilliant

00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:16,680
witchcraft that works yeah so for this

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:20,460
presentation I selected the following

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,080
cases this one it was my first

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,050
exploration to this topic

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,410
it's about hackers and shamans as you

00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:30,270
see in the slide this was a comparative

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:33,600
analysis between the figure of the

00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:37,350
hacker and the shaman and I started to

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,680
main text the book shamanism by masala

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:42,840
he's one of the most famous scholars on

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,550
religious studies and coding freedom

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,930
that's an ethnography on hacker

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,000
communities written by biella Coleman

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,490
through the study I found several

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,330
similarities between the two groups to

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,940
name a few

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,400
there's the use of masks by Chairman's

00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,970
well the relation to death was something

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,490
that I

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:05,600
I always I found very it was very

00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,690
coherent between the two communities

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:14,389
that have the shamans and the hackers

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:17,500
the first paragraph is it's that

00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:22,160
description on how shamans face death

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:24,979
they believe that you need to confront

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,220
death in order to come back stronger and

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:32,360
with the answers you were looking for

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:35,330
and after that is this paragraph of a

00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:39,710
hacker describing a Linux installation

00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:44,030
as a confrontation to death he caused a

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:47,349
larval stage of hacking and describes

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:51,590
the issues like how the he neglects

00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:57,460
activities such as food sleep personal

00:07:51,590 --> 00:08:01,849
personal hygiene II and it felt very

00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:06,669
near death experience in order to return

00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:13,280
with the knowledge you were aspiring to

00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:16,729
and this thing is a video I did I

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,479
presented this on the hope conference in

00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:20,750
New York City

00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:23,330
have there some planet Earth and this is

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,210
an overlap of a shamanic ritual and a

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,400
hacking conference the rituals are very

00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:32,599
important to both communities maybe we

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:36,380
can look at this the weekend you can

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:40,120
picture yourself work with computers as

00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:42,129
some sort of channels maybe

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,680
I don't know I always felt like there's

00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:47,490
at the sound of the drum and there's

00:08:44,680 --> 00:09:16,300
some of the typing in our key words I

00:08:47,490 --> 00:09:20,290
kind of miss experience but I also have

00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:22,540
other case studies this for example is

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:26,829
something I always highlight it's about

00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:31,899
a research trip I did at Havana Cuba

00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:33,970
I started street networks in cool there

00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,189
because of the US embargo among other

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,040
reasons the access to Internet is very

00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:41,319
slow and very limited so the government

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,189
and many autonomous providers built

00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:48,370
Wi-Fi networks in selected spots of the

00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:50,259
city so people can connect and I was

00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:53,379
able to connect the situation with

00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:56,379
Santeria practices in Santeria this

00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:58,029
religion they have in Kula obfuscation

00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:00,819
is at the center

00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:05,170
it's a syncretic religion because it has

00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:09,610
to disguise juruá beliefs with Christian

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:13,329
imaginary and I realized that of guuuys

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:15,249
in us not connected nation they are very

00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:17,559
resourceful and they're computer

00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:19,990
scientists have been able to circumvent

00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:23,740
all the political limitations to

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:26,379
connectivity just like Santeria in the

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:30,389
picture there's a woman at midnight in

00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:32,800
Havana connected to a street network

00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:35,110
that's a weird thing to see in Latin

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,970
America you cannot go to the squared we

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,850
had midnight with your cell phone you'll

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,699
get robbed but you can do that in cool

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,459
and you see like this small rituals at

00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:48,649
night with all this blue hues in

00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:54,110
people's faces

00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:56,860
I found it very interesting - this was

00:10:54,110 --> 00:11:01,160
this is certainly one of the cases that

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:04,040
moves me the most is an Android I met at

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:07,519
the Cudahy temple in Kyoto last year

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,350
this Android teaches Buddhists lessons

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,740
especially around the concept of

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:14,569
emptiness which in Buddhism is a door to

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:17,959
liberation since you get rid of

00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:21,110
everything to me was very important

00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:24,410
because it opened the possibility of us

00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:28,059
cyborgs spirituality was really cool to

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:31,759
talk with the monks really old monks and

00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:36,079
see that they were taking the Android

00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:39,709
very seriously it wasn't like a soulless

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:44,059
machine to speak and stuff they consider

00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:48,170
the this Android as valid speaker to

00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:51,619
them we humans and machines are capable

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:53,899
of emptiness and I found it very

00:11:51,619 --> 00:11:58,399
beautiful if you go to Tokyo see this

00:11:53,899 --> 00:12:01,490
Android and this is the most recent case

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,759
I studied is about jinn or genies like

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:07,459
Robin Williams genie well of course the

00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:10,550
origin of genus is not his name these

00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:13,339
genes are a supernatural myth from the

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,529
Arabic world and the and and that's a

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:19,399
frame of one of my favourite films are

00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:23,120
Arabian night by Paolo Pasolini the main

00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:25,360
idea around genes is that they're beings

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,699
that live between the human and the

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,579
otherworldly dimension they can be in

00:12:28,699 --> 00:12:34,189
both worlds and I connected this idea

00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:38,269
with the notion of interoperability that

00:12:34,189 --> 00:12:40,399
free software promoters advocate for

00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:43,569
instance I think it will be so cool to

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,869
think about some deep interoperability

00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:51,619
what about poetry and computer science

00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:53,749
spirits and your phone the belief in

00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:57,490
genes is still very present in the

00:12:53,749 --> 00:13:00,750
Arabic world for example that

00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:04,180
there are forums where you see that

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:07,330
testimonies of genes that supposedly

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:13,660
took possession of computers and talk to

00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:15,850
you through some kind of chat it's very

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,459
appealing to think of a spirit taking

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,920
possession of your machines maybe it has

00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:24,610
happened to you sometime at some point

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:27,220
in your life but well all of those were

00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,589
case studies but I had to do something

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:32,050
with all this information because while

00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:36,279
I'm a researcher I consider myself an

00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:39,850
activist too so I always try to to have

00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:42,790
my output reach something more impactful

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:47,230
and my opportunies to promote an

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:50,350
exercise of speculative design and they

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:53,399
started at the Internet freedom festival

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:57,970
last year in Valencia Spain yeah Spain

00:13:53,399 --> 00:14:00,970
where with a group of technologists and

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:03,250
activists we developed advanced

00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:08,110
technology prototypes and used a

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:11,410
methodology where we have like magical

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:15,430
powers in one side and communities of

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:18,490
our interest in the other and it made

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:21,760
connections between the two like what

00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:25,510
this what powers this community might

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:31,690
need and with that with that with those

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:35,380
crosses we reach for prototypes of

00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:39,839
advanced technology I did with this

00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:44,470
experience I did a film a short film

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:47,050
that was screened in a couple of

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:54,490
galleries in Rotterdam and Amsterdam

00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:58,209
it's basically mean reading reading a

00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:01,360
poem plus several interviews I did

00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:05,170
around the world there's footage from my

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,300
research trips and there are the

00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:09,220
prototypes that we design it's also in

00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,749
this website if you want to watch it

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,850
someday

00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:15,759
I have a collaboration of my friend

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:18,249
andreas Tapia he's an industrial

00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,079
designer and he actually designed the

00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:22,720
prototypes we moved from the stage of

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:26,920
having just an idea to have a material

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,529
object I like to share with you some

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,410
bits of this short film it starts with

00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:35,230
this guy in the Amazon go store in San

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:38,139
Francisco he tries to explain how the

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,749
store works the ideas that is a store

00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:43,809
with no where you don't use cash or any

00:15:40,749 --> 00:15:45,730
form of payment and it's weird because

00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,899
it's like it's it's supposed to be very

00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:49,899
smooth and easy buddy

00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:51,490
everyone was super complicated trying to

00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:54,459
figure out how this worked

00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:59,579
it felt really like one of this Internet

00:15:54,459 --> 00:16:02,619
of situation but he was a Curie and

00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:03,970
and we started with this kind in in this

00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:06,850
situation that we're right now we're in

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:14,079
this in this in the technology is

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:19,420
working weird I'd like to share with you

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:23,379
the the part that Simona he is an

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:25,569
industrial designer from from Italy but

00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:29,759
he lives in Shanghai oh sorry

00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:32,499
but he lives in Shanghai he is in this

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:37,509
design studio the name is automatic

00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:39,850
automata he's super smart he I kind of

00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:44,459
had a crush on him he's super super

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:47,889
smart and he designs let me look at him

00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:50,379
and he designs with this really

00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:53,139
posthumanist vision and in mind where

00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:56,499
the human is not at the center so let's

00:16:53,139 --> 00:17:06,429
see what Simona says hope this is going

00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:08,799
to sound why should you I think taking

00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:10,299
the point of view of the objects and

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,679
other things is actually very

00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:13,720
interesting to look at the future

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,419
because and that'll be the problem I

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,519
think we had

00:17:14,419 --> 00:17:19,249
with design and especially user centered

00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:21,079
design that it only looks at the person

00:17:19,249 --> 00:17:25,489
has the center but you sometimes lose

00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:27,559
the the context and so by if you think

00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:29,359
on the field if you think about the

00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:35,869
future from the perspective of a Roomba

00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:38,259
or a cat or a river what is it and I

00:17:35,869 --> 00:17:40,399
think that's that's actually a lot more

00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:43,279
it's something that we definitely have

00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:45,409
to look at for for now like how do you

00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,149
go beyond I mean in some ways some

00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:49,940
people talk about of course there is

00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:53,359
like beyond you as a person in you as

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,039
you know whatever like why there is a

00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,350
hole like inclusion on discussion but I

00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:00,139
think there is also like the whole like

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:02,480
beyond human discussion and especially

00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:05,659
when you're talking about issues on

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,909
technology and things that have agents

00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:11,809
in your life we you also need to think

00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:14,269
about what is what is that thing doing

00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:16,789
what does it see there was a very

00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:20,720
beautiful work like years ago from FEMA

00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:24,409
had not used to be if you made the whole

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,570
super cut of all point of views of

00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:29,809
cameras and how do cameras see the world

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:31,850
and so you start to see how you know

00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:33,710
there are all these different algorithms

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:35,509
have different ways of determining what

00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,429
is what and sometimes it's vector

00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:40,340
sometimes it's boxes sometimes it's

00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:42,320
blobs but if you don't understand how

00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:45,169
these things see or have these things

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,149
why they behave then it's really hard to

00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:48,649
even have the discussion around what's

00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:50,659
the problem with AI what's the problem

00:18:48,649 --> 00:18:53,550
with ethics in technology unless you

00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:56,640
also see

00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:56,640
[Music]

00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:06,420
this is one of the prototypes that the

00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,420
weight is trying

00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:12,679
some sort of ship

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,450
extremely appropriate appropriate for

00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:21,450
migration

00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:34,020
[Music]

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:51,940
[Music]

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,340
yeah I guess so we did that that kind of

00:19:51,940 --> 00:20:01,230
we took that approach to the sign like

00:19:54,340 --> 00:20:02,450
think from the far far farm and to the

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,610
[Music]

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,409
- like the most extreme thing you can

00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,899
think and then the sign from that rather

00:20:07,409 --> 00:20:12,539
than from the things you already have

00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:15,679
it's very speculative it's not really

00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:19,590
super concrete but we took like this

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:26,519
opposite direction and I I liked it and

00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:29,250
I think it it can be very fruitful and

00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:32,600
so this is how we're going to be

00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:35,389
reaching the end of my presentation

00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:41,850
maybe we can reflect a little about the

00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:49,710
the impact of thinking this way first I

00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:54,330
think it could be important to use this

00:20:49,710 --> 00:21:00,480
magical thinking approach to switch the

00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:03,210
narratives we used to to think when we

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,320
think about tech and switch those from

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:10,470
profit to public interest there's lots

00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:14,990
of lots of research that revealed the

00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:18,450
bias in tech for example how many

00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:23,330
products smart products not really

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:28,049
consider issues such as race or

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:30,570
geographies from the global south I

00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:33,769
think is connected to the idea of taking

00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:38,340
back the tech that's a concept that

00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:44,870
cyber feminists use a lot lady of like

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:52,820
let's reappropriation ology and you said

00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:55,559
according to our own ethics and purposes

00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:59,250
third I yeah I wrote scientific

00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:04,740
innovation has to be adventurous I I

00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:10,020
believe that is true and it's important

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:13,289
to to be really reckless about it is not

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:15,100
that I'm proposing to that all of us

00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:19,480
have to become

00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:22,090
new age or anti-vaxxers not at all I do

00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,820
believe in scientific in science and in

00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,950
scientific innovation and this kind of

00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,630
way I was in California last week and

00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:32,080
theirs is full of mystical stuff

00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:35,289
psychics

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,120
everywhere also the boom on astrology it

00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:41,410
seems like there's a lot of people

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:45,610
trying to find something somewhere else

00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:48,360
and that that can be problematic because

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:51,250
it can lead to I don't know the scams

00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:55,360
stuff like that but it's also saying

00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:58,559
that there there is an important group

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,600
of people that is trying to think in a

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:06,480
different paradigm that the one we are

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:10,510
living in today and I think as

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:14,530
technologists have to I don't know get

00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:21,539
rid of our I don't know strictly

00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:27,309
concrete boundaries finally I think that

00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:29,080
I have this conversation a lot we kind

00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:33,880
of think that the Internet in the past

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:35,950
was kind of more fun we were it had this

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:39,090
feeling that everything was possible you

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:42,600
can you were able to choose your own

00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:46,840
identity everything it was anonymous and

00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:48,429
but that is not possible anymore and now

00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,169
is everything everything is super

00:23:48,429 --> 00:23:54,700
surveilled is super controlled by a

00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:59,110
couple of corporations and I think that

00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:01,510
a project like mine and a prig this is

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:04,299
not just me doing this kind of work in

00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:06,159
speculative design there's a lot of

00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:09,460
people in Europe and South America

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:12,340
working on this and I think it's an

00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:14,530
attempt to fall in love with an Internet

00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:18,909
again and not look at that as something

00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:21,870
I don't know that constrains you my

00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:23,549
intuition is that we can achieve that by

00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:26,530
[Music]

00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:29,290
running away from the

00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:34,330
big internet corporations and became

00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:40,120
becoming more creative more adventurous

00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:41,950
more reckless more magical and that's it

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,380
that's what my talk you can reach me at

00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:50,949
that email thank you

00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:50,949
