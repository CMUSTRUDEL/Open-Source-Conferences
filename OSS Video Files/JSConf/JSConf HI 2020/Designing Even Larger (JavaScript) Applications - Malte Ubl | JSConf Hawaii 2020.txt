Building frameworks is fun. And even if your project is using one of the awesome open-source frameworks, it might at some point reach the point where you need just a little bit more software infrastructure then you find on npm: Things may start with a custom build script and end with your own full blown framework.

But building frameworks is also difficult. And many folks might have read the first paragraph thinking “That is us, but I wish we had something clean, stable and most importantly standard instead”.

In this sequel to the popular “Designing very large (JavaScript) applications” talk, we’ll take a deep look at the principles of framework design and how we can apply them to build better software. We’ll look at how to go about designing a framework, how to ensure that developers like it, and how to make sure that systems get into a clean and stable state as quickly as possible.
