Description: 
	Custom Hooks in React are useful for much more than just managing the local state and one-dimensional side-effects you see in almost every React Hooks example.

They can be used to build sophisticated memoization pipelines and chained-effects that automatically manage local and network resources.

But most importantly, they provide a new new layer of abstraction to accomplish new and amazing patterns that we couldn't have just over a year ago.

On the surface, this abstraction layer is simply collection of custom hooks, but when unlocked, it can be the most powerful piece of your application architecture.
