Title: Very Responsive Typography with Variable Fonts - Mandy Michael | JSConf Hawaii 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-22
Playlist: JSConf HI 2020
Description: 
	Variable Fonts allow typography on the web to adapt to the flexible nature of screens, environments and devices.

We can use variable fonts with pre-existing technologies to improve the performance, design, accessibility and usability of our websites. We can start to design our typography to adjust to various inputs, situations or events using Media Queries, JS events and the Sensor or Audio Apis. This will allow us to modify our fonts to aid in storytelling, achieve improved readability and legibility in different situations, environments or on larger or smaller screens.

Letâ€™s explore new and exciting creative opportunities for storytelling, design and expression in ways standard fonts could never provide us. This is just the beginning of our journey to discover what we can do with variable fonts.

we're gonna be talking about responsive

00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,490
typography with variable fonts and what

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,349
I mean by responsive typography isn't

00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:20,150
like traditional responsive web design

00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:21,080
where you move a browser and stuff

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,330
change

00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,650
more about how we can make how

00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:29,330
typography respond to various inputs

00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,279
different API sensors that kind of thing

00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,280
but first what I'll do is explain what

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,900
variable fonts are before I do that my

00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,699
name is Mandy you can find me on Twitter

00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,530
mandy underscore Cerf you have any

00:00:37,699 --> 00:00:40,489
questions things don't make sense my

00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,149
dams are open

00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:46,070
most of my demos are up on koi pond at

00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:48,010
Mandy Michael so you can go and check

00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:52,190
those out later they're in a collection

00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:54,920
this is my dog jelly you will find out

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,930
why this is important why I had to tell

00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,070
you that my dog's name is jello because

00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,180
if I didn't things would get very

00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:05,330
confusing later so I wanted to explain

00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,770
how I fell into playing with variable

00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,289
fonts a couple of years ago I started

00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:14,360
making text effects with HTML and CSS

00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:15,950
and I came across variable fonts as a

00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,510
result of making text effects and it

00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,549
became clear to me very quickly that

00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,680
variable fonts offer us some unique

00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:24,380
opportunities that standard fonts have

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,479
never been able to provide us and the

00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,780
reason for that is that a variable fund

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,960
is one font file that acts like multiple

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,729
fonts and what I mean by that is at the

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,420
moment when you're loading fonts into

00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:41,210
your site say you have I don't know six

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,640
font weights you would have these as

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,619
separate individual files and you would

00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,200
load them in separately with a variable

00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:51,470
fund all of that information exists

00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,149
within one file and the way that this is

00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,240
accomplished comes down to how the font

00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:59,600
itself is made so a variable font can

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,340
contain one or more axes and each of

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,490
these axes represents different

00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:08,509
variations of extremes for a different

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:10,250
style so for example a weight axis might

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:13,790
range from a light weight to a really

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,530
heavy or black way now you can still

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,239
have all of the standard stuff in

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,400
between that you're used to like regular

00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:22,040
bold that kind of thing they're known as

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,469
named instances

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,269
you can also interpolate between these

00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:30,099
values which means you have access to

00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:30,099
all of the values in between as well

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,480
this means that we can animate between

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,400
the styles which is something that we've

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,660
not been able to do with fonts before it

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,750
would be really janky because you

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,310
couldn't get those smooth transitions

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:46,260
but we're not just limited to a single

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,980
axis at a time a variable function

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,510
contains thousands of axes and you can

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,420
interpolate between the combinations of

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,209
the axes as well so whether it's weight

00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,100
or wear like standard stuff like that or

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,800
if it's something a little bit different

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,350
this font is called de cobre it's by

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,470
David Burt furlough it's an experimental

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:11,040
variable fund it's one of my favorites

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:13,910
because it has a lot of creative axes

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,910
that you can play with

00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:18,860
now I'm going to show you some examples

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:22,810
with Jack over a bit later but before I

00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:25,100
do that I wanted to get the practical

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,190
implementation stuff out of the way that

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,680
people always ask first thing browser

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,930
support you can totally use them now

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,900
unless you have to support Internet

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,520
Explorer if you do have to support

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,350
Internet Explorer you can use CSS

00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,170
feature detection to fall back to a

00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,930
standard font so you know that there are

00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:49,670
ways around it the only caveat to these

00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:52,820
green ticks is that for Firefox you need

00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:56,420
to have high sierra and above on a Mac

00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,980
for example because Firefox relies on

00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:01,280
the operating system to render the

00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,110
variable fun chrome does not so you know

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,670
I see errors a couple of operating

00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:08,270
systems ago so that should be less of a

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:10,070
problem but it does require more modern

00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:12,120
operating systems to render the

00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:14,010
specification

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,680
when it comes to using variable fonts

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,919
it's the same way that we use fonts now

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,639
we use font face the main difference is

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,820
how we render sorry how we define

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,010
descriptors oh sorry the variations for

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,290
descriptors like font weight font

00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,010
stretch and font style so with a

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,960
standard font say you had a regular

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,150
weight and a bold weight you would do

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,860
one font face block for regular and one

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,389
font face work for bold and you would

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,120
keep doing this until you had all of the

00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:48,330
the styles that you need with a variable

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,080
font you just have to define a range so

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:54,060
in this case 200 to 700 and then when

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,030
you reference it in your CSS you can

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,910
pick any number from 300 to 700

00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:03,210
including decimal places so 658 point

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:05,580
seven five six is a random number but

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,410
you can pick anything

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,210
now this is really really good for

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,540
something like wait because we have a

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:14,610
CSS property for it this is known as a

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,370
registered access and all that means is

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,500
it's defined in the specification there

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:23,280
are five registered axes at the moment

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,660
weight with slant italic and optical

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,380
size and they're all matched to

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,599
preexisting

00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,610
CSS properties

00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:32,219
if you wanted to do something custom

00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:34,710
like deco var which I just showed you we

00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:37,669
need a new CSS property and that's

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,169
called font variation settings

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:40,999
now font variation settings will allow

00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:44,090
us to define as many registered and

00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:46,610
custom axes as we need and the way that

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,580
you use them is you define a four

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,499
character string which in the case of

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,900
custom axes is determined by whoever

00:05:51,499 --> 00:05:56,870
made the font so in this case me which

00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:59,569
is why it says jelly and then you give

00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,580
it a associated number value and you can

00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:04,460
just separate these by a comma and add

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,289
as many as you like you can use a

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,629
registered axis in font variation

00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:12,830
settings for something like weight it is

00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:15,560
w ght however I would recommend that you

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,840
don't there are some bugs in front

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,960
variation settings but the main reason

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,580
is that it's just harder we already know

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,949
how to use things like font weight and

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,830
font style and if you're doing fancy

00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:29,719
stuff font stretch on optical size so

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:31,789
don't change what you're doing already

00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:33,469
just to use a different property keep

00:06:31,789 --> 00:06:35,240
everything the same and then when it's

00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:37,360
custom use font variation settings for

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,360
that

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,949
the army it's pretty much the same as

00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:43,650
what we're doing now with a you know a

00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:46,410
couple of slight changes when it comes

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:51,919
to fonts on the web there's a whole talk

00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,919
in that for performance on its own

00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,420
or a variable font there's a couple of

00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,760
things about them that does make them

00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,530
quite good for performance but they're

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,240
still fun so you still need to have a

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,850
good font performance strategy things

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,460
like font display subsetting compression

00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,020
that kind of stuff there's two things

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,870
that I wanted to mention about variable

00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,760
fonts though that a good for performance

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,800
they're kind of unique to the fact that

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,780
they're variable fonts and the first one

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,300
is reducing the number of font requests

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,790
so one of the ways that we maintain good

00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,990
fun performance is trying to not request

00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:28,819
as many fonts to download

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,620
at the moment when we think about

00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:32,930
reducing the number of front requests

00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,000
we'd weigh up the cost of design over

00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:38,240
the cost of performance and we'd have to

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,819
justify the cost of adding new fonts

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,139
before we add any more styles in because

00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:44,360
of the impact that it would have on the

00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:46,220
performance of the site but with a

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,009
variable fund because all of the data

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:51,590
can exist within one file simply by

00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:54,020
using a variable font you reduce the

00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,420
number of front requests just because

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:58,820
that's what it does

00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,650
so not only do we reduce the front

00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,390
request but we also gain the benefit of

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,150
all of the interpolated bays as well

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:07,400
giving us more design opportunity of

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,410
course the problem then becomes if all

00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,290
of the data is in one file what does

00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:14,409
that do to file size people like it must

00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:18,489
be huge right

00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:21,399
my answer to this is not necessarily in

00:08:18,489 --> 00:08:24,279
my experience that's my terms and

00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:26,909
conditions variable fonts are either on

00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:29,860
par or better than the combination of

00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:31,689
your standard font weights for example

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,329
that you might be loading in your site

00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:36,399
just generally and an example of this is

00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:40,589
source sans Pro so this is the file

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,589
sizes for the wofe two versions

00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:48,520
a single weight of source and SPRO is

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,620
111 kilobytes the variable point is 112

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,660
the variable font has that single weight

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,670
plus all the other weights plus all of

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,610
the interpolated values so for an extra

00:08:54,670 --> 00:09:00,430
kilobyte you get like a significant

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:03,040
improvement in design opportunities now

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,830
sauce ants is a big font it has lots of

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,500
language support so I would subset this

00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:11,110
and standard fonts do subset a little

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:15,130
bit better than variable fonts although

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:17,440
not significantly but even if you had to

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,410
weights a regular and a bold which is

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,320
pretty common the variable font is still

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:26,140
smaller than the two standard weights

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:28,240
combined so you can get some good

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,550
performance benefits by switching to a

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,090
variable font

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:37,090
but this is obviously going to depend on

00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:40,030
the fonts you use your website stars

00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,290
what you're using so like don't quote me

00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,730
on this and come back to me later and be

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,650
like Mandy you said that my performance

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,300
would be better if I use variable fun I

00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,130
can't tell you that in every scenario

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,760
but there's an opportunity there that it

00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,760
might be better

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:58,090
so at this point what I want to to get

00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:59,680
into is the fun part this is a bit that

00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:03,660
I like in my talk we've done all of the

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:07,000
sort of serious housekeeping if

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,710
performance can be better even let's

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,380
just assume our performance doesn't

00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:14,550
change but all of a sudden we have a lot

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:17,920
more options for our styles in our fonts

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:20,170
much more flexible choices this means

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,210
that we can start to shift our focus we

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,550
can experiment with creating better

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,220
experiences for the people using our

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:29,530
websites and creativity can determine

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,800
our choices we don't have to start to

00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:35,240
trade-off design for performance we can

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,430
have both

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,490
this is something we don't often get

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:42,380
right always like oh no you can't have

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,690
an accessible website and a beautiful

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:46,580
website or you can't have a performant

00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:49,640
website and a beautiful website I'm

00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,440
telling you that you can variable fonts

00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,660
will allow you to do that but also just

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,940
generally you can like if someone tells

00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:02,090
you that they're wrong so for example

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:04,040
this uses 13 different font weights many

00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:06,260
of which don't exist in the standard

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,790
font so you can see that we kind of

00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,230
start to gain some more flexibility

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:15,200
designs which would have previously been

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:18,130
a very heavy burden on performance and

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,130
now completely possible

00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:24,170
this means that the tone the intent the

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,029
rhythm the meaning of our words can be

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:28,399
changed and they can be represented more

00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:30,170
effectively with less worry over the

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,680
impact of loading in too many font

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:38,770
weights this is what I refer to as jello

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,770
Epsom and I use it quite extensively

00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:45,380
it's pretty much just words that rhyme

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,089
with jello and a little bit of story

00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:50,839
about about him so you get to learn

00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:53,600
about him as you go speaking of jello we

00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,370
can embrace the learnings of print

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,020
design right when we start to do this we

00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,029
can combine variable fonts with things

00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,670
like CSS grid and blend modes and shapes

00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:03,980
and clip paths and textures and all of

00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,899
those great things and we can represent

00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:10,370
our content in more interesting and more

00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:12,020
engaging ways but unlike print design we

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:16,010
can embrace the interactivity and the

00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:18,080
flexibility of the web because variable

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,750
fonts can have the interpolated range of

00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,940
values we can create animations or

00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,279
transitions and we can do that with

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:29,310
techniques that were probably already

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:33,149
familiar with like this one

00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:36,060
this is a h1 and some CSS it's editable

00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:40,060
selectable searchable accessible via a

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:42,490
screen reader you can copy and paste it

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:45,270
and it only requires a little bit of CSS

00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,830
to make the actual animation work

00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,000
previously if we were going to do

00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:53,380
something like this it would have to be

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,050
SVG or canvas or something like that the

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:59,710
CSS to do that is this I have a font

00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:02,710
family depo bar by David Bailey David

00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:04,180
did does he's amazing he deserves all

00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:07,480
the credit in the world for this awesome

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:10,750
font we have an animation property runs

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:14,230
infinitely keyframe I've just called it

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:16,330
grow it's got two states we have two

00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,790
axes for this effect to work one's

00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:23,310
called inline and one's called skeleton

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:25,990
worm David named them I don't know

00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:27,580
skeleton worms starts at zero and then

00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,320
goes to a thousand in the next keyframe

00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,740
and then it just loops back round and

00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:36,150
literally that's it I added a bit of

00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,150
extra CSS for

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,360
texts y'all bought eats a background

00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,640
image and some text shadows the

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,760
heavy-lifting is really done by the font

00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,800
here

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:49,620
David kind of did all the work for me

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,530
and I just had to swoop in and add a bit

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,060
of CSS and then share out this awesome

00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:58,200
demo on Twitter and wait for people to

00:13:54,060 --> 00:14:01,380
go mm-hmm which they did and I was very

00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,930
excited about but I think this is really

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,400
amazing doing this with text is

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,230
something we've never been able to do

00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,900
before and there's lots of stuff that

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:12,240
you can do with text and variable fonts

00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:15,060
with just a little bit of CSS maybe a

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,430
bit of JavaScript this is a handwriting

00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,960
font by a foundry called underwear who

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:21,260
are doing really awesome stuff with

00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,670
handwriting you should check them out

00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:27,300
when I started making text effects

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:29,040
originally I would layer font a lot but

00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:30,990
the problem with that is that you're

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,970
loading multiple fonts in just to get

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,250
one effect but with variable fonts it's

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:38,220
only one font and you can layer things

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:40,370
to create the effects in a very similar

00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,370
way

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,790
you can do hovers and transitions with

00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,110
your weights or your wits and which like

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,010
I said earlier is something that we

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,010
weren't able to do before

00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:55,430
um I'm not really sure how to describe

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:58,880
this I just think it's really cool it's

00:14:55,430 --> 00:15:00,440
called wind VF every time I do this talk

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,280
I'm like I'm gonna figure out a good use

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,780
for this and I still still haven't yet

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:08,810
you can create weird things like this

00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:11,090
this is actually a Google font from the

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,350
v2 version of the Google Fonts API they

00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,290
have variable fonts there's about a

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:17,840
dozen of them so you can experiment with

00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,790
them with google fonts as well I have a

00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:22,700
blog called variable fonts Deb that has

00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,080
a tutorial on how to make this so you

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,110
can go check that out if you want to

00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,690
have a base

00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,339
or you can do something like this this

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,200
is deaf over again and this is my

00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,089
favorite demo and the reason that I love

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:38,800
it is because I love how the text shadow

00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:41,500
disappears with the text it's very very

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,950
beautiful and I just like to look at it

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:48,269
for a long time when I first made it

00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,269
chrome did not like it at all

00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:55,700
originally it would make my laptop get

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,320
very warm but they have fixed the

00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:01,820
performance of it now so it doesn't get

00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:03,110
as hot anymore which is nice as hot I

00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,170
said yeah a little bit

00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,680
so this demo this is marshmallow my

00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,680
dragon

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:15,980
away from that mic so when I started

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,990
making text effects

00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,610
I eventually got bored of the fact that

00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:21,530
they were just there so I started

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:24,350
experimenting with alternate inputs if

00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:26,840
this doesn't work I have a backup of a

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,860
button but that's boring so I'm going to

00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,630
say a word

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,900
to marshmallowy and he is going to

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:35,880
breathe fire in that word using my

00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,269
awesome variable fun

00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,269
byah

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:45,529
so this uses Dec over again it's like a

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,949
bunch of axes and what I love about this

00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:50,779
demo in particular is that I always

00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:52,490
wanted to create via text but I could

00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:55,100
never get it to look like fire so

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:57,790
instead what I did is I made the rest of

00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:01,249
it look like the fire text I could make

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:03,559
but I like how it kind of the text

00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:05,689
itself becomes part of the illustration

00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:08,390
and the interactivity and although you

00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:10,640
can do this with canvas and SVG we've

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:13,010
never really been able to tie our actual

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,760
content into designs it's always kind of

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:18,919
added on as a feet is like a layer and

00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,360
it doesn't blend as well into the

00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,220
background but with variable fonts you

00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:26,360
can start to tie those things together a

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:29,510
lot more effectively Thank You

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,980
marshmallow that was spectacular

00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,600
so it's not just that these are

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,310
beautiful or cool effects right what

00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:37,310
they demonstrate is that as developers

00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:39,170
and designers we can control the font

00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,300
itself and that means that variable

00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,950
frontal our typography on the web to

00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:46,030
adapt to the flexible nature of our

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:48,770
screens our environments and our devices

00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:51,650
this means we can also make the most of

00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:54,770
things like dark mode for example to

00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,690
change the way our fonts are represented

00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,230
in different color schemes or

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:03,700
environments so for example we could

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:07,470
change the axis of one of our fonts in

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,730
prefers color scheme media query

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,000
and that could give us something like

00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:11,000
this

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:19,100
it oozes because it's dark mode right

00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:21,530
I made this at Halloween and thought it

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,740
was hilarious I still think it's

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:27,080
hilarious so this is a bit of a silly

00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,059
example but more practically we can

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,370
modify the contrast and the styles of

00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:34,250
our text to ensure better legibility

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:36,110
when we think about color contrast and

00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,150
dark modes and things like that

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:41,179
we're usually thinking specifically

00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:44,419
about color and that's obviously

00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:46,880
important but the colors that we use can

00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:49,370
affect the way our text is read and how

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,200
legible it is so you might actually need

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,940
to change the weight a little bit or the

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,059
width a little bit or the optical sizing

00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:59,030
to make it more legible in a darker

00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:01,669
interface but also if you think about

00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:04,130
this from a user preference perspective

00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:05,840
if a variable font is available to

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,059
developers and designers it also means

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,530
it's available to our users so for those

00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,929
people that need to make custom

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:14,630
stylesheets for accessibility reasons it

00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:16,429
means that they can customize the way

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,789
the fonts are rendered to suit their

00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:22,070
specific needs and that's very exciting

00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:24,020
to me I like the idea that we can give

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,179
our users options for their own

00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,530
preferences and I know there's a

00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:30,980
variable font being developed at the

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:34,100
moment that helps people with dyslexia

00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:37,039
to change the way that let how far

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:39,679
letters are apart the shapes of them so

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,049
that they can read content better and

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,360
this is very important for critical

00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:46,880
interfaces or public websites like

00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,490
government hospitals those kinds of

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:53,450
things so rather than designing for I

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:55,460
guess the average you can give people

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:58,669
the opportunity to customize it to their

00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:01,640
needs but also it means that we can

00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:03,980
change our design and our typography to

00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,840
adjust to things like screen width that

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,720
might allow us to tweak font way with

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:13,120
Optical size or other axes to be more

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,120
readable on larger or smaller screens

00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,890
so whether viewport is wide we might

00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,390
have more detail or when the viewport is

00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,870
smaller you might want it to be heavier

00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:26,030
so it's easier to read or I mean if you

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:30,440
want things to fit in a confined space

00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:33,020
like a box you might be able to do that

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,340
too I'm sure you can think of some good

00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:37,460
examples of where that might be

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,410
applicable another example is when you

00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:42,410
have designs which are designed to fit

00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:45,230
as a certain breakpoint in this case i'm

00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,180
reducing the width of the heading as a

00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:49,400
viewport gets smaller so it doesn't wrap

00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:51,740
onto a new line this means i can

00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,260
maintain the integrity of my design and

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:58,040
i can determine when the text is going

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:59,960
to wrap or stack on new lines now I do

00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,430
this with a bit of JavaScript and I want

00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,260
to show you how it works because once

00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:07,130
you have it you can do a lot of cool

00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:09,920
things so we need a couple of things the

00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,740
access range so in this case 200 to 900

00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:16,820
font weight and the event range so

00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:20,029
viewport for this 320 to 1440

00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:22,930
we get our current viewport with window

00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:25,090
don't in a wit or something

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:28,750
then we need to convert that to a

00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:32,320
decimal so we take the current size we

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:35,470
minus the minimum we divide that by the

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,230
maximum minus the minimum size and that

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:41,799
will give us our decimal

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,809
we type that decimal place we multiply

00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:46,120
it by the minimum weight minus the

00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:48,929
maximum weight and then we add the

00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,929
maximum weight on

00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,070
GSS however you want to do it I'm using

00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,160
CSS custom properties because they're

00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,080
amazing whack it all in a function it

00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,940
looks something like this don't worry

00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,680
about the code I will share my slides

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,510
later there's also it's all in fun

00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:07,810
github as well so you can just copy it

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:10,240
from there and crouppen once you have

00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:13,270
this put it in an event listener for

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,910
resize in this case and that's how you

00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:18,100
make it adjust to the viewport now as I

00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:20,110
said you can pass any event or access

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:24,670
range into this so you could pass in

00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:26,710
scroll events this uses Chi by I know

00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:28,390
type clue took me longer to figure out

00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,780
what word to put in this than it did for

00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:35,050
me to actually write the code but bloop

00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:38,320
I think nailed it you can tie it into

00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:40,300
device orientation it's funny that my

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,770
phone is cracked in this but that wasn't

00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,590
intentional

00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:48,130
it's actually way worse now which is a

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:50,440
bit embarrassing or this one I love this

00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:52,270
one I made this last year this changes

00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,110
the font weight and a transform of each

00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,110
individual letter

00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:02,280
there's this one so now this wasn't

00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:05,160
coming up very nice on this projector

00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:08,370
but I'll see what it looks like

00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:11,060
yeah so this one I might tweet the link

00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,110
out so you can see it so it looks better

00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:16,650
it's cold whoa

00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:18,990
bye scribble tone and it uses a mouse

00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:23,640
position to change the angles and the

00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:27,170
orientation of the axes in such a cool

00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:30,690
font where's my mouse there it is

00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:34,260
so we've also got one like this this

00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:36,570
uses the Web Audio API and it listens to

00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,430
the sound of my voice what I'm going to

00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:45,030
do before I explain why this is cool is

00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:47,070
get all of you to go whoo yay so why I

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:49,230
think this is cool aside from the fact

00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:52,700
that I like people to woo at me when I'm

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:56,880
onstage is that if you think about

00:23:52,700 --> 00:24:00,660
speech-to-text api it's like or Google

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,910
home Alexa those kinds of things when

00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,710
they convert our speech into text you

00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:07,760
kind of lose the tone in the intent of

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:10,470
your words but if we could combine

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,660
variable fonts with Web Audio and other

00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,220
technologies we could start to represent

00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,440
what we're saying in much more

00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,440
meaningful ways so we don't lose that

00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,460
tone and intent so the messages that we

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,890
send to people through these speech

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,000
api's can actually convey what we want

00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,370
rather than people may be

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,690
misinterpreting what we're saying

00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,039
but I think that's super cool I'm just

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:36,039
going to stop that so it doesn't keep

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,529
running in the background um so this one

00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:41,590
I'll just get my prop here my broken

00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:43,690
phone this one uses the ambient light

00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,059
sensor so I just put the light up to my

00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:48,370
laptop and this is the same technology

00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:50,919
that causes your light your phone to dim

00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:54,130
in low-light environments and what is

00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,480
really cool about this is that if you

00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,610
think about the fact that we don't

00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,020
always sit inside an office with perfect

00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:01,140
lighting sometimes people were using

00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,880
tablets and moving indoors to outdoors

00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:07,720
you might want to change the way your

00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,309
text is rendered to be more readable for

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,470
critical interfaces you might want to

00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:14,260
make sure that it's whatever situation

00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,789
they're in they can read what you want

00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,919
them to see so sometimes it might need

00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:20,049
to be heavier rather than really thin

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,580
and this one's called tiny and I just

00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:24,399
think it's a good demonstration of the

00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,080
effect so you can make things more

00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:29,370
usable and more accessible with these

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,370
kinds of technologies or

00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:35,980
because this is me you can also create

00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,830
really interesting storytelling this

00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:42,190
one's called blooming GX by type Achuar

00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:43,600
Arthur who makes this fondant makes the

00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,340
most incredible variable funds you'll

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,990
ever see in your life it actually

00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,340
renders better on firefox but the

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:51,210
ambient light sensor doesn't work in

00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,440
firefox so I couldn't couldn't show you

00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:56,520
but there's a lot of opportunity here

00:25:53,440 --> 00:26:00,250
for creating experiences which allow

00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,230
users to to experience our website based

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:04,630
on their specific circumstance and their

00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:07,179
specific experience and I think that's

00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,309
really exciting like we don't have to

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:12,039
keep designing things that work a

00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:13,899
specific way for every person that ever

00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:15,580
visits our website we can create

00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:17,740
something that's just for them in the

00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,549
moment that they're in at the time that

00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,549
they visit our sites

00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:34,100
and finally this Arthur made a jelly

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:38,540
font so that you can pop jello in font

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:41,750
form this is probably the happiest I've

00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:45,250
ever been in my entire life that my dog

00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:45,250
now has a font

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,870
absolutely delightful so it's only

00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:53,310
because variable fonts give us control

00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,530
over each of these elements that we can

00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:57,060
fine-tune font characteristics to

00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,130
maximize things like legibility

00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,110
readability and accessibility of our

00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:03,540
website text and I know that some of

00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:05,970
these examples might seem trivial but

00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:09,260
what they are are possibilities we're

00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:12,030
demonstrating the options that you have

00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:14,550
variable fonts are still very new and

00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:17,370
this is a level of control over our

00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,820
fonts that are unprecedented we have

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:22,610
never been able to do this with actual

00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:25,070
text

00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:28,480
but mean this is an exciting place to be

00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:30,920
in on the web we have technology

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,010
developing all the time new sensors new

00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:36,290
API is new CSS new JavaScript and we

00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:39,260
have more opportunities than ever to

00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:42,410
combine create and present content on

00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:45,770
the web in more creative more meaningful

00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:48,590
more purposeful and do so in a more

00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:50,510
performant and accessible way there's no

00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:53,930
reason that we can't have all of these

00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:57,080
things and build amazing experiences for

00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:59,240
our users so at the very least you could

00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,520
create a more performant website just by

00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:05,179
using a variable fun that's cool it's

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:08,269
also you know a little bit boring

00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:10,309
but at best we can do all of these cool

00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:15,679
amazing things and start to create

00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:18,169
websites that are not just for everyone

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,179
to feel the same experience but to give

00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:22,279
them something that suits their needs in

00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:23,659
the moment that they're in right now and

00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:24,830
I think that's really exciting and

00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:26,960
that's why I get excited about the

00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:30,349
future of web typography with variable

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,320
funds if you want variable fonts B -

00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:35,450
fonts comm is the best resource my blog

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,830
variable fonts dev hasn't been updated

00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:38,869
for a while but I will be doing that

00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,700
again soon and these are some great

00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:41,990
