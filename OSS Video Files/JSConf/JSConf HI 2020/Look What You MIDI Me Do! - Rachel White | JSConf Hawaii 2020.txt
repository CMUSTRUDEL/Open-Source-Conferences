Title: Look What You MIDI Me Do! - Rachel White | JSConf Hawaii 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-16
Playlist: JSConf HI 2020
Description: 
	Who loves pushing buttons? You? And you over there? And the person behind you? Oh wait, everyone loves it?!!? Of course they do, a button is irresistible. Now… what if I told you that you could hook up a LOT of buttons to your computer… and use it to do wild things with the web?

I’m glad you’re listening! Let’s take a journey into the Web MIDI api where the possibilities of the web aren’t just at your keyboard fingertips anymore, they’re literally any MIDI compatible controller you have connected! Want to make glitchy audio responsive visuals with WebGL shaders? Rad, we can do that. Want to create custom beats and have those input as a drum machine? No problem when you throw a little Web Audio API in the mix. Let’s dive in and find out how!

	00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:15,049
all right yeah so um my favorite type of

00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,480
programming is attempting things that

00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:18,950
I've never done before which is an extra

00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,220
reason why I shouldn't be a full-time

00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:24,080
software engineer cuz I love the whole

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,399
process of failing and learning from it

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,290
which i think is really important

00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:31,460
especially admitting that in front of

00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:35,870
hundreds of people so as that artist

00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,760
residency I did a series where of

00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,790
artworks that were called new romance

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,469
and I took a play it well it was a play

00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,379
on Neuromancer by William Gibson

00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:47,690
obviously but um the reason that I did

00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,550
this project was because I wanted to

00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,550
blend special-effects makeup and

00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,649
Technology together to better visualize

00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:58,519
what modern cybernetic augmentation

00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:01,579
could look like and I did this in the

00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,489
sense that this is digitalized makeup

00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:06,290
and when I had the show to show people

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,700
this they were like whoa that's really

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,909
cool but it's also weird and I don't

00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,200
want to go near it but they also didn't

00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:14,390
know how I did it so I got to talk to

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,160
them about no BOTS because this is just

00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,220
running on an Arduino and it's a simple

00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:21,350
circuit that I soldered together and the

00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,020
face is Angelina Fabro it's making you

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:27,050
oddly like familiar with it but you

00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,300
can't put a finger on it um yeah so

00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:32,360
weird art and Technology stuff like that

00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:35,270
and so that leads me to what we're

00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:41,180
talking about today um I do visuals

00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:42,950
under the name ms paint ms paint this

00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,730
was a show that I just played in January

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:49,250
out of festival called Magfest it has

00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:50,900
30,000 attendees and like was

00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,380
surprisingly not as scary as tech

00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,750
conferences yeah when I started doing

00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,670
visuals I was using tools that other

00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,770
people had made already and I was like

00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:04,310
why not make this harder on myself and

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,840
build my own tools so I do a lot of

00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,450
these chiptune shows and I wanted

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,890
something to work for myself

00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:14,030
the thing that I had been working with

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:15,920
before was called women and excuse me I

00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:18,560
was using this for a while it's only

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,510
available for Mac what it is is it's an

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,850
old-school type of video synthesizer

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:24,950
that has like patch board stuff that you

00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:28,430
could factor in and it was really cool

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:31,390
but it was very specific and I'm gonna

00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,390
show you what it looks like

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,440
so it has a bunch of these patches so

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,520
that you can pick different kinds of

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,760
simulations of however they're altering

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,730
the waves and you can change it in here

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,760
and you can hook it up to a MIDI input

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,830
and save it and then you can get really

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,260
wild back here I don't even know I read

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,880
the I read the instructions a little bit

00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,390
but I gave up because I was like that's

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:04,040
that's just way too much and so I was

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,040
like I gotta I gotta do something myself

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:12,390
right and then steer like why why would

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:15,270
you do that yourself um so I already was

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,610
doing visuals so it seems like valid

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,280
time and effort output to you know do it

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,020
myself and and I also love challenging

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,740
myself like I said I love trying things

00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:28,290
that I've never done before so my

00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,140
process going through when I make things

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:33,960
is probably similar to like how a lot of

00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,820
other people put things through I think

00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,010
of it separately I'm like okay cool so I

00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,900
have this I had an idea of how I wanted

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,700
to control the input because I wanted to

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,040
look cooler than just like standing up

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,600
on stage with a laptop and pushing

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,090
buttons I was like I want to look even

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,540
cooler this thing this is called a MIDI

00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,520
fighter

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,380
it is a MIDI input through USB there's a

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:57,690
bunch of buttons there's a potentiometer

00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,250
inside there's buttons on the side and I

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,690
was like I would the way cooler up on

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,240
stage with one of these things than just

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,560
a laptop so I have my buttons and I know

00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,780
I wanted to do something in the browser

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,850
so that I could build that and then I

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,420
was like alright so how am I going to do

00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,620
this and then I'd figured out how to put

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,470
them together in a hard way essentially

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,590
and that was you know learning a whole

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,150
new way API so maybe we all know about

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,600
I'm gonna give you a little bit of a

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,770
history of the protocol and so it's an

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,169
acronym that stands for musical

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,210
instrument digital interface and it's a

00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:32,640
way to connect devices that make it a

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,800
make and control sound so some people

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,110
think that like when I talk about MIDI

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,540
I'm gonna be talking about the sound

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,590
that gets like that but we're just

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,490
talking about the messages that

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:46,050
communicate with it and so it's a

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,430
protocol that allows electronic

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:49,500
instruments and synthesizers to

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,419
communicate meaning a user can control

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,360
multiple electronic instruments from one

00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:57,630
synthesizer or a computer there used to

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,690
be no coherent way for manufacturers to

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,520
do this but then in 1981 at the Audio

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,770
Engineering Society convention in New

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,380
York Dave Smith proposed a rough version

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:09,210
of a universal digital interface that he

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,990
called a universal synthesizer and

00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:14,910
interface or USI and he was like gonna

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,370
go out and meet all these people and not

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,060
that many people came so you know he was

00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,290
basically like

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,940
here's my project and I want other

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:24,780
people to contribute to it and everybody

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:27,810
was like it's always been a problem

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,210
apparently except somebody that did show

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,639
up was equatorial kakehashi who was the

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,490
founder of roland at the time and so the

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,840
following year they displayed the fruits

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:40,560
of their labor and it was a

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,270
demonstration on how MIDI worked and how

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,190
it was born and then they went a

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,820
technical Grammy for it in 2013 which is

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:52,380
cool and yeah so how does MIDI work

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:54,630
specifically and the most important

00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,060
thing to know about MIDI is that it is

00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:58,950
based on the idea of message passing

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,440
between devices so like pieces of

00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:03,360
equipment or software and so you have a

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,830
keyboard and a synthesizer and you would

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,510
like to record a sequence using the

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,190
sounds that are in the synthesizer and

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,139
so you connect them so that they can

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,479
communicate using that MIDI protocol and

00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,610
start recording and when that happens

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,440
you play notes on the synthesizer and

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:18,600
all of the physical actions are

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,229
transmitted as MIDI messages to the

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,330
computer sequencing software which

00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:26,430
records the messages and so many

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,620
messages are brief numeric descriptions

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,560
of an action which I'm going to show you

00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,050
with the web MIDI API when I push the

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,289
buttons on them so that can be key

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:39,660
presses joystick Wiggles knob turns

00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:42,650
they're all encoded and you know you are

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,850
interpreting what those messages mean so

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:48,510
when you hear the sound that you're

00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:50,610
making it's not because of the MIDI it's

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,110
because of the messaging that the MIDI

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,110
is telling the synthesizer together

00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:59,690
basically the computer isn't making the

00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:02,690
or isn't recording the sound itself yeah

00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,690
sorry

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,320
why is my slide deck yelling at me sorry

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:13,080
about that

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:14,640
oh so the concept of channels essential

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,080
to how much meeting messaging works and

00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,880
that's an independent path over which

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,250
messages travel to their destination

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,860
there's sixteen channels per MIDI device

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,750
and a track on your sequencer program

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,790
plays one instrument over a single

00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,350
channel when dealing with the musical

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,850
application maybe messages in their

00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,010
track find their way to the instrument

00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,900
that channel like I said we're not

00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,990
dealing with music today we're dealing

00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,640
with web MIDI and the MIDI a typical

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,770
typically enables synthesizers drum

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,570
machines you know like the music stuff

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,760
that we talked about but since it

00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,100
doesn't transmit the audio if you wanted

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,900
to make a drum machine using the web

00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,360
MIDI API you would just use the audio

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:53,880
tag simple so you could build your own

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,980
drum machine if you like the other kind

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,300
of thing that you can use it for is live

00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,440
event controls for lighting and special

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,469
effects really it's like you can you can

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,530
do whatever you want

00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:09,150
so the web MIDI API spec supports MIDI

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,759
protocol by allowing web apps to

00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:13,889
enumerate and select input and output

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,819
devices on the client system and send

00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:20,159
and receive MIDI messages and you're

00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:22,229
able to utilize non music applications

00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:24,719
as well as music ones by providing low

00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:27,840
level access to the MIDI devices on the

00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:31,650
user systems and the web MIDI API gives

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,829
you an output that tells you what kind

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:38,279
of device is connected and you can do so

00:08:34,829 --> 00:08:40,709
much with it it's really really wild um

00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,779
I've said this a lot I'm gonna skip over

00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:46,260
it use the audio tag if you're wanting

00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:47,760
to make music basically web MIDI is

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,680
really enabling a new class of

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,640
application that can respond to MIDI

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:57,540
input using external hardware so use it

00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:00,529
along with other api's and from 43 and

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:03,060
up and you're you're ready to go okay

00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:06,529
well so I'm going to show you some demos

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,529
now of how it works

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:17,459
all right now also ignore the

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:22,170
deprecation messages in the console

00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:24,600
alright so where is my screen

00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,510
alright so the way that you use MIDI is

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,800
you request MIDI access it's built into

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,830
Chrome so that's why I'm able to not

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,240
have anything else in here

00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:35,520
yeah it requests access to the MIDI

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,170
device and this is how you can see if

00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,460
the browser supports it if it doesn't

00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,460
it'll tell you it does not

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,980
you

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,980
and then this is going to output the

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,890
the object that I was telling you about

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:55,370
before that talks to you about MIDI

00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,370
inputs

00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:03,290
and the MIDI outputs because not only is

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,720
a button press it's the press the hold

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,460
and the release depending on the MIDI

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,390
device that you have that outputs all of

00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:13,730
that messaging and then this one also

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,950
the one bad thing about it is since it's

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,270
a potentiometer like every single

00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,980
movement is just going to keep on giving

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:22,990
me messages to you so let me clear this

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:22,990
out and let's open one of these up

00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:33,460
alright so in here you can see

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:37,230
that my MIDI device is a MIDI fighter

00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,230
would be unless it's the next one

00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,920
oh wait here we go

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:50,170
so this is a MIDI Fighter 3d it is made

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:54,280
by DJ tech tools this is not a sponsored

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:57,850
talk I just chose their device because I

00:10:54,280 --> 00:11:01,530
like it and then when you go in a little

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,530
bit further there's a data

00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:06,790
right here and it gives you an array

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,620
that identifies a lot of different

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,810
things it's based off of the spec that

00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,020
you get for the MIDI controller but for

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:16,690
for me at least I know that the index 0

00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,339
item in all of the data is contributing

00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:21,010
to a specific button that is on the

00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:24,130
device so that's how I'm able to control

00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:28,360
the work that I'm going to show you in a

00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:30,529
second and it also allows you to do fun

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,829
things like

00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:35,180
hello so that's what I mean like you

00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:38,360
don't have to do music you don't have to

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,720
do like games you can even just use it

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,990
to control simple elements on a webpage

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,990
all right

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:53,220
so what I built I decided to call Vinny

00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,449
I originally was going to do like

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,120
shaders I was like that would've been

00:11:54,449 --> 00:11:58,949
really cool but shaders are hard so

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,050
there's this really awesome library

00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:04,350
called pixel sense made by Donald Hansen

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:06,809
and it's it essentially did exactly what

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,420
I was looking for so I asked him if I

00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:11,089
could use it and adapt it to working

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,610
with a MIDI controller and he said yes

00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:17,850
which is a nice thing to ask um yeah so

00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:21,420
I'm gonna show you how that works

00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:23,040
here is another example of what the MIDI

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,050
fighter is so it's full color

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,269
configurable arcade buttons total motion

00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:30,709
control and three accesses it's it's

00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:34,889
really cool people use it for drumming

00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:36,480
like this but I used it for vide I do

00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:40,019
want to give a warning in case anybody

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,240
instead of two flashing light if you

00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,009
have that issue let me know and I will

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,249
give you a second to leave does anyone

00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:50,480
have that too you don't okay cool so now

00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:50,480
I'm going to give you a demo of

00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,800
how this works

00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:04,490
all right so this is it it is all in the

00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,490
browser

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:13,160
and see that when you use the

00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:16,100
potentiometer it affects on one axis the

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:19,130
rotation and on the other one it's scale

00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,620
so it's really great for live music

00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,269
because even if I'm not familiar with

00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:26,959
the artists that I'm performing for I

00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:29,810
can do it on the fly if I'm on beat okay

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,430
and then the other other functions that

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,390
are programmed into this is ugly color

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:36,280
so let me switch it to something cuter

00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:39,070
I have a randomizer on the side that

00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,050
allows me to keep on going through until

00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:44,560
I can get a setup that I like and then

00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:47,340
from there I'm also able to change the

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,340
width of the waves

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,680
so that it's very it's kind of hard to

00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,769
see

00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,749
but it allows for quick changes on the

00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:03,699
fly which is really cool and I'll show

00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:03,699
you how the code looks for that

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,580
it is mess

00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,589
but um you know at the beginning we're

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:17,290
requesting that MIDI access like I was

00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:20,259
saying I'm gonna make this bigger also

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:22,589
it's on github if you want to doctor it

00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,589
for me

00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:31,420
or you know perform yourself

00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:33,190
ah command what P B thank you see it's

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:38,250
been so long I don't even write code at

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,250
my job anymore vp e

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:44,160
[Music]

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,620
all right so I'm not going to go over

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:51,170
all of the synthesizer code because it's

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:54,000
essentially just a lot of rgba waves

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:57,200
really MIDI is the star here and

00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,340
everything in here is commented for

00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:04,320
clarity and yeah so I have a lot of that

00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:08,100
output values for the different buttons

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,050
I have an output for controlling the

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,200
potentiometer and the accelerometer or

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:16,020
the just the potentiometer because we

00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,570
needed to round that to a more median

00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,840
number otherwise it would have been all

00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:24,720
over the place and very sensitive so we

00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,760
are controlling it through these helper

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,530
functions which is just like averaging

00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,530
out the frequency of

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,500
is all of the synthesizer stuff which is

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,500
pretty cool

00:15:38,089 --> 00:15:44,749
and here is what we did with the changes

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:48,170
so this scale on the rotation is getting

00:15:44,749 --> 00:15:50,509
that input from a potentiometer and then

00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:53,300
I'm handling the messaging and honestly

00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:55,579
like just randomizing everything cuz it

00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,879
works it allows you to like check for

00:15:55,579 --> 00:16:00,680
the specific buttons for changing the

00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:04,430
waves it allows to track for the

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,680
potentiometer and then defining through

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:08,629
the scale and rotation so it's almost

00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,670
all the way there the only issue is like

00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:13,220
since it is a canvas animation if I

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,740
rotate it at a certain point in the

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,470
browser window it kind of rotates and

00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,520
you can see the white background but

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,770
that is an easy fix

00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,180
yeah tilt logic later I wrote this two

00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:28,020
years ago there's not going to be a

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:30,360
later all right so the last thing I'm

00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:33,060
gonna do is I'm gonna show you what it

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,610
looks like when I perform it live I

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,459
picked a song I'm gonna do like a minute

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:40,290
or two cool I'm not over I was so

00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:43,170
nervous to talk to you today it has been

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:46,890
a while you would think that but stops

00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:50,010
happening after but it does not all

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,339
right let's get out of here let me put a

00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,339
song

00:16:53,330 --> 00:17:16,170
yeah

00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:19,289
[Music]

00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,289
[Applause]

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,039
[Music]

00:17:44,320 --> 00:18:14,169
[Music]

00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:21,350
yeah so the future and the future would

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:23,570
be ideally what I've done the past two

00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:26,140
years if I did anything but since I

00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:28,880
haven't and now I'm working on it again

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,890
I would love to have more custom MIDI

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,440
mapping in it so that people are able to

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:37,400
use something other than the MIDI

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,110
fighter so that you know people can plug

00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,570
in whatever they want and play around

00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,340
with it

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,410
excuse me I'd also like to add in

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:48,170
multiple visual options so instead of

00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:52,600
just like canvas drawing web GL shaders

00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:55,790
p5 3GS maybe just play in CSS animations

00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,610
you want to do any of that you can I'm

00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:00,040
going to try

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:02,020
and if you are interested in web MIDI

00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,910
and want to try any of this yourself

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:06,370
there's a bunch of resources that I'll

00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:09,490
leave up if you want to take a picture

00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:13,240
it has the web MIDI API shim which I use

00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,860
because it's it's easy the web MIDI API

00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,620
hasn't really changed that much

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,299
there was the deprecation message in the

00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:21,370
console because I hadn't updated that

00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:23,559
code to follow the new spec but the new

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:25,390
spec has like a one-line fix that would

00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:28,890
get rid of that so I probably should

00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:30,560
have just fixed um yeah

00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:35,400
Thanks

00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,400
