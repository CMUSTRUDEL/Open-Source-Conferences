Description: 
	Page freeze, glitchy animation, and slow scrolling. They follow us everywhere, and we'd like them to stop. This talk will get to the bottom of these issues by delving into the Javascript engine and concepts like task, call-stack, and event-loops. I will also introduce several ways to tackle these problems and walk you through a demo to help you understand.
