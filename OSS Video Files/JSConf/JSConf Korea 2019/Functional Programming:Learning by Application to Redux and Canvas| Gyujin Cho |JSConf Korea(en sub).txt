Description: 
	What's so great about functional programming? Textbooks tell you it's "declarative, reusable, and without side effects," but don't explain how or when to use it.

In this talk, I will go step-by-step through the "how and when" of functional programming as applied to Redux and Canvas. You'll also learn about my own experiences with FP, why Ramda.js works better than lodash.js in this context, and the ups and downs of app development in FP.
