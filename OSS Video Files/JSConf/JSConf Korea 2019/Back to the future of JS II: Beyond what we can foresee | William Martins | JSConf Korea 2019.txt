Title: Back to the future of JS II: Beyond what we can foresee | William Martins | JSConf Korea 2019
Publication date: 2019-10-01
Playlist: JSConf Korea 2019
Description: 
	Learn about the upcoming JavaScript features you never knew you needed: Pattern Matching, Pipeline Operator, and Binary AST. I'll show you how these proposals may change the way you write code forever, as the spread operator once did. After that, I'd like to invite you to help TC39 push them forward.

What would you like to see implemented in JavaScript next?
