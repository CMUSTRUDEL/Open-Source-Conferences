Description: 
	I learned a lot running a personal open source project and occasionally contributing to other ones. I learned even more maintaining a popular open source project used by many users across the globe. In this talk, I'd like to share with you the challenges I faced and the lessons I learned working on Mocha as a maintainer over the past year. I'll also talk about how maintainers of big open source projects manage them and collaborate with each other.
