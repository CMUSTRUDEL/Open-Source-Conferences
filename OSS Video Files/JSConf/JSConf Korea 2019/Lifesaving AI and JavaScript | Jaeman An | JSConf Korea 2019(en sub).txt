Title: Lifesaving AI and JavaScript | Jaeman An | JSConf Korea 2019(en sub)
Publication date: 2019-10-10
Playlist: JSConf Korea 2019
Description: 
	JavaScript, artificial intelligence, and software development, a combination with myriad possibilities. This presentation tells one such story, a life-saving software for predicting severe acute illness.

The AI system required not just back-end and front-end but also mobile apps, AI models, and data collection and analysis components. I’ll show you how I used JavaScript to create this solution, with tools like Vue.js, React Native, Electron, TypeScript, and server-side JavaScript. I’ll also explain issues of safety, privacy, and explainability that comes with using AI in medicine and how to deal with them. Finally, I'd like to share with you how software made out of JS can bring tangible contributions and innovations to the forefront of medicine.
