Description: 
	Design Systems are beneficial in bridging the gap between design and development. The inclusion of React.js in Design Systems helped introduce the concept of functional programming as it relates to building components for reuse and scale. What happens if we take it a step further? With Typescript, a superset of JS that can be used in conjunction with React.js, your Design System can reach a whole new level of efficiency and clarity. This talk will explore how UI engineers, from beginner to experienced, can harness the power of Typescript to help enforce better component standards in the code and allow large-scale JS projects to succeed. By the end of this talk, you will walk away with actionable ideas to implement in your codebase!
