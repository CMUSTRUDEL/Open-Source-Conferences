Title: The Man who Sold the Amp: How to Process Music with JS | Vitalii Bobrov | JSConf Korea 2019
Publication date: 2019-10-01
Playlist: JSConf Korea 2019
Description: 
	Take your old scratched Les Paul or Stratocaster from the case and fill all the space around with warm riffs. I’m going to show how to transform the code into Kirk Hammett’s wah-wah, Stevie Ray Vaughan’s overdrive and Kurt Cobain’s distortion. You’ll learn how to parse audio input in real-time using JavaScript and the Web Audio API.

okay right now it should be better so I

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,210
know you're already tired but who of you

00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,830
have some rock'n'roll metal grunge

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:20,720
whatever come on

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:25,210
okay let's try to make some noise

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:28,280
[Music]

00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,900
[Applause]

00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,830
[Music]

00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:48,400
[Applause]

00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:54,010
[Music]

00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:59,540
okay so this talk I will show you how to

00:00:54,010 --> 00:01:02,000
sell your amp and process music life

00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,920
your instrument with JavaScript

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,580
so before we start few words about

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,100
myself my name is Vitaly I came from

00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:13,130
Poland and Here I am working as the

00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,150
leads of 20 engineer at company called a

00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:16,370
pump systems

00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,910
I also Corgan eyes in angular Brussels

00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:22,369
meetups and disclaimer I'm not a

00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:26,660
professional guitar player so don't

00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:29,330
judge me it's just a hobby and I used to

00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:32,240
play punk rock groups when I was a

00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,790
teenager you can find me on Twitter and

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,300
you can read my blog actually here I

00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:40,220
started to blog posting some information

00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,080
regarding this topic that I will show

00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:45,920
today

00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:49,940
okay so Web Audio yeah it's exists for a

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,940
while in web standards most of browsers

00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,460
get a good supports of it so what is it

00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:58,850
actually it's provide us with the

00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:03,140
context with which you can create a uni

00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:07,940
directed graph with audio knows those

00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:11,690
audio notes could be get together to

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:15,380
create some effects create generate some

00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:18,080
music or process live stream how it

00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,440
looks like we have some input in my case

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,130
it's guitar it might be generated sound

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,730
with oscillators and we have an output

00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:30,880
our speakers headphones whatever and

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,200
between that we have some nodes

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,130
connected these nodes we can achieve

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,250
some effects and audio processing if you

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:42,620
take a look at real guitar stock we have

00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:46,040
a guitar we have some amplifiers

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,980
cabinets and between them we have some

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,890
stone boxes with some effects like

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:55,010
Kouros distortion and so on

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:59,090
so how we can actually connect

00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:01,580
instrument this could be applied to any

00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,430
instrument actually that could be

00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:08,390
connected to an order cards but in my

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:11,660
case is Peter okay first of all we need

00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,460
to create audio context audio context is

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:17,480
the main object that allows you to

00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:20,930
create new nodes connect them and put it

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,710
to some destination so we create this

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:28,190
context

00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:30,950
after that we request some stream in and

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,800
we will use navigator media devices and

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:37,100
we are requesting audio in my case we

00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,200
you can also request video but I don't

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:43,160
need it that is why I don't show it and

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,920
textually you can catch errors if you

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:49,330
don't grant permissions to audio or

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:53,630
something against wrong so it's optional

00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:57,019
that's fine but hey wait I got some

00:03:53,630 --> 00:04:00,019
audio constraints for you what I mean by

00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:03,440
that so that's completely fine you can

00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:07,370
request audio using just get media audio

00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:10,370
true but by default most of browsers

00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:13,700
apply some post-processing for input

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:16,459
stream it's completely fine for

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:20,419
microphone for chatting application like

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:23,900
hangout Skype but for web borders they

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:26,510
will reduce amount of our signal which

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,340
we want to use so instead to passing

00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:31,790
just through we need to pass some

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:35,120
constraints to remove echo cancellation

00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:39,770
after gain control noise suspension and

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,710
provide some latency hint doing that we

00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:47,990
get the most clean sound as we can from

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:52,280
our instrument after that we get some

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:56,410
stream we have a context and we need to

00:04:52,280 --> 00:05:00,640
connect this stream to destination

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:02,990
context destination is a default output

00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,090
selected in your system

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:09,440
for example now it should output to the

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:11,720
speakers one more thing

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:16,310
usually we need to control the amount of

00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:20,330
volume to not hurry our neighbors for

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:22,880
example at night so how to do this we

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:26,690
can imagine the audio signal as sine

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,680
wave yeah and the amplitude of this sine

00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:33,670
wave is actually the amount of volume

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:36,770
for the sound so multiplying it or

00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:40,100
dividing by some numbers will reduce the

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,860
amplitude and reducing the amplitude we

00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,430
reduce the amount of volume how it looks

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:50,030
like in code so Web Audio provide us

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:54,620
with gain note we create an again node

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:56,780
and then we can apply again value the

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:00,860
value of zero means that our sound

00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:03,410
completely muted the value of one means

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,500
that the sound not changed the volume is

00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:09,020
as it is so by putting the values

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,990
between zero and one we can control the

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,420
amount of volume or even more we can add

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:18,890
add some values more than one and

00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:21,650
amplify our sound so when we create such

00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,020
a node we need to connect our graph so

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,260
we have source we connect it to gain

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:31,640
node and after that connect to

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:33,010
destination so let's let me show how it

00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:40,030
looks like

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:45,060
in real life okay so I connected clean

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:53,860
sound so it's nice and what

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:53,860
[Music]

00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:03,250
and they have this master volume control

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,870
so now it's a value of one and I can

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,870
reduce it to make it

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:20,840
or even muted completely no sound and

00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:27,369
come back to one okay let's miss fish to

00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:30,409
slice again okay

00:07:27,369 --> 00:07:32,089
so the first effect I want to show how

00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:35,990
to create with a buff order is

00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:38,270
distortion distortion often reused in

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:41,330
some rock music metal and so on

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,699
so actually it's a group of effects that

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,339
change our input sine-wave

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:50,300
with some transfer function and this

00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:52,430
process called wave shape so bit of

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,419
history about this effect back in test

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:59,559
times the equipment for guitarists

00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:01,849
wasn't there bad is it good sorry and

00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:04,490
when it was broken

00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:07,399
for example speaker was cut off the

00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:10,639
sound became disordered but get replaced

00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:13,099
while like this effect so much so they

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,699
started to destroy the speaker's

00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:19,330
themself that's how it was born only

00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:22,249
after few years the first the

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:25,069
semiconductor effect the in form of

00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:27,379
pedal was done by different producers

00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:31,189
but now you don't mean that

00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:33,949
you can use just Web Audio okay as I

00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:37,219
said before distortion is a group of

00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:40,459
effects it contains of overdrive

00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:44,750
distortion and fuss so what is the

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:47,839
difference between them again we can

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:54,019
imagine how a sound wave as a sine wave

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:57,860
and we apply wave shaping a function to

00:08:54,019 --> 00:09:00,290
our wave until become more square doing

00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:04,220
that with generating harmonics what is

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:06,139
harmonic I will sound of some instrument

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,050
for example it doesn't have only one

00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:12,829
frequency it has one a domain frequency

00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:14,930
and a bunch of harmonics as a

00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:18,819
frequencies with possibly lower

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:22,480
amplitude and during wave shaping we

00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:26,660
increase amount of harmonics so our

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,180
original wave become more richer and

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,510
harder

00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:35,220
so difference between overdrive

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:37,570
distortion and fuss if we will see on

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,360
Soundwave after we apply transfer

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:43,300
function of different types for

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,110
overdrive it will be more curved for

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,500
Distortion

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:50,980
slightly more Square and for fuss it

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:57,130
will be almost completely square so this

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:59,110
such changes in a wave shape we be

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,750
reducing or increasing amount of

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:03,910
harmonics we are to original sound and

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:08,800
more harmonics we add to it

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:11,380
more effect under sound we achieve how

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,040
it looks like with web order so we have

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:17,260
a know some web shaper note provided by

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,070
Web Audio why it's awesome you just

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,670
provided a lookup table with values

00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:27,690
calculated beforehand for harmonics

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:31,180
which of transfer function and Web Audio

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:35,350
applies it using fast Fourier transforms

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:38,410
to your source input so most of hard

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:42,540
work a hidden and done for you by Web

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:45,670
Audio API so we creating some wave

00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:49,590
lookout table and assign it adds a curve

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:53,110
for way shape or node so how look this

00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:56,290
function would be so we have some amount

00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:59,530
of gain we want to add we have number of

00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:02,200
samples for a lookup table and we filled

00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:06,570
with our transfer function so basically

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:11,680
we apply floating 32 array to a curve

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:13,720
and that's it after that usually those

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,440
effects distortions they have at least

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:20,560
one control for tone and again hard done

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,040
hard work done for you you have big vat

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,260
filter note it a basic node for creating

00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,960
different types of filters so we

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:32,430
creating a low pass filter low pass

00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:36,580
filter except some frequency and

00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:40,240
everything below that frequency will be

00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:41,529
passed through every since that hires at

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,930
this frequency we

00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:46,360
we'll be cut off so Morgan's this

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:50,079
frequency we're reducing or increasing

00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:54,610
the amount of high frequencies mid

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:57,939
frequencies and low frequencies and the

00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:00,939
interesting thing that real stompboxes

00:11:57,939 --> 00:12:04,439
also at least some of them using such

00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:12,689
kind of low-pass filtering but mate with

00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:15,069
some reduced capacitors and resistors so

00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:18,430
basically we're doing the same but in

00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:20,970
the code in a different way so let's try

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:25,930
to see what the difference between

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:30,120
OverDrive's distortion sent so first I

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:32,280
have some overdrive enabled yeah

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,360
[Music]

00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:47,479
could we make it louder slightly

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:47,479
[Music]

00:12:52,240 --> 00:13:00,350
so here I apply and the most soft

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:05,330
transfer function I can so it's just not

00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:07,520
the big difference between sound and we

00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:11,029
add in not that much harmonics but let's

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,900
try another one this more harder

00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:15,220
function

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:17,440
[Applause]

00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,700
[Music]

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,010
[Applause]

00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,800
[Music]

00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,750
[Applause]

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:28,740
[Music]

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:30,950
so our sound is more harder and when I

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,850
change in the amount of effect I

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:38,280
statically generated cupcake so we can

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,710
use more amount I just recovered

00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,610
recalculating this lookup table after

00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,320
yet

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,060
[Music]

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,760
[Applause]

00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:50,390
and here we have tone control yeah Oh

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:53,360
way up we have all frequencies no of our

00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:56,559
guitar frequencies reduced

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,559
[Music]

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:05,060
it sounds slightly harsh and if we

00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:06,370
reduce the amount of frequencies it will

00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:13,040
be some modest sound

00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:16,820
[Music]

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,800
so again with just one filter we change

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,970
our sound

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,080
different ways

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,080
[Applause]

00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:28,940
those bows OverDrive's

00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:38,290
now let's try some dystocia

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:41,379
[Music]

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:44,259
so our sound became more harder more

00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:46,089
heavy and that's the basically

00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:47,019
difference between overdrive and

00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:50,100
Distortion

00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:58,279
let's try another one

00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:58,279
[Music]

00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:09,460
okay and the last one fuss

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:22,790
[Music]

00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:31,100
more heavier and more like digital

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:32,840
because this our sound shape become

00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:39,820
almost square

00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:39,820
[Music]

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:49,100
and again we have tone control but in

00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:49,660
this case is slightly different control

00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:59,120
variant

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:59,120
[Music]

00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,400
we can make it almost

00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,040
[Applause]

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:30,270
okay that was some distortions okay but

00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:33,630
to make our sound more closer to real

00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:38,130
devices we would like to create some

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:40,650
cabinet or amplifier simulation and we

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,360
can do it using special thing called

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,850
impulse response

00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,940
what is impulse response is a short

00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:51,090
sample containing just few milliseconds

00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:55,890
of a sound of a real device

00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:58,710
I mean speaker of Geezer cabinet so if

00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:02,850
you think about you can think about it

00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:07,980
like photo photo is a snapshot of fly

00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:11,430
light at some point of time impulse

00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,949
response is the same but applies for the

00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:17,839
sound so it's a snapshot of some sound

00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:22,170
in some space at some point of time so

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:25,199
and again Web Audio save us and hide a

00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:28,560
lot of complicated work behind the

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,110
scenes we can use convo or not we create

00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:35,040
this can louver node then we load this

00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:38,400
impulse response file we create a ray

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:44,400
buffer free then we decode it and apply

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:46,710
this buffer to a lot so all the sounds

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,760
that will go through this controller

00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:53,060
node will be goes through this impulse

00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:58,410
response so it will be adjusted

00:17:53,060 --> 00:18:00,930
accordingly to our sample and next thing

00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,720
usually amplifies has at least three

00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:07,200
band Equalization so to have more

00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:10,410
control over our tone stack on either

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:14,160
cabinet we want to create some 3-band

00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:19,440
equalizer so basically we need to split

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:22,290
our frequency range into three bands for

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,990
everything below 500 gals

00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,789
it will be for bus control everything

00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:29,159
above 300

00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:33,359
we'll go for treble control everything

00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:36,959
in the middle will be middle how it

00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:39,539
looks like in code again we using big

00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:42,479
fat filter node but now we using another

00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:45,449
types of them for our bus node we using

00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:48,329
low shelf filter wall shelf filter takes

00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:51,359
a frequency and everything below that

00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:54,209
frequency will be attenuated or

00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,789
amplified depending on again value we

00:18:54,209 --> 00:19:01,289
did for it so we can adjust the amount

00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:04,679
of those frequencies the opposite thing

00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:08,339
we do for high frequencies with high

00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:10,919
shelf filter so it takes the frequency

00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:14,549
and everything above that frequency will

00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:17,909
be updated or amplified for middle range

00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:21,289
we using peaking filter so it takes the

00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:24,779
middle frequency of our range and

00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:29,159
everything inside this range will be

00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:29,789
amplified or attenuated okay let's try

00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:32,449
it out

00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:36,049
and try to see the difference between

00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:36,049
different cabinets

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,879
okay

00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:46,020
let's start for the screen so here I

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,020
mean

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:56,910
turn off any cabinet emulation now

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,510
[Music]

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:04,650
minutes

00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,650
[Music]

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,830
then I can switch to another one for

00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,830
example

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:21,360
it sound differently so those samples

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:26,370
made from real devices versus darker

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:28,860
sound maybe it won't be the possible

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:40,950
without in any effect so let's enable

00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:44,460
some effect so now we have really really

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,450
dark come as you are let's try something

00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:56,529
more whiter

00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:56,529
[Music]

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:14,399
let's try more lighter one and let's try

00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:21,480
ours we went equalizer so let me reduce

00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:24,260
the amount of needle domes damnit

00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:27,990
[Music]

00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:36,510
or if your increasing it will be more

00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:38,750
bright we can increase the amount of

00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,750
bass

00:21:41,740 --> 00:22:04,210
and trebles okay

00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,210
let's switch back to the slides

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,640
and the last thing I want to show is a

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,350
rib abrasion what is the reverberation

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:17,200
is the effect that tries to simulate

00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:20,860
some spaces for example now we are in

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,500
hole yeah and this space has its own

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:26,110
acoustic properties

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:31,630
so this reverberation we can emulate

00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:35,470
such spaces like holes football court

00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:38,590
for example or something else is this

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,630
effect would be slightly more

00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,410
complicated so basically we want to

00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:46,720
split our source sound into two lines

00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,830
there wet one this effect and dry one

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,790
without effect

00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:56,650
just clean sound so for wet tone we will

00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:59,620
create some GA note actually when you

00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:03,160
speaking in some hole as the sound goes

00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:05,760
to the back wall and come to you back

00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:10,590
with some delays that creates for us

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:13,270
meaning of the space inside some rooms

00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:17,080
after that we will filter it slightly

00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:20,140
and again apply convolve or not but now

00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,710
we will use the impulse responses from

00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:26,679
different places usually this sample is

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:30,510
just some clap few milliseconds of a

00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:33,640
clap in different space and a plant can

00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:36,790
convolution on it we will get the

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:41,610
simulation of the space then we will

00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:44,460
merge back or wet and dry tones and

00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:47,260
reducing the gain on wet and dry we will

00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:52,419
control the amount of effect we want to

00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:55,630
apply to the source so how it looks like

00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:58,090
first of all we create splitter node to

00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:03,490
split our Channel sound into two

00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:07,260
channels then we are do a note tone note

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:10,150
with big fat filter controller note and

00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,059
the gain control to control amount of

00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:15,359
effect sound

00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:18,840
and try not to control the amount of

00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:21,210
clean sound and we create major to March

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,509
it back after that we need to connect

00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:27,570
them so splitter connect to do a delay

00:24:24,509 --> 00:24:29,999
to tone tone to convert convert wet and

00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:34,109
back to measure and in the second fly we

00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:38,940
connect dry and back to merger okay

00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:47,809
let's show how the reverberation changes

00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:51,950
the sound okay let me try this preset so

00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:54,929
firstly I will show how to sound without

00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:58,700
reverberation yeah it's kind of so I'm

00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:58,700
not that good at source but anyway

00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,570
is a turn table

00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,920
why is the reason all sound

00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,500
is there any input

00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:27,779
okay

00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:49,520
now yeah okay let's try it

00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:50,960
[Music]

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,630
okay

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,810
this was the variant without regression

00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:59,140
let's add the reverberation emulation of

00:25:56,810 --> 00:25:59,140
West

00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:25,149
[Music]

00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:27,789
okay and another example here I will

00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:31,809
show again without your vibration and

00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:34,590
twist and I will simulate how this

00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:34,590
vibration

00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,519
[Music]

00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:48,069
[Music]

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,069
[Applause]

00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:58,429
[Music]

00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:58,429
okay and now we will try to break

00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,760
[Music]

00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:28,080
[Music]

00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:30,360
and we can adjust the amount of space we

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,790
want to simulate visit away time

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,450
so let's write for example there 10

00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,450
milliseconds

00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:58,000
[Music]

00:27:49,330 --> 00:28:00,679
okay and let's switch to slides back so

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,320
should recap what we learned today

00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:06,620
so we learnt what is web audio how to

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,519
connect your instrument to process it in

00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:12,529
real time this Web Audio how to control

00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:15,350
amount of volume using gain node how to

00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:18,019
create basic distortion effects using

00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:20,629
wave shaper and controlled tone of

00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:23,720
effect using big wad filter node how to

00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:26,779
simulate real guitar cabinets and

00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,929
amplifiers using curved over node how to

00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:33,830
create reverberation effect using merger

00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:39,970
splitter and delay nodes and that's

00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:44,659
basically what I have be 10x engineers

00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:48,500
but better to be a rock star engineers

00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:51,889
using Web Audio so write out all the

00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:54,500
code available on github the app is open

00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:57,649
source I'm open to pull request is we

00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:01,070
want to create a new effect or fix any

00:28:57,649 --> 00:29:03,860
issues for example mobile version it's

00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:06,769
hard for me to create right now and all

00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:08,840
these controls so check it out thank you

00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:11,500
very much for coming and enjoy a

00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,500
conference

00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:41,439
[Applause]
