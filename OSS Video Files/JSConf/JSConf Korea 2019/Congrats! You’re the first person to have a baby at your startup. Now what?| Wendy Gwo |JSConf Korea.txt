Description: 
	Having a baby is a big life change. Being the first person to have a baby at a startup makes it feel even more daunting. This talk walks you through the steps I took when I was the first person to go on family leave at my previous job (a startup), including educating my company about what leave I was entitled to, and shows how you can own the situation and take control.

This talk is for anyone who works in startups who is thinking about having a baby (or adopting one!), is currently expecting a child, or just wants to be an ally in the workplace for soon-to-be parents.
