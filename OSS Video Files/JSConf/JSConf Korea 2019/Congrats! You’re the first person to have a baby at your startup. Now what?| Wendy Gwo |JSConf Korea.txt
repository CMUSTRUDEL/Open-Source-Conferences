Description: 
	Having a baby is a big life change. Being the first person to have a baby at a startup makes it feel even more daunting. This talk walks you through the steps I took when I was the first person to go on family leave at my previous job (a startup), including educating my company about what leave I was entitled to, and shows how you can own the situation and take control.

This talk is for anyone who works in startups who is thinking about having a baby (or adopting one!), is currently expecting a child, or just wants to be an ally in the workplace for soon-to-be parents.

hey everyone how's the sound okay good

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,130
so I'm Wendy in case any of you weren't

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,660
sure I'm going to be talking about being

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,150
the first person that your startup to

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,770
have a baby so that's not the talk that

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,289
you were expecting feel free to escape

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,820
now you won't hurt my feelings

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,160
but assuming that this is the talk that

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,199
you are here to listen to let me

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,990
introduce myself first I'm Wendy I'm a

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,540
senior software engineer at aspiration

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,210
which is a fin tech startup in Los

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,950
Angeles and so I wanted to start this

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,079
talk by giving a disclaimer that this

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,790
talk is based on my experience as

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,160
someone who lives in the u.s. in

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,500
California with all the cultural

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,600
attitudes towards parents and policies

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,820
that go along with that so I realized

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,590
there are really big differences

00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,000
potentially and cultures as well as

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,449
differences in maternity and paternity

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,859
leaves so if there's anything a part of

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,570
my experience that doesn't ring true for

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,030
you I would love to hear about your

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,220
experiences after my talk and I'll be

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,350
around so just grab me so with that

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,570
caveat out of the way let's get to why I

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,360
decided to give this talk about parental

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,189
leave so a little over three years ago

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,009
while I was working at a start-up I

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,950
found out it was pregnant and at first I

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:23,280
was like this super excited but then

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,320
that quickly turned to anxiety so you

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,170
might be wondering why isn't having a

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,820
baby a happy experience

00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,939
well the start up like a lot of startups

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,229
had no formal family leave policy so

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,780
that's not to say that there weren't any

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,119
parents at the startup there were but as

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,090
you all probably know tech especially

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,549
startups tends to skew young and male so

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,799
a lot of the parents that were working

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,750
at my startup left for two weeks for a

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,399
vacation time and then went right back

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,500
to work and obviously that wasn't going

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,450
to work for me and in the u.s. there's

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,850
no law at the federal level that

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:59,189
requires any paid family leave so it's

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,450
up to individual states or companies to

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,110
make it more generous leaves if they

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,659
want to do so for us we had an HR person

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,030
which also not a lot of startups have

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,030
but from everything that I heard even

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,250
people with HR representatives didn't

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,320
really

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,450
know what the correct maternity or

00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,320
paternity leave should be and so I knew

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,430
I was gonna have to figure it out for

00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,290
myself

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,600
little did I know that was the first the

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,550
many things I'd have to figure out and

00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,950
so it took a lot of work from being

00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:29,230
completely lost to feeling like I could

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:31,150
have a degree in family leave policy so

00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,280
this is the talk that I wish someone had

00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,690
given me when I was newly pregnant and

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,420
hopefully I'll be able to share some

00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,740
tips that will help you figure out what

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,140
your leave is and what you can expect

00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,030
and what steps you can take to make your

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:47,350
life easier if you're the first person

00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:49,630
to have a baby at your startup so before

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:53,530
I jump into things I made a legend just

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:55,900
to show what I'm a bit about what I

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,709
wanted to do differently what I would do

00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,270
again tips and hints and observations as

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:05,860
well as things that I just found to be

00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:07,620
important so first up is spewing out

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,450
your leave

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,090
before you talk to anybody at your

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,410
company I'd highly suggest that you do

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,420
your homework to figure out what leave

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:17,879
you're entitled to no one cares about

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,680
your leaves more than you do so even if

00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,530
you have someone at your company like HR

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,750
who should know it's best to just assume

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,760
that they have no idea that what you're

00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:28,230
entitled to and if you're wrong that's

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,780
great they can just confirm what you

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,660
already figured out but if you're right

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,220
then you can educate your company and

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,660
hopefully make it easier for the next

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,950
person at your company who goes through

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,450
this incidentally for me after I had my

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,370
son I found out that there was a

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,380
California maternity leave Facebook

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,390
group and I joined it even though by

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,099
that point I already knew what Levi was

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,959
entitled to because I was curious I

00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:54,360
wanted to see how much of it I got right

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,390
and how much of it I got wrong and if

00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,160
you can see there are three over three

00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,269
thousand members of their group and the

00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,980
moderators actually had to close down

00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:03,870
the group because they just don't have

00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,849
enough time to answer everybody's

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,440
questions but the thing that you see

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:10,019
being in this group over and over again

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,989
is that HR completely gets people's

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,400
leaves wrong over and over again so

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:15,750
again it's up to you to figure out what

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,479
leave you're entitled to because

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,039
knowledge is power

00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:23,250
so how do you figure out what leave

00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:25,800
you're actually entitled to so the first

00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:29,520
thing that I did was of course Google

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,349
everything the second one the second way

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,510
that I went about researching was that I

00:04:31,349 --> 00:04:35,669
talked to my friends and I cross-checked

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,289
what I found on Google with what my

00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:39,539
friends at bigger companies with bigger

00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:41,220
HR departments had figured out by

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:44,550
checking what you've already researched

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,080
with what bigger companies have said is

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,610
the policy you can be pretty sure if

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,220
they match that that's actually the

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,200
correct policy and then the third place

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,760
that I found information which won't

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,160
apply to anybody here but if you're in

00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,080
California is the California state

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,760
disability website since that's where I

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,650
actually had to go and file all of my

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,080
paperwork

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,350
and so I know most of the audience here

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,090
is from South Korea so I'm not gonna

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:09,860
talk too much about what California

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,419
leave was but just wanted to give you

00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,810
this image that helped me figure out

00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:16,880
what California leave was so at the top

00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:20,090
we have a whole set of policies that

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,810
protect your job with no pay it's a mix

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:26,780
of federal and state policies and at the

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:27,979
bottom we also have a mix of federal and

00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,169
state policies but these are the

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:32,570
policies that will actually pay you some

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:34,430
amount of money and so it's totally

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:36,530
confusing if you didn't know that there

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,000
were state level policies you would

00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:40,039
think that the federal level policies

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,419
which don't pay you anything and only

00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:43,610
give you job protection are the only

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:45,740
things that exists there are also a

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,090
bunch of requirements that if they

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,639
aren't met you aren't entitled to

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:52,430
anything and so just it's a big mess and

00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:55,039
you really again should figure out what

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,020
your leave is and so with that I did a

00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,310
little bit of googling about South

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:03,050
Korean policy I'm by no means an expert

00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:06,349
but this is what I was able to find out

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:09,889
so pregnant women are eligible for 90

00:06:06,349 --> 00:06:12,320
days of leave the first 60 are fully

00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:15,950
paid and the last 30 days are partially

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:18,099
paid and at least 45 of those have to be

00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,690
taken after the birth of the baby

00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:23,539
fathers are entitled to five days of

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,250
print paternity leave and pregnant

00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:28,520
workers have rights to work two hours

00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:31,550
less per day without a wage cut no

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,740
overtime nighttime or holiday work and

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,610
you also get medical exams during work

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,810
without and

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:42,000
any additional pay cuts the government

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,050
also provides monetary assistance to

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,210
expectant couples

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,650
such as vouchers for pregnancy checkups

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,870
which is pretty awesome because the u.s.

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,039
doesn't do anything like that the

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,870
government also provides monthly

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,610
allowances to parents for the first year

00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,639
after the child is born for other

00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,620
related expenses as well and then

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,719
parents of children less than three

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,090
years old can request up to one year of

00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:05,370
full-time or part-time childcare leave

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,469
with a 30 day notice period which is

00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,440
super awesome because that also is not

00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:12,060
available in the US and the best part of

00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,610
this I thought was the free public

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,560
daycare that's available so there is the

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,599
wait time typically of one to two years

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,740
but if both parents work kids get to the

00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:22,050
jump to the front of the wait list

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,580
there's a ton more stuff but these were

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,069
just the highlights of what I was able

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,110
to find doing my research for this talk

00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:31,469
so make sure that again you figure out

00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:34,259
what you're entitled to and this leads

00:07:31,469 --> 00:07:36,360
me to my next point which is take as

00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:37,650
much leave as you can afford to whether

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,330
you're the pregnant woman or their

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,400
partner but especially if you're the

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,379
partner and I'm not saying this because

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,389
of the cliches around you'll never get

00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:47,699
this time back even though it's true I'm

00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:49,469
saying it because taking care of kids is

00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,449
really hard and having two people there

00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,669
makes it way easier there are a lot of

00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:57,089
articles that talk about this but my

00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:59,279
favorite one was titled after a men in

00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:02,370
Spain got paternity leave they wanted

00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:05,279
fewer kids and the best quote out of

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,509
here was Farah and Gonzalez think that

00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,719
spending more time with their children

00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:11,879
or the prospect of having to do so may

00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:13,529
have made men more acutely aware of the

00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,279
effort and cost associated with

00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:16,620
child-rearing

00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:18,810
and as the researchers put it shifted

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,300
their preferences from child quantity to

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,909
quality so I realize not everyone can

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,500
afford to take time off but if you can

00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:27,419
afford to you won't regret taking that

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,729
time off your child your relationship

00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,980
will be so much less stressful because

00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:34,190
of it

00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:37,460
so moving on to talking to your work

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:38,630
again when I got to this part I was

00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,930
really nervous and I didn't really

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:44,300
understand why you know again shouldn't

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,800
this be a happy thing but again the

00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,870
problem is that people start making

00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,930
assumptions as soon as they hear that

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:53,510
you're pregnant so for example this

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,280
article shows that children hurt woman's

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,140
earnings but not men's even in

00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,090
Scandinavia which is one of the most

00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,860
progressive countries out there there

00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:02,210
can be a lot of reasons for this people

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,130
might assume that you're going to just

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,840
end up staying at home or that you're

00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:08,480
not as motivated or that you don't want

00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,240
to take on as challenging assignments

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,180
which you know usually is not the case

00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,940
and so all of this is just to say that

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,080
it's totally normal to be nervous about

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,620
telling your company that you're

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,540
expecting a baby and so it wasn't until

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,700
after I talked to my friends that I

00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:27,920
realized why this was something that I

00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,080
was feeling so nervous about and like I

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,000
also want to take this chance to talk to

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,070
any managers out in the audience which

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,560
is that if you're on the receiving end

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:40,340
of this news you should be just super

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,870
excited this should be you and then once

00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:43,550
the dust is settled just go back to

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,890
treating the person who told you

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,750
normally the greatest gift that my

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,260
manager and co-workers gave me at the

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,880
time

00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,340
after I told them was treating the fact

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,810
that I was pregnant as no bigger deal

00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,180
than the fact that I had brown eyes it

00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,650
just didn't matter to them the only

00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,600
thing that they did do was they stopped

00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:02,180
offering me beer when we got to lunch

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,460
and dinner so with that said there's no

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,020
hard or fast rules for when and how you

00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,640
should tell your company so I just

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,000
wanted to give a few tips that worked

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,819
for me

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,709
so for me I would definitely repeat

00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,899
telling them as soon as I was

00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:18,389
comfortable there may or may not be a

00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:20,819
minimal notice period for you there

00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:22,410
definitely is in the u.s. of course if

00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:24,120
you're the person who's pregnant you're

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:26,629
probably an entire company way more than

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,490
the 30-day minimum requirement in the US

00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:31,079
but even if you're the partner it's a

00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,240
lot easier to explain why you're

00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:35,220
suddenly needing to take all of these

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,839
morning's off to go to appointments and

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,100
everything people will wonder if

00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:39,389
something is something wrong with you if

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,459
you're like I need to be going to

00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,839
doctors appointments regularly if they

00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:44,819
don't know that you're going because

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:49,470
you're seeing the doctor for your future

00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:52,019
baby I would also repeat talking to your

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,389
HR I'm not sure how widespread HR people

00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,160
are in South Korea but if you have

00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:57,959
someone who manages these kind of things

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,850
definitely talk to them along with your

00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,829
manager I had a really supportive

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,750
manager so I actually told him before we

00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:06,029
talked to HR and this was also a really

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,220
good time to figure out if my company

00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:10,439
would be willing to pay anything while I

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,480
was gone and as luck would have it they

00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:15,089
ended up supplementing my income for

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,769
twelve weeks so I had full salary for 12

00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:19,910
weeks which is not the case for a lot of

00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:22,220
people in the US or even California

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:25,240
also keep copies of all correspondence

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,620
regarding your leave and job performance

00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,180
while you're out on maternity leave or

00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,580
paternity leave you don't want to

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:33,350
suddenly be let go of your job without

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,880
any sort of evidence that this was

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,010
actually something that your company

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,360
said was ok and approved of you're not

00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,090
necessarily going to have access to your

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,800
email anymore so whether it's printing

00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:45,710
out emails or forwarding it to yourself

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,190
just you know have something to show

00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:52,310
that this was approved before and for me

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:54,860
about it for talking to your company so

00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,780
we're gonna move on to gearing up for

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,430
your baby this is gonna be a little

00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,870
different than most of the lists that

00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,060
you see out there related to getting

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,680
ready for baby which are usually things

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,050
that you should and shouldn't buy you

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,090
can totally Google all of that so that's

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,770
not what this is going to be it's mostly

00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:12,050
a list of things that I have observed

00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:15,830
about being pregnant and which someone

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:17,210
had told me about so first up if you're

00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,190
the person who's pregnant you're gonna

00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,470
be more tired than you've ever been in

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:23,750
your first trimester you might not

00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:26,300
realize just how tired that is for me I

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:28,130
worked two blocks from the beach when I

00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,530
was pregnant and I seriously considered

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,570
for about a month straight walking to

00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,070
the beach during lunch time taking a nap

00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,620
and then heading back to work that's how

00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,630
tired I was so again another thing I

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,580
didn't realize was normal but it totally

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:43,920
is so just be ready

00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,140
also you're gonna outgrow every piece of

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,430
clothing you have towards the end even

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,470
your maternity clothes

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:51,720
this really depressed me no one warned

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,760
me about this it's normal just go to

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,649
your local thrift shop and buy some

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,970
really big pieces of clothing to tide

00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:00,089
you over for the last month and you'll

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:01,529
be good this was me a week before my son

00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:03,690
came I don't know if you can tell but

00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:08,820
that fabric is not holding together very

00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:10,560
well also now's the time to start

00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,480
talking to your employer about setting

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,060
them up a mother's room if you plan to

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,440
breastfeed so where I worked like a lot

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,380
of startups they had an open floor plan

00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,019
the only rooms that were available were

00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,640
conference rooms that had glass walls so

00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:25,560
clearly that wouldn't work as a mother's

00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,630
room and so it's good to give your

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,890
company some lead time to make changes

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:32,310
so that you can have an appropriate

00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:34,350
mother's room if that's what you need so

00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,149
I want to also take this time to talk

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:41,160
about South Korea's breastfeeding right

00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:43,649
so there's only 18.3% as of 2016

00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:46,110
breastfed Fred excuse me

00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:48,690
breastfed exclusively until six months

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:51,089
while the global average is 41%

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:53,220
even though 95 percent of mothers

00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:55,290
breastfeed immediately after birth in an

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,690
earlier months and the biggest reasons

00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:59,579
that that rate was so low were that

00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,220
there is either no more milk or that

00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:04,980
they didn't think it was any necessary

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,630
any longer or work conditions so the

00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,790
fact that we're conditions is along the

00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,500
top three reasons for why women stop

00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,000
breastfeeding is why it's really

00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,440
important to talk to your company about

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,720
getting a mother's room if that is

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,480
important to you

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,130
so with that said this is my realistic

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,450
mother's room obviously in a start-up

00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,520
you're always strapped for cash so I

00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,520
can't just give you my pie in the sky

00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,660
dream mother's room but for me oh the

00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,449
minimum that you would want to have a

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,459
good mother's room is a lock that only

00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:34,260
the pumping moms have access to because

00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:37,149
I had to kick out people so many times

00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,100
that I got super tired of it

00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:40,660
curtains and blinds over the windows and

00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,610
I need glass walls that's sort of

00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,740
obvious but something that needs to be

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,420
said comfy chairs because you're gonna

00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:49,570
be sitting in there for a long time

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:52,209
everyday and office chairs just aren't

00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:54,850
comfortable a fridge to store punk milk

00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:56,470
and pump parts because people get a

00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,029
little weird when you store your Pumped

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,970
milk with their lunch for whatever

00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:03,220
reason even though it's both food also

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:04,839
if there are multiple women pumping it

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,000
would be really nice to have lockers so

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:08,260
people can store all of their pump stuff

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,470
in there without having to lug it all

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,120
around and if privacy partitions or

00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,550
cubicles if you only have one room

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,470
available and if you only have one room

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:19,089
available and can't do anything about it

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,130
then at least have a calendar for

00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:23,620
scheduling their room and then finally

00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,510
bonus points first Inc because you might

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,040
have to wash some of your pump stuff and

00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,079
people get really weird about you

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,339
washing again your pump stuff in the

00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:31,930
same sink where they're washing other

00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,540
really gross things but they don't think

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:38,670
it's as gross as your your breast milk

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,670
so I think is really nice too

00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:45,050
so moving on something that I would do

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,730
totally differently is not keeping on

00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:48,650
top of my employer once I filed for

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,570
disability so this is a little

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,310
California specific I'm not sure if

00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,110
there's paperwork that your employer

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:55,700
needs to sign when you're going to go

00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:58,550
out on maternity or paternity leave

00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,020
but for California there is and I didn't

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,370
pay attention to the mail I was getting

00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,000
and it turns out that my claim was

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:04,310
denied

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,260
I only had 21 days to repeal it and I

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,570
didn't realize it until I was about 14

00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,030
days in so I was holding my two-week old

00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:13,610
on hold for hours at a time multiple

00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,380
times a day trying to talk to a real

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,510
person so definitely don't recommend it

00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:19,850
if there's paperwork that your employer

00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,380
or really anyone needs signed just make

00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:25,100
sure that you keep track of that before

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:27,050
the baby's born another thing that I

00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,930
would not do again is that I didn't get

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:33,350
on the daycare waitlist early enough so

00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:35,480
when I went to my first daycare visit I

00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,520
was four months pregnant I thought that

00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,890
was plenty of time and then the woman

00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,660
who was doing the tour asked me so are

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,490
you pregnant yet and I thought that she

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,830
was kidding until I found out that the

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:48,050
waitlist was fifteen months long and as

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,630
I pointed out earlier the wait lists for

00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:52,580
daycares in South Korea can run up to

00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,980
one or two years so if you can do

00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,530
anything ahead of time make sure that

00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:59,690
you get on that list as soon as possible

00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:01,550
and this isn't to say that there's not

00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:03,890
going to be a spot in a daycare

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,959
somewhere but all of the top rated ones

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,100
are always filled up way in advance and

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,429
so those are the ones that I'm really

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,449
talking about

00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:13,939
something that I would do again is

00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:16,699
joining my local Facebook baby gear

00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:19,100
resale group I don't know if Facebook is

00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:21,919
used as widely here but if you have any

00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:24,470
sort of social media or groups where

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,509
people share have shared interests I

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,129
would definitely look for shared groups

00:17:26,509 --> 00:17:31,070
because people would solve these big

00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:32,720
garbage bags of baby clothes for $25

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,820
because they wanted to get rid of it and

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,679
get something for it it saved me and my

00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,639
husband a ton of money so definitely

00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:42,769
look into that you're having a baby soon

00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:44,480
also this was something that was totally

00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:46,730
out of left field for me but if you want

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,190
newborn photos schedule it now for the

00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:51,470
sleepy two-week period in the first two

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,600
weeks baby sleep through everything uh I

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,059
think a car could like explode and they

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,529
would still stay asleep this is the best

00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:00,139
time for them to take pictures but it's

00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:01,999
also the time when photographers are

00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:03,440
super full because that's when the best

00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:05,330
pictures come out so if this is

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,740
something you want to do make sure that

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:10,759
you find a photographer that you like

00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:12,710
and book them now so the last thing that

00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:14,600
I wouldn't do is starting a big

00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,149
remodeling project when my due date was

00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,309
less than two months away so you might

00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:21,110
laugh and wonder who would decide to do

00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:22,909
a big renovation when they're pregnant

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:26,299
and the answer is a lot of people

00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:28,220
including me him a husband this is what

00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:30,830
our master bathroom looked like 50 days

00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,720
from when I was due and there's

00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:34,999
something about knowing that a baby's

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,279
coming and that wanting to make sure

00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:39,289
that your space is a good space for them

00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:42,169
to grow up in as well as knowing how

00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:43,460
much harder is gonna be to remodel once

00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:45,409
the baby's here that makes a lot of

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,210
people decide to suddenly do big

00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:49,129
construction projects right before the

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,629
baby's due I know at least two other

00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,879
people who did it around the same time

00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,889
as me and none of them including ours

00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:56,899
finished on time because babies are

00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:59,269
generally on time whereas construction

00:18:56,899 --> 00:19:00,860
projects generally aren't and as much as

00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:02,720
you might think you need to upgrade your

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,730
kitchen or your bathroom now it just

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,570
adds a bunch of struts that you really

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:11,720
don't need so don't do it

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:14,270
so the last section is babies here

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,580
hooray the first few days in the

00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:18,260
hospital were such a blur for me that I

00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,970
was really grateful that I got to stay

00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,280
in the hospital for four days because

00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,260
there the nurses do everything for you

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,510
and then I remember when we were leaving

00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,160
the hospital thinking are they seriously

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,350
letting me a person who doesn't know

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,360
anything just take this helpless tiny

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:35,230
little thing home yep

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,120
they are congratulations you're a parent

00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,170
don't panic

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,720
just kidding your new parent you're

00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:44,500
gonna panic about everything so all I

00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:48,230
can say is just breathe it'll be okay I

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,640
also found out a few surprising things

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,070
about life with a newborn that I

00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,720
couldn't find on Google anywhere and if

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,010
someone had told me this I would have

00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,560
felt a lot better knowing that

00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:59,750
everything was normal so I'm gonna tell

00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,180
let you in on a few of those things I

00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,130
found out so you have to know waking

00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:06,110
newborns up every three hours to feed

00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:09,980
them if they don't wake themselves up

00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:11,330
they this totally blew my mind like

00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,280
knowing that I would have to be up every

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,530
three hours because the baby woke me up

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,880
was already pretty bad but then

00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,920
realizing that I'd have to set my own

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,930
alarm and wake ourselves off was just

00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:23,480
torturous but it's just something that

00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:25,860
you're gonna have to do so just be

00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,090
prepared and sleep a lot now

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,680
also babies don't like to sleep by

00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:33,070
themselves they love sleeping in your

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,230
arms so in the US we use cribs pretty

00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:37,300
much everybody's crib was unused for the

00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:38,770
first three months including ours so the

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,270
good news is that if you haven't put

00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:42,070
together whatever it is that you

00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:44,620
typically put your baby to sleep in

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:45,670
you've got lots of time the bad news is

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,960
you're not gonna get to sleep at all

00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,190
because you're going to just be holding

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,510
this baby while they're sleeping and

00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,120
hoping that they don't wake up

00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:54,450
but again just be prepared and know that

00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,450
it's normal

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,680
also babies have a superhuman ability to

00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,510
detect when you're trying to sit down so

00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,090
remember you have to wake yourself up

00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,740
every three hours to feed them and then

00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,300
put them back to sleep they won't let

00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:09,430
you sit down when you're doing that you

00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,320
have to keep walking back and forth back

00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,180
and forth even though you think that

00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,190
they're asleep the second you start

00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,740
squatting into a sitting position they

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,060
will wake right up so just again be

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,620
prepared and know you're gonna be doing

00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:22,900
a lot of walking back and forth in the

00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,340
dark so those were the three biggest

00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,080
surprising things about life with

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,520
newborns I have a ton more but I don't

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,960
have enough time to talk about them so

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,720
come find me if you want to find out

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,850
more of the things that I figure it out

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,290
I have I also had some advice that I

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:37,240
wish I could have given to my former

00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:39,730
self which is that the first six weeks

00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,410
are a huge roller coaster they're way

00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,450
harder than anyone ever warns you about

00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:45,160
I think I cried maybe every other day

00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:46,870
it's totally normal

00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,700
the thing is no one tells you until

00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:51,280
you're talking to them about it and so

00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,380
I'm here to tell you it's normal but

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,420
also be on the lookout for signs of

00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:57,490
postpartum depression there's it affects

00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,530
a lot more women and even some men then

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,790
you would realize and so make sure that

00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,160
you're checking yourself and your

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,440
partner for that also breastfeeding is

00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,850
harder than anyone tells you big part of

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,800
why I cried every other day for the

00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:10,510
first six weeks it's normal and it's

00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,100
okay to feel like you have no idea what

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,820
you're doing but it's also okay to

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,530
decide if you want to stop

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,360
also say no to everybody who wants to

00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:21,160
come over in the first six weeks it's

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,170
really hard feeling like you have to

00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,600
clean everything up and play hostess

00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,820
tour host when you're super tired you're

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,380
not feeling good about yourself but if

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,450
you're not able to actually say no to

00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,800
people it's feel free to take a nap when

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,390
people come over you don't have to

00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,430
entertain them that's what the babies

00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:39,520
for just throw the baby at them go to

00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:42,190
sleep and the last thing is it

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,440
excuse me it's okay to put the baby down

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:46,600
in a safe space and walk away for a few

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,179
minutes if you need to compose yourself

00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,140
so I had a friend tell me that and I

00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:52,000
didn't really understand what she was

00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,890
talking about until I was feeling super

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,020
overwhelmed one day and having that

00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:57,730
permission was really helpful so I'm

00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:02,290
giving all of you permission to do that

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:04,929
as well I lied this is the last part so

00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:07,030
everyone's gonna have advice feel free

00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:08,650
to ignore everything that people say

00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:11,290
including what I'm saying and all of us

00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:12,880
talk and just do what you want so hold

00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:16,120
your baby as much as you want or not

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:20,830
sleep train or not restrict screen time

00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:22,750
or not do what works for your family so

00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,210
I do have one last section but going

00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:29,040
back to work could be its own whole talk

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:31,680
so I just have a few survival tips

00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,980
number one be gentle with yourself the

00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,810
first few days weeks months years are

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,610
tough for everyone and even if you're

00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:41,490
super excited to be back at work it's

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:44,060
okay to feel weird now that you don't

00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:46,350
have a baby attached to your hip 24/7

00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,180
also don't expect to be a hundred

00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:49,410
percent right away you're gonna think

00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,510
that everyone thinks that you're behind

00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,980
are going too slow it's not true and if

00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:56,580
that is what you're thinking that is not

00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,560
the best place to work anyway I don't

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:01,830
know if working remotely is super

00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,580
widespread here but if you can work

00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,380
remotely

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,590
when possible it just makes things a lot

00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:09,600
easier for me I remember when I had a

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,800
one hour commute each way and I would

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,600
just spend time sitting in traffic

00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,280
thinking like I could be at home hanging

00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,160
out with my kid right now so if you can

00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,930
reduce your traffic time or anything

00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,390
like that working remotely is really

00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:23,760
great also if you have to travel there

00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:25,320
are milk shipping services that exists I

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,660
did not know about this at all at

00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,040
luckily I didn't need it but you can

00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,660
pump milk if you're on a business trip

00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,120
and then ship it back to your house so

00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,920
whoever is taking care of your baby can

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,780
actually continue to feed them your milk

00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,090
if that's what you want to do and then

00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,850
finally put your life on easy mode so

00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:43,830
whether that's getting takeout delivery

00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:45,660
of toilet paper and everything using

00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,150
paper plates forks so you don't have to

00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:49,710
do dishes you know just do everything

00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,270
that you can you're in survival mode for

00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,460
at least the first six months do

00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:56,040
everything that you can can to make your

00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:59,070
life easy I have about a million more

00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:02,220
tips like I said but I am out of time so
