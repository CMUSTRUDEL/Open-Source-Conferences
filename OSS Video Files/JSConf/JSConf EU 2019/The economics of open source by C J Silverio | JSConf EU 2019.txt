Title: The economics of open source by C J Silverio | JSConf EU 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-03
Playlist: JSConf EU 2019
Description: 
	The JS package commons is in the hands of a for-profit entity. We trust npm with our shared code, but we have no way to hold npm accountable for its behavior. A trust-based system cannot function without accountability, but somebody still has to pay for the servers. How did we get here, and what should JavaScript do now?

>> All right!

00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,480
You're tired?

00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,029
You're hot, it's been a long day.

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:18,029
Shake it out a little bit.

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:19,029
Shake it out.

00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:20,029
All right.

00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:21,029
Here we are.

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,369
So, I'm going to talk about economics of package management, and more specifically in open

00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:26,369
source.

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:35,260
It's - I'm going to tell you a story about who owns the JavaScript language commons,

00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,780
how we got into this situation with the JavaScript language commons is by someone, and why we

00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,730
need to change it.

00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:49,690
This is a story about money, ownership, and control, as much as it is about JavaScript.

00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,390
I am going to tell you this story.

00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,710
I'm going to tell you the version of the story I know how to tell.

00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:03,239
I'm one human being with imperfect knowledge as a point of view, so this story is not the

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,700
only story anyone could tell about it - not by a long way.

00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,810
I could tell you a good version of one slice of this story because I was part of it.

00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:19,649
I was at its heart, because, until last year, I was CTO of NPM Inc.

00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:26,810
This gives me an expertise on the topic few people in the world have.

00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,179
It also comes with a point of view, and I'm going to invite you to keep my point of view

00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:34,119
in mind as you hear this story.

00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:37,979
You're in this story.

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:38,979
Yes, you.

00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:44,070
I bet you didn't know you were part of this story.

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,850
You will know why you're part of it, and you will know why your participation matters when

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,280
I'm done with this story.

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,860
It's a story about money, people who have money, and people who make money from open-source

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:05,179
software are not the people who - it's the story of an accidental decision that you made

00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:09,630
without knowing about it, and one that I made consciously, and how that decision working

00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,630
out today.

00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,860
So it's a story about ownership, control, and their consequences.

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:21,629
It's also a story about power: who has it, how much of it you have, and what you can

00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,599
do with it.

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,569
Are you ready?

00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:26,569
[Cheering].

00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,239
All right.

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,540
Here we go.

00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:34,099
Do you remember Yahoo!

00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:39,599
A story kind of starts with Yahoo back in its glory days in the mid-2000s.

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,600
JavaScript was the heart of a lot of JavaScript activity back then.

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,819
It employed a lot of thought leaders like Douglas Crockford, if it was pushing state

00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:47,950
of the art forward.

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,780
It might not have had a good business plan but it did have a good tech stack.

00:02:52,780 --> 00:03:00,530
It had a package manager called YPM and it did neat things.

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,200
People who used it liked it.

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,670
About at the same time all this was happening, and, you know, action and Yahoo, JavaScript

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:15,659
was itself kind of taking off, and in an interesting way, thanks to things like jQuery, and browser

00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:21,879
makers deciding to adhere to a common spec for once.

00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,370
JavaScript exploded.

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,320
Server-side JavaScript was starting to be a big topic, and it was here in 2009, ten

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:35,909
years ago, where Dahl announced node.js and that turned out to be the JavaScript platform

00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:38,420
we wanted on the server.

00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:43,499
Now, the early Node community was a happening place.

00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:46,260
It was a scene.

00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,709
It swept up a whole bunch of interesting people from systems programming and web programming,

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,750
and people who really enjoyed being at a bleeding edge ecosystem where a whole lot of stuff

00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,310
hadn't been invented yet.

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,859
Several of the people involved early on figured out earlier on that package management would

00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:08,109
be a pretty great thing, and there were a bunch of package managers, plural, being written

00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:10,709
- yeah, more than one.

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,299
One of these people was a Yahoo employee.

00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:16,169
He was super into Node.

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:20,900
He quit his job so that he could write something inspired by the Yahoo package manager but

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:29,160
for node.js, and this particular programmer was clever in a couple of really useful ways.

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,310
For one thing, he got really super involved with Node, and this let him work on the Node

00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,590
side implementation and his package manager at the same time.

00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:44,170
He could make installer work right, and he really championed the common JS implementation

00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,040
that Node has.

00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:52,530
He did other stuff to beat other package managers, going around to other managers to support

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:55,440
pull requests of his rather than the other one.

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,970
Pretty smart.

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:05,220
His was good enough and useful enough, the right solution, supported well enough so that

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:14,000
it won, so that the node package manager, or npm, was put along with node rather than

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,260
a third-party thing that you downloaded.

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:26,170
Official status granted by the Node Project continues to today.

00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:33,250
Right about this time, bought Node from Dahl for a paltry amount of money.

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:40,250
You notice we're already in interesting economic territory.

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:46,400
The man who invented node.js, the tool used by everyone in this room, and millions of

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:53,580
people daily to develop JavaScript, made a few tens of thousands of dollars from it.

00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:59,630
Whoever is making money from Node today, it's not its inventor.

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:05,350
He did at least make a living after selling it, because he was hired, which is pretty

00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:14,000
good, and the joint also hired the programmer who made Node's package manager, but, important

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,260
plot point, he retained ownership of it.

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:25,650
He retained ownership of the npm domain name and source code.

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:33,370
He didn't turn it all over to it Joyen the way the Node source had been.

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,400
This decision matters later, so, in the it.

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:44,390
The open source doesn't mean open ownership or control, it means you get to read the source

00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,390
for something.

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:50,370
And the ability to read part of the source from something doesn't mean you can change

00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,370
that source.

00:06:51,370 --> 00:07:00,590
It doesn't give you any control over it, what it does, or what it .... The story moved forward,

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:06,110
you've probably heard this part before, 2012, Dahl leaves the npm project.

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:14,160
Right up about here is where all of you start appearing on the scene, or some of you anyway.

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,450
You're JavaScript programmers.

00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,530
You like writing JavaScript.

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,530
If you can write a tool in JavaScript, you will.

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,000
So you started writing JavaScript with Node, and you liked it.

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,310
Meanwhile, people like me, who are kind of mixed about JavaScript - don't tell anyone!

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,450
- I figured out that Node was handy for writing I/O multiplexing services and thought this

00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,450
is fun.

00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:41,220
As 2013 went on, more and more people got on the Node train and Node got popular.

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,330
It meant npm got pretty popular.

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,420
That's great.

00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,970
Right?

00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,060
Well, no.

00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,650
Success is a catastrophe for a lot of projects.

00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:01,880
It's a catastrophe you need to survive, and success for npm was a catastrophe.

00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,860
Here's why: npm's package registry is centralised.

00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:14,500
It is not just a CLI tool that grabs the code and puts it to to your hard drive and do modules.

00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,300
The CLI probably is the least important part of the machinery despite how frequently you

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,520
interact with it.

00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:29,930
Npm is most importantly to all of you a centralised package registry and a repository.

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:35,760
Right from the beginning, the registry was there running inside a Crouch DB database

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,130
on the same domain it is today.

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:43,769
Registry is just a list of all the packages you can install, their authors, anywhere names,

00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:44,769
their versions.

00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:50,410
The repository part is the part that stores all those packages in a centralised spot.

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,079
This is pretty great, because it makes installing them fast and reliable.

00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:58,810
Someone is work on making that central repository zippy.

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:06,740
There's a lot to unpack there.

00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:12,069
Centralisation is what we are talking about here, and centralisation has some advantages.

00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:14,810
The npm registry is centralised.

00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:16,920
It comes with usability wins.

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,959
You only need to go to one place to look for something.

00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:24,290
That one place can enforce some rules about the things you're looking for that they all

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:28,569
look the same, that they provide the same kind of information, maybe they don't even

00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:31,660
vanish on a whim when their owner gets board.

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,449
Centralisation has advantages that matter to you.

00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:40,391
I've been doing a Go programming lately, and it's weird.

00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:44,181
It's very strange to try to find Go packages, because they're everywhere, and the only way

00:09:44,181 --> 00:09:46,540
to find them is Google them.

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:52,639
You look at these old-fashioned lists of really exciting Go packages, the thing that Yahoo

00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,779
used to do, like a hand-made list of things.

00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:01,420
When I install these packages, I is that you will from GitHub repos I can just vanish.

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:10,749
So I have expectations that come from having used npm for eight years, and Go decent meet

00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:12,579
any of those expectations.

00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:18,249
The absence of a central registry for Go has helped me understand what NPM provides every

00:10:18,249 --> 00:10:22,470
JavaScript programmer.

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,199
Centralisation is such an advantage that it is a trend.

00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,089
Blogs were something you used to host on your own.

00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:34,480
You used to buy your own domain name and spin up a server and host a blog.

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,910
Through the last ten years, there's been this big trend towards centralised hosting platforms.

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:46,750
You know, things that can provide a reliable place for you to put your blog, like MySpace.

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:56,860
Yes, Tumblr medium, social media centralised, Twitter and Facebook, and open source is even

00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,260
centralised.

00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:04,490
So, okay, npm is a centralised registry for the node packages.

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:10,279
In 2013, it wasn't great.

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,850
Why?

00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:17,380
Downside of centralisation is that costs are costs are centralised.

00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:22,639
Downside of npm's registry is that all that use centred on a single database with a ... inside

00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,459
it.

00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:29,430
Here's a fact of the world: servers cost money.

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,199
Who pays for them?

00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:39,029
For years, Node manager ran on donated hosting.

00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:43,899
It was written with help from some of the people involved in implementing CouchDB, and

00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:56,910
it free loaded on a bunch of CouchDB hosting services, treated as an ad for Couch - they

00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:06,160
continued to host Node's package manager, and then it wasn't so cheap.

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,559
Success, the catastrophe, is expensive.

00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:20,709
You all started using Node and that ad stopped being cheap the other various lazy short cuts

00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:24,670
in implementing the registry starting have an effect once the registry saw some real

00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,160
use.

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,759
The registry was down more than it was up in 2013.

00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,240
Npm needed money.

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,920
It needed a maintainer who didn't ignore it for a day job.

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,540
This is not a particularly new problem.

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,430
Every language ecosystem at some point if they have a centralised package registry also

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,629
has this problem.

00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:55,589
Ruby Gems cost money to run too, they run on donations.

00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:00,820
CPen, they solved their problem 20 years ago with a network of mirrors, a lot of smaller

00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:09,490
language ecosystems, some by free loading on GitHub, public repos, like Cocoa Pods and

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,810
others.

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:17,769
What npm's owner decided to do was pretty novel: he decided to found a company.

00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:27,050
This is possible because he still owned it.

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:33,420
He found his company, npm Inc, and he takes seed funding.

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:41,089
And here's our decision point: Node Project decided this was fine.

00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:45,189
They continued to give npm special privileges something they bundle along.

00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:48,970
I don't know if there was internal controversy about this because I wasn't part of it.

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:54,360
Node Project was entering its moribund period around this time, so maybe decision was made

00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,579
through inaction, I don't know.

00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:03,579
They continued to affirmatively decide that's what they want to do every year since then.

00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:07,670
You decided this was fine.

00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,470
You voted with your feet.

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,949
You kept using the npm registry.

00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:20,850
But CJ, I hear you say, I wasn't around then.

00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,589
You weren't around, then.

00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:23,589
Then.

00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:24,779
You inherited this decision.

00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:28,449
You don't know it was a decision.

00:14:28,449 --> 00:14:32,579
Npm is out there as a fun question fact of JavaScript life.

00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:36,050
You might not have known it was a company at all, right?

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:42,519
At the time, it was pretty controversial president the company that had been hosting npm was

00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:46,699
really pissed off about it.

00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:55,300
They ended up raising a bunch of money the same time the VC money came in, and there

00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,990
were lawyers involved.

00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,399
I don't know much about this.

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,490
I just know that npm exited the node messily.

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:12,360
Later, npm exited Joyant's hosting because they were also fighting.

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,309
I don't know, money: it changes everything.

00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:24,490
Friendships made when it is all just open source fun, end under the strain of competing

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,790
for dollars.

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:31,129
Here's another thing: I decided this was fine.

00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:34,779
I decided to let JavaScript's language commons be owned by venture capitalists.

00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:37,910
I didn't frame it that way to myself, though.

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:44,920
The decision I told myself I was making was the decision to contribute what I could to

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,699
making Node successful.

00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:48,230
As a huge Node fan.

00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:50,130
I really liked programming in Node.

00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,130
I still do.

00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:55,959
That was the first place I had ever participated in open source.

00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:04,290
So, npm Inc is a company, has VC money and started hiring people.

00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:13,319
The first person they hired at - I second hire was me.

00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:14,869
I wanted to make it go better.

00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:21,869
I told the story - I was told the story by the owner that we would to make it self-sustaining

00:16:21,869 --> 00:16:26,239
take, and the servers would hum along happily dispensing packages for the masses forever

00:16:26,239 --> 00:16:29,029
and every.

00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,800
I ended up leading npm engineering team.

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,540
You know this part of the story.

00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,660
Large numbers are very large.

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,129
You install lots of packages.

00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:44,959
Npm was successful, it scaled, and Node exploded as a result.

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,910
You started using Node to do everything, and npm is now an unquestioned part of your work

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,910
flow.

00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:57,690
You reinvented web development in ways you wouldn't do before npm was there, reliable,

00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,399
providing shared code.

00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,489
Lucky it's some kind of utility.

00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:04,339
It's the highlight of an excellent career.

00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,809
I'm still pretty proud of it.

00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:08,630
Let's pause here.

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:15,970
We're at the zenith of node's package manager.

00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,689
Let's talk about money.

00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:21,909
I love money.

00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:26,720
Why isn't Ryan Dahl living on a tropical island?

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:34,880
Why isn't James Halliday retired on a tropical island he lives on now?

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,950
Why isn't Dominic Tar living in a yacht instead of a sailboat?

00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,510
Does he still live in a sailboat?

00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:45,000
Why does Doug Wilson have a day job?

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,700
Do you know those names?

00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,679
They're the authors of software you have on your laptops right now.

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:58,130
Software that is the beating heart of 1,000 programmes that business runs every day.

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:03,539
Every Fortune 500 company will is runs the software written by those people.

00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:08,980
And dozens of other people who I don't have time to list who contributed packages to npm

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,750
in the early days, and do so even now.

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:18,510
Those people are not well think, despite the enormous value created by the software they

00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,650
make.

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:27,260
Capitalism, yes, it's unfortunately, as you problem already know, capitalism is supposed

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:34,299
to reward people like them, but in practice, it doesn't.

00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:43,309
Most of us give away the source without expecting we will make money of it.

00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:48,890
Most people who named contributed to JavaScript commons without wanting their tropical island.

00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,000
They might wish they had them but they didn't expect them.

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,230
Money was not on their minds.

00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:58,809
That was back in the early days of Node when the contributors knew each other.

00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:04,730
They were just exchanging gifts with their peers, fellow Node programmers.

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:10,809
All right, now here, I want to talk about the difference between the open-source and

00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:12,050
free software.

00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,210
You're aware of this difference.

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:25,910
It's the free software you install - the Gnu licence, like, aims to make you have to give

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,950
away the thing you make with the source code you've shared.

00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:36,290
And over here, in Eric Raymond land, it goes a little differently.

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:42,399
We can argue about whether Stallman's Gnu licence achieves it or not.

00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:46,160
I'm not going to join that argument right now.

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:52,690
I will point out that Eric Raymond's style free software, MST licence, and permissive

00:19:52,690 --> 00:20:01,110
licence is almost certainly the kind of open source you practise.

00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,160
You treat the GPL like poison.

00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,570
You've chosen open source, not free software.

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,070
Capitalism freaking loves open source, let me tell you.

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:16,049
Companies get a lot of good stuff for free, and they have no requirements on them for

00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,049
using it.

00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:23,880
It takes it even further, I think by telling you that you have to do this get hired.

00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:29,210
GitHub is your résumé, they tell you, and they stretch out their hand to take their

00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,559
free software from you to build things with.

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,019
Dominic Tar gives away pull stream and every Fortune 500 company uses it, and he doesn't

00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:40,690
get compensated.

00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,230
This is a reality.

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,950
I don't think I can fix that.

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:50,340
You notice that there is a person in the story that didn't give his stuff away?

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,899
That's pretty smart, right?

00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:55,870
He's the one who didn't give away his intellectual property is the one who will make a pile of

00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,870
money from this.

00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,110
He planned ahead in the ways that other people didn't.

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:07,350
Of course, he's not actually going to make most money anybody makes from npm, because

00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:11,190
the people who are actually going to make money from npm are the venture capitalists

00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,039
who invested in it.

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,000
People who truly do well in this story are the people who had money to begin with, people

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,691
who had nothing to do with JavaScript, effectively only our language commons.

00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:26,440
What does our language commons - what is our language commons?

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,870
Shall I define that?

00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,690
Let's do it.

00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,890
Commons in English means the resources available to everybody.

00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:41,200
It's like natural resources, like the air we breathe, or a field that we all share to

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,200
graze our sheep - shared.

00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,000
For us in the JavaScript community, the language spec is our commons.

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,919
That's owned by an organisation that is set up to allow JavaScript's users to all co-operate

00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,899
and design and build it.

00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:58,240
TC39 has done pretty well by JavaScript.

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,539
All of our shared code is part of our JavaScript commons.

00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:06,460
The registry that lists all this shared code is part of our commons.

00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:13,480
The connections we use to share code in it is part of our commons.

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,429
But all of that is owned by a VC-funded private company.

00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:23,110
This is the thing we as a group have given away.

00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:32,230
Ryan Dahl was here last year, and he had something interesting to say.

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:38,860
It's unfortunate that there is a centralised privately controlled, even, repository for

00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,860
modules.

00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,380
I saw that, I wanted to argue with him about centralisation, but I had to agree with his

00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,110
comment about private control.

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:49,169
What are the consequences of private control?

00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:51,870
Why do I think that's a problem?

00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:59,910
Well, none of us have any input into registry policies.

00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:02,470
What gets a package removed from the registry?

00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,110
What is acceptable to be on the registry.

00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,630
How are disputes about package names resolved?

00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:14,480
What happens when two people fight about a package name and they can't make up their

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
minds about it?

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
You letter Left Pad?

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,510
I bet you remember Left Pad.

00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:24,679
The publication policy didn't exist before Left Pad happened because it didn't occur

00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,940
to npm, a private institution, to think about the use case.

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:33,620
They don't act proactively to solve problems until they exist and are in their faces.

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,980
This is northerly.

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,889
You don't want to have to deal with something until you have to.

00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:41,340
You have no input into registry features.

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:46,520
You might have a wish list, but you don't get it.

00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,590
There's no way for you to contribute.

00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,760
There's no way for you to say you demand something.

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,200
You want package signing?

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,340
Good luck.

00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,440
You're not likely to see it.

00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,789
Maybe if a major security incident happens or a major public outcry happens, you'll get

00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:03,830
it, but it would have to be an existential threat.

00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:07,630
And note that hear I'm talking about the registry, not the client.

00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:12,780
The registry is closed source, the policies that regulate it are not open to our influence.

00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,049
The NPM CLI is open source but it's unimportant.

00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:22,799
The key building blocks that you would need to write your own CLI are all open source

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,269
and not under npm's control.

00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:31,720
But a third of you use another client to react anyway.

00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,110
The management of our commons is opaque to us.

00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:40,159
It will be opaque to you until the company that owns it has a financial incentive to

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,730
change it.

00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,210
You don't know what is happening with your package data.

00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,340
You have to trust it.

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:55,580
There is no trust without a accountability, and we have no - we as the JavaScript have

00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,430
no way to hold npm Inc accountable.

00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:04,670
When I was there, I could tell myself that I trusted myself and my team, and I knew our

00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:10,620
intentions were so good, and motivations were good, with we have to have 2FA.

00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,460
This was not a good answer.

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:19,190
I was wrong to have relied on that answer, because you had no way to hold me accountable,

00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,019
and test that I was trustworthy.

00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:23,840
Oops.

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,909
Am I saying that npm is evil?

00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:29,380
Moo.

00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,679
Ask a different question.

00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:35,159
It's a private entity in control of our commons.

00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,159
It's not good or evil.

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,140
The question of its benevolence is the wrong question to ask.

00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,220
Npm is not a benevolent institution.

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,539
It can't be one.

00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:50,830
The possibility of it being one is the ended the day they took VC funding.

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,660
That decision took it into a financial instrument.

00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,259
I mean something very specific when I say that.

00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:01,289
Financial instruments are contracts about money.

00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:03,559
They're widgets that can be traded.

00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:08,950
Npm Inc, the thing that owns our language ecosystem, is a thing that might as well be

00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,920
a collection of pork bellies as far as its owners are concerned.

00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,429
They make contracts with each other and trade bits of it around.

00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:19,190
It's a means for turning money into more money.

00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:24,179
It is important to keep this in mind as you evaluate your interactions with it, and your

00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:28,080
interactions with the people who represented it.

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,060
This means to look at incentives.

00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,450
Money is a lot of incentives for a lot of actors in this story.

00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,950
Companies do not love you.

00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:42,950
Not even companies that make something you like.

00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:49,309
That phrase is a marketing message designed to get you to mistake the financial instrument

00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:51,639
for something that might be your friend.

00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:53,220
That marketing message is powerful.

00:26:53,220 --> 00:27:01,169
You've got a cuddly mascot and a great stickers, and a red emoji heart, and you're on board,

00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:02,169
right?

00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:03,890
Npm does not love you.

00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,960
It can't love you.

00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,519
It's a Delaware corporation founded as a financial instrument intended to turn money into more

00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:13,110
money for a handful of people you don't know.

00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:17,669
And here's the other thing: nobody believes that message any more.

00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:23,000
When I first knew I wanted to talk to you all about this, instead of just whispering

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,559
in a corner with friends, I thought I had an uphill battle to go.

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:39,799
The VC package managing company was - I said that message, what I meant by it was

00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:44,629
that I, CJ feel affection for you, stranger.

00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:45,850
I kind of do.

00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,980
But, you know, it was true.

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:48,980
I did.

00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,030
I still do.

00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:54,419
But I don't think anyone can stand up in front of you now, after the PR events of the last

00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,870
few months and think that npm loves you.

00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:02,450
It's burned a lot of goodwill in the last couple of months - by choice, deliberately.

00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,090
They made the choice, they double-downed on it, and here we are.

00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,950
You're willing to listen to this now.

00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:11,590
So, how did we get there?

00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,250
It's 2018, packages flow like water.

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,500
You just - you don't you care where they come from.

00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:27,110
They cost money, even if you're not paying for them.

00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:30,789
Npm has been spending venture capital money to deliver you all those packages for free

00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:33,510
this whole time.

00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,090
Venture capitalists eventually want their money back.

00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:42,360
They want that 10x return on investment.

00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,840
VCs want you to go big or go home.

00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,029
That means they want you to burn your cash or succeed or fail.

00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:52,470
VC money is interested in returning the investment.

00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,139
There's nothing wrong with that, in my view.

00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:58,779
Some companies are shaped like VCs want to shape.

00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:02,321
I don't think that's really the problem.

00:29:02,321 --> 00:29:05,020
The problem is that our language ecosystem is there.

00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:10,419
Remember, there are obligations of the people who own npm, not to us.

00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:14,679
Make money or raise money by telling a story about making money to raise money ... money.

00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:16,509
It's all about the money.

00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:19,070
So in 2018, they hired a new CEO.

00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,389
It's pretty interesting.

00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:26,110
Thank God - yeah.

00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,220
The culture.

00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,090
The culture that they exported as their marketing message started to look a little threadbare

00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,750
right around then.

00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,400
Everyone, including me, learned it was just a marketing message and actually not deeply

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,770
held values.

00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,080
Npm's PR troubles are known to all of you as a result.

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,639
We are a community that enjoys drama - have a some drama.

00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:53,190
Even if it had somebody who is a good actor at its head, there would be - that person

00:29:53,190 --> 00:30:00,860
would have a big problem to solve, and here's the problem: centralised registries are expensive.

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:11,049
The part where the packages are stored are expensive.

00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:17,539
It controls all JavaScript development, because every single one of you willingly proxies

00:30:17,539 --> 00:30:20,580
all of your JavaScript development through it.

00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:26,230
The data, the data gathered from your usage of it, and you heard the talk earlier today,

00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,470
that's the value.

00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:32,090
Every time you run an audit, npm looks at your package lock, chock-full of information

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,269
about what you've been up to.

00:30:34,269 --> 00:30:43,809
Yes, you know what they say about when you're not paying for the product, you might be the

00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,309
product?

00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:46,820
Yeah.

00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,830
It's there.

00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:53,779
The thread is dangling over your head right now.

00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:58,710
I think we're in a situation right now that is not going to last very long.

00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:04,030
The npm hasn't fully had its reckoning with its investors or with us.

00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:08,419
It's had lay-offs but we don't know has going on inside, but the point is, the ground has

00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:10,279
shifted under our feet a little bit.

00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:14,659
Anyone who wasn't asking if npm is stable is now asking that.

00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:21,299
We know that it doesn't love us and it doesn't love its employees, either.

00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:24,799
This is not our own option.

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,080
The story didn't have to go this way.

00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,350
People chose it, and here we are.

00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,169
What are we going to do about it?

00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:36,899
You, you sitting in this audience right now: what are you going to do about it?

00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:40,540
Are you going to do nothing?

00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,540
That's easy.

00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,230
We made our community decision in 2013, and we're stuck with it.

00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:53,149
We wait for npm Inc to fail - not if, when - a nasty couple of months replacing the registry.

00:31:53,149 --> 00:31:56,380
I don't like this answer.

00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,350
Imagine npm selling to somebody we don't like, corporate pirate, someone that takes over

00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:04,591
adversarial and shakes them down for pocket change, someone who doesn't have an incentive

00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:09,830
to keep the registry up, threatens to take it down to see what we would do about it.

00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:15,499
That's possible, frankly, because npm's board of directors hasn't done a very good job.

00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:19,660
Maybe we will be saved by Microsoft!

00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:22,460
[Laughter].

00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:27,220
I've been on the internet since 1987.

00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,360
I remember when Microsoft was actively evil.

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,010
I believe they might be again.

00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:36,279
Certainly Google is not benevolent, purely benevolent actor right now, even though they've

00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:37,509
got fountains of money.

00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:42,499
I would like to avoid having to come here ten years from now and make the same talk

00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:43,499
again.

00:32:43,499 --> 00:32:47,270
I think in the end, I agree with Ryan Dahl.

00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:51,330
JavaScript's package registry should not be privately controlled.

00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:55,700
Centralisation is a burden that will lead to private control because the servers cost

00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,809
money and that's just a fact.

00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:04,350
But I think if we load to many people, we can share this burden.

00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:10,520
Who knows, from once it's under the burden, npm can be a normal company and try to make

00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:12,559
a profit for itself.

00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,520
Do you think that's impossible?

00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,679
Do you think npm's entrenched?

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,789
I'm not a big fan of - and I don't like the do-nothing answer.

00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:31,789
The other confession I make is that I believe in open source despite everything.

00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:36,429
I think it's good for us as human beings to give things away to each other, and I'm at

00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:42,090
peace with the idea that some corporation is going to make some pee from my work.

00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:50,360
So, Chris Dickinson, follow him on Twitter, we have an announcement: we would like to

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,370
give something away to you all right now.

00:33:53,370 --> 00:34:04,249
I would like to introduce you to Entropic, a federated package manager!

00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:21,020
[Cheering and applause].

00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:26,610
Yes!

00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,040
All right.

00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,950
It comes with its own CLI.

00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,819
It offers a new API for publication.

00:34:32,819 --> 00:34:34,909
You heard Kat talking about tink earlier.

00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:40,379
This was a dream Chris Dickinson and I have had for several years now, and we offer that

00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,159
file-based API.

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,589
It's federated.

00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:47,820
You depend on packages from other instances, you mirror your dependencies so you remain

00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:55,040
self-sufficient, requirements list, we Dockerised it, you sign in with your GitHub account.

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,819
Don't use it yet!

00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:58,020
[Laughter].

00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,560
The project is only a month old because Chris only escaped about a month ago, so that's

00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,660
when we started it.

00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:09,260
It's not ready for anybody to use, but people developing it, but, we do want your help.

00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,640
I hear QR codes are hip, so I've got one for you all.

00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,359
On GitHub, it's on open source right now.

00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:17,020
Tell me you can get there and see it.

00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:24,080
We've got a huge list to contribute to right now.

00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,960
I've just up a lot of your time.

00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,890
I'm going to run down very quickly what my goals are, why I did this.

00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:34,380
I want to prove to you all that we have power.

00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,650
We don't have to sit here and wait for fate to come to us.

00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,940
We can be optimist ic, proactive, and do something.

00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,579
You have power.

00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:47,740
Second, Chris and I will among a handful of human beings who actually deeply understand

00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,490
the problems that a language package registry has to solve.

00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:54,970
We spent years thinking about this and what we should do.

00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:58,270
I think that expertise is needed by our community right now.

00:35:58,270 --> 00:35:59,619
We want to share it.

00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:01,220
We choose to give it away.

00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,619
We will be working with the Open JS foundation on this.

00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:09,340
We are giving you the gift of our expertise and work.

00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,460
Third, I think it's right that this pendulum is swinging away from federation.

00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,309
I think move away from centralised solutions is good.

00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:22,869
The last decade has been about consolidation, and I think the coming decade is going to

00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:24,859
be federated.

00:36:24,859 --> 00:36:28,640
It's going to be cheaper for us all.

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,069
Yes!

00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:35,790
Yes, take it back!

00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,650
It's yours!

00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,440
It belongs to you!

00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
[Applause].

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,990
Let's make a different decision: we made this decision in 2013, and it made sense at the

00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:50,240
time, it's time to make a different one.

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,140
Entropic is the kick-start Chris and I will giving to this problem.

00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,680
There's a lot more to say.

00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:00,950
There's a lot of work to do on it, and I want to get to the point where I can tell you all

00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,441
to use it may be next year this time.

00:37:02,441 --> 00:37:06,490
It's time to move with our feet again.

00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:10,869
You are good, may amazing people, capable of building amazing things.

00:37:10,869 --> 00:37:12,290
Most of you are much smarter than I am.

00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,050
I want to hand this over to you.

00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,940
We should not be owned by a single company.

00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,740
Our commons should not be owned by a single company.

00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,220
We can do it.

00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:28,360
This is love from two human beings capable of love from us to you.

00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,760
What happens next is up to you.

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
Thank you.

00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,760
[Cheering and applause].

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,760
Go do it.

00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:32,763
