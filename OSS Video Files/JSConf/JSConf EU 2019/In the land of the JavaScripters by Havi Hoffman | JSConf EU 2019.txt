Title: In the land of the JavaScripters by Havi Hoffman | JSConf EU 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-27
Playlist: JSConf EU 2019
Description: 
	In 2009 I was managing Yahoo’s tech event budget when we agreed to sponsor the very first JSConf, the one that almost didn’t happen, the one that started something… And though I’ve still never attended a JSConf, nor learned to code, the zeitgeist of the JavaScript community and its event culture have had a profound effect on how I live and the devrel work I do.

I’d like to speak about cultivating “JavaScript: The Good Times”—the evolution of inclusiveness, the effort to replace customs that no longer reflect the values and demographics of the community, the focus on new practices for joyful conference-going and knowledge sharing. The JavaScript ethos has fueled a reinvention of the tech gathering as an act of participation and experiment, generating enduring artifacts for learning and excellent new habits for our relationships - personal and professional.

	00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,889
Wow.

00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:12,880
We are in the land of the JavaScripters.

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,680
But you already knew that.

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:24,660
So, today, I'm going to share some thoughts in a medium that you probably weren't expecting.

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:34,620
I know I'm not the first person to bring poetry to a tech conference, and I sincerely hope

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,399
I'm not the last.

00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:46,290
You see, JavaScript, and the people who write JavaScript - that's you all - have been essential

00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,420
to my work in developer relations.

00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:59,640
I've watched the culture and the language evolve and grow up over the past decade.

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,660
This is the tweet that went out announcing my talk.

00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:11,749
I was so excited and so honoured, I decided to embrace it, even though I have never, ever

00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:16,079
thought of myself as a golden girl.

00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,830
I had to wonder: what would you all be expecting from me?

00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:30,149
So I struggled for weeks trying to find a way into my story, and then one random Wednesday

00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:37,659
morning in April, after several weeks of waking up in the middle of the night in the dark,

00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:44,229
in a cold panic, I decided to get up and write.

00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,990
I began.

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,950
Why is my brain so unsharp?

00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:56,049
This might be my last conference talk ever!

00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:03,149
Then I kept going as the light crawled into the garden, and the birds started making noise,

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:10,489
I wrote, ""The JS Confs were punk rock, they cut the crap and went roller blading.""

00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:14,349
Then I stepped slowly away from the display.

00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:22,170
I grabbed a pad, a lined legal pad, and a pen, and started writing.

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:30,470
14 lines later, it was a Sonnet, strict rhyme scheme, a meter called iambic pentameter that

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:39,080
sounds like the beat of your heart.

00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,110
I felt lighter than I had in weeks.

00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:52,080
Writing poetry had put me into a fine state of flow.

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,560
This is the first one, the beginning.

00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:07,440
Here goes: when I consider JSConf EU and wonder what it is I have to share, heroic JavaScripters

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,450
I once knew, or why UI or Ajax, or would you even care?

00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:19,120
I've studied coders long, but not the code.

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,370
I know constraint can free up self-expression.

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:34,560
Rhyme, scheme, metre, platform, network, Node, but is there room on stage for true confession?

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:44,660
You see, I will speak of culture's evolution, but you are the artisan of JS give and taking,

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:54,680
and I'm not here to 'splain your revolution, it's iterative and comes from daily making,

00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:06,430
creating more than apps and interactions, you terraform immersive new distractions.

00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,560
You're going to see this slide at the close of every sonnet.

00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,520
I will read nine of them, or eight more of them today.

00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:25,080
It's a visualisation of Lorenz's strange contractor, a simplified model that describes con convex

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:37,090
know in the world's atmosphere, the unverified idea of the butterfly effect that small changes

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:46,090
of state like a butterfly flapping her wings can influence larger, more significant difference

00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:53,150
s later and elsewhere, like triggering a Tornado thousands of miles away.

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:57,449
We will get back to that a little bit later in the talk.

00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:05,639
For now, it turns out the constraints of poetry are not totally different from the constraints

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,240
of code.

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:15,639
In producing things of craft, and artfulness, in a sonnet, as in code, you have to pack

00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:23,330
a lot of meaning and intent into tightly controlled syntax and word choices.

00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:29,990
And then there are elegant ways to go bonkers and bend or break the rules.

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:36,350
Quick two-minute history of the sonnet form: it was created in Italy in the early 13th

00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:45,050
century, the poet Petrarch was its most famous practitioner.

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:52,110
The form travelled across Europe and arrived in England in the early 16th century, just

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:59,340
in time for the Liz - Elizabethan poets and Shakespeare most famously of all who wrote

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,759
164 sonnets.

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:10,960
Through the centuries, poets everywhere wrote sonnets in their own languages.

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:23,279
In Russia, in the early 1800s, Alexander Pushkin wrote a novel in verse called Eugene Onegin,

00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,729
about the life and times of a young romantic, let's say.

00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:39,150
In 1922, in German, in a chilly castle in Switzerland, the Austrian poet Rheiner wrote

00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:45,050
a 55-sonnet cycle called Sonnets to Orpheus.

00:06:45,050 --> 00:07:01,180
In 1986, inspired by Pushkin, Indian-born author Vikram Seth wrote Golden Gate.

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,900
He inspired me, and so it goes.

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:15,150
The sonnet endures as a poetic form for story-telling, philosophying, celebrations of love and festive

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:21,580
occasions.

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:33,620
The second sonnet, the origin story, was inspired by a talk from Jan Lenhardt written in 2015.

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:41,059
The times have changed with JavaScript's ascent.

00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,930
Since Voodoo Tik.

00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:53,339
God pitched us to sponsor a new event, a gathering in Washington beyond the web 2.0 of suits

00:07:53,339 --> 00:08:03,199
and swag, and paid product pitches, the first JSConf happened in the spring, and almost

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,630
didn't due to funding givens.

00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,630
But tickets sold.

00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:18,960
It was a homecoming for folks who didn't know that content plus fun could raise up a community

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,119
of like-minded coders where once was none.

00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:31,550
It was not long to find an opportunity to do another one in pulsing Berlin.

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:48,070
Jan, Malte, Kristina made the JSConfs and considers considers Confs pure win.

00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,750
In the sonnets ahead, I will continue to poke at the relationship between the writer's craft

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,640
and the coder's.

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,910
In Elizabethan England, poets would release their sonnets in private to an elite audience

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,990
before sharing them more widely, kind of like I'm doing here today.

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:11,600
So, please be kind to these little songs of mine.

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,520
Like me, they're travellers from an older world.

00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:26,680
Into JavaScript World Domination of course.

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,940
Trajectory is best viewed in retrospect.

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,890
A JS singularity was never inevitable.

00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:45,650
But loose federation makes network effect, and the JSConfs have been unforgettable.

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:55,000
Client side, server side, dark side of the moon, Asia, Australia, Colombia, Budapest.

00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,120
No JS and Tito launched from this cocoon, Iceland, Scotland, CSSConfs and the rest.

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:13,070
It's that magic dynamic that comes to your town, building cam lad which out of the fun.

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,810
Maybe it is conferences all the way down.

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:23,550
Artefacts of knowledge, with access for everyone.

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:38,020
And always new ideas are put in play, to globally influence a generation's way.

00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:44,780
One of those good ideas that did not emerge immediately was the need for a code of conduct.

00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,000
And a focused committed effort to enforce it.

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,060
A along with a commitment to foster a diverse, and inclusive environment for all attendees

00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:04,870
and all speakers, we can and we must keep doing better at this, and maybe this weekend,

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,180
I think this weekend has shown me some of what's possible.

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:20,970
So, the code of conduct: at our events, we do not tolerate harassment of participants

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,140
in any form.

00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,970
A posted code of conduct works to mitigate.

00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:32,210
In 2011, this was far from the norm.

00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:42,280
Today, we raise each other up through schooling for unbiased language and communication.

00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:51,790
Appropriate kindness and respect, and tooling to promote good behaviour and collaboration.

00:11:51,790 --> 00:12:01,260
We will not tolerate at our events stalking or following, or unwelcome comments.

00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:09,250
This unwelcome contact, this includes offensive verbal comments.

00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:18,690
You see a code of conduct is a pact, reminding each of us of our humanity, and hoping tolerance

00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,330
can replace profanity.

00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:29,170
Okay, in sonnet 5, I look back in time.

00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:35,800
Emma Lazarus was a writer and activist in New York City, well educated, and well to

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,220
do.

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:43,911
In 1883, she wrote the sonnet that eventually found the plaque on the pedestal in the on

00:12:43,911 --> 00:12:51,290
the Statue of Liberty in New York City Harbor.

00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:58,850
Those are the words of welcome for immigrants and refugees to the United States.

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:09,530
A digital immigrant, that's me, reflects on em-La Lazarus: the sonnet is a poem of 14

00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:15,950
lines, give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.

00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:29,160
Octave sestet define the sonnet of Shakespeare, Petrach that made the Statue of Liberty ever

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:39,310
more a mother of exiles, for every refugee, her lift ed lamp beside the golden door gives

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,450
worldwide welcome to the land of the free.

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:57,020
20 years to go from print to monument, written in 1883, engraved on a plaque in 1903, a poem

00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:01,810
for the immigrant, by an author and an activist.

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,150
A world-class harbour hack.

00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:14,470
Emma, like me, a New York City girl with Jewish roots, wielding words to change minds, our

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,960
work in cahoots.

00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:23,140
T pause.

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:29,600
This next poem was inspired by a Ted talk by Carole Cadwalladr whose role as a journalist

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:38,860
uncovered the work of Cambridge Analytica in affecting the Brexit vote.

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:52,540
I will quote Zeldman where nothing fails like success, about the dangers of surveillance

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:59,100
as a business model.

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:07,970
The immigrant who puts down roots but never learns the language, that's JavaScript and

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,300
me.

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,720
Sometimes, code is export that changes lives forever.

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,360
Though nothing fails like success to keep us free.

00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:27,500
Gathering wise words from Twitter, I could read, I could Weave sonnets of bravery in

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:34,890
140 characters, gleaned from conferences recorded to retrieve later, to remember the passion

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,150
of others.

00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:45,990
Courage in the form of a Ted talk by Carole Cadwalladr, to Silicon Valley, sheer terror

00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,350
didn't stop her speaking truth to power.

00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,900
Her urgency to save democracy.

00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,840
Will we play with our phones as this darkness falls?

00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:10,870
Fascism rises when democracy palls.

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:17,500
I would not be here today if it weren't for my employer, Mozilla, and I'm Not Really Sure

00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:29,660
That the Web is It is It We Know It Were It Not for Mozilla, So This is a Sonnet for Mozilla.

00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:37,170
You may know Mozilla as the dinosaur that birthed a browser open source out of Netscape's

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,220
ashes.

00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:48,090
Long my Firefox endure as a user-centric client, with a mission worth your love.

00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:57,520
To protect the net as a global, public resource, Mozilla makes browsers, apps, code, and tools

00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,910
open and accessible, safe, and free.

00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:09,670
A force for opportunity with level playing field rules.

00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:17,650
Keeping tabs on browser culture and internet health, explicit in our aspirations, and stated

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:29,030
in our manifesto, in support of civil discourse, collaboration and a wealth of user commitments.

00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:37,010
Ten principles plus addendum show a clever red panda that faints like a fossil.

00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:48,500
Protecting web standards so the Open Web still rocks.

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:56,740
I met Angus at a JS Conference in Brazil in 2015.

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:04,430
His book If Hemingway Wrote JavaScript, and he spoke then about the connections between

00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:09,360
language, literature, and JavaScript.

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:14,180
And I don't think that talk would ever have happened without that book.

00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:21,680
I also quote directly from some of Angus's online writing about code poetry and code,

00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:31,660
and when I do this, I want to indicate that I'm quoting somebody else's words verbatim:

00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:40,620
doctrine and dogma, these are the enemy of good JavaScript, writes Angus Crall, a programmer

00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,810
who codes English expressively.

00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:50,470
If Hemingway wrote JavaScript, for whom would it toll?

00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:55,770
Crall's book praises pushing language boundaries.

00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,050
For earnest, code works tersely and direct.

00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:07,900
His simplicity conceals the quandaries of eloquent reduction.

00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:13,559
Jane Austin's code is circumspect.

00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:22,520
If poetry is grace, if poetry connotes and code commands, the choice of paths reveals

00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,480
a human face.

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,580
An algorithmic style is still in human hands.

00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:41,800
A 24-author pastiche goes beyond the charm of ploy, and led me to write sonnets which

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:48,280
I hope will spark some joy - a-ha.

00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,850
So thank you for indulging my book reviews, and literary references that may be a little

00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,940
unfamiliar.

00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,860
They've given me a way to share some reflections on culture and code.

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:08,480
You may have noticed also, that, in writing, as in JavaScript, we are always borrowing

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,050
and building upon the writing and the work of others.

00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:20,250
Especially the texts or the libraries that have shaped us, and taught us, and particularly

00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,770
he will our fancy.

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:29,290
So there are several slides of reference links and one more book review sonnet called Big

00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:38,510
Data, Big Picture in the appendix, and also on the JSConf EU sonnets page, which is live

00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:45,010
now online if you really want to keep going, I'm going to close with an homage to two programmes

00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:52,500
which is close to my heart, one of Mozilla text speakers, which I co-founded and led

00:20:52,500 --> 00:21:01,160
for a few years, and maybe poised for world domination like JavaScript, and Global Diversity

00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:09,170
CFP Day, a young programme that came about directly through the influence of JSConfs,

00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:13,090
and that's been very present here this weekend.

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:31,340
So then: Mozilla Tech Speakers is a programme designed, like Global Diversity CFP Day, to

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:41,559
make diverse speakers easier to find and share skills, tools, and contacts along the way.

00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:51,850
CFP day grassroots are self- sus - self-sustaining.

00:21:51,850 --> 00:22:03,050
Mozilla's programme offers support and training for web advocates and speakers from a host

00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,050
of places.

00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:15,480
These are living proof of working ecosystem, stand alone programmes launched and thriving,

00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:23,660
feeding global JavaScript momentum, nomadic tribes of advocates arriving.

00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,559
Is it the butterfly effect, or strange attractor?

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:36,320
The influence of JSConfs could well be a factor.

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:44,880
Today, IBA been speaking about the subtle and intelligent things that are exchanged

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,240
when people come together with good intentions and a certain spirit.

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:57,540
I've pushed past my own sheer terror to share what I believe most deeply, that, if you can

00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:04,700
be true to yourself, there are many amazing and outrageously cool things you can do from

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
there.

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:12,470
Like organise a tech event in 60 cities on the same day from an island in the far north,

00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:20,450
or write Tennyson et cetera about JavaScript in 21 days under pressure for a tech conference,

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:26,820
so, thank you so much to everyone who has encouraged me on this journey, and thank you

00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,770
all today so very, very much for your attention.

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:37,870
I'll be putting the slide deck up, and, like I said, there are lots of resource slides,

00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,360
and links, and one more sonnet in there.

00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Have fun.

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,850
If you're into John McCarthy and AI, you should read that one!

00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,030
Thank you all so much!

00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,920
