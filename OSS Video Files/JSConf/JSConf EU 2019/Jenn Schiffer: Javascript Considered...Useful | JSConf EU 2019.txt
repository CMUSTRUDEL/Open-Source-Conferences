Title: Jenn Schiffer: Javascript Considered...Useful | JSConf EU 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-10
Playlist: JSConf EU 2019
Description: 
	Most people connected to the Web are carrying JavaScript in their pocket without even knowing it, and those of us making tools for building with it are either unaware of or blissfully ignoring that population. While JavaScript’s pervasiveness grows, so is the gap in its literacy, and this is a gap we need to solve if we’re ever going to survive self-driving cars on the blockchain. Let’s talk about JavaScript, the tool, as opposed to JavaScript, the Oracle-run Twitter account.

JENN: Hello.

00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,309
Just kidding.

00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:19,689
My friend at Apple taught me that.

00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:21,910
How is everyone doing tonight?

00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,800
[ Applause ] It's like 2:00 in the morning.

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,800
You did it.

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,410
I so, backstage they have like a makeup station and the sound guy is like, oh, do you need

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,410
makeup?

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,929
I think I have enough going on here?

00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:39,649
Do I look good?

00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:42,430
Of course I do.

00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,430
Anyway.

00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:48,170
Along with that and the layout and aggressiveness of this slide, I think that should set the

00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,620
tone for the rest of the talk.

00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:57,289
So, despite what Lori said in his talk this morning, I'm not talking about WebAssembly.

00:00:57,289 --> 00:00:59,620
I think they misread the schedule.

00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,969
That's actually Max's talk which is moved to tomorrow.

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,710
So, please check it out.

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,230
I'm here today to talk about package managers.

00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,850
I'm just kidding.

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:10,979
[ Laughter ] Oh!

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,049
Oh!

00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,259
And before I go on, I know this counts towards a ton of my talk.

00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:16,880
Where is Keith Kurson?

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,119
Is Keith here?

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,619
Oh, here.

00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:23,539
Happy birthday, Keith.

00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:26,110
[ Applause ] Cool.

00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:34,009
Clapping, a round of applause for the organizers, volunteers, speakers, sponsors.

00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,189
Awesome.

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,850
Thank you so much for having me tonight.

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:46,490
Which was supposed to be a talk I called JavaScript considered useful.

00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:51,670
But then I saw that the conference schedule had my talk this late.

00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,539
And so, I switched things up a bit.

00:01:54,539 --> 00:02:00,689
So, thank you for sticking around this late for the first episode and maybe last of my

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,179
new hit show "JavaScript After Dark."

00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:08,340
Night time is a time to reflect on the past day.

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,310
Like, did we feel productive?

00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,160
Did we meet our goals of meeting new people?

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,140
Saying hi to old friends?

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,380
Not drinking too much coffee?

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,200
Who here drank too much coffee?

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,990
Did we learn some new stuff from the talks today?

00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,530
Like how capitalism is bad, right?

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,880
Wow.

00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,640
It's also a time to reflect on those moments we can't ever take back.

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,510
Whose flashbacks keep us up at night.

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,500
Important and impactful meaningful moments like this time a woman asked me in lower Manhattan

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,930
three years ago at that red X there where the Chase bank was.

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,840
And I said I didn't know.

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,140
But it turns out we were literally in front of a Chase bank.

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,210
I think about it every night.

00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:04,850
Tonight, we're going reflect on some just as insomnia inducing past and present moments

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,270
of JS.

00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:11,780
The language, the community and me.

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:19,210
Tonight, I am your tall shadowy figure hovering over you above sleep paralysis.

00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:24,820
Now, we're not going to reflect on the birth of JavaScript 23 years ago.

00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,740
There's a wealth of content online you can read about.

00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,850
How it came to be.

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,120
And it wasn't even the most exciting thing to happen in 1995.

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:42,350
That, of course, goes to Space Hog's debut album, if you're into British glam rock.

00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,090
Oasis released what's the story morning glory.

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:53,340
But that's just as uninteresting to me tonight as the JavaScript origin story.

00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,900
I bet you didn't think that someone from outside the world of package managers would be bringing

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,870
the hottest takes to the JavaScript conference.

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:03,850
But here we are.

00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,480
The only year in the past that we are going to talk about is probably the most impactful

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,910
to all of us tonight and that is ten years ago.

00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,430
That is 2009.

00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,620
I know a lot of math.

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:20,790
So, what were JavaScript, the community and I up to in 2009?

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:24,480
And how we all have collectively grown up since.

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,590
So, let's explore.

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:33,520
In 2009, JavaScript had just about started getting use to the actually being useful.

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,470
Both for normals and nerds.

00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,180
The iPhone had only been out for about two years.

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,150
So, the idea of JavaScript in everyone's pockets was real.

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,720
But it was still in its infancy.

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,240
Not a lot of people knew.

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,600
And it had been about four years since AJAX had come about.

00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,230
And I think stronger than dirt is a pretty good bar to reach for scripting languages.

00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:04,220
In part with AJAX, web 2.0 was evolving from user interactions like shit posting comments,

00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:11,260
to collaboration and real time shit posting comments with Google wave.

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:18,580
They reprogrammed the algorithm that most use today like Glitch.

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,900
So, honestly, haters of Google Wave can eat it.

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,120
GitHub and StackOverflow were about a year old.

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,160
And the most popular JavaScript questions from that year were a reflection of the language's

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,420
youth and complexity.

00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,850
Which nearly matched that of the social construct of time which to this day we still have issues

00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:42,750
with in JavaScript.

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,150
Prototype, jQuery, all a few years old.

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,780
It's about the user interface, baby.

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,310
I'm sorry, I cringe whenever I hear that.

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:58,050
For the client side, there wasn't much besides the cringy taglines and logos.

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,110
Entirely exciting or dramatic going on.

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,660
And to be fair, this is the year before backbone was released.

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,310
So, there was no real framework wars in sight yet.

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,370
It would be another year before Steve Jobs would release his viral YouTube video/open

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,370
letter, thoughts on Flash.

00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:22,000
By the way, Flash ends of life next year.

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,560
So, rich people and blogging males weren't quite yet talking about HTML5 as if it were

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,640
like an actual brand new language literally to solve every problem yet.

00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,720
It was a simpler, softer, more down to Earth time for the document object model and those

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,690
of us fucking around with it.

00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:49,730
But that's not to say that 2009 was without excitement or even conflict and drama.

00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,419
Shouts out to the TC39 panel a little bit earlier.

00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:54,090
It looked a lot different back then.

00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,480
Looked a lot different last year.

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,240
They were having a tough time coming to a resolution to a debate that I will summarize

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,930
as I do most in the community, grownups fighting on blogs instead of saying it to their faces.

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:16,400
Blogs, for the unfamiliar, it was how people put long threads of Tweets into a single page,

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,060
by the way.

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,160
RIP.

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,680
And TC39 for those that missed the panel, it was great panel.

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,620
It's a technical committee to which large companies pay 70K or more dollars to join.

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,190
And what does or doesn't change with JavaScript the language.

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:42,810
It appears that in 2009 the committee of the pulling a weekend at Bernie's with the math

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,250
icon John Von Neumann.

00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:54,300
Fun fact, Neumann invented merge sort, the second best sorting algorithm next to Jortsort.

00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,410
I don't know.

00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,970
Maybe this is what TC39 was fighting about.

00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:05,570
Honestly, it was one of the least interesting things I was reading about in 2009.

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:09,560
But to be fair, there was a lot of competition in being interesting.

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,710
Remember, Google Wave came out that year.

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:21,530
And by the way, it's hard not to see some irony in the year collaboration was disrupted,

00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:28,110
some dudes from large companies had a hard time collaborating with each other.

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,840
Maybe that's the hardest problem in computer science.

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:40,259
But if you stare directly into the sun, you may find it interesting that the resolution

00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:46,699
of this particular conflict was the committee renaming ECMAScript 3.1 to ECMAScript fifth

00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:47,699
edition.

00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:53,160
The version, one point, nine points, is a huge thing back thing.

00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:02,730
It was a few years later that TC39 had another conflict and moved up the version 2009 points.

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,339
Obviously, an homage to the 2009 renaming.

00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:14,559
Numerologists should be all over this shit.

00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:19,480
Most of the news about JavaScript 2009 was not about JavaScript, but about browsers who

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,259
were all allegedly the best.

00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,720
Stallman was mad about open source.

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,139
And, yeah, some things haven't changed.

00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,139
Companies tracking us.

00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:30,449
So, you know, we knew.

00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:31,920
We were warned.

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,220
But the most exciting news you would agree in the JavaScript cannon for developers was

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:47,839
the founding of the modern JavaScript specification and the release of NodeJS a few months later.

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,269
Whoo, yeah.

00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:50,269
Whoo.

00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,920
So, like 2009 was like a growth spurt year.

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,430
Our youthful and complex JavaScript was finally going through puberty.

00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:04,440
You know who wasn't going through puberty?

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,089
Me.

00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:09,610
I was 24 years old in 2009.

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,170
And if you go off my Tweets from that year alone, I was dealing with excruciating wisdom

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,439
tooth pain which I couldn't afford to fix because I was broke as fuck.

00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:24,370
So, I took recreational drugs to curb the pain instead and expressed myself on the Internet

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,290
and doing so.

00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:31,670
I was in Rob Thomas and deleting the Internet before that became cool.

00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,209
And I freaking loved Yahoo!

00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:35,569
Pipes.

00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:36,569
Shouts out.

00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:41,589
What would probably surprise you, I was not writing much JavaScript.

00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:47,440
I was in graduate school working on my master’s in computer science and my last year's courses

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,389
were virtually all mathematics.

00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:56,070
And when not writing pages and pages of pure math, quite beautifully, I must add, I was

00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,869
programming in R. Who here knows R?

00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:06,560
So, for those of you who are unfamiliar with R, it's similar to S. Very self explanatory.

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,459
[ Laughter ] I had a lot of odd jobs back then.

00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:16,040
But my most fulfilling was teaching non technical college students how to use Excel at 7 a.m.

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:24,389
I love this review from them who said the class topics themselves are really boring.

00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:28,470
But it's not like she invented Microsoft Office and forced it upon us.

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,079
I did not invent Microsoft Office, but I did create the curriculum.

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,600
So, yeah.

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,130
7 a.m.

00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,130
Fun times.

00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:39,910
I have no idea what StackOverflow or GitHub were.

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:45,089
And those sites are probably not even actively considering me a part of their target core

00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:46,879
demographic.

00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,769
I was a young white woman studying computer science, stats and linear algebra in a state

00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:53,870
school in New Jersey.

00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:59,310
In 2009 that was like the conventional path to becoming a software engineer if you were

00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:04,990
broke and living on your own and the only person in your family to go to college.

00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't think there were any web developer bootcamps in 2009.

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:17,029
And most higher education engineering programs were using Java and C++ and to this day to

00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:20,890
teach programming at an applicable level.

00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,949
JavaScript was copying and pasting from cool sites and blogs I liked to look at and follow

00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:27,879
using Google Reader.

00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,879
Remember?

00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,670
I do.

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,819
Googlers in here, I remember what you did.

00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:37,629
Also, I want to shouts out to my old D and D crew.

00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:39,029
Brian Brennans here.

00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:44,769
I forgot to take my D and D handbook and my glittery dice out of the shop before I took

00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:47,149
it.

00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:49,970
And the elephant says PHP.

00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:54,549
PHP is JavaScript with question marks.

00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:59,489
[ Laughter ] I did a lot of really shitty part time freelance

00:12:59,489 --> 00:13:01,410
web design and development.

00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,339
Yes, design.

00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:08,850
With a wide range of low or no paying clients and most of that development work was written

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,850
in PHP.

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,879
Which is way prettier than the designs I was expected to come up with.

00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:20,170
So, yeah, my then boyfriend's dad's friend's real estate company who didn't pay me learned.

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:31,819
Joan Osborne, Grammy nominated singer, performer, of what is God is one was us hated what I

00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:32,819
designed.

00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:37,660
And the movie baby geniuses was adapted from.

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,790
He was sick as fuck.

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,629
He hate what had I designed.

00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:49,180
But as my friend said when his kid vomited on him, tough, but fair.

00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,360
I didn't Tweet about JavaScript until 2010.

00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Far from helpful.

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,600
I shan't be purchasing this services from you.

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:07,240
To me, programming community let alone JavaScript community didn't really exist.

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,850
Programming in general didn't exist outside of the classroom and maybe in a couple of

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,100
channels.

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:20,269
And this one mailing list I participated in about my favorite operating system, open Solaris.

00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,060
Pour one out for that.

00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:30,240
While TC39 was arguing about whatever they were arguing about in 2009, Oracle was buying

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,690
Sun microsystems.

00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,399
With that was the end of the Open Solaris project.

00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,999
I was heartbroken and still pissed at Oracle.

00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:45,290
You know what else died in 2009?

00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,589
GeoCities.

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:47,889
Yeah.

00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:50,690
So, this may seem hella dramatic.

00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:56,860
But I was basically watching everything important to me about open source and building the web

00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,269
being destroyed in a very tiny bubble that was very far and very different from the bubble

00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:07,839
that I am in today which is the JavaScript community.

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,179
The JavaScript community, what many of us call the communities, what we see here tonight.

00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:18,489
Young, we think of JSConf, the family conferences and EU.

00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:25,009
And this conference started in 2009 in response to or after the inaugural JSConf US earlier

00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:26,989
this year.

00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:28,709
You may recognize the organizers.

00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:31,139
Little baby Jan.

00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:36,279
I like that Jan grew his beard over the past ten years so he can dye it pink just for us

00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:37,329
tonight.

00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:44,309
In the pink there, I can't believe you spoke at your own conference.

00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:48,429
That's like wearing a Green Day shirt to a Green Day concert.

00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:50,339
It's bad ass.

00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:53,949
And notice I'm not making fun of AMP in this talking.

00:15:53,949 --> 00:16:02,160
So, while to me there was no community, it definitely did exist somewhere.

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,629
And allegedly it was rock and roll.

00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:08,819
And remember, I love rock and roll.

00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:12,459
So, why didn't anyone tell me about this?

00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:17,149
I mean, if you look at this image and you look at the earlier couple of years' images

00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:23,899
and that like intro, you'll probably realize that I wasn't part of the core target demographic

00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:28,829
of not only many of the tools that came out in 2009, but these events.

00:16:28,829 --> 00:16:30,209
And that's not meant to be shade.

00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:31,209
That's reality.

00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:36,649
In 2009 it was very hard to see someone like me in the audience of an event like this.

00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:41,290
Let alone on stage visible and admired by the tech community.

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,819
Also, these conferences were in they're expensive as hell.

00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:50,100
And I don't know about the rest of you all who at least like went to college.

00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,720
But the predatory textbook industry ate up whatever so called disposable income I had.

00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,059
Plus, I needed to buy weed because my wisdom teeth were hurting.

00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:03,980
Just kidding, I've never done a crime.

00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,870
But today, 2009 plus ten equals 2019.

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,410
I can better support myself and others.

00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,220
And not only am I actively part of the JavaScript community.

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,640
I'm literally right here on stage at the tenth JSConf.

00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,070
Or at least the tenth year that they've had it.

00:17:21,070 --> 00:17:24,389
Soc, congrats to the organizers and everyone for such a long run.

00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:25,389
Let's give everyone a another round of applause.

00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:36,020
[ Applause ] What a wild ride this past ten years have

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,200
been.

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,610
For one, I don't have wisdom teeth anymore.

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,000
So, that's great news.

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,860
In less great news, I also don't have Google reader, Google wave or Yahoo! pipes.

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,730
Ten years I was mad at Oracle.

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,049
Today the feeling is mutual.

00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:57,580
This is a Tweet by an Oracle employee after this conference announced my speaking.

00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,720
Please don't find this person and I give him shit.

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,410
He is correct, JSConf EU is better than this.

00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:09,460
Using this to represent me.

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,490
This conference will be hearing from my lawyers.

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:18,039
And by the way, it needs to be said that me making fun of Oracle owning the JavaScript

00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:20,080
trademark is not punching down.

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,700
Because unlike Larry Ellison, I don't own a fucking island with a volcano on it.

00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,030
He's going to be just fine.

00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,429
JavaScript the fame, though.

00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:33,750
Maybe it's not time to worry about that.

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,660
Capitalism is bad.

00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:45,870
So, yea, not only do I write a lot of JavaScript, I'm an exec at one of the most exciting in

00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,990
the JavaScript ecosystem.

00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,990
Yeah, Glitch.com.

00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,309
Yeah, shouts out.

00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:56,951
I get to lead and work with some of the best engineers, designers and business people in

00:18:56,951 --> 00:19:01,360
the world and we're all working together to make it so that everyone who uses the web

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,110
can create the web.

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,019
It's been wild to start to see that happen.

00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:11,539
And not only is it happening, but people are building apps on Glitch that I couldn't imagine

00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:18,190
would be possible within the confines of the browser and this beloved portable dynamic

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,490
language we use.

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:22,450
Like, I'm not even saying hard to see like ten years ago.

00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:30,100
Like, I couldn't imagine this stuff, or double stuff, five years ago.

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,070
Things like virtual reality and motion detection in the browser.

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:42,100
We have a cool web VR starter kit and we have been working with Mozilla on making cool demos.

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,350
And like, in the browser.

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,850
Like, who'd have thank you?

00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:51,750
Machine learning and music, shoutout to really cool stuff with JS.

00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:59,769
And people asking about the questions about the new metal group Evanescence, the answer

00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:03,540
is going under is their best song.

00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:10,120
And people on the note extending services and even content management services like

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,240
WordPress with their Gutenberg editor.

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,230
So, it's sick.

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:19,279
Game Devs are not only making games on Glitch, but they're building them in a way so those

00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,370
that don't typically design and build games can do so with their own levels.

00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:26,190
And that is also super sick.

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:34,950
And speaking of games, that quiz game that you have been playing is a Glitch app.

00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:40,620
But also like under the hood, we have a powerful as hell collaborative editor written in JavaScript

00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:46,929
that runs in the browse their lets everyone write JavaScript and other languages collaboratively.

00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:49,870
And even view server-side JavaScript in the browser.

00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:58,639
So, like the scale of access to writing JavaScript in 2019 among all the editors is matched only

00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:02,130
by the access to learning it this year.

00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,130
You know?

00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:06,730
There are bootcamps now and there's online learning and they're expanding the options

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,779
and opportunities for people to enter the community and industry.

00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:15,539
Even the books about JavaScript today show not only is the community growing in number

00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:20,090
of developers and technologies, but the backgrounds of those using JavaScript is changing.

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:25,490
I want to give a shoutout to Daniel of Coding Train, awesome series.

00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:29,770
Nick Morgan, writing with JavaScript for kids book.

00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:34,799
And all the like awesome great initiatives like Black Girls Code.

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:40,330
Giving like people getting people of all ages and backgrounds into our community so that

00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,450
we all collectively cannot only build the web together.

00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,860
But build like an ethical web that solves the problems that we all actually have and

00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,340
solves everyone's problems.

00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,799
Not just a core group.

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,140
People aren't just asking, you know, anymore how to use JavaScript to redirect a page or

00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,220
figure out the name of the month.

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:05,120
They're asking JavaScript they're asking how to JavaScript to tell a story with data around

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,779
gun violence and political activism And we're learning and teaching literature

00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:13,070
and art using the language.

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:19,590
So, shouts out to re Publica, color of change, awesome organization.

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:25,419
My large son, Angus Cole for writing with JavaScript.

00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:27,480
And the institute, my own project.

00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:36,330
It's like the side project or indefinite hiatus and fronted.

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:40,389
And not only does JavaScript the language look different, the people writing and talking

00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:42,309
about JavaScript do too.

00:22:42,309 --> 00:22:45,650
Shouts out to all of my fellow speakers that the event.

00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,759
Round of applause for them.

00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:53,240
And the MCs.

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,200
[ Applause ] And don't you dare let anyone tell you that

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,710
the diversity and who is writing all this code and the brilliance of what is being made

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,490
with it are a coincidence.

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,490
It's not.

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:14,540
And we have a lot more work to do to make it actually diverse and inclusive and we can

00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,149
only imagine how awesome and how brilliant the things coming out of this language will

00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:25,159
be when we are at the point and beyond that we could say that.

00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:27,380
Anyway, 2009 was a wild year.

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,400
But 2019 is fucking lit.

00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:37,450
Which makes it incredibly hard to imagine what could be in store for us in 2029?

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,450
But I flew all the way out here so let's give it a go.

00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:47,340
These are my hopes and dreams for 2029.

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,360
The first: You might have noticed my avatar on the website.

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,909
I gave them one that had my face and the skeleton zoomed in.

00:23:55,909 --> 00:24:00,120
I was told that the reason my conference head shot is zoomed in on the skeleton is because

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,230
of AI.

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,909
Which means we're all going to die.

00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:10,371
But honestly, in 2029, a significant amount if not majority of code will be written by

00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:11,371
machines.

00:24:11,371 --> 00:24:15,000
That shouldn't be surprising with all the talk about artificial intelligence in this

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,320
industry.

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,799
This has been planned for decades.

00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:23,379
If you read early text that's on artificial intelligence, like the people who created

00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:28,509
that idea did it so like machines would write our code for us.

00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:30,679
Like, work for ourselves.

00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,590
Like, machines can do it.

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:38,230
And we've already boilerplated and automated a lot via command line interfaces.

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,820
Which is rad.

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:46,190
But we're going to need some nice slick graphical user interfaces to bring that development

00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,220
to the masses.

00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,760
Much like some of our favorite operating systems did for computing in general.

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,100
So, that's a cycle we're entering into now.

00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:59,399
And because we need GUIs, there's a lot of abstraction and design challenges that come

00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,399
with it.

00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:04,210
So, that means that those specializations we saw starting to disappear over the past

00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:10,139
ten years like content and style, separate concerns from interaction, I think that those

00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:13,169
things are going to become more discrete again.

00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:20,509
And with that, like the role of frontend and backend will become rarely used unironically

00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:23,960
as much as the phrase close to the middle is.

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,120
I think we're gonna see a lot more specialization in our community.

00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,820
And front and back will be replaced with UI, ML, AI, IoT. hope they come up with another

00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,820
phrase than IoT.

00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,350
I don't like that.

00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,269
Too many letters.

00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:41,269
VR.

00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:47,150
I would say hobbyists or maker, but I think that's also kind of like the maker movement

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:52,570
is still quite misogynist because women have been doing crafts and yarn and that shit for

00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,620
years.

00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,179
Hopefully there's a better word that doesn't bring the patriarchal theme in.

00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:08,679
Way specialized and there are going to be generalists to mentor, coach and educate new

00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,020
and seasoned specialists.

00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:15,769
So, I think like the thing that we need to worry about, and I'm seeing it already in

00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:22,910
our community, is the gap in value and pay of educators in the industry.

00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,330
Yeah.

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,850
[ Applause ] shouts out to my teachers.

00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:32,680
And not like the engineers who teach on the side because it's extra money and they don't

00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,559
really care about the people that they're teaching.

00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,950
No.

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,350
Anyway.

00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,350
I can't go on these tangents.

00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:42,340
I'm going to get people mad.

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,360
That gap, by the way, I think should be can be filled with all the money Microsoft is

00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,720
spending on trying to figure out who horse JS is.

00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,559
Just saying.

00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:58,509
Ryan Dahl will be doing a mistakes I made making Dino tour.

00:26:58,509 --> 00:27:02,860
Ryan, if you watch this video, you're a treasure.

00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,259
Please don't hate me.

00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:05,809
But I'm right.

00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:10,169
Microsoft is going to shut down GitHub and VS code in their master plan to get us back

00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:16,270
to using Microsoft Word to build HTML pages like nature intended.

00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:22,250
And because Word doesn't allow JavaScript, all y'all who are like JavaScript is considered

00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,919
harmful folks will finally be happy.

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,389
But then you'll realize your brand has become obsolete.

00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:31,230
So, sorry about that.

00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:37,279
Make E CMA will update their website design.

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,360
Also, you see all the trademarks down there?

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,590
That's an update.

00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,390
If any of y'all are here still.

00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:49,830
I want to propose some hot new trendy dark modes.

00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:57,270
Or an old classic, hot dog stand.

00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:03,049
Even better, maybe in 2029 we'll have designed and implemented a more diverse and inclusive

00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:08,749
way to evolve the language than leaving it up to only large English speaking corporations

00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:13,289
who can afford not only a seat at the table, but the flight and hotel to wherever that

00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:18,360
table keeps moving around to.

00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:25,840
Now, given the number of people in this room and my background in statistics and getting

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,890
yelled at on the Internet.

00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:33,440
I will say it's highly probable that some of you are thinking, Jenn, why are you complaining

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,659
about diversity when you said this event is more diverse than it was ten years ago?

00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:45,100
And yes, Uncle Bob, from my extreme white woman perspective, we're doing a bit better

00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,860
this decade when it comes to D&I.

00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:53,940
But I predict and hope that by continuing and evolving this work, in ten years the need

00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,200
for diversity scholarships will have dwindled or have been made obsolete by the fact that

00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,059
companies will value all of their employees enough to sponsor their being a part of these

00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:04,059
events.

00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:08,940
Or at the very least, people will not complain on Twitter about people of color having their

00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:11,999
own space at these events.

00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:19,019
[ Applause ] Just a reminder.

00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:25,860
We are living in a misogynist and white supremacist society.

00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,950
And that plays into a lot of the stuff happening over the next ten years in AI.

00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,029
I don't want to slip that under the rug.

00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:37,080
These are hopes and dreams and I'm hoping that more people are involved, and more diverse

00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,220
people are involved so we can undo the damage and prevent that.

00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,020
That's an aside off script.

00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,700
I can talk for hours about that.

00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:55,230
But I think another thing is that all of us community organizers will have hopefully evolved

00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:57,299
the conference experience so that yeah!

00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:58,600
Fuck yeah!

00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,179
Are they playing Foosball?

00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:05,039
Are they getting excited about Foosball?

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,240
Shaking my head.

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,120
Anyway, yeah!

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,970
I think that we will make it so that all people can still know the community exists and feel

00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:21,179
like they're a part of it even if they're like I was in 2009.

00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:26,049
Which was too broke to travel and/or too lost to know what I was supposed to be looking

00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:27,049
for.

00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:30,901
And I predict that a lot of people writing code in ten years, if not the majority of

00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:34,679
people writing code in ten years, will not be developers but trade.

00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,230
So, we need to welcome them to this experience as well.

00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:47,320
As well as TC39 whatever hopefully non corporate professional group is running the show.

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,649
And it's been said that this will be the last JSConf EU which in the wake of my Microsoft

00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:54,559
Word prediction, I'm not surprised.

00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:00,080
Much like every conference, though I think they'll skip a year or two and keep going

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,549
for years to come.

00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:05,580
I'm thinking this might be my last JavaScript talk.

00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,270
I said that a few years ago and came back.

00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,309
Jay Z said he wasn't making music anymore and then he came back.

00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:14,150
I don't know.

00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,929
I just think that something like this is too magical and beautiful.

00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:20,950
And to give up this ability to bring different people together to learn and grow with each

00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,950
other.

00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:27,149
It won't run quite the same, this conference, though, and it shouldn't, because what the

00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:30,340
language and community look like is rapidly changing.

00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:36,210
So, you know, those of you here running companies and popular projects in the ecosystem, I want

00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,320
you to take note of that dynamic changing.

00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:46,159
I think it's becoming hella evident today and not that not only are more companies in

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,899
our ecosystem going to have to live by the value that all people matter more than the

00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:51,899
tech we're building.

00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:56,529
But the survival of their business will depend on their being accountable and honest to those

00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:57,950
values.

00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,950
You know?

00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,049
They're staffed by and used by the community.

00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:08,659
And so, those of us running companies in that space need to like walk the walk sprint, even

00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:10,529
more than talking the talk.

00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:11,529
Yeah.

00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:17,110
I mean, as an aside, I was just thinking a lot about CJ's talk.

00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:22,080
It's been really hard to witness what's been going on at npm.

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,080
Because like at Glitch we talk about like we're trying to get everyone to be able to

00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,419
build the we can, and our product is very focused on people.

00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:34,720
And it just sucks when like someone in the ecosystem just like fucks up something and

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,950
it sets the rest of us who are trying to do good work back.

00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:38,950
And that's fine.

00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,590
We were ready to do the work.

00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,590
We're here for the fight.

00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,909
Like, we're gonna do it.

00:32:42,909 --> 00:32:43,909
And we're gonna win.

00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:45,929
We're counting on it.

00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:54,710
But I'm just hoping that you all still you all question companies and ask questions and

00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,499
keep us honest and hold us accountable.

00:32:57,499 --> 00:33:01,270
Because some of us like want to do you right.

00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,270
We're trying.

00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,520
We're trying really hard.

00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,840
And while tech is already political, in 2029 I predict there will be significantly fewer

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,549
cowards pretending it's not.

00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:25,019
[ Applause ] As for me, I don't know where I see myself

00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:27,970
in ten minutes, let alone ten years.

00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:29,880
Besides, of course, hotter and smarter.

00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,290
Let's be honest.

00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,450
Thank you.

00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:38,559
Where I see myself in the future has always been my hardest problem in computer science.

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,419
Like, I know where I'm at now and that's like living a life and in a world that I never

00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:45,330
could have imagined ten years ago.

00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,429
Let alone two years ago.

00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:51,429
Three months before I joined Glitch, I was exploring how to quit tech because I fell

00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:57,340
really ill and I just couldn't manage going to work every day miserable and also physically

00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,340
being miserable.

00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,299
One of those had to give, that was tech.

00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:04,409
And fortunately, an opportunity came around and I ended up at Glitch.

00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,610
And I felt great.

00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:12,330
But I could never see that path happening and it's very scary when you enter a space.

00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,410
Even someone in the game as long as me and not knowing what's ahead of you.

00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,429
Not having any visibility.

00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:26,920
It took a lot of hitting road blocks, earning degrees and dodging obstacles, getting yelled

00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:33,290
at on the Internet on the regular and a fuck ton of work to get where I am today.

00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:38,270
It was not a direct path, becoming a woman in leadership.

00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:42,750
And I'm not confident that such a path is available for anyone else.

00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,170
Let myself to continue.

00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,600
You know?

00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,460
Something might happen and in three months or six months I might be like you know what?

00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,460
Something's got to give.

00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,900
I got to go back to teaching Excel at 6 a.m. or 7 a.m.

00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,650
Whatever the fuck it was.

00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,060
I'm not a morning person anymore.

00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,690
I don't want that to happen.

00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:05,630
But I predict or at least hope that with like the work we're all doing, like all of us in

00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:11,540
this room and helping everyone on the web create the web that our community in 2029

00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,860
will be more visible and accessible.

00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:18,240
As well as the definition of success for individuals.

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,600
More and different people will not only get a say in how our language evolves, but they'll

00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,530
get time on stage.

00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:31,050
The safety that comes with being valued and fairly paid.

00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:34,920
I think that or hope that they'll be able to see themselves continuing on that path

00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,350
and reaching their ideal destination.

00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:42,320
That they're not just sort of walking blindly like I feel I am myself today.

00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,660
And I think with that, they'll hopefully be a little more confident in coaching other

00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:52,400
generations and types of coders to reach their ideal destinations as well.

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:59,860
And I think a lot of prominent visible marginalized people in this industry have many stories

00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,860
like this to tell.

00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:04,660
But, you know, one day a woman came up to me and was like, I really look up to you.

00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,260
I follow you on Twitter.

00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,240
I'm like, sorry.

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,830
And she's like, I want to, like, be you in two years.

00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:17,300
And I'm like, girl, I couldn't be me in two years.

00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,370
And I can't tell you how to be me in ten years.

00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,500
That's what I'm hoping will change.

00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:28,020
I hope that path will include building like awesome apps that solve everyone's problems.

00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:32,541
I hope it includes leading a team of the Greatest engineers in the world and, you know, even

00:36:32,541 --> 00:36:36,670
flying thousands of miles to shit post Larry Ellison.

00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:41,250
A volcano on the island.

00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:45,800
Look it up.

00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,280
If I play my cards right, and y'all let me play them, I think that I'll be doing all

00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,150
of those things still.

00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,100
Maybe not flying miles to shit post Larry Ellison.

00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,990
That's like a one and done thing.

00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:04,690
I think that maybe I'll be helping some Glitch employee work on their dot doc XEU talk where

00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:09,750
they showcase all the amazing apps that our rad community made that year.

00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:19,090
And we asked the community about 2029, it was facilitating farming, supplying energy,

00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:24,700
quantum computing, challenging the social construct time.

00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,460
The news in a social media dystopia.

00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:33,340
And maybe even just simply making websites.

00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:39,020
I know that my hair will probably be all gray which will look sick as hell.

00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,350
I hope any wisdom teeth don't grow back.

00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,690
I don't know, climate change.

00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:44,120
Like you never know what's gonna happen.

00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,240
Anti vaxxers.

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:55,870
But I'm pretty confident that every night I'll be lying wide awake, just like for years,

00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:58,850
reflecting on the moment where I told the woman in front of the bank that I did not

00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:02,930
know where the Chase bank was.

00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,200
Maybe the sun will burn out.

00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,360
Thank you.

00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:09,320
Thank you for sticking around for JavaScript after dark.

00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:15,650
I'm Jenn, smash those links, please subscribe.

00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,030
And I'll see you on Glitch.com.

00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:21,640
Thank you.

00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,940
