Title: Recreating Retro Computer Art with JS! by Sher Minn Chong | JSConf EU 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-20
Playlist: JSConf EU 2019
Description: 
	Before personal computing became a thing, there was a handful of programmers and artists saw computers as a tool beyond their intended purpose: to create art.

In this talk, we will explore the early history of computer art, from ghostly oscilloscope paints to pre-ASCII text art. We’ll discuss how simple techniques with limited technology back then could yield compelling pieces. We’ll see how the history of computer displays and printers have evolved in the 1950s to 1980s.

While quite a bit of retro art survives today, most of them do not come preserved with their algorithms. In this talk, I’ll also demo some attempts to recreate retro art pieces using p5.js, a JavaScript graphics library as well as talk through some of the techniques of creating generative computer art.

Welcome to my talk, recreating retro computer Art with JavaScript.

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,780
And my name is Sher Minn.

00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,980
It's a little bit of an unusual name.

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,930
Downside is online forums don't like it when you have a space in your name.

00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,530
I'll be here working on clientside validation, keep that in mind.

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,470
On the bright side, my SEO is really great.

00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,320
If you look up my name, it's the first result and I didn't have to do anything.

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,400
So, life is good.

00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,880
I am from a small country in southeast Asia called Malaysia.

00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,620
And yeah.

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,239
We have actually another Malaysian in the house here that was on the stage at CSSconf.

00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,930
Proud to represent my country.

00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:05,350
And I live in New York right now where I initially moved to attend something called the recurse

00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,350
Center.

00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,670
RC in the house.

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:17,230
For those who don't know what the recurse Center, it's based in New York City for programmers.

00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:23,900
6, 8 or 12 weeks and you can rediscover can the joy in programming.

00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,200
If you want to take time to learn something you have been meaning to learn, this is a

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,130
great place to do it.

00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,850
And I plug it because this is the reason why I'm giving this talk here today.

00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:40,430
Everything they have provided me has enabled me to pursue creative programming.

00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,220
Creative programming.

00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,060
I like art a lot.

00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,509
I learned thousand draw before I learned how to code.

00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,520
Here are some of the pieces of work that I've made in the past year.

00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,970
And I really enjoy using programming to create code.

00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,020
And most recently I have been really inspired by retro computer art.

00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:06,979
So, what happened was that I discovered this magazine from 1976 to 1978.

00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:12,639
And it was edited by a computer artist, Gracie Hertlein based in California in the United

00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,639
States.

00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,120
This was the first ever computer magazine entirely dedicated to computer graphics and

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
art.

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,260
You can see the title, inexpensive graphics in the storage category, really dates it.

00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,200
And I got these images from a website called the recode project.com.

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,930
The site is no longer up.

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,659
But it was a great resource to look through what was cutting edge graphics back then.

00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:42,340
And as you can see, it's mostly black and white, textbased, lines, geometric shapes.

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,709
Today we would call it minimalist or Lofi as an esthetic.

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:54,599
It was fun to look at and think about because most of the times the work published is just

00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,260
the artwork itself.

00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,400
There wasn't a lot of algorithms.

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,739
Most of the time there would be some description of the technology used and maybe some of the

00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:04,559
techniques, but no actual algorithms.

00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:09,879
So, the whole purpose of the website that posted this magazine, the archive for this

00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:13,540
magazine were like, can we try to reverse engineer it.

00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:18,529
Can we look at a piece and figure out how it was made?

00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:22,629
And so, this exactly what I sort of fell into.

00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:29,069
And so, this entire talk will be about the research that I did and also some of the attempts

00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:31,959
at recreating these works.

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:33,459
Let's first talk about computer art.

00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:34,529
What is computer art?

00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:38,089
A lot of us have an idea what have computer art is.

00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:39,379
It's probably right.

00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:51,129
In my definition, computer art is the art that computers play a part in the creation

00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:53,200
of the artwork.

00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:02,159
That's using Photoshop or Illustrator or 3D graphics, AR, VR, the latest hottest thing,

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,900
deep learning art, AI art.

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,339
But we're not talking about that today.

00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:11,709
We're going it be talking about the really, really early years of computer graphics.

00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:18,169
This is when computer graphics became accessible and it will be about how people took those

00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:21,009
technologies and used it to make art.

00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:25,370
So, the decade I'm focusing on is the 1950s it 1970s.

00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,560
This was really the crucial part where computer art was just becoming a thing.

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,580
So, everything's in black and white.

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:39,090
So, to talk about retro computer art, we first need to talk about what computers were like

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,820
back then.

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,979
The reason being that context really matter when is you're talking about history.

00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:49,490
And if you understand the tools and the techniques that are available to people at the time,

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,520
you can understand why certain pieces had a certain esthetic or, you know, why was it

00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,520
done that way.

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,470
It helps you appreciate a lot of the work a little bit better.

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,699
Here is a computer that was introduced in 1959.

00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,080
This is the IBM7099 data processing system.

00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,030
Not just a computer, a data processing system.

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,050
Really fancy.

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,289
It would take up the entire room.

00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:17,150
You can see the magnetic tape readers at the back, console and punch card readers.

00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,360
And it was introduced at a really cool price of $3 million.

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,370
Back then.

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,729
If you converted it to currency today counting for inflation it would be something like $19

00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:33,639
million US which is really, really expensive.

00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:36,860
What this meant was that computer were really difficult to come by.

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:43,449
The people who could afford it were in universities, research labs, the military, government agencies.

00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:46,389
They are very scarce as a resource.

00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:51,680
Can you imagine calling IBM up and saying I would like to buy a computer for $19 million.

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,620
I'll write you a check, you know?

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:59,770
And most of the time people wouldn't interface with the computer.

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:05,960
They would write programs for it using a punch card writing like a typewriter.

00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,599
And you punch the code and punch it into a punch card.

00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:15,250
Take the stack of punch cards and hand it to a little old man behind the door and you

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,350
would get the results back five minutes later.

00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,930
If you get impatient waiting for Webpack to building with think of this.

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,310
It takes a lot of time.

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,580
And there were many uses for scientific and mathematical applications mostly by scientists

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,400
or mathematicians in research labs or, you know, universities.

00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:42,240
So, I want to show you some examples of companies that really converted to the field of computer

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
graphics.

00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,199
The first coined the term computer graphics and they were one of the first few people

00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,490
to use computer graphics in design work.

00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:58,090
They used it to design cockpits to animate the different reaches of the limbs for the

00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:59,270
pilot in the cockpit.

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,270
Simulations.

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:06,150
Here was the first airport that was made using computer graphics, the Seattle Tacoma Airport

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,740
in the United States.

00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:18,909
And Bell Labs in the US, they made one of the first ever computergenerated films.

00:07:18,909 --> 00:07:24,610
First what that might look like and then I'm going to show it to you.

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:32,090
Here it is, it is a simulation of a control system from 1963.

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,789
And it's supercute.

00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:38,099
It's a satellite revolving around a planet.

00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:44,280
The early graphics were mostly designed to model or maybe just, you know, demonstrate

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
some diagrams.

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,529
And so, like this really simple graph of straight lines, geometric shapes, black and white,

00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:52,210
that was sufficient for their purposes.

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,759
This is wonderful.

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,169
No fancy colors or gradients or anything like that.

00:07:58,169 --> 00:07:59,759
And yet, you know, art happened anyway.

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,620
People look the limited technology they had and did something really wonderful with it.

00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,680
So, I'm going to talk about three different types of art.

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,669
I just chose examples from each category.

00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:17,629
And I'll show you some oscilloscope art, some graphics and some textbased art and my attempts

00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:18,699
at recreating them.

00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:21,180
Let's start with oscilloscope art.

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,439
So, cathode ray oscilloscopes.

00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,009
If you have been in a lab or school, played with one.

00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:33,360
And this is what an oscilloscope is, or this is what it looked like in the 1950s.

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,071
It is a device that takes electrical signals and converts them into a visual over here.

00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:44,610
So, here we have an example of a sine wave on an oscilloscope.

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,630
This is like a little bit before, you know, the IBM7090.

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:55,990
And here on the left is a picture of Ben Laposky, credited to be one of the first few people

00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,960
who created electronic graphics.

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,550
And so, what I mean by that is he would plot interesting patterns on so the oscilloscope

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:10,140
and he would then photograph them and here is some of his works.

00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,710
And what's really interesting about them is they look really ghostly.

00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,870
Really kind of organic a way.

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,230
But you can sort of tell they had this sort of mathematical quality to it.

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,199
A few more.

00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:27,339
Around the same time actually in Europe also there was a movement getting started in computer

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:28,339
art.

00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:33,260
Herbert W. Franke, we created his own electronic artwork using oscilloscopes.

00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,020
Here is some of his work.

00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,610
So, the interesting thing to note about this, oscilloscopes don't have a screenshot button.

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,269
You don't press screenshot, and this is going to come out.

00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:48,920
So, in order to capture these images, what they would do is set the camera in front of

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,980
the screen and leave it on long exposure.

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,730
It captures the movement of lines and graphics on the screen.

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,180
What you're seeing here is not just a single snapshot.

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,790
It is a combination of events on a screen over time.

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,190
And so, here actually is an example of the same like event, but two different phases

00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,370
of it.

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,279
And I think it looks really beautiful like a ghostly jelly fish.

00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:20,209
And more works by him.

00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:28,480
And how to do this, draw sine waves on an oscilloscope.

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,519
But how to get from that to that?

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:41,500
There was a little bit of an explanation in recreational math mat irks and he used the

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:47,980
sine waves and others in combination.

00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:52,750
Applying operations to create composite waves that had really interesting patterns.

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,920
Here is an example of the work that makes is really obvious that there is a bit of a

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,360
sine wave thing going on.

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,410
And I was like, how okay.

00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,170
I get it.

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,630
But how well, how are these really made?

00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,070
I attempted to create it.

00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:17,230
I'm going to show you a demo here of creation of Lapsoky's Oscillons.

00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:25,750
And I'm going to use P5JS, which is a graphics drawing library based on processing.

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,259
The processing language was designed to make drawing with code accessible for nonprogrammers.

00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:35,770
It's super great if you're interested in trying out graphical things, I highly recommend checking

00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,770
it out.

00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:41,399
It's great reference and documentation, and it's an online editor.

00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,389
Really easy to use so a good place to start.

00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:47,380
Jump to demo.

00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:55,230
In P5, off global draw function that will get called to draw a frame of your animation

00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,030
or visual.

00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,600
And so, in this I'm just doing something really simple.

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,319
Just setting the center of the canvas as zerozero and drawing a tiny circle here at zerozero

00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:10,360
with the width and height of 10 pixels.

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,960
And that's not superinteresting.

00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,980
What's more interesting is that you can animate things.

00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,170
So, here I'm adding a little counter.

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,709
And incrementing it at every frame that's being drawn.

00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:33,300
And using that value to position the coordinate of the little circle.

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:42,590
I can draw a circle, and the formula is R sine theta, what X equals, and R is R cost

00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,500
data, and R is the circle.

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,392
Drawing circles in circles.

00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:51,019
Circles are cool, but not superinteresting.

00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:56,660
What's more interesting is you can mess around with theta and multiply it by two different

00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:00,860
fragments, and you get a pretzel.

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,040
This is an example of a figure.

00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,459
It's when your sign and cause functions are at different phases.

00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:11,459
It creates interesting loopy effects.

00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:12,660
All right.

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:19,389
So, what I can do now is I can have the pretzel and then draw an additional point.

00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:21,040
Pretzel is one point.

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,040
And draw the ellipse over here.

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,320
And I can draw a line between those two points, and you get kind of that, but not quite still

00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,949
because this overlaps.

00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:33,639
And it keeps on getting brighter and brighter.

00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,230
So, what you can do is that whoops.

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,930
You can fade out the lines as they're being drawn.

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,389
And this, I imagine, would be what that might look like on the oscilloscope screen.

00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:48,430
A close approximation of it.

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,350
So, I have actually the code here in P5 demo.

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,050
I will send out a link to the slides on my Twitter after this so you can play with it

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,709
and you can sort of mess around with some of the values and run it and see how that

00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:03,600
changes the movements or the effects.

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,120
It's kind of interesting because you never know what you're gonna get.

00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,480
You just punch in stuff, that looks good.

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Or not.

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,069
And you just have to figure out what you're looking for.

00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:14,520
You can also add color here.

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,730
Instead of straight lines, I drew curves, same idea.

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:25,420
And, yeah, so, that's it for oscilloscope art.

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,600
Next, vector graphics.

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,300
Vector graphics has a special place in my heart.

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,250
I really enjoy working with it.

00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:37,759
To understand why vector graphics are really important and they're mostly lines and geometric

00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:45,350
shapes, we need to understand the output available in the computers.

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:47,319
This was before laser printers.

00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:52,250
You couldn't print a highdefinition image really easily like we do now.

00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,810
In order to create really detailed images, people would use mechanical plotters.

00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,040
Think of it as a drawing robot.

00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:07,449
It has a pen and can move on the Y or X axis across the surface of the paper and draw on

00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,449
it.

00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,449
This is a drum printer.

00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:14,540
It moves the Y which is paper and the X which is the pen.

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,800
And so, the limitation with plotters is that all you have is literally a robot arm that

00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,060
draws lines.

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,949
And so, you had to describe your graphics in terms of vectors.

00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:26,820
So, you had to provide coordinates in which to move around.

00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,670
Can't do colors or gradients or fancy things.

00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:36,730
So, a lot of the esthetic back then had to do with lines, especially close together to

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,480
have the effects.

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,459
Here is one I saw a lot of.

00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:50,199
The basic idea is you take a geometric shape and nest it and get the cool, swirly effect.

00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,199
Okay.

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,199
Interesting.

00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:56,100
Like it's just nested squares, whatever.

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,829
And in fact, it was so popular that it was the esthetic for cybernetic serendipity which

00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:08,529
is the first ever computer exhibition that focused on computer art and held in the institute

00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:10,980
of contemporary arts in London.

00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,620
It was a really big deal at the time.

00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,019
And the fact that they chose this for the graphics, I guess it must be really popular.

00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,180
Inspires some imagination.

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:26,879
A little side note about Cybernetics Serendipity, it was by a Polish woman, Jasia Reichardt,

00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:33,601
and she brought together the artists and showcased them.

00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:40,290
And it's the name is a reference to the happy chance discoveries that you make with the

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,079
computer.

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,750
Sometimes it's random and you don't know what's going come out and sometimes it's really beautiful.

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:51,839
I saw this motif used over and over again in interesting ways.

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,470
I was like whatever, I don't know.

00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:59,690
But later I found out this was actually a visualization to a calculus problem.

00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:04,930
That makes sense, the early artists were people with access to computers, scientists and mathematicians.

00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:12,720
The problem is like this, imagine four flies sitting on a card table and they start walking

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,880
at the same rate.

00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,530
Each going towards the fly on the right.

00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,840
The math in calculus is to find the path of each.

00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,080
If I'm trying to solve it, cool.

00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,310
I don't think about it.

00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,280
It's not very interesting.

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:36,160
But if you visualize it over here with each color representing the path of a certain fly,

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,930
it actually looks you get that swirly effect.

00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:45,970
And it gets really pretty when you draw lines between each of the different flies here.

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,870
And I also added pretty gradients.

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,630
Here is some video just in case the demo didn't work.

00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,300
You know, got to be prepared.

00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,130
And I found out that you could do this not just with four, but with three flies or five

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,130
or six.

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,820
And because of I have a computer that runs really fast and I can cue up for it, I can

00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,070
run it as many times as I want.

00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,410
And what I want to do with the shape is to tell it.

00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,650
If you put them all together, these are triangles.

00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,040
What's fun to see is when you look at this, the first that you see is not the triangle.

00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,190
It's actually this spirallike shape.

00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,820
And you don't want expect that to come out of this.

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:27,470
So, kind of like that emerging property.

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,260
Here is one with squares.

00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:35,090
It's a shape that's really, really hypnotizing.

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,900
So, All right.

00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,570
And now I'm going to tell you about textbased art.

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,620
Some of you are thinking ASCII, right?

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,950
I will talk about that.

00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,280
First, I want to talk about what was it like outputting text.

00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,670
So, there were CRT monitors, but they had an output.

00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,840
Here is a line printer for the '60s, I believe.

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:09,620
And it's a line printer because it prints by lines and does that really fast because

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,160
it has a fixed character set.

00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,510
You can only print certain characters.

00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,240
Just goes line by line.

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,180
Supergreat are for printing out text.

00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,060
And so, people figured out ways to make creative works with this.

00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,630
Here, a couple of pieces of work by Frederick Hammersley.

00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:32,270
And you can see the images here.

00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:35,810
I really like these two.

00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:40,120
And the interesting thing about this, this was actually created with something called

00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,600
the art one programming language.

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,840
And it was created by Katherine Nash and Richard H. Williams at a university in New Mexico.

00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,160
Nash was from the art department and Williams was from the engineering department and they

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:58,020
collaborated to make this language with the intention to teach students to make simple

00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,390
computer graphics.

00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:04,320
It was notable for its simplicity and intended as an introduction to the use of computers

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,680
for those without a technological background.

00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:12,200
And that sounds familiar, that sounds like P5 and processing.

00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
That's really cool.

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,790
Art 1 was the original processing for P5.

00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,810
This is from the '60s.

00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:26,450
And if you look at the documentation, it may look more complicated for art 1, but the API

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,400
is the same thing.

00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,480
You pass in the center of the ellipse and then the size of it.

00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,180
And the same thing, and art 1, punch it on the card and do all that.

00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,150
But the P5 is like type it in, magic.

00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:47,910
Another interesting thing I noticed is if you look at the detail of some of these pieces,

00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:53,860
you notice that the way that it creates its depth of texture is by overlooking characters.

00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,710
You know they had the fixed set of characters.

00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:02,580
And in order to get creative with more textures and effects, they would overlap two different

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,050
characters together.

00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:08,740
This piece is made up entirely of zeros, dots, dashes and apostrophes.

00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,290
And that was brilliant because you have a printer.

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,270
You can print over things.

00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,950
Let's do it.

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:20,240
And I was really inspired by the fact this was really art that was making the most out

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,800
of the available technology.

00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:28,050
Being creative with what they had instead of creating in spite of it.

00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:32,180
And we still have this today, kind of.

00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:39,870
Only difference is that it's not really SBR, it's more like EBCDIC, extended binary coded

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,600
decimal interchange code, supported by IBM at the time.

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,090
And it was even more limited than ASCII.

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,710
As you can see on the top of the character set.

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,780
It's a little hard to see.

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,230
But not a lot of characters.

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,880
I was curious, what was it like working in this language?

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,210
Original art one.

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:02,950
What features did they have?

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:05,090
What did they choose to include?

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:10,290
I did a little research and it's surprisingly hard to find things written about Art one.

00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:17,210
The only thing where I found something significant was in the Reichardt book.

00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:20,790
There was a flowchart talking about the languages.

00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:30,010
And you can draw a line, solid rectangles, open rectangles, triangles, ellipses, and

00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,880
I don't know why they had solid and open rectangles but not solid and open ellipse.

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,340
Not sure.

00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,020
This was simple and straightforward and yet people can create interesting things out of

00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,020
it.

00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,840
I was inspired to recreate this using JavaScript.

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,050
I have here the code.

00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,600
It's on GitHub.

00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,230
Still a work in progress.

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,170
Please don't judge.

00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,220
So, I was like, here's the thing.

00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,220
I don't have a printer, right?

00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,150
I'm not going to go out and buy a printer.

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:03,210
What's the closest thing we have to a printer that's easily accessible?

00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:07,320
And I settled on the terminal.

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,820
Limited character set, wonderful, easy to use.

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,570
Here is an example of a piece of work that I created using the same rules that were available.

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,640
Art one.

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,470
And here these are made with triangles.

00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:25,420
But they have interesting like 3D effect.

00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:28,950
You can do colors with terminals.

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:32,360
Here's one that's actually inspired by the skirt that I'm wearing right now.

00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:40,000
And so, you remember how I talked about how creative they got with overlapping characters?

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,840
So, here's the thing, turns out in a terminal it's really hard to overlap characters if

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,800
you're not using an extended library.

00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,610
So, I was like, okay.

00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,430
What's the next best thing I got?

00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,630
Which is accents or diacritical marks.

00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,340
You see for the Ss, there's an accent at the top and the bottom.

00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,630
Same here, this is an asterisk and then the accent with the box around it.

00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,230
And a lot of my interesting happy accidents.

00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:12,910
Like the way that you color the background of the characters, sometimes it's a little

00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,800
out of sync, but I like that effect.

00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,470
So, yeah, use what you have.

00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,280
I used Unicode.

00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:27,040
Not quite SDR, but Unicode art and that was fun to play with.

00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,260
This just skims the surface.

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,970
There's way, way, way so much more history in computer graphics and computer art.

00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:40,660
In Europe alone, I tailored this talk for Europe because a lot of the history came out.

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:47,070
And Frieder Nake and Georg Nees, prolific computer artist in the '70s.

00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:53,220
And from Hungary, making computer drawings before computer were a thing and also when

00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,250
they were a thing.

00:24:54,250 --> 00:25:03,340
And not to forget the new tendencies movement in what was once Yugoslavia and now Croatia.

00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,270
And there's an 800page book on this.

00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,539
If you want to look it up, the title is over here.

00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:15,420
This is an interesting movement because they celebrate the modular or procedural art.

00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:18,280
Even before computers were used for it.

00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:23,360
And as computers became more and more known, they also became a part of this movement.

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,230
So, yeah.

00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,270
Before I end I just want to talk a little bit about why?

00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,930
Why go through all this research like looking at things from 60 years ago?

00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:40,460
So, a thing that I noticed, especially in the web world, is that we are always looking

00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,280
at, you know, what's new and what's shiny.

00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,430
What can I do next?

00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:50,960
And we don't take a lot of time to step back and to look at what has already been done.

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,470
But it's important to understand that we didn't all get here just on our own.

00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:01,320
We really, you know, were built on the we really stand on the shoulders of giants.

00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,260
It's really important to know where you came from.

00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:08,730
Because if you don't know what has already been done, you don't know how to make something

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:09,740
new.

00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,770
So, yeah.

00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,760
This has given me a lot of appreciation for the technology we have today.

00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:20,100
And, of course, there is no shame in finding inspiration from the past.

00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,080
You can pick what has already been done and make it your own, refine it.

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,490
Learn from all these people who have put in all the work and creativity to get us where

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,140
we are here today.

00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,120
And that's all I have for you.

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,840
I have a blog.

00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,230
I write about this stuff if you're interested.

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,230
But, yeah.

00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,770
It was such a pleasure.

00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,610
