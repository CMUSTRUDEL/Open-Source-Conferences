Title: Javascript is for Everyone! by Meya Stephen Kenigbolo | JSConf EU 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-13
Playlist: JSConf EU 2019
Description: 
	Teaching absolute beginners with no technical experience whatsoever to understand Javascript can be quite a daunting task. It’s more challenging if you have a thick British accent and your students are mostly African students. If you’ve ever designed a tech curriculum then you understand how complicated this can be. At code Afrique where we help the community by offering a free weekend intensive bootcamp, we explored and have now achieved success with ember where we had earlier failed. The aim of this talk is to show, what we tried, where we failed and how Javascript via Ember brought us success like no other.

	00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,150
That's it!

00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:22,920
Now I'm a star.

00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,920
I'm done!

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
Thank you.

00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:35,260
Okay, today I'm going to be talking about JavaScript is for everyone.

00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,870
That wasn't supposed to happen!

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:46,010
And also that wasn't supposed to happen!

00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,780
Okay, hello.

00:00:48,780 --> 00:01:00,039
I'm Kenigbolo Stephen, a lead and advocate.

00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:06,030
I'm also the community manager for Code Afrique story, and I will tell you about the Code

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,830
Afrique story and why JavaScript is for everyone.

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,270
You can find me on Twitter.

00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:17,860
Please don't ask me how I came about that handle!

00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,190
It's one of those things I don't really want to talk about!

00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,910
But, yes.

00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,520
I work in Finland.

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,290
Who knows about Finland?

00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,290
That's nice.

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,290
This audience is way better.

00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:33,819
In Finland, we don't smile, so it is do you know about Finland?

00:01:33,819 --> 00:01:35,619
That's pretty much it!

00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:39,130
I'm going to be talking about JavaScript being for everyone.

00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,539
This is basically how it's going to go.

00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:47,400
I will talk about what Code Afrique is, why we do what we do, an important disclaimer:

00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,649
you may not like a lot of the things I'm going to say today but I think it's important to

00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:52,780
state these things.

00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,200
There's been a huge dysfunction between teaching JavaScript and getting beginners into the

00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,310
industry.

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,830
I'm going to talk about the team behind Code Afrique.

00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:06,530
I'm going to be telling you how we teach JavaScript.

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:14,840
I'm going to tell you about Amber, how the conventions of configuration have changed.

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,060
Beginner concepts that we used Ember to do, and a history of where we came from and how

00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,560
we decided to go with this.

00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,519
What is Code Afrique?

00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,790
Nothing fancy, just giving back to the community.

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,319
It's a bunch of students, doing a masters in software engineering.

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,689
We figured out the problem in Estonia and decided to get together to solve it.

00:02:48,689 --> 00:02:52,560
I'm going to tell you what we did.

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,470
What do we do, and why do we do what we do?

00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,489
Who understands what this means?

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:00,730
Okay.

00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,469
Very few hands.

00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:07,269
But this basically explains why I'm giving this talk.

00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:14,909
In case you missed it in my previous slide, I used the word "under represented" highlighted

00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:17,870
in red for a reason.

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,379
I would like to redefine this word.

00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:23,110
I see myself as a marginalised person.

00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,859
In 2015, I was doing a Masters in software engineering?

00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:27,859
In Estonia.

00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:36,939
We have a lot of people of colour in the country, not so many but a significant number.

00:03:36,939 --> 00:03:40,519
The issue was it was difficult to get jobs, right?

00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,040
There were a lot of people who wanted to get into the tech space and it was difficult to

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,999
get in and the reason was we had created this barrier for them, assuming that everyone had

00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:54,420
the same cognitive abilities.

00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,499
This is a bias, a lot of us have.

00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:59,370
We don't necessarily do it intentionally, but this is it.

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:06,219
A random question: how many people who make tutorials or teach people think about learning

00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:10,489
disabilities like ADHD, for example?

00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:11,489
Very few hands.

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:17,209
How many people think about people who are not really able to learn not because they're

00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,070
not smart enough, but because they didn't have the same privileges that you had?

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,460
Do you ever think of that?

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,020
How many people here got their first computers before 15?

00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,370
Okay.

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,540
You see these hands?

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,360
I never got a computer before 15.

00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,060
So, what whether I like it or not, I didn't get the advantages that others had.

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,960
This is why we came about Code Afrique to actually try to boost that gap and give people

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,380
the ability to actually get into the industry without thinking so much.

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,330
Yesterday, something happened, and I basically wanted to call out this.

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:54,600
I thought it was important.

00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,280
I would like to change the narrative of we being under represented.

00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,060
I quote Brian Lyells when he says you're not under represented before, you're over represented.

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:13,200
I'm sorry, but this is fact.

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,650
We are black, indigenous people of colour in IT, and we are supposed to be here.

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,380
We're not here as a quota, we are here because we're supposed to be here.

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,010
We don't want to use negatives to address ourselves in the industry, we want to be seen

00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,120
as people managing our lives, not under represented.

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,020
Hopefully, I hope that by the end of this talk everything thinks this back and puts

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,890
it on the back of their minds.

00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,900
Would you believe me when I tell you there are a lot of amazing ideas that because it

00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,400
belongs to a person of colour or a marginalised community?

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,800
How many people actually believe this?

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,830
It is always difficult when you need to go and talk for funds when you belong to a specific

00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,090
demographic.

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,520
It's not as easy as a lot of people think.

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,620
This it is one of the reasons where we decided we want to bring this community to get people

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,370
together, people who belong to these under represented groups and then teach them JavaScript

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,280
in such a way where they don't need to be so much worried about the toxicity we have

00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
not industry.

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,940
They could just come and learn, and afterwards explore.

00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:26,140
So, yes, like everyone else, I think we all deserve an equal chance.

00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:31,950
It might not be nice, it might not be comfortable for some people, but we all deserve an equal

00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,950
chance.

00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm not sure about pizza and - I'm a pizza person, so maybe the Americans may not be

00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,590
so happy but I like pizza more than ... we're a bunch of regular people.

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,940
The folks who work at Code Afrique, that's Gabriel.

00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,400
This is Sunday.

00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,000
And this is Victor, all senior software engineers.

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,530
Two work in Canada and one works in Estonia.

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:07,570
We started Code Afrique together in 2016, and we've been going strong there ever since.

00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,030
I'm going to give an honourable mention to a friend called Fortuna based in Estonia.

00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:19,180
He helped us discover a better way to actually accommodate people when we need to teach JavaScript.

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,930
Now, one of the biggest things we found out about JavaScript and getting people into the

00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,860
industry is the conceptions of pure evil.

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,280
One of the preconceptions is that JavaScript is easy.

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,030
You can say that when you're not a beginner.

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,970
If you've never written a line of code, programming is never as easy as you think, and this is

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,810
something I want us to remember when you have to teach people.

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,860
The fact that you understand it does not necessarily mean they will understand it the way that

00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,860
you do.

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,360
The fact that you have the ability to assimilate things does not necessarily mean they would

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,680
have the ability to assimilate it in the way that you will.

00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,860
The JavaScript community out here, there is no control of people grasping the concepts.

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:07,360
This is not the fault of JavaScript but down to the fact that people learn differently.

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,830
Where we've made the mistake is not taking time to find ways to accommodate the different

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,720
type of people who need to learn.

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,021
We have been very mainstream in the way we teach JavaScript, and I'm hoping that, as

00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:24,270
we go back today to mentor people, those who have junior developers, we take this into

00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,960
consideration about who we are teaching what the situations might be.

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,460
Sometimes, it's not only about learning disabilities, it could be emotional, mental, physical.

00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,580
Let's always put that into consideration when we need to teach.

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:45,420
Now, JavaScript does not have to be complicated as much as we tend to make it complicated.

00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,810
I strongly believe it doesn't have to be.

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,370
JavaScript is a beautiful language.

00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,850
I didn't come from a JavaScript background.

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,629
I came from a C++ background but of since I got here I don't want to go back because

00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:56,370
I love being here.

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:01,540
However, we have created a barrier that makes it difficult for people to come into the industry,

00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:08,029
and just before I go, a quick question: how many people here work in front-end development?

00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:09,040
Awesome.

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,100
That's a lot of hands.

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,100
Okay.

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,999
This should have been named JSConf front-end!

00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:22,279
How many people as front-end engineers have had to traverse a binary tree in their regular

00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:24,999
day jobs?

00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,249
That's very few hands.

00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:27,689
I can't even count.

00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:33,759
How many have had to use the big notification in the regular jobs and front-end engineers?

00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:34,759
Also very few hand.

00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:41,060
Now, think about it: why do we need to actually make beginners scared of getting into the

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,649
industry by bombarding them with all this information instead of getting them in and

00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:47,579
easing them into learning?

00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:49,190
Why can't we do that?

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,029
Why do we always have to make it so complicated?

00:09:52,029 --> 00:10:00,300
So we designed a simple way to actually teach beginners, and it's basically this: because

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,720
whether you like it or not, these are the three building blocks of JavaScript.

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,810
The moment you can understand these three concepts, it makes it easier for you to go

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:13,709
on and explore different other things.

00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:21,509
We basically decided to use the pattern explaining variables and objects and methods going through

00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:22,509
this way.

00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:24,120
We think it's easier.

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,139
It has worked for us and enabled us to get out the 15 students we initially take, get

00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:33,579
nine of them into the industry, they're good engineers, they're still young, they still

00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,389
have a lot of time to improve, but they're learning, and it has shown us that there is

00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:41,540
a possibility to actually ease people into the industry without necessarily complicating

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,670
the entrants.

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,900
We need to think about the different type of people.

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,170
We need no to think about the different communities and find a way to get everyone in without

00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,889
necessarily unintentionally excluding them.

00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:02,550
Now, the biggest problem we face when we need to teach people, and this is not - this is

00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:09,470
by no means me lashing out at anyone, or any particular thing, I'm just saying the JavaScript

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,490
community has grown so big, and something that is supposed to be a huge help for us

00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:20,259
has unfortunately turned out to be a problem, and that is that?

00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,259
This is it.

00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:22,259
Yes.

00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:24,819
And, again, pretty much frameworks.

00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:28,810
Frameworks was supposed to make software development easy.

00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:35,699
Frameworks were basically - we started building frameworks to enable people become productive

00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:37,819
easier.

00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:43,180
Unfortunately, we have started making frameworks that by making it more complicated for people

00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:48,529
to get in, and this is now not a lash-out to anyone or framework.

00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:53,300
In my team, we use four different JavaScript frameworks for different projects.

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,600
Every one has its pros and cons.

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,369
I think that it's important that when we build this, and even when we make tutorials, we

00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:06,579
take into consideration the different type of people that need to learn.

00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:13,060
Now, I like Ember, and I'm going to make a disclaimer: I am not sure I'm not connected

00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,660
to Ember.

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:25,910
I'm only speaking it in the context of how we use them by giving people simple instructions.

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,740
There's something very controversial about Ember.

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,180
I wouldn't say controversial but a diverse opinion.

00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,800
It's a convention over configuration.

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,120
A lot of people feel that this is not so good.

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,259
And that's not justified.

00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,259
They have their reasons.

00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:46,930
A lot of people do believe that conventional over configuration is quite important, and

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,550
they have their reasons.

00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:54,720
Now, starting in Code Afrique, we actually went ahead to teach people in terms of the

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,399
different things that we needed to show them.

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,949
What we discovered was that it was easier to actually use Ember because we could give

00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,879
them a set of instructions to follow.

00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:08,899
One of the most important things you enjoyed as a beginner was writing the line of code

00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:09,899
and seeing it work.

00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:16,170
We gave them an opportunity to see their work progress, enjoy that excitement, and then

00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,769
go on to dig deeper behind the basics, why this works the way it works, with , instead

00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:23,949
of working in the reverse pattern.

00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:28,259
So typical pit stalls we encountered with trying to use frameworks.

00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:29,509
Lazy-loading.

00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:33,339
Too many computer science concepts that is front-end development.

00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:34,709
It doesn't have to be so complicated.

00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:36,930
Come on.

00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:40,769
Some frameworks seemed to be front-end frameworks designed for back-end developers.

00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:44,129
A lot of people here can agree with that, I'm pretty sure we've all seen it.

00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:46,579
You probably know what I'm talking about.

00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:51,170
Yes, and then some things aren't designed for beginners, it's true.

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,910
As much as we would like to say it is, it's just not designed for beginners.

00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:56,910
It's not beginner-friendly.

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,380
There are tons of other things but I will skip that and talk about the basic ones.

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,590
At this point, I'm going to play a nice video.

00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,590
Hopefully, the musical part is actually removed.

00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,590
This was a video made by one of our students and I promised him I was going to play here.

00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,590
>> Thank you.

00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,590
God bless America.

00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,590
[Applause].

00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,590
>> It's a representation of how the different technologies and frameworks.

00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,590
[Video]: "Nice to meet you.

00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,590
What's up, Graham.

00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,590
You know this.

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,590
Heath Williamson.

00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,590
Nice to meet you, sir.

00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,590
Come on.

00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,590
Come on.

00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,590
Emily George.

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,590
How are you doing?

00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,590
All right.

00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,590
Never forget about that.

00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,590
That's all we got.

00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,590
Nice to meet you.

00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,590
All right.

00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,590
Oh, bring it in!

00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,590
Starting from the bottom now we are here.

00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,590
Nice to meet you.

00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,590
All right.

00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,590
All right.

00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:29,590
Nice to meet you.

00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,590
One - bring it in there.

00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,590
[Voices overspeaking].

00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,590
Nice to meet you.

00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,590
My goodness.

00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,590
Look at this.

00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,590
Oh.

00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,590
She is so beautiful.

00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,590
Mmm.

00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,590
I want another one.

00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,590
There you go.

00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,590
Precious.

00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,590
Beautiful.

00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,590
Beautiful.

00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,590
What's her name?

00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,590
This is Libia Roogie.

00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,590
Come on, there he is!

00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,590
All right, very good to meet you.

00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,590
Here we go.

00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,590
[Laughter].

00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,590
" >> Okay, so I'm just going to round up.

00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,590
That was pretty much it.

00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:51,590
I would say a big thank you to all the people who work with Ember guides, teaching Ember

00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,590
and JS has been amazing because of the way the documentation is designed.

00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,590
A huge shout-out to your communities.

00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,590
The documentations are totally amazing and they make teaching easy for us.

00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,590
Routers, and this is no beef against any framework, but not having to teach people about routing,

00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,590
not having to tell people listen, I need you to go and install this particular framework

00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,590
router to get started helps us a lot because it eliminates the need for people to worry

00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,590
about that.

00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,590
When they want to learn about routers is doing it in their own time.

00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,590
They want to get productive and learn code.

00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,910
Handle - data binding.

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:09,949
We can't actually teach data-binding without teaching data-binding.

00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:14,809
Basically, they can get productive and understand it and when they want to dig deeper, they

00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:19,389
have a better overview of what data binding should be and how it should work.

00:15:19,389 --> 00:15:20,389
Lastly, convention.

00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:25,600
We all have different ideas about convention, but as someone who has taught Ruby on Rails,

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:35,420
and em-R Ember, I think for beginners, it's important to give learners a set of guidelines

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,140
to use and work in.

00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,829
Just I'm going to show a couple of little things.

00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:46,709
So this is pretty much lazy-loading in Ember.js.

00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:50,160
This is how straightforward it was.

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,500
I only need to explain what Lazy Loading is and show them is.

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,949
No disrespect to Angular, if I want to do this in Angular, it's not so straightforward.

00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:05,819
This is one of the issues we face.

00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:10,439
You need to make sure you can go into a lot of core concepts.

00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:14,959
Going into a lot of core concepts for people you're trying to get into the industry might

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,100
just be a way to chase them away.

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,190
So using simpler methods, using this kind of method, and using convention over configuration,

00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,189
we can do this and show it to to them better.

00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:32,259
I hope a lot of frameworks will make it easier for people getting into the industry.

00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:36,579
This is a simple routing function in Ember.js.

00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:37,740
This is a simple explanation.

00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,009
This is all I need to tell the student that how the routing itself would work, and this

00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:48,160
would make logical sense because it follows systematically the way it will flow.

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,369
Lastly, this is a code written by someone who learned JavaScript for four days.

00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:58,110
He literally just learned objects, variables, and functions, and then he came up with this.

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,519
I promised him I was going to put this up there because four days in, I couldn't write

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,519
this.

00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:10,030
Somehow, we are actually doing something right, and I'm hoping as we go back, we learn to

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,300
actually help people learn properly.

00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,880
Moving forward, we've run the code to reload.

00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:25,829
We still have Code Afrique as an online version and Reload is a boot camp for people who identify

00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,100
as marginalised groups.

00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,049
You can find us on Twitter.

00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:35,490
If you would like to be a mentor to some of our students, we would love that.

00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,640
And many thanks to the following organisations.

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,490
The Association of African Students in Estonia.

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:46,510
They gave us to the - and the Talin Institute of Technology.

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:53,779
Our classrooms are located in the institute, and a huge thanks to my company.

00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:59,880
I'm paid to be a developer-advocate that doesn't need to come and talk about ... but I - our

00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,360
huge thanks to them.

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,750
Lastly, I wanted to mention about mentoring, because this is also a fundamental part of

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,780
JavaScript that we have actually forgotten.

00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,299
Now, a huge shout out to the node.js community.

00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:17,019
They have an awesome mentoring system.

00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:21,211
It does have a little flaw and hopefully sometime I'm going to bring that up when I can, but

00:18:21,211 --> 00:18:28,520
I just wanted to point out that if you know you mentor anyone, if you know you're a senior

00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,740
engineer and you have junior engineers in your team, mentoring is not good enough.

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,850
You need to open them to your network.

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,250
You need to give them opportunities.

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:43,370
It's wanting to say yes, I'm a teacher, I have four mentees.

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:48,169
How many are working?

00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:51,500
It's important that we keep this at the back of our mind when we teach.

00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,919
It's another thing to pass knowledge and another thing to give people confidence.

00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,820
While you mentor people, giving them opportunities.

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:14,630
I used to be at fault for this because I have seven meant yes, sir - what was I missing?

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:21,169
On linked linked, if I see a job, I - if - I can say all seven are working today.

00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:26,160
One will be a senior engineer, he's just within three years be he is smart because he has

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,669
a CSS background.

00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:30,250
It's important that we open up people to our networks.

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:37,270
I'm highlighting the mentees that we have at Code Afrique because they came from a very

00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,270
different background.

00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:47,160
He's a journalist, and when I look down there, he actually also doesn't have a CS degree.

00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,230
She started studying marketing, but they're all engineers now, and we're really proud

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,279
of what they do.

00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,450
I hope we can encourage people to get into tech this way.

00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:05,970
Lastly, I'm going to point this: who has had this raised before? - who has heard this phrase

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:06,970
before?

00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,140
What this means is that it is all about sharing what has been bothering you for a long time.

00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:16,159
Mostly things that, you know, you usually don't have anyone to talk about, but you would

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,159
like to talk about it.

00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,039
The reason why I do this is because every time I come to a conference, I have students

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:27,179
who are back home listening, and I want the experienced developers here to please go on

00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:34,059
Twitter and talk about your most vulnerable times, talk about those things that you can't

00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:35,059
remember.

00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:39,750
You can go on Twitter, for example, every single time I need to Google how to use the

00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:44,679
reduce function because despite the fact I've been programming for over five years, I don't

00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:45,679
seem to grab it.

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,919
I have to check out the reduce function.

00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:53,970
When you say this to young people, it doesn't matter the age, but people who are young in

00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:54,970
the industry.

00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,880
You give them some sort of confidence and let them know we're not all Superman.

00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:04,299
Everyone makes mistakes and has a part they're not comfortable with.

00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,039
I want you please to share your stories.

00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:10,190
I'm going to go on Twitter quickly and post this.

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,090
So please indulge me.

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,960
I prepared this tweet just ahead of time.

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,490
You can go on the there and write the themes that you consider to be the most vulnerable

00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,360
things as a senior developer, what things do you forget regularly?

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,529
As a senior developer, no matter how much I think I know, I really don't know shit,

00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:39,220
unfortunately, because, when I went to EmberConf I sat with Yehuda who was a role model for

00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:49,039
me, when he started to contribute - I realised, like, oh, boy, I have a long way to go, you

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,039
know?

00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:54,539
So please share your stories with them, and encourage them and make them understand that

00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:55,990
it's okay to make mistakes.

00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,691
We all make mistakes regardless of how many years experience we have not industry, everyone

00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:05,980
makes mistakes and you can learn from them and be better.

00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,020
I started going back.

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,440
And with that, I say thank you.

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,070
You can find me on GitHub, and Twitter, and you can send me an email.

00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:19,700
The word you see there is the one thing I want you to learn about Finland today - how

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,960
we say thank you.

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,620
Thank you very much!

00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,929
