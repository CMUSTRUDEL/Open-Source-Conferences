Description: 
	This is "Stencil: a built-time approach to the web". Sorry, we messed up the title of the talk in the intro. 

We all know and love framework-like features such as hot module replacement, reactive properties, templating, CSS-in-JS, lazy-loaded bundling, etc. Stencil is a new approach, a build-time abstraction with framework-level productivity, that generates hand-optimized components using future-proof web APIs. Weâ€™ll discuss the architecture of Stencil and the innovations a compiler can introduce to your apps and design systems!
