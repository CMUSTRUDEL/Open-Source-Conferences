Hi, everybody!

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,830
Wooh!

00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:13,650
It's finally here.

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,220
I mean, is anyone playing drums around here?

00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:25,710
Because, you know, I am kind of hearing beatings.

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,980
I think it's my heart beating so loud and fast - I'm so nervous.

00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,220
Thank you, Rachel.

00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:41,960
First of all, I would like to thank JSConf EU for this wonderful community.

00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,070
This is my second time in JSConf EU, and second time in Berlin.

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:55,160
I had a nice time back then, and also hoping to have the same this year too.

00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:02,469
I was here last year on a scholarship - again, thanks to JSConf EU.

00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:11,090
They're doing an amazing job providing scholarships to diverse culture people from people who

00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,920
wouldn't be here for the scholarships.

00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:21,950
So a round of applause, maybe, for the JSConf EU team!

00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,950
[Applause].

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,920
And, yes, a few disclaimers and excuses.

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,850
This is going to be my first ever talk at an international conference, and also my first-ever

00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,049
talk in the English language.

00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:36,049
[Applause].

00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:44,329
I'm used to give in the Nepali language, so this will be my first-ever talk.

00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:52,149
You might hear some broken English, and - so bear with me.

00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:57,759
Another disclaimer: the challenges of overcoming techniques that I'm going to mention here

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:04,649
in this talk are based on my total, I mean, based on my personal experience, and it's

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,890
subjected to change according to the country, according to the organiser.

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:17,440
Yes, before starting today, I would like to have a few questions with the guys.

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,780
You can raise your hands if you agree with it.

00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,630
And you don't have to do anything if you don't.

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,700
Have you ever started a tech community before?

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,020
Anyone?

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,290
I can see a few hands.

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,610
Has anyone here currently leading a community?

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:40,849
You don't have to - you don't have to be the founder, but you're currently leading the

00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:42,099
community?

00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,349
Anybody?

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,849
A few.

00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,690
How many of you believe in community?

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:55,220
By "believe", I mean how many think a community can help you grow?

00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,400
It can help you be more productive, and even help.

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,210
You can be a better person?

00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,210
Nice.

00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,360
That's what I feel too.

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,260
In fact, what I am today, where I am today is all because of the community.

00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,900
I'm so into it.

00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,090
So, yes, about me: I'm Roshan Gautam.

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,140
By the way, good afternoon, everybody!

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,470
I've come all the way from Nepal, just finished my bachelor's degree in computer science.

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:32,260
Actually, waiting for the result of my last semester, so fingers crossed.

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:39,459
I'm working as a full-time coder in my own company called Technology.

00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:41,709
You can see the spelling right there.

00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:51,909
I saw my - I spend my time developing mobile apps using React Native, mobile apps development

00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:56,830
for four years now, just after joining the campus.

00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:06,870
When I was in school, maybe grade 8 or 9, my dad bought a computer, and I was so into

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,870
it.

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,900
At that time, I used to play a lot of football - I mean, you understand football, right?

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,280
So, maybe soccer for somebody.

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,720
So, yes.

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,250
I used to play a lot of football.

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:29,260
After that, I got the computer in my home, and in school, they used to teach us QBASIC,

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:37,160
and one of my elder brothers introduced me with in tool, and I just got into programming

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,880
world from grade 9.

00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,500
I used to get so fascinated by community back then as well.

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,720
I used to create and joined the Facebook groups for programming.

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,290
I created one called Programmers, something like that.

00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,510
On Facebook, not that old!

00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,560
Also, I used to join different chat rooms?

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,080
Yahoo Messenger a lot.

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,870
Yes, talking about the communities.

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:10,180
These are a few of the communities that I'm currently involved in, and also I was involved

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,490
in, KT MDS.

00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:24,940
Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, and it's a small JavaScript community, actually a meet-up

00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,390
group in Kathmandu.

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:34,390
I'm currently leading in community so I will talk about this in more detail in a moment.

00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,020
Next up, it's Web Conference in Kathmandu.

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,460
I'm so excited to talk about this.

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,400
I'm one of the proud organisers.

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,050
Have you ever heard of Web Kathmandu, anybody?

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:52,130
You will have heard about it today!

00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,770
I also talk about this in more detail in a moment.

00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:03,250
It's another is community of volunteers who want to contribute in open source, and also

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:09,120
in the open way who wants to contribute in open source, in a modular project.

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,840
We organise various events, and activities like the selection of the browsers, privacy

00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:35,180
campaigns, and work - I'm a ... another talk at ambassador programme is local campus ambassador

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:38,210
in my campus while I was there.

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:44,370
So, let's talk about KTMJS.

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:51,820
As I said earlier, it's a community of JS developers in Kathmandu where we gather together,

00:06:51,820 --> 00:07:01,240
share things around JavaScript, just we talk, and it started two years ago as a Facebook

00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
group.

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,080
It is still there.

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,580
I mean, yes.

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,120
So, we are currently six people managing the community, six co-contributors.

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:18,200
Until now, we have managed to organise around 13 event, and in our Facebook group, there

00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:25,900
are around 1,500 members, so I'm not into all these numbers at all, but I wanted to

00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,560
have it in the slide so I could talk about it.

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:38,520
So the last meet-up that we did was on 25 May.

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,480
We do a regular meet-up of different formats, like sometimes formal, sometimes informal,

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,190
and sometimes a mix of both.

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:52,900
This is the photo from the last week of KMTJS.

00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:02,530
There were 65 people, I guess, with four speakers.

00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:07,790
It was about testing, and security in JavaScript.

00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,170
So let me talk about where - let me talk about the conference in Kathmandu, the conference

00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:17,020
that I'm so excited and proud about.

00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,840
It's the only web conference in Nepal.

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:25,810
There are a few conferences which are related to the workplace or something like that, but

00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:36,539
it's the only conference that - it's a two-day conference, but a bit different than the KTMJ

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,649
- than JSConf EU.

00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:45,300
On the first day, it's talks like this, but on the second day, we do outdoor activities

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:56,110
like, you know, trekking, and hiking, and roaming around the city together.

00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,150
I want to talk about the motivation behind this conference.

00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:08,810
So, there are a lot of experienced developers promising start-ups in Nepal, they are scattered

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,450
and unnoticed.

00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:16,760
The main motivation behind this conference is making these people come together and say

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,590
about their stuff with - share their stuff with each other, and get together and build

00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,770
something, right?

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:32,260
And also, it's very economically hard for Nepalese, like in their salary range to come

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:41,840
to this place and attend the conference and not everybody is as lucky as me to get their

00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:49,700
talk accepted and attend the conference or get a scholarship.

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:58,120
What it aims to do is to provide these opportunities to meet people, and attend high-class talks

00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,970
for the local people in Nepal.

00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:07,420
Let me talk about a little bit of behind the scenes, how it all started.

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,260
So I was attending this conference in Iceland.

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,240
It's JSConf Iceland which you may have heard of.

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,090
I was talking to one of the speakers of JSConf Iceland.

00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:24,590
He actually asked me if there were any conferences that are happening in Nepal?

00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,000
At that point of time, I was speechless, actually.

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,020
So, I was really sad.

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,580
I came back to Nepal.

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:39,580
In one of the local meet-ups in my surprise, I found this group of people who were actually

00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,940
planning to do a conference in Nepal.

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,140
So, I was so excited, you know?

00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,440
I was attending this conference in all the places of the world, but I had not any conferences

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,810
in my place, so I was so excited, I joined the team, successfully organised, the first

00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,880
time in 2018.

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,330
So do you want to know the best part?

00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:15,000
The speaker who asked me about the conference in Nepal will be speak ing at in 2019 in September

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,180
22 to 23rd.

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,010
How cool is that?

00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,470
[Applause].

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:27,680
So these are some of the stats from WWKTM.

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:37,610
We were initially expecting only 80 people, so I guess around 80 people to come, and five

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:45,050
or six speakers, but to our surprise, as you can see in the stats, there were 300-plus

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:51,260
attendees, and ten speakers from 14-plus countries.

00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:59,270
This is the group photo from the Kathmandu 2018.

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:06,210
So this was - it - so there are a lot of perks going together with community.

00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:12,860
There are a lot of perks when leading a meet-up group or organising events and conferences.

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,920
It's possible to grow together with community, right?

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,030
You guys believed it before.

00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:27,890
So, if you haven't watched the final episode of Game of Thrones yet, this might be the

00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,500
spoiler for you, but I hope it won't matter anyway.

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,200
Yes.

00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,590
How many of you ...! Did you get it!

00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,820
How do you think I came all this way?

00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,920
I mean, if it wasn't for community?

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,120
I wouldn't have been here speaking before you guys, organising meet-ups and conferences,

00:12:49,120 --> 00:13:00,220
giving me the courage to do challenging things that even if I'm not very good at it.

00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:06,420
I hadn't known about this conference or I wouldn't have applied for the talk if it wasn't

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,040
for community, and, if I wasn't involved in these kind of activities.

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,360
So you will be more privileged.

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,730
So list - I was listening to this podcast called Howe I Built This?

00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:23,340
Has anyone heard of that?

00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:31,700
I was listening to this podcast by John from BuzzFeed.

00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:39,790
He was saying when you get initial success, as he did in the Huffington Post, you will

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:46,540
get access to greater ideas, resources and people, et cetera, that strike me right in.

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:53,160
For this, I mean when you lead a community or you organise this kind of event, even if

00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:59,870
you participate actively in these programmes, you will have access to more resources, and

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,400
many more available stuff, right?

00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,820
So, you know, you get these perks.

00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,370
I found myself doing these things.

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,940
You can have your own set of stuff.

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,080
Attend the talks actively.

00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,120
Yes, you are the organiser of the meet-up.

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:28,089
You might not have a lot of time attending the talks, but you have to, you can try to

00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:33,410
manage things in such a way that you are also attending the talks actively which will surely

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:38,690
help you grow your professional lives and get some skills.

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:42,000
How many of you agree on this?

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,860
Reaching out to the speakers, reaching out to the speakers will help you grow your communication

00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,350
skills of course.

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:58,900
Your network of friends and professionals will be wide enough to get more opportunities.

00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:05,920
Challenges that I faced: so, of course, you're going to face a lot of challenges if you trying

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,690
to conduct meet-ups in small communities like Nepal, right?

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,970
There might be a lot of them in different forms.

00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:21,280
I will talk about these challenges that I'm facing in my place, Nepal, and you can always

00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,860
deliver them to yours.

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,290
No wonder you might have differences of challenges.

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:38,410
Values: yes, in a small community like Nepal, it's really hard to get nice conference hall

00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,630
for free of cost.

00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:49,650
I mean, as we are not well funded, and that could accommodate more, more than 50 participants.

00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:58,279
I actually, we, I had to postpone one of the meet-ups because of not getting the venue

00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,710
in time, right?

00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,670
That was a very sad moment.

00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:06,220
Another challenge would be to find sponsors.

00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:12,331
You might not need sponsors to run the meet-up, but, in fact, most of the meet-ups that I

00:16:12,331 --> 00:16:14,899
have organised they are sponsor-free.

00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:22,450
On the other hand, it's hard to organise meet-ups without sponsors.

00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:33,770
I mean, usually, we have - with no sponsors, there are not going to be food and drinks

00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,399
for the attendees, right?

00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,560
How actively one can participate in the event, a hungry stomach?

00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:51,630
And also, it's really nice to give some token of love to speakers.

00:16:51,630 --> 00:17:00,110
In my context, the main issue with finding sponsors was, like, not so many companies

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,540
to approach for sponsorship.

00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:09,040
There were not enough companies, there are not enough companies in Nepal, sorry, where

00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:15,550
I can approach for sponsorship.

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:22,060
Finding speakers turned out to be hard task for me as well.

00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:28,390
In the case of Nepal, and in the case of some of the speakers don't really want to talk

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:34,490
in the small meet-up like ours, and most of them, most of the engineers, they hesitate

00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,440
to talk in public.

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,660
That's a real problem in our place.

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:46,040
So, if you want to share something in the community, or if you have done some amazing

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:52,890
stuff that will help the public, please go forward and don't hesitate about talking in

00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:53,980
the meet-ups.

00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,090
It could be local, or it could be a conference like this.

00:17:57,090 --> 00:17:59,980
It would really help the organisers.

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:09,250
The same like the speakers, attendees are also like, faced challenges in attendees as

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,250
well.

00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:15,750
Senior engineers and developers are not willing to attend the meet-up maybe because they feel

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:22,530
like they aren't going to learn anything from the meet-up, but, yes, most of the participants

00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:27,470
in the meet-ups in Nepal are students.

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:33,992
Also, this is the main thing, I guess, motivations in teams.. since we are non-funded, we're

00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:42,700
not funded by any big organisations, there might be the loss of motivation in the team.

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:49,770
Yes, too much or too few meet-ups.

00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:52,680
This is a very big problem.

00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:58,240
Because of the lack of motivation and the different jobs of the people, of the organising

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:06,250
team, there might be very few meet-ups, and also there might be too many meet-ups.

00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,300
So how to overcome these challenges?

00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:15,460
Again, these are based on my experience, and these things are subjected to change according

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:22,710
to the country, according to the place, and according to the organiser teams.

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,170
So you can try to find alternative venues.

00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:29,580
You know, you can talk to the schools and colleges, and universities to provide their

00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,060
premises as a venue.

00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:39,920
You can also conduct small meet-ups in coffee shops and cafes where participants can buy

00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:46,080
their own coffee and food, and also you can ask the venue providers to provide light snacks

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:53,610
and tea and coffee for their attendees.

00:19:53,610 --> 00:20:01,500
In the - senior developers and engineers don't like to go, why they wouldn't like to come

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:10,480
in the meet-up, it's like they're not going to learn anything from the talks, they just

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,430
want to build their network, but students, they like to attend the talks from the seniors,

00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,370
and they like to learn programming languages, or something like that.

00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:30,100
So you can try to have, you know, different formats of the events like these talks should

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:37,650
not, I mean, it doesn't have to be formal meet-ups where two guys come and do the frameworks,

00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:43,380
right, so you can try to do informal meet-ups where developers meet and greet, talk about

00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:47,890
their life, talk about their side projects.

00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:53,250
You can also try doing events in different time, like, sometimes in the morning, sometimes

00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,260
in the afternoon, and even in the evening.

00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,080
Right?

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:09,260
Yes, the meet-ups in the Facebook group can be also very fruitful.

00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:18,220
Too frequent meet-ups in the beginning, we used to do meet-ups efficient week.

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,180
That was crazy.

00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:27,840
Attendees and even yourself, you don't want to lose all your weekends, you know?

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,790
Going to the meet-ups, and listening to some stuff.

00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:38,520
Having said that, skipping six or seven months for a meet-up is not healthy, either.

00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:47,510
You have to do - regularly, it could be once in a month, or twice in - I don't know, once

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,860
in two months, and something like that.

00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:57,700
And another thing that you can do is let your team member lead the meet-up.

00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:04,200
I actually, did this recently, that I was just talking about the May 25 meet-up.

00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:12,190
I was actually preparing for JSConf EU talk, and I didn't have enough time to conduct meet-up,

00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:22,120
so I asked one of my team members to organise this and do anything they like, you know?

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,880
It was very good thing.

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,950
I mean, there was a lot of - all the people from the team came up, and they started working

00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,620
on them, and it was successful.

00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:41,679
I mean, 65 people were there, and I heard it went a lot better.

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:49,140
Also, you can get engaged in social media, Facebook groups, and invite the attendees

00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,280
to attend, to join the group, and ask questions, or something like that.

00:22:53,280 --> 00:23:01,000
Yes, very, very important, not - yes, check feedback from your attendees.

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,540
It's very important.

00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:09,480
Like, I told you earlier that we are trying to have different formats of events, right?

00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:16,550
So it was because of the feedbacks from the attendees.

00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:26,330
Takeaways, actively to grow and participate with the together, involved in community will

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:33,330
help you grow your communication skills and professional skills, have motivated members

00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:35,270
in your team.

00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:40,450
Too many meet-ups and too irregular meet-ups, avoid.

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:46,960
Always take feedback from the attendees, and screw it, just do it!

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:55,090
If you have - if you're not getting involved in the local meet-ups, just get involved in

00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,010
it, and thank you.

00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,130
This is Roshan Gautam.

00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:01,230
You can find me in the GitHub.

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,610
Thank you.

00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,799
[Applause].

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:15,549
Actually, one more thing: if you want to speak at Kathmandu, we've just opened up our wildcard

00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:22,990
speaker proposal for a very limited tile, make sure you apply as soon as possible.

00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,990
Thanks again!

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,460
