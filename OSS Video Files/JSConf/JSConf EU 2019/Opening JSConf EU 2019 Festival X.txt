>> I'm Carolina you might have heard that this is the tenth anniversary of JSConf EU!

00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,600
[Cheering and applause].

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,710
But you might also have heard that, for now, this is the last one.

00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:39,800
But, this seems like a great opportunity for us to give you a little bit of a look at how

00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,640
it all got started.

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,840
>> So the history of JSConf EU began in Washington, DC ten years ago in 2009.

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,360
This event is often described as a homecoming for the JavaScript community, because that

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:22,959
might be hard for you to believe right now, but back then, the JavaScript community kind

00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:30,520
of didn't exist.

00:01:30,520 --> 00:02:42,799
A lot of people were PHP programmers doing Ruby and Python and doing a bit of JavaScript.

00:02:42,799 --> 00:03:17,079
Nobody felt that JavaScript is my home.

00:03:17,079 --> 00:04:02,599
JSConf EU 2009 brought that space together and changed the landscaping space forever.

00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:09,319
>> Holger, Jan and Malte met at that first JSConf US and decided they needed to bring

00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:10,489
that community to Europe.

00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:14,620
In 2009, they chose a venue, and, with no other prior experience planning a conference,

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,620
they got started.

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:23,280
Lucky for them, Marina worked there, and she helped bring that conference to live, and

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:32,919
a few months later when they were planning the next conference, they found that Marina

00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:40,620
didn't work there any more, and they were panicked and approached there, and since then,

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,350
she's been working with the conference every single year.

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,889
A little-known secret: Marina is a huge part of this conference.

00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:49,300
Please applaud Marina!

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,300
[Applause].

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,720
She is the one who suggested the bubble track.

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,319
If you remember that?

00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,919
Anyway, not this year.

00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,380
So the original JSConf was Jan, Holger, and Malte.

00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:11,210
These were not the only people who have been a part of this amazing organising team.

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,680
In 2012, Tiffany joins, and then in 2015, Simone.

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:27,250
For a year, I was a part of the team before moving to Australia and starting - actually,

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:49,550
just cultivating a local chapter of JSConf and CSSConf Australia, and Feli joined as

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,550
the newest team member.

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:57,650
As someone who is organiser, I think it's fair to shall I that JSConf EU had a little

00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:09,759
impact on the tech community starting in the first year when Ryan Dahl showed JS for the

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,330
first time, and it was one of the only tech conferences with a standing ovation.

00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,430
I missed it.

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,409
I was in the other track.

00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:21,539
And then, last year, he demoed Deno, his new JavaScript run time, and of course, Deno is

00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,870
based on typescript which was also I understood Democratic Unionist at JSConf EU.

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,259
Finally, the not-so-super-well-received React was at JSConf US but then represented at Pete

00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,259
Hunt.

00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,770
JSConf was never supposed to be a big conference.

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,020
Yet here we are with 1,600 people right now.

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:43,599
The strategy for JSConf from the early days was to have a lot of small conferences around

00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,550
the globe to provide local communities to be distributed, and also to lower the environmental

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,220
impact of flying people around.

00:06:50,220 --> 00:07:01,000
While organising conferences now we have 14 JSConfs, some active and retired - EU, Australia,

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:11,780
China, Colombia would be Brazil, Belgium, China, and I hope I didn't forget anyone.

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,780
[Cheering].

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,050
>> There are a lot of them.

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:22,949
And that's not mentioning any satellite events and JSConf family events.

00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:38,970
It's

00:07:38,970 --> 00:08:14,010
a huge family now.

00:08:14,010 --> 00:09:49,360
JSConf EU didn't just spawn more JSConfs around the world.

00:09:49,360 --> 00:10:32,690
In 2011, Reject US which was originally conceived as a platform for the great talks that got

00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:58,650
rejected, and it was a lower prised event aimed at locals which got its own cult following.

00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:09,780
CSSConf came to the US as well in 2013.

00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:19,310
They may have heard that just like JSConf, CSSConf is also taking a break, but that means

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,020
it's completely over.

00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,880
Their last conference was yesterday.

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,450
Round of applause if you went yesterday!

00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,450
[Applause].

00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:44,430
One of the things that makes JSConf and CSSConf very special and welcoming place is inclusion.

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:56,170
And JSConf is one of the first events in tech which implemented and enforced a code of conduct,

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:07,670
provided childcare, built an anonymous Call for Speakers process that minimises bias,

00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,170
and they really put an effort into maximising the participation from under-represented groups

00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,220
in every single aspect of the event.

00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:22,920
So diversity and inclusion is one of the core values at JSConf, because anyone, no matter

00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:31,080
their race, gender, age, socio-economic status, ability, should be able to safely participate

00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,820
in the tech community, be treated equally, and be welcome.

00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,220
>> Applause to that!

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,220
[Applause].

00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,220
>> Wow!

00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,220
I didn't do that.

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,220
I promise!

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,280
I just pressed a button.

00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,140
We can keep going.

00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,010
We can just go.

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,410
>> Let's keep going!

00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,850
Imagine tweets, imagine excited tweets from people - picture tweets!

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,850
Okay, key can go.

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,850
We can go through this again.

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:55,850
Yes, we've talked about this.

00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,750
>> Recap of the recap!

00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,650
>> Been there, done that!

00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,650
Yep, yep!

00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,010
Previously on JSConf EU!

00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,800
>> It's the gifs that are breaking it, I swear.

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
>> Success.

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Getting back on track.

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:15,810
So one of the most exciting and great manifestations of that inclusion strategy is the scholarship

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:25,690
programme that's been run by JSConf EU JSConf and CSSConf as well.

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,500
This programme allows people who couldn't attend these events otherwise to attend for

00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
free.

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,050
This programme has started friendships, careers, and built amazing connections.

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:40,940
One of the examples of that is Sun Li is the participant and now the organiser of the first

00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,380
JSConf Korea!

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,380
[Applause].

00:13:43,380 --> 00:17:11,559
So it's just incredible to see the effect of this programme that it

00:17:11,559 --> 00:18:12,120
can have

00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:25,900
on somebody's life.

00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:35,039
>> So we want to thank right now everyone who supported

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,230
this programme, both this year and in previous years.

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:43,299
People, like yourselves, contributing to this programme.

00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:46,779
All the sponsors this year, every single one of them contributed to the programme.

00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:51,710
We want especially to thank Google and Glitch who directly contributed to the programme,

00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:57,490
and this programme has grown so significantly that, this year, there are 150 scholarships

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:01,610
given out for CSSconf and JSConf.

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:09,509
Congratulations on that!

00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:16,609
[Applause].

00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:24,110
>> It's really important to address those of you who are here because of this programme.

00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:28,100
I want to welcome you to JSConf, welcome you to this community.

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,070
We are so, so happy and privileged to have you, so welcome, and I hope you have a wonderful

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,070
time here.

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,070
[Cheering and applause].

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:45,669
>> If anything, JSConf has made a lot of people happy, and we hope we see a lot more smiling

00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:46,970
faces today.

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,970
I was at that first JSConf EU, and I can tell you that was the first time I felt I was part

00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,179
of my professional community.

00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:55,679
I'm going to lose if - shit!

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,669
Maybe this conf was that for you too.

00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:06,799
We're part of a diverse community, we are going to have a great time, and enjoy the

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,799
rest of the show!

00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:08,799
[Cheering and applause].

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,799
[Music].

00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:10,799
* Everybody sing - oh, baby!

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:11,799
* Oh, never, ever ... some day.

00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:12,799
* Some day.

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,799
* Some day, woah ... * Never forget where you're coming from.

00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:14,799
* Never pretend that it's all real.

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,799
* Some day, it will be someone else's dream ...

00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:16,799
* Never forget where you're coming from.

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,799
* Never pretend that it's all real.

00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,479
* Some day, it will be someone else's dream, woaaah.

00:20:19,479 --> 00:21:16,259
* And we reach so high.

00:21:16,259 --> 00:22:55,639
* And we learn each day and night.

00:22:55,639 --> 00:24:06,629
* And it feels so young.

00:24:06,629 --> 00:24:49,220
* And we... more.

00:24:49,220 --> 00:25:31,809
