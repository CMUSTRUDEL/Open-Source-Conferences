Title: Animations — Learning from Cartoons by Martin Sonnenholzer | JSConf EU 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-19
Playlist: JSConf EU 2019
Description: 
	With CSS animations and web animations moving elements became possible in the browser. But how one moves an object in such a way that it appears “correct” for the human eye? How does a motion feel natural? These and similar questions confronted the artists who brought cartoons to life as early as 1906. Let’s take a look behind the scenes and see how drawings learned to walk and what we can learn from it for animations in the browser.

00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:13,750
Whoa.

00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,830
So many people.

00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,990
Did you see Jessica's talk about comics?

00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,190
Did you like it?

00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,190
Yeah.

00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,280
I like comics as well.

00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,340
And a lot of cartoons.

00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,910
They are company for me for almost my entire life.

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,930
When I was a kid, I was sitting at the TV every Sunday morning and watching cartoons

00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,360
for hours.

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,050
My parents didn't like it, but I loved the cartoons.

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:45,870
Later on, when I went to school, I started drawing little characters in my math books

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,870
in the corner.

00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,239
And every time you flip the page your characters came to life.

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,239
It was really amazing.

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,350
So, my name is Martin.

00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,910
I'm a principal project engineer.

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:04,790
I organize a conference based around Angular.

00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:10,420
I later on used my math books for the original purpose and studied math.

00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,190
I love math and the possibilities.

00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,780
I and love cats.

00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:22,640
That's probably the reason why all over the Internet my cat's face is my avatar for Twitter,

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,380
GitHub, everything.

00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,770
And my cat's nickname, Chaos Monster became my Twitter handle.

00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,740
If you see a cat like this, it's probably me.

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,420
I started as a backend developer.

00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:43,960
And at some time in the last ten years I switched to the frontend and became a JavaScript developer.

00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,509
I did that because I was passionate about the UX possibilities that you can have.

00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:56,140
All the user interaction is most possible in the browser when AngularJS 1.0.7 came out

00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,140
years ago.

00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,780
And I was like, yes!

00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:03,130
I want to do everything in the browser because I want to be close to the user.

00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,439
I want to have interaction with them.

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,299
But I was really, really afraid of animations.

00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:13,279
Every time my product owner came to me and said something like, hey, can you move that

00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,569
from the left to the right?

00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:18,930
I was like, don't you think it would be better if it suddenly pops up on the right side of

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,930
the screen!

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,120
It's way better, it's way better and I don't have to do animations.

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:38,019
The time passed by and I watched documentation by Studio Ghibli, creating the moving castle.

00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:47,569
And this was about how they made walking animations a smooth and natural experience for everyone.

00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:54,400
And I was like, all the time I learned from different domains from other professions.

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,779
Why don't I look at cartoons and can see what I can learn about animations from watching

00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:03,799
cartoons and learning how they do it?

00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,950
So, if you do a little bit of research in field, you are not able to get around this

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,769
book, called the illusion of life.

00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:14,989
It's by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnson.

00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:19,400
Both are animators at Disney.

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,590
And in the '80s when they released that book, they boiled down all the knowledge that Disney

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,799
acquired in the last not 50 decades five decades.

00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:35,370
They did the amazing animation movies to 12 principles of animation.

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,499
And I thought to myself, after read them, they are really amazing.

00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:44,349
I have a lot that I learned from that and boiled it down to the eight principles of

00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,010
web animation.

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,159
Starting with squash and stretch.

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,699
If you think about a ball, a tennis ball, for example.

00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:58,719
And if you think how a tennis ball would behave if you throw it on the floor and how it would

00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,219
bounce back into the air.

00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:08,069
You think about it, it wouldn't really change its form, its shape.

00:04:08,069 --> 00:04:11,319
It would look something like this.

00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,489
But that doesn't feel really good.

00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:15,859
Because you can't feel the speed of the ball.

00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:22,430
You can't feel the impact of the ball on the floor and you can't feel how the ball falls

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,810
jumps back into the air.

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,240
So, what you can do instead is doing stretch and squash.

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,340
You use stretch to show speed.

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,389
To show how the ball gets accelerated.

00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:42,610
And you use squash to show how the ball gets pulled and pushed into the floor.

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,129
And how the energy goes back into speed afterwards.

00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:53,629
And you cannot only use that to create a ball that bounces off a floor, but you can also

00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:57,500
use it to create a feeling for material.

00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,169
This box that is created with key frames in CSS feels really squashy.

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,039
It feels like bouncy.

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,150
It gets adjectives.

00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,840
It's not just a box.

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,639
So, you have to keep a few things in mind when you do that.

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,169
For example, you have to think about the volume.

00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:20,439
The volume of the object should not change because your brain recognizes if you're just

00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:24,430
changing the volume of the object by squashing or stretching it.

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,820
And it feels really off if you do that.

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:33,439
And you can use squash and stretch to give objects weight and a feeling of speed.

00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,110
And also, to give them material.

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,030
The feeling on how the material works.

00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:45,020
The second principle is anticipation.

00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,340
If you look at this stick figure, you would think, okay, what happens next?

00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,300
You would not expect it to just fly off in the air like this.

00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,499
It doesn't feel right, right?

00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:02,909
What you actually want to do is you want it to bend the knees and then go up.

00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:09,699
Because with that, you give the view of this animation, the feeling that something will

00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:10,699
happen.

00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:12,650
The user can anticipate what happens next.

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:18,639
If I'm going down and I'm jumping up, you will expect me to jump up because you've seen

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,759
me going to the floor and you expect something to happen here.

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:30,030
And you can use the same in the browser when you do some animations before you do a bigger

00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,030
animation.

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,110
Before you show that you can drag and drop it.

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,600
Also, really important what I did not do here, but what can be really important for anticipation

00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,699
is the timing.

00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:47,780
So, if you slowly start winding up before you do a really fast throw of a ball, this

00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,879
is also important.

00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:49,950
Not only the winding up.

00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,039
But also, the speed of how I do it.

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,729
The third principle is staging.

00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:00,460
Frank and Ollie talked said it's like that.

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,189
If you have a presentation of an idea, it should be completely and unmistakably clear

00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:08,569
what you want to do.

00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:15,669
Don't irritate your user or viewer by pointing them in a certain direction and then doing

00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,919
something totally different.

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,009
Look at the stage and all those arrows.

00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:28,150
I focus you on one point of the screen.

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,939
Doesn't have to be the center of the screen but focus your view on one point of the screen

00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:40,039
and you expect something to happen here like a character appearing like a magician.

00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:42,900
And use that technique wherever you do it.

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,419
If it's on the left or on the right, just use it to make it clear for the user where

00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,249
something will appear, or something will happen.

00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:54,580
The same goes for when we are in the western culture.

00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:59,389
We expect something that comes from the left to the right to appear on stage.

00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:04,699
If it goes from the center to the right, we think it disappears from stage and you would

00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:08,749
drop it down to the bottom of the stage.

00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:10,880
You think it will never come back.

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:13,930
Keep those things in mind because they are part of staging.

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,090
When you look at this green diff.

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:22,400
And I want you to focus on that diff.

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,990
Now I told you to focus on the diff.

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,430
Imagine you're a user and you're in a browser and I want you as a developer to focus on

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,430
the diff.

00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:35,949
What I can do is I can make the background opaque and do a little bit of animation to

00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,590
focus on the green diff.

00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,590
Maybe it's a greet button.

00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:45,560
Maybe I want you to save that form because otherwise all your data will be gone.

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,720
Number four.

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,851
I have a little bit of a problem with that because in animation this is a really, really

00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:56,380
important thing to do.

00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:04,730
But I wasn't sure how to translate it to the web browser.

00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,839
Let's go a little bit back.

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:14,820
If you have a motion in a movie or an anime, you have a lot of pictures and those pictures

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,980
slightly change from frame to frame.

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,870
Normally we talk about 12 to 24 frames per second.

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,340
If you're a gamer, you want to run on 60 frames per second.

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:33,320
Meaning you want to have so many images that slightly differentiate to each other in each

00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,820
second.

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:42,370
And back in the days, in the 1980s and before that, before this was a thing, all of those

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:45,589
frames, all of those images, had to be drawn by hand.

00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:51,880
So, people were sitting there and drawing the same image over and over again and just

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,490
slightly make a change to the previous one.

00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,720
And here comes the technique of straight ahead.

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:07,720
If you just change the image just slightly without any concept or any story about it,

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,940
you just create something that is randomly moving like fire or rain or explosions.

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,970
This is a really great technique to do that.

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,779
But if you want to tell a story, you need a concept, a story board behind that.

00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:26,149
And for that you think about, what is my first pose?

00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:29,040
And then you think about will be my last pose?

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,199
And you think about, what poses are in between those two poses that are important for me

00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:36,680
to show my audience?

00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,949
So, the audience gets an understanding of the movement we want to have.

00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:46,760
And then you create those key frames and afterwards you just add more and more frames by using

00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,690
the straight-ahead technique.

00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,019
And then at the end you have a movement.

00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:58,329
And with CSS we have CSS Transform, we have scale, rotate, you name it.

00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:01,730
And we also have CSS keyframes.

00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,170
And this is where my mind just popped.

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,699
I have those poses.

00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:06,790
Those are key frames.

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:11,519
They are frames that are really important for how the animation would work.

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,830
Same goes for web animation API.

00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:21,279
And if you look at keyframes, and this is no change to how web animations work with

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,310
the web animation API, you create your initial pose you create your final pose, and if you

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:33,360
want to, you create a few poses in between that are important to tell the story of how

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,779
your object moves and then you let the browser just fill in all the other thousands of frames

00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,110
that you might want to have.

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,730
The fifth principle of animation frames is overlapping action.

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:54,839
If I have the pod and tell you I'm moving from the right to the left.

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,630
You would imagine the flower pod to move and you would imagine the flower to move.

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:07,750
Follow through and overlapping means that you can drag secondary animations like the

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,830
flower.

00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:12,779
Because the flower takes a little bit longer than the flowerpot until it realizes that

00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:13,779
something is moving.

00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:20,050
And it takes a little bit longer to that's just physics to realize that it stopped.

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:24,190
And this is called follow through and overlapping action.

00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,790
And if you look at the browser, I found this great article.

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:34,829
Get the slides afterwards and I highly recommend to read that article.

00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:38,699
That mentions how to fix drag and drop by using a little bit of math.

00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:42,100
You see why I was into that article.

00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:48,740
And what they do is they use the mouse movement speed and translate it into the tilde of the

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,740
dragged object.

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,790
The faster the mouse moves, the higher the angle of the object, the tildes.

00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:01,040
And if the mouse moves slowly, the tilde goes back to a horizontal stage.

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,990
And this makes all your drag and drop animations feel way more natural.

00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:14,060
Way more like I want to drag and drop everything here because it's awesome.

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,340
Slow in and slow out.

00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,050
I read that principle and I was like, yes.

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,399
I totally understand it.

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,000
I know how this will work in the browser.

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,650
Just for you to present how it works, slow in and slow out means if I'm starting running

00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,230
over there, I won't start with full speed.

00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:37,699
And if I'm stopping at end of the stage, I won't stop at full speed.

00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:39,480
I will slow down.

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,570
This is a natural movement.

00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,279
I will show it to you just for the sake that you see it.

00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,470
[ Laughter ] I'm walking very fast.

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,819
I'm slowing down.

00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:49,139
And back.

00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,319
I start fast, slowing down.

00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:53,440
Yeah.

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,949
I did my sport for today.

00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:01,350
[ Applause ] I would never imagine that someone claps when

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,660
I'm running.

00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:07,589
And we have the same thing in the browser.

00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:09,839
We call them easing functions.

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,579
We call them busy functions.

00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:19,310
If you have an ease in and ease out function on your animation, it comes to it at a faster

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:25,360
speed and slows down before it's at its final stage.

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,889
And if you do a linear transformation, it will have the same speed from the beginning

00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:32,390
until the end.

00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,389
And this feels really mechanical.

00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:36,220
Not natural like in and out.

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,100
And mechanical is something that we really don't have that often.

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,480
Even a car that is mechanical would slowly start.

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,769
Only things like bullets would be really fast from the beginning.

00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:52,660
Secondary actions.

00:14:52,660 --> 00:15:01,279
This is about how your main action, your main animation, needs sometimes support so you

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,860
can tell a story.

00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,440
And for that you need a concept.

00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:11,279
And, for example, if I'm walking over that side of the stage, my arms are really stiff.

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,980
And I'm walking and you see the walking animation.

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,980
Imagine animation.

00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,230
And it feels really stiff and really unnatural.

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:24,920
So, what I actually do when I walk and probably all of you if you're walking, you move your

00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
upper body.

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,920
You move your arms.

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Okay.

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
I'm a little over accelerating now.

00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,170
But you move your body with that.

00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:36,550
And the movement of the arms and the shoulders are the secondary action and they support

00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:42,480
the main animation, meaning the walking animation.

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,570
I found this really, really, really awesome CSS animation by Andrew Wong.

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,269
And I don't want you to focus on the walking animation.

00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:55,069
I want you to focus on the secondary animations here.

00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:58,810
Meaning the clouds in the back, the signs inform back.

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,949
They are secondary animations that help to give the animation depth.

00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:09,620
That help to give your relation to how fast this object is moving.

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,220
And this helps you to understand the main animation.

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,740
So, secondary animations are really, really good when it comes to how to improve your

00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,360
main animation.

00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,899
And with that I'm coming to the eighth principle called appealing.

00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:31,769
Frank and Ollie just said, "Make your animations appeal.

00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:36,220
Make the viewer feel like I love this character.

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,379
I totally dig this character, how it works and moves."

00:16:39,379 --> 00:16:43,560
And I want to make that my conclusion as well.

00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:50,519
So, here's my conclusion of looking at the 12 principles of animation by Frank and Ollie.

00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,120
And how to translate them to the web.

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,899
First, use animations to improve your user experience.

00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,230
Because motion can tell a story.

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,839
And to tell a story, you need a storybook.

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,940
Make yourself comfortable with the idea to think about, where does my animation start?

00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,950
What is in between of my animation?

00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,590
And where does my animation stop?

00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:17,360
Make this concept, not only for one animation, but for the entirety of your website.

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,150
Think about how all the animations can work together.

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:28,380
And please, don't overdo your animations because if you do too much, and it doesn't feel really

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,380
right.

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,920
And last but not least, have fun.

00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,000
Have fun with doing animations because animations are great.

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,230
And don't be afraid as I was.

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,340
Because there's so much content about how to do animations.

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:49,850
Look at 12 principles of animations and learn from over a century of animations on how to

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:52,870
really do great animations.

00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,870
Thank you for listening to me.

00:17:53,870 --> 00:18:07,170
