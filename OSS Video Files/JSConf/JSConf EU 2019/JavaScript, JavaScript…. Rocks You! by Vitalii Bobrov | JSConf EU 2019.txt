Title: JavaScript, JavaScript…. Rocks You! by Vitalii Bobrov | JSConf EU 2019

Description: 
	After so many years sitting with the computer you can take your old scratched Les Paul or Stratocaster from the case and fill all the space around with warm riffs. I’m going to show how to transform the code into Kirk Hammett’s wah-wah, Stevie Ray Vaughan’s overdrive and Kurt Cobain’s distortion. You’ll learn how to parse audio input in real-time using JavaScript and the Web Audio API.

I’ll be jamming live on stage with my guitar to demo every code example and we’ll also use WebRTC to jam with friends across the world! After this talk, you will be familiar with the principles behind pedal sound effects and how to create them in code. Let’s rock the Web!
