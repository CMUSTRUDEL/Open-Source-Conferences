Description: 
	PWAs are now installable on every mobile and desktop OSs, but there is a lot of new things since last year we need to do to create a successful experience. We will start understanding the App Lifecycle on every OS including new APIs, the limitations on iOS and how to deal with them, and how WebAPK works on Android. We will mention challenges on desktop PWAs, including multi-window management and we will finally cover distribution channels, including new DOM events to improve analytics, how to create a custom Install experience, and how to distribute the app in the store.
