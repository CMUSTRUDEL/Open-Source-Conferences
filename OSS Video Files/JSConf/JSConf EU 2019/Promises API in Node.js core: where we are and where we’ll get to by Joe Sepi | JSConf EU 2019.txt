Description: 
	Currently only ‘fs’ and ‘dns’ have an experimental promise api in Node core. People LOL at node.js core modules for still using the callback pattern. I could launch into a bunch of puns here but instead I’ll just say the current status is sad but fixable. Where are we? What do we need to do? How can you help?
