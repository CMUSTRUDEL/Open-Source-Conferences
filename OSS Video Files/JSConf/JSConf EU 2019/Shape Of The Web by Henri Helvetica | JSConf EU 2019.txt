Title: Shape Of The Web by Henri Helvetica | JSConf EU 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-06
Playlist: JSConf EU 2019
Description: 
	Until 1992, the web was largely textual, reserved almost exclusively to academia, with the charm of searching for library books via card catalogs.

The sea change came when a browser allowed for both text and images to now be displayed in the viewport. Despite some vehement opposition, this was described as the “gateway to the riches of the internet”.

This was a technological advancement that some had wagered would further fuel more advacement. We now have seen technologies like APIs, PWAs, DevTools and many more.

“The Shape Of The Web” is about both accomplishments and challenges that lay in past, present and future of the web - from its technologies employed and its employed technologists.

>> Man, oh, man.

00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,290
I know everybody's been looking forward to this, not supposedly seeing me, but it's the

00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,290
end.

00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,470
So I'm going to try to make this as quick as possible.

00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,539
I don't know, I guess, will my slides show eventually?

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,050
I sure hope so.

00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,900
Shout out to the AV people, because they're the best!

00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,529
[Applause].

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,800
All right.

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,300
The slides are supposed to show any don't know.

00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,200
I hope so, because I'm not going to be able to act this out the whole time.

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,330
There we go!

00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:51,080
So, quickly, I mean, I realise that I saw a speaker yesterday, and she kind of like

00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,010
matched her slides with her outfit, so I thought I might do the same.

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,760
And so, if everything goes right, I'm going to disappear!

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,690
And I'm going to re-appear again.

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,680
It's like camouflage!

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,310
Okay, it worked.

00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,280
Anyway, I thought that was kind of funny.

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,560
And you're going to find out I'm a bit of a comedian.

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,391
We will start this with a joke.

00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,391
Is that cool?

00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:17,391
Can we have a joke?

00:01:17,391 --> 00:01:18,391
All right.

00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:20,570
How many JavaScripters here?

00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,330
I mean, it's kind of funny that I don't see all the hands up, but that's cool.

00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:36,380
So, imagine if naughty by nature went to the TC39 meeting.

00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,320
Hip-hop hurray!

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,170
Hey - oh, you didn't like that.

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,560
It's all good!

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,890
Anyhow, we're going to get things cracking.

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,490
My name's Henri.

00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,380
My last name isn't Helvetica.

00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,460
I thought it sounded cool.

00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,700
I did anyways.

00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,480
People might recognise me from my nays which is the avatar that I kind of like to.

00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,250
I'm from the greatest city on the planet called Toronto.

00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,319
It's super multi-cultural, and I didn't realise it until I left, and I was like, man, Toronto

00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,040
is actually amazing.

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,710
If you're in the area, check us out.

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,620
Here is something you may not have known about Toronto.

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,420
Anyone own a Commodore 64 back in the day?

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,849
Commodore was founded in Toronto.

00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,760
No doubt.

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,879
So we're going to get things going.

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,280
Welcome to the Shape of the Web.

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,709
It's a talk I thought about a while back, and sort of just to talk about where the web

00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,549
has gone.

00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:45,670
A lot of good things have happened.

00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:51,189
A lot of technology was used to make things really sort of like friendly and - like the

00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:56,760
great user experiences that we try to create, but I also felt that the technologists that

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,980
were involved were amazing but some who may have been left behind so we will have a conversation

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,980
about that.

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,150
It's really just a conversation.

00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,640
So let's get cracking.

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,349
Now, first off, I want to thank JSConf EU for having me.

00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:16,319
I've been watching this conference from a distance on Twitter and look at the photos

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,459
like this is amazing!

00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:19,939
Look at the screen!

00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:22,349
No, seriously, look at the screen!

00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:31,499
I mean, I only an-wide at home, and I think that this ratio is like 15:2 which is bananas.

00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:33,209
Talk about neck pains.

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:36,099
DevTools would be amazing on this screen, by the way!

00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:42,669
First of all, X, ten years, and I come from music, so I could appreciate what they've

00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,669
done here, the set-up.

00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,590
I mean, it's absolutely elaborate, but I love that they've done this for a tech conference,

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:55,049
so can we please give JSConf a round of applause as well!

00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,529
[Applause].

00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,519
All right, that's enough!

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,170
I'm going to get jealous!

00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,760
So, they've been around ten years, and I was thinking to myself, like, you know, I was

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,870
kind of writing this talk up, adding some notes, ten years.

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,760
Where was I ten years ago?

00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,439
Like I said, I came from music.

00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:15,769
I was able to pull this photo out.

00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:20,100
I used to do lectures with the Red Bull Music Academy which is actually based out of Germany,

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,690
and I was doing a lecture here with Flying Lotus, a big deal for me at the time, ten

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,070
years a week from today.

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,250
It's pretty on point and on brand.

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,940
But the web.

00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,200
The web's actually 30 years old.

00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,950
And I was thinking to myself, like, man, 30 years old, that's kind of like a long time.

00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:47,780
And I don't know where you were 30 years ago, but I remember when I first accessed the web,

00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,510
the first thing I thought of was this.

00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,380
And I don't know how many of you were able to sort of like be around this time where

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,530
you had to get a modem, and you made those telephone sounds, and that stuff, just to

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,220
get on the internet?

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,470
But it was great because I discovered a lot of things, and there was one place I used

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,540
to hang out - who remembers newsgroups here?

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,540
There we go.

00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,340
This is where I hung out a lot, rec.hipohop and yes, I'm going to talk about hip-hop with

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,700
people I don't know.

00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,630
This is the first time you start to connect with people from all parts of the world who

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,260
had access to the net.

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,100
Another thing that I did, as I had more and more access, I used to use search engines,

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,750
like everyone else, and who remembers Alta Vista.

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,750
There we go.

00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,560
I was a big fan.

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,890
When that vanished, I was so sad.

00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:50,060
But, what I also did was I started to surf the web, and I was a big Netscape Navigator

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,510
and Communicator fan.

00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:59,860
Actually, there were a few browsers around thereafter, but this is the one that I was

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,211
using, and the big part about this one is when it was released, this is what one of

00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:09,860
the early quotes from Andriesson himself, "This software is going to to change everything."

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,930
And it did.

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:23,090
Another quote came, things started exploding with the invention of the browser because

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,860
suddenly the internet was accessible to the average person.

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,870
And I mean, average, we will say sort of like model-class person who had a computer and

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,110
a modem, but it definitely opened things up.

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:41,210
You started to have that delight and discovery that I like to talk about.

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:47,151
When Netscape came out, it was extremely popular, 65 million users in 18 months, and part of

00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:54,670
the reason was the fact that as much as the early web was, like, text, it was very academic,

00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:00,450
they were actually able to bring images into the fold here, and what then happened is that

00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,100
when we were surfing the net, we were accustomed to the lay-out text, images.

00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,240
It was reading the paper.

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,110
And believe it or not, there was debate as to whether or not they were going to bring

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,340
images on to the web.

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:20,530
Some mild arguments, and the belief was that if they brought images on, there would be

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,380
like this onslaught of pornography.

00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,000
And I'm here to say that they were absolutely wrong.

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,440
Right?

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:37,460
But, the fact is, for real, though, they believe that by opening it up, adding some images,

00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,580
and letting people sort of expert, it was going to drive the web forward, and it actually

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,580
did.

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,430
Now, today, we are 4.3 billion users online.

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,520
I think that's phenomenal, but believe it or not, there's still room to grow.

00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,010
And, you know, you might wonder that's an explosive growth.

00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,400
What sort of drove that?

00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,350
Well, this is kind of it right here.

00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,570
This young lady's on a mobile phone.

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,080
I believe this is nothing that the they expected to see at the time.

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,460
This is like mid-1990s.

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,560
Who thought you were going to have a mobile device and be able to surf the web just as

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,430
powerfully as they did back then?

00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:24,510
So this has allowed us to do a lot of different things.

00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,460
We've been able to be very productive in life.

00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,070
So what have we been able to do with sort of like little friction?

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,030
Pretty much everything.

00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:41,210
I mean, we can make money, we manage money online, we can go on a date, we can go buy

00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,770
clothes.

00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:48,280
We can actually go rent a car to take your date out.

00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:54,710
We can order fish, we can listen to one of my favourite songs called Fish, and we could

00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:00,700
actually get phishing emails from African Princes, right?

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:09,150
But all jokes aside, man, we can actually read comics and make them accessible, comic

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,740
books, shot-out to Jessica.

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,270
[Applause].

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,330
No doubt.

00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:22,250
For all the people that were trying to bring online, we could actually go offline.

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,240
This is what technology has allowed us to do.

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,440
Which is absolutely needed.

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,680
By the way, I downloaded the offline map for Berlin because I was not going to pay those

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,680
fees.

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,070
But we could actually create music in the browser as well.

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:42,160
Shout-out to Live :JS in the building!

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,610
This is what the technology has allowed us to do, very important.

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,490
This is the shape of the web as we see it growing right before our eyes.

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:59,480
So, the technology has been extremely important in getting these sort of things done.

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,740
And this is where we are going to sort of like see even more technology allow us to

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,860
do greater things thereafter.

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,000
Now, what about the technologist?

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,380
We may have been playing some amazing chords on some of the devices that we've seen out

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,380
there, you know, from keyboards to the MIDI controllers, but, unfortunately, there's been

00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:29,010
a little bit of discord as well, and we're going to get into a few items that have been

00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,260
bothering me a little.

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,930
Let's talk about technology.

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:40,610
There's an ongoing refrain, we know exactly what is going on, and it saddens me.

00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:47,460
I mean, you just need to open up Twitter and wait five seconds before it hits you, and

00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,080
I think that's sad.

00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:57,420
It's been long discussed, you know, what needs to be done to retain talent, to attract talent,

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,320
and we still go out and sort of like trip over some of the main issues.

00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,310
I mean, what do they talk about?

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,029
What do women talk about when they leave the industry?

00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:12,130
The lack of career growth, salary, poor management, and, you know, when I read poor management,

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,940
I know exactly what they mean.

00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,580
That's just being polite.

00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,910
And the other part is actually what scares me, because the other, I feel, I know exactly

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,240
what is going on, but, again, it's being polite and not calling people out, because other

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,089
to me means this.

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:35,290
It's not fit for print, but we know exactly what is happening.

00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:41,640
To me, that's absolutely not the way or the shape of the web needs to take.

00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:50,720
Further on I'm going to share a little story, something I did did a few years ago.

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,540
International men's day happens once a year, March 8th.

00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,670
And I got together with some buddies, I'm like let's rap about this.

00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:03,240
I want to put an event for women to come out and enjoy themselves and listen to other women

00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,020
in the industry.

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,050
This goes back to something I tried about ten years ago in music.

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:13,440
I really wanted to do a show with female producers.

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,750
I work in a certain pack of sound, and I knew there were producers out there, but when I

00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:22,970
went knocking on some doors, I couldn't find any sponsors, so it got a little tough, but

00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,300
I never forgot that.

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,760
When I had an opportunity to do something again, I did.

00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:36,360
So, every year we put together in event called IWDTO, International Men's Day, and this is

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,480
a picture of 2015, and we've been doing it for five years now.

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,510
On the right to left, we have Lisa, who worked at the White House, an Obama hire, by the

00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,590
way.

00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:57,190
The lady in the middle, someone who I look up to very much, she works in performance.

00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,160
She goes by the name of Tammy Everts who works at SpeedCurve.

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,020
An amazing person.

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,430
You need to follow her if you can.

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,940
On the left, I'm not sure if she is here, Mina Markham.

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:15,360
I would be happy for her to come down and share her story.

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,101
The most important part is the fact that, like I say, we do this every year, and it

00:13:19,101 --> 00:13:25,791
warms my heart to be able to help out in a way - I might not be the best ally - but I

00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:28,350
feel I'm doing something to make things work.

00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,100
Why do I want to to this?

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:36,860
I want to make sure that we have moments like these, you know?

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,779
[Applause].

00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,870
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,130
Katie, we know exactly what happened there.

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,680
A great moment, even though shortly after we saw the trolls come out and sort of question

00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,470
her.

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:58,300
Margaret Hamilton, as we know, coined the term "software engineering" but right there

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:04,990
she is sitting next to the stack of paper that was essentially her sort of like tracing,

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,230
or helping get the rockets up to the moon.

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,080
But one of my favourite photos is this one right here.

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:18,330
This is the Indian space research organisation.

00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,220
And they're having a ball right there.

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,220
Why?

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:30,360
Well, they were the fourth team to ever get a satellite around Mars.

00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:37,100
But they were the first to do it on the first try, not NASA, not the European Space Agency,

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,850
and not the Russian Space Agency, but the agency out of India.

00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,740
As you can tell, the team is made up of several women.

00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,900
It's actually a short documentary on that.

00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,110
I will be more than happy to put the link out.

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:54,460
So I want to see of month of these happening, these moments taking place.

00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:01,540
The big thing is that the comment thread between the three photos that I showed, I mean, they

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:09,100
all had CS backgrounds, degrees, and what not, which brings me to my next malaise, the

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,130
CS versus non-CS beef.

00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,340
Any CS people in the building?

00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,640
I mean, raise your hand.

00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,910
I've got love for you.

00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,020
You know what I mean?

00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,330
How did this happen?

00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,370
I really don't know.

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,800
But, I kind of got triggered by this one tweet, and this person's going to go unidentified,

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,310
reasons why computer science degree is a bad eat.

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,310
Idea.

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,310
What?

00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,050
Money, time, CS can be so boring.

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,870
I thought to myself that was irresponsible because it came from someone who has a large

00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:44,080
platform, and I actually questioned him on it, but I'm not going to get into that.

00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:50,300
But, I will get into this, and make some noise when you see a photo that sort of like you

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,710
recognise the image.

00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,250
[Applause].

00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,780
Okay.

00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,860
All right.

00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,750
Does anyone know what this is?

00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,790
Okay.

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,750
I'm go the to get into that, but does anyone know what this is?

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,750
Okay.

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,330
So, let me go back.

00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,100
Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment - DOPE.

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,010
It was the language that preceded BASIC.

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:24,310
Why is it important?

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:35,220
The author of BASIC, a math wizard worked at Dartmouth, believed that he could get non-STEM

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,950
students at the university to get into programming.

00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,960
And he basically soldiered on trying to make things work.

00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,160
Eventually, BASIC did become a language, and how did it happen?

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:56,290
Because he got a lot of non-STEM students to work along and contribute to the venture.

00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,310
And BASIC was born.

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:04,699
That's very important, because even as a non-STEM student you're in BASIC, this is a tweet from

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:09,699
Brian Love's words boom!

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:13,100
I thought this was so true.

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:19,250
You needed to see this because you don't need a CS degree to be successful, but it doesn't

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,600
mean by having a CS degree you're not going to be.

00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:30,880
In fact, John's daughter mentioned this: BASIC was basically an incredible project of what

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,780
is now called an aligned team.

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,630
I thought that was wild.

00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,010
But speaking of CS, I want to talk about something else real quick.

00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,280
Does anyone know who this is?

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
Probably not.

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:50,620
Her name's Lena Soderburg, and most of the CS people, and if you're in performance, you

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,700
might know this performance, Lena?

00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,900
We know someone here knows?

00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,920
But you might recognise her when I do this.

00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:06,730
Now, this is the photo that's been internationally accepted as the test image when you do any

00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:12,010
kind of image processing, compressing, et cetera, et cetera, which is totally cool.

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,549
But here's what is not so cool.

00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:19,160
This is where it came from.

00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,620
I remember doing some research one day, and I could not believe it.

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:28,270
We've been using an image from Playboy for 40-some years.

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,480
Do you know that two million images are uploaded to the web daily?

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Did I say two million?

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
I meant two million images.

00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:42,150
They're uploaded to the web daily, but somehow we have the photo of a centre fold as the

00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,250
test image for image compression.

00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:50,780
You know, for a second, I was thinking, it's the 1940s, we're going to get over it, whatever.

00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:53,040
It's going to fade.

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,490
This happened in 2018.

00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:03,720
Someone presented a talk and just like talked about centre folds - 2018.

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,230
How are you supposed to retain talent?

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:11,010
How are you supposed to attract talent when you have this kind of comportment out in the

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,010
wild?

00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:15,110
This is not the shape of the web to come.

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:20,290
And with that being said, I mean, I tweeted this out just moments before I got on stage.

00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:27,110
I will ask anyone who wishes to do so to vote whether or not the Lena image should remain

00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,650
the standard in image processing.

00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:38,100
Now, we kind of know what this means, the World Wide Web.

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,690
A developer I know likes to wall it the "wealthy Western web".

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,820
Okay, I'm good, because I think this started early.

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:54,510
I'm watching the clock and this flashing president the wealthy Western web, because we like to

00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:02,090
design and create apps for the West, but what if I told you this is the list of the top-ten

00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,020
internet users by country?

00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,040
Okay?

00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:17,820
What if I told you the greatest growth by country looks like this: now, these two lists

00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:26,480
are the reason why documentation is important, and it's important to trans late.

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
Think about this.

00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:34,419
Remember that German spoke yesterday who said, he spoken a few times on stage but it was

00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:36,630
his first time speaking in English.

00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,450
First time.

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:44,100
And you have developers out there that are trying to get in the fold, but documentation's

00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,610
not in their native language.

00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,240
That's something we definitely have to look into.

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Why?

00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,680
Because you have situations like this.

00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,710
And this sort of caused a little bit of kerfuffle on Twitter.

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,380
And I was watching it.

00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,570
And this tweet came out.

00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:10,570
I'm not going to name the person, because I didn't ask whether or not I could use it,

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:16,480
but this happened thereafter.

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,650
Same tweet.

00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:27,770
Now, we are talking about, you know, creating an inclusive community, an inclusive web.

00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:35,110
I mean, I don't know how you're going to get more inclusive than having documentation translated

00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:41,860
properly so that other developers can have some input.

00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:48,179
Think about your framework that may sort of like mature so much faster because you have

00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:54,360
contributions from all over the globe because they have documentation in their native tongue.

00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,540
I think it's very important to remember.

00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:02,200
That being said, what is next in 2020?

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
I don't know.

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,810
I think we will still be developers, and we're all still going to love the web and go to

00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,710
conferences, and network, we're all still going to have great discoveries.

00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,100
I mean, there's so much web we've yet to discover.

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:21,490
There are so many more people that we can help the light in discovery.

00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:26,960
I mean, there are so many more applications we have yet to engineer.

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:34,809
People, neighbours, so many people we can learn from, experiences, you know?

00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:39,880
Just is that we can make tweaks to our applications.

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,760
At the end of the day, I know we are good people by default.

00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,340
I mean, I truly believe that.

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:51,760
I don't think that we are born with, like, sort of like evil within us - at least I sure

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,940
hope not.

00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,750
My hope is that we keep it as you have.

00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,850
I mean, we get maybe one day to enjoy another JSConf EU, because I would love to come back.

00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:58,850
And, with that being said, thank you very much for your time.

00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,850
Come visit me in Toronto.

00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:00,850
And let's party tonight!

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,850
[Cheering and applause].

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,850
Exit stage left.

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:03,850
I don't know!

00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,850
Is anyone coming!

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,850
Is there a gong I'm supposed to hit?

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:06,850
[Applause].

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,850
>> I've got it, thanks.

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:08,850
I'm just joking.

00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,850
Thanks, everyone, sorry.

00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,850
We would like to thank everyone for coming.

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:11,850
And we would like to start with - we're going to thank a lot of people now.

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:12,850
We want to thank all our speakers.

00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,850
Please raise the roof for the speakers while all the speakers come on stage to receive

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,850
your roof-raising, everyone, please!

00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,850
All the speakers, please come on stage!

00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:16,850
[Cheering and applause].

00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:17,850
All right, so, ... [Applause].

00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,850
So we have had a meeting about this, and I'm glad you can see all the speakers and you

00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,850
can do another applause, but then I need you to go down for theatrical reasons which I

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:20,850
totally screwed up, very sorry.

00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,850
One more big applause for all the speakers.

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:22,850
Thank you very much!

00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:23,850
[Cheering and applause].

00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:24,850
Now, we all need to go again so people can see the slides we've prepared.

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,850
Sorry!

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,850
>> That's the main problem.

00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,850
We have to ask speakers to leave the stage again.

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:28,850
We need the screen!

00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,850
Sorry.

00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,850
Move to the side again?

00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,850
Thank you.

00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,850
Sorry for the confusion.

00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,850
>> There was a meeting, and we talked about it in Slack, and we got confused, mostly me.

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,850
It end like it started, with at least some misunderstanding!

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,850
>> Very well prepared, yes, thank you.

00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,850
Please, all the emcees and stage managers, please stand up and receive your well-deserved

00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,850
applause!

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,850
[Cheering and applause].

00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:39,850
And the next group of persons and companies we want to thank you are our sponsors.

00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:40,850
Many of them joined us for more than one year, some of them for almost ten years, and we

00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:41,850
think that is worth a round of applause for our sponsors!

00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:42,850
[Applause].

00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,850
>> People working at a company who is sponsoring us currently, please stand up for a second!

00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,850
Woo!

00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:45,850
[Applause].

00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:46,850
And also, sponsorship is our scholarship supporter list.

00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,850
That's the main reason why we need the screen, because this list is really huge.

00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,850
Please, everybody, stand up who is on that list, and everybody else should give a warm

00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:49,850
applause to all these people who made it possible to include 150 people to our conference at

00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:50,850
no cost.

00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,850
[Cheering and applause].

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:52,850
And also, we want to say thank you to the company called Attribute, who is bringing

00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:53,850
all these parts together.

00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:54,850
Attribute with Bjorn, Juliana, Andre, Philip and the whole team is planning this event

00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,850
to us and sets everything up with us, and they're at least co responsible for everything

00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,850
that you see here, and they're full of ideas, and helped us growing over the years.

00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:57,850
They joined us seven years ago, I think, and it's a really great collaboration with them

00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:58,850
so far, so thank you, Attribute, Bjorn, Juliana, and everybody else!

00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,850
[Applause].

00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:00,850
The other companies that are here are Wecap.

00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:01,850
Julia is doing our mood videos, Julia is doing 50 per cent of the photos alongside Shahin

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,850
who is doing the rest of our photos.

00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,850
We want to thank the right?

00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,850
Arena for hosting us for the last three years, the Textile Press with us for three or four

00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,850
years.

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,850
We had frozen yoghurt, and first time #nailconf.

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,850
We would like to thank Harald and his team for the great food from the last three days.

00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,850
We would like to thank you White Coat Captioning who is captioning every stage at every time

00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:09,850
of day and night via Skype calls set up from all these stages.

00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:10,850
We want to thank you the Bahn for the coffee, and thank you to serve you for the Wi-Fi which

00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:11,850
made roughly 200 megabits per second on average.

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,850
We want to thank you for childcare, the team from Kids' Event, the medical response team

00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,850
which helped us one or two times for difficult situations this time, and we would like to

00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:14,850
say thank you for those building the stuff where you're sitting here.

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:15,850
Thank you!

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:16,850
[Applause].

00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,850
>> Oh, wait?

00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,850
I can already see what is happening ... . Oh, my God!

00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,850
That wasn't planned!

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,850
[Cheering and applause].

00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,850
>> I've joined the luxurious land of post-conference organisers, it's fantastic.

00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,850
Can you all hear me?

00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:23,850
Yes!

00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:24,850
There we go!

00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:25,850
Reaching out from the beyond to welcome all of the JSConf EU organisers into the happy,

00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,850
happy zone thereafter from - can everyone give them a tremendous round of applause,

00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:27,850
because tomorrow morning, they wake up without worrying about yet another conference!

00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:28,850
Congratulations, everybody!

00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:29,850
[Cheering and applause].

00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,850
Make them embarrassingly happy!

00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,850
Congratulations.

00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:32,850
If I make take a moment, we should reminisce and appreciate the first time the JSConf EU

00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,850
went off, I was in the same sort of role, doing a video conference.

00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:34,850
Clearly, I've not fixed this problem.

00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,850
But things are as they are, so, I wanted to take a second and congratulate everyone who

00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,850
has organised JSConf EU throughout the years, being a host, and many wonderful things, sliced

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,850
fingers opening for controllers, node.js, housing one of the most inclusive and incredibly

00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,850
diverse conferences, to proving that you can do conferences outdoors in bubbles - yay!

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:39,850
- and you know what crazy people - and all have a wonderful inviting, and wonderful experience.

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,850
You've done a tremendous amount of benefit for the JavaScript and technology community,

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,850
and our thanks cannot - even if we thanked you ever single day, it would not be enough.

00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:42,850
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,850
[Cheering and applause].

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:44,850
[Applause].

00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:45,850
>> That's all I've got!

00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,850
Auf wiedersehen.

00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:47,850
>> All right, give it up for Live: JS!

00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,850
[Applause].

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,850
Some of you have probably seen the talk yesterday where they talked about how they created this

00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,850
amazing experience.

00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:51,850
You've seen them play over there.

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,850
They have not slept much over the last week, and the weeks before this, it's been an incredible

00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:53,850
amount of work, so, again, thank you very much to Live:JS.

00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,850
[Applause].

00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:55,850
On top of that, we had a great set of artists, who helped with the visuals, and especially

00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:56,850
the mural over in the side track.

00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,850
John was the person creating the audience's programming, trailer, that ran at the start

00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:58,850
of our opening show, and then we have the group that created the absolutely incredible

00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,850
computer of one's own exhibition that you saw at the back of the of the hall.

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:00,850
We saw this earlier, you can now purchase those.

00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,850
Follow the link on our Twitter.

00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:02,850
[Applause].

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,850
And then, Thursday, the week of last week, so nine days ago, I messaged our internal

00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,850
Slack for speakers, scholarship recipients and volunteers saying we would like to do

00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,850
a choir.

00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:06,850
Can any one of you sing?

00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:07,850
The response I got which what I was hoping for we are a choir, we know what this is.

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,850
We're the awareness team, we're there anyway.

00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,850
Can we help?

00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:10,850
That saved our idea, and we had speaker and scholarship recipients joining in our opening.

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:11,850
It was incredible.

00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:12,850
They practised this the night before.

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:13,850
They had never met before, so give it up for them.

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,850
Thank you very much.

00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,850
[Cheering and applause].

00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,850
>> We had the honour to get to have Wiebke this year, she managed the sponsorship from

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:17,850
both conferences, and into and we could not be more thankful to have her.

00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,850
Big applause for Wiebke!

00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,850
Such a big event couldn't be done without the help of a team.

00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,850
A big shout out to them.

00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,850
They helped us for many things.

00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,850
Thank you, Niko, Martin, Zeno, and Olivia!

00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:23,850
[Applause].

00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:24,850
This year, we had more volunteers than ever before.

00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,850
And they are the reason why we, the organisers, could be a bit more relaxed this year.

00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:26,850
They helped at the registration community launch, BIPoCiT space, live captions, and

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,850
much more.

00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,850
Thanks to all our volunteers.

00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,850
[Applause].

00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:30,850
So, who of you has been to the community lounge?

00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:31,850
They shared great stories, right?

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:32,850
The community lounge is a small conference running in the breaks since 2017.

00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,850
Thank you, Michelle, and Vanessa, for being part of our team and putting in so much effort

00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:34,850
in organising the community lounge.

00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:35,850
[Applause].

00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,850
This year, for the first time, JSConf EU had an inclusionary space for black, indigenous,

00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:37,850
and/or people of colour.

00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:38,850
Thank you Lauren, Darren, and Vanessa for putting so much effort into the BIPoCiT space.

00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,850
[Cheering and applause].

00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:40,850
Also, for the first tile, we had a team which was here for you in case you needed support

00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:41,850
or had any issues.

00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:42,850
Thank you to the team for their great work and to Tui for organising it.

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,850
[Applause].

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:44,850
>> Our scholarship programme was organised this year by Princya, Olivia, and Thuy.

00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:45,850
Give it up for them.

00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:46,850
[Applause].

00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,850
JSConf EU would not be what it is without the continuous help of the CSSconf EU team.

00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,850
Thank you, Lukasz, Kristina for all your help over these years.

00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,850
>> Can you tell we didn't rehearse that bit!

00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,850
Okay, thank you so much to the organisers.

00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:51,850
I think that it's pretty obvious that this is the most welcoming generate conference

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,850
in the world.

00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,850
[Cheering and applause].

00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:54,850
I think it's also really obvious that it's changed the lives of probably 100s or thousands

00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,850
of people, not just the in the room tonight, but the people you spoke to, spread the word

00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:56,850
to, and said, hey, the JavaScript community is welcoming, friendly, and you can been a

00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:57,850
part of it.

00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,850
Thank you to all of you as well.

00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,850
[Applause].

00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,850
Okay, final announcement: we're selling the portraits back there.

00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,850
They are tweeted on the JSConf EU Twitter.

00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,850
The money is going to go to the artist that created them.

00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:03,850
Next steps is in a second, we are going to take a family photo.

00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:04,850
It's going to happen straight behind us.

00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,850
I need you to form a triangle, so narrower in the front.

00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:06,850
Ah, okay, more announcements, then we're going to do the photo.

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,850
The photo's going to be shaped in a triangle.

00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,850
Right now, let's remind you to get your things from the coat check after we all come on stage.

00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:09,850
So, first, everybody ... >> I would say no, because I think I know

00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:10,850
what I want.

00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,850
Everybody who has helped this year organising this great event, and who could not be on

00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:12,850
stage because the slides are too big, please come up.

00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:13,850
We want you all here, and we want a warm applause for all of you.

00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,850
[Applause].

00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:15,850
And now we would like to have the speakers come to the stage again, please.

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,850
[Applause].

00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,850
We would also like to have the speakers from the BIPoCiT space and the community lounge

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,850
come to the stage.

00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:19,850
[Applause].

00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,850
Are our emcees already on stage in where is our emceeing team?

00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,850
Yeah!

00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:22,850
Thank you, everyone for being here for helping us, and please apologies for the unorganised

00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:23,850
closing here.

00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,850
We love you all, and I think we can go to the family photo soon, but it's great to have

00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,850
us all here, so thanks, everyone, again!
