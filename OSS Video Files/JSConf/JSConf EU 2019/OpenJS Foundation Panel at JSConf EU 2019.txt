Hi, everybody.

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,849
How are you all doing today?

00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,589
Jump up and down a few things.

00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:14,040
Stretch a little bit.

00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,049
High-five the person to your right because you can.

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,200
My name is Adam Miller.

00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,200
This is OpenJS.

00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:23,800
This is between you and me, we won't tell the panellists, how many people know what

00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:30,620
the JS Foundations do, and interact with them a lot and should be up here on this panel?

00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,119
I see a few hands.

00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:39,370
Who knows that the foundations exist and kind of know what they do but really ... couldn't

00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,411
give a talk on it or be on the panel here.

00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:44,850
Here is, ""We're talking about foundations?

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,800
We're talking about open source, right, why is there a foundation involved?""

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:59,649
We've done a lot of work recent to merge together the Node Foundation, and the JavaScript Foundation

00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:02,100
into the OpenJS Foundation.

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,549
It's been a ten-month process or more.

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,670
We are really excited to share with you what we've been doing.

00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:16,990
There's an awesome panel of people here who are have been rocking it on the foundation

00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:21,130
formation side, and I guess we will about down the line and do intros here.

00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:26,149
>> You have a standalone full-screen experience from looks like any other app on the iPhone.

00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:27,819
So it's basically a PWA.

00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:31,950
Then you have - feature phones, I have this Nokia here with me, feature phones, non-touch,

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,950
they're supporting PWAs.

00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,429
But it's not just on mobile.

00:01:34,429 --> 00:01:40,590
On desktop you can go and install Trivago, Tinder, by the way, and you have a - that

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,159
works on Windows, Chromebook, Mac and Linux.

00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,789
You can open more PWAs at the same time.

00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:52,079
We have the properly, we just need to create really, really good experiences, and today,

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,569
let's say that I can say that maybe half of the PWA s out there on R offering a good experience.

00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:16,989
The other half are away for offering a competition like the native apps, and so we will try to

00:02:16,989 --> 00:02:31,879
see why, and what we can do today to improve that experience.

00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,650
So, talking about the app cycle, okay?

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,599
So because we are creating apps, not just websites that will appear in the browser.

00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,969
So, when you open a PWA, so if the d Platform.

00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:53,239
I'm Google's representative as a platinum member board representative and the vice-chair

00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,370
of the Open JS Foundation.

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:02,879
Before that, I was the elected representative on the board prior to the merger in the original

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,409
structure of the node.js Foundation.

00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:09,060
There were three board seats that are community members.

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:16,549
Tracy had one of them, and I was representing the other group.

00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:17,700
>> I'm Adam Miller.

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:27,950
In the daytime, I work on LinkedIn.

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,549
We can't talk to the future of the organisation without looking to the past.

00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:41,080
I would like to get a tl;dr on the node Node Foundation and the JavaScript Foundation.

00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:51,640
>> So a the although of people may not realise that the JavaScript community has had a foundation

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,290
working on behalf of open-source projects for a long time.

00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:01,739
Back in the mid-2000s, we had the jQuery project that got wildly popular and we made a foundation

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:09,239
for jQuery that added projects over time which later merged with what was the Dojo Foundation

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,281
which had a handful of projects itself and just kind of that was about three or four

00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:20,100
years ago, and so that was when we became the JS Foundation, and we've been rocking

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,250
along behind the scenes for quite some time.

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:33,660
>> And the Node JS Foundation was formed in 2015 to provide a future place where a number

00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,320
of different groups within the node community could come together and work on figuring out

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,610
how to move things forward into the future.

00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,690
There was a few sort of key things that were important, which I think we will see flow

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:57,070
through so what we see in the OpenJS Foundation as well as that neutrality, if they contribute,

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,500
they have the tools and the access that they need to make things happen.

00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,160
That is something we will see reflected in what we talk about in the OpenJS Foundation

00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,530
as well.

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:24,320
In September 15, we - we've seen consistent and reliable releases

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,320
ever since then.

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,250
I think it's a good sign of the stability and the ability for everybody to get in in

00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,630
work together on that front.

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:37,380
>> Yes, I know early on when it was just in early discussions about the two foundations

00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,560
merging, there was a good bit of uncertainty about whether it should happen, whether it

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,350
was the right time to do it.

00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,800
I know a lot of you feel that a lot of those concerns early on, I was hoping you could

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,790
answer maybe why not, and why merge?

00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,900
>> Can you repeat that one more time really quickly?

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,440
>> Why are we merging now and why - what is the reason for the merge?

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,360
>> It's been a long couple of days!

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,380
So there are a number of different reasons to consider merging foundations.

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:18,511
If you go and look at the bylaws of the foundation itself, right in there, we claim that we want

00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:23,870
to be a centre of gravity for the JavaScript ecosystem.

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:30,190
Prior to there being one primary foundation, it wasn't really clear.

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:37,780
And it's hard because Node was the main project in the node.js Foundation, and joining something

00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:43,280
bigger means giving some stuff up, and there's an anecdote I really like.

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:50,800
When I kind of started getting into the node.js ecosystem, when I had just moved to California,

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,520
I got - I got a free ticket to go to a conference called Node Summit.

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,681
This was right around the time of the fork, and they were talking about merging, and I

00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:07,070
have no shame, so I walked right up to Scott Hammond at the time the CEO of Joyant and

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,410
asked him why would you put Node?

00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,930
A foundation - in a foundation?

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,550
He said it's better to have a smaller piece of a bigger pie.

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,660
To me, when I think about these foundations, and we just had our summit recently which

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:28,230
was fantastic, and so many new faces in the room that weren't there before, we just massively

00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:32,770
expanded the scope of the work that we can do, who we can work with, how we can work

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,770
with them.

00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:40,240
We get to revisit all of these kind of preconceived notions when Node first went in the foundation,

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,430
it was very reactive.

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,310
We had things that we needed to protect and fix and now we can be proactive and start

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,490
thinking about what we want to build.

00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:54,360
>> It made me think we all know we can accomplish a lot more than we could on our own as an

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,280
individual, so it's the same thing for a larger foundation.

00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,370
>> And sort of wearing the Node hat, there was a lot of scepticism when we were talking

00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,920
about a merger.

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,750
And not - I wouldn't necessarily say it was balanced.

00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:15,020
There was a lot from the Node side, and, again, it was because we had experience going through

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:20,800
I think a pretty tumultuous foundation formation not too many years ago, and Node was finally

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,280
feeling like a stable place sort of firing on all cylinders, we were working together

00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:33,130
in the community, and the TSC, but I think as part of that, we ended up seeing how bringing

00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:40,120
in the up stream components in the JS ecosystem, that, like, we were stronger when we were

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,530
doing that together, and so by focusing on these sorts of things that we had already

00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:50,560
learned, transparency, including not - not just including - giving autonomy to the project

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,440
members so they could run and host these meetings, we ran weekly meetings when it came to the

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,250
merger discussion and planning so whatever wanted to drive the planning from particular

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:07,090
initiative phases of making this merger happen, it was only going to happen if people showed

00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,980
up and did the work, and that is from the project side, not from the board side.

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:17,840
>> Yes, I will add that on the .just Foundation side, we immediately you a the benefit of

00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:23,800
possibly merging with the Node ecosystem because all of our projects really rely on Node.

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:31,750
At the same time, there was fear and uncertainty because there was a lot of historical drama,

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:37,840
and energy from the community which may be disruptive to what was otherwise fairly stability

00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
projects.

00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:47,330
So, you know, with that optimism, but cautious optimism in mind, everybody got really excited

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:52,650
about the possibility of collaborating more closely with their peers on the Node side

00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:59,110
through one umbrella, and I think that's kind of what put us over the edge.

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,570
>> And one of the things that building on what both Tracy and Jory was saying, from

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:10,320
the get-go, we approached this from an egalitarian mind set.

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,870
We made the doors open, like we tried to be hyper inclusive as much as possible.

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:22,391
If you are a member or a committer, and even then we weren't that picky, like, if you wanted

00:10:22,391 --> 00:10:27,400
to show up to those meetings and you wasn't being disruptive, you had a voice and a seat

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,779
at the table, and were participating.

00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,830
I think that was really important to make sure that this could be successful.

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:40,180
>> I was going to say, we looked at the governance for a number of the different projects, for

00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:48,630
the Node Foundation, Kubernetes, and I'm happy that we ended up with something that is the

00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:56,440
most, has the most opportunity, and hopefully the best place where people will want to come

00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,620
and will attract a lot of good people through that.

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,920
I'm happy by looking at that, we ended up with that open and really nice governance.

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:09,970
>> I think in all of this drives home the value of this work is always project-driven,

00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,800
and that's the point of the foundation, is to help empower and give autonomy to the projects,

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,560
and get sort of the crap out of the way for them to be able to do their good work.

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,020
>> I think what I've heard on that front is we talk about great projects and the focus

00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,839
will be on those great projects, not the foundation itself.

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,430
>> So let's dig into some of that nitty-gritty.

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:34,710
Almost everybody in the room here is an engineer, and I have always held the opinion that governance

00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:38,410
is just coding but with words!

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,500
It's really what it has felt like over the past ten months, and we have a visual aid

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,960
here as we talk about it.

00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:50,610
Let's dive into some of the more nitty-gritty details here of under the hood of what is

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,680
kind of making this foundation, new foundation tick, and we can talk about some of the back

00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:00,100
story, and reasoning behind these sections of the foundation.

00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:10,819
Yes, so, I mean, let's take it from the top and go OpenJS board and talk about their functionality.

00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:16,400
>> To start out with, I talked about the governance.

00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,810
We have multiple levels so there are observers.

00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:23,380
Any who wants to can come up and participate in the meetings.

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:27,270
We want to get as many different ideas to come to the best answers.

00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:32,230
We have regular members who can actually, people who in my mind who said I'm making

00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,750
a commitment to be involved regularly and they can they can be recognised for that.

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:42,890
Again, both observers and regular members are involved in all of the work that goes

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,920
on.

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,880
And then finally, we have voting members where in the rare cases where we need to actually

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,650
have a vote on something, it's that subset who will do that vote.

00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:58,371
Now, our experience in the Node project at least has been that votes are very rare, we

00:12:58,371 --> 00:13:02,900
follow a consensus-seeking approach, and really it's going to be all of those members who

00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:07,570
have ownership and who push things forward, and so it should not really matter which level

00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,530
you're in, but we have just to have the different levels for the contingencies.

00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:19,390
>> One thing that I can add, a mantra I would tell myself, was that we wanted to create

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:24,890
structures and hierarchies of responsibility rather than power.

00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:32,650
So there isn't fundamentally a major power balance between any of the members of the

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,930
any of the projects, being a voting member just means you're more responsible.

00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:37,930
You need to be showing up.

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:41,750
You need to make sure that things are getting finished but you just don't get to shut down

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,319
another person's voice because you have that responsibility.

00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:49,920
>> The governance is really written so that all the responsibilities of the CPC are the

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,290
responsibilities of all the members as opposed to anybody in particular.

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:59,740
>> I want to talk a little bit about the projects if we can, the staging, because I think for

00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:08,240
me, this was a big bringing all JS Foundation projects on board, and important they had

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:16,760
a voice in the project, and where they were going to derive value and get value and services

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,470
from the organisation, so we came up with this proposal that was loosely based on the

00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:29,750
CNCF model of impact projects, growth-stage projects, and what is not pictured here is

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:35,200
there a project which we have six projects that we deemed, and the projects themselves

00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,390
opted into this stage, functionally complete.

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:43,060
We recognised and thanked them for their contribution they made to the comment but we're not really

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,240
encouraging people to go and contribute to those projects or adopt those projects now.

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:56,731
We have five impact projects which are sort of the projects that are a real kind of need

00:14:56,731 --> 00:15:02,040
to have some resources and support on a very active basis from the foundation.

00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,690
They're used heavily in enterprise, and they need that backing.

00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:12,020
We have six growth projects and that stage is for projects that have a specific objective

00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,580
in mind, like there is a goal.

00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,560
I need, I want to grow my contributor base.

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,290
I want to increase the number of implementations.

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,040
I want to put on an Yvette, or something like that.

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,810
They have some specific goal for which they need extra resources from the foundation for

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:32,620
a short period of time, growth stages for those projects, and then we have 15 projects

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:40,310
that are projects that are fine, they're kind of doing their thing, their resource needs

00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,829
are pretty set, and we don't have to do too much to support that.

00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:50,360
>> One thing I can add from the At Large is the Node Foundation, that was the only project.

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,300
That was half true.

00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,550
It had attempted an incubation programme to bring for projects in.

00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:09,810
I personally, and I can't speak for how other people feel, I don't feel that programme was

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:10,810
successful.

00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:16,829
While we were merging, we have to make sure that all projects are accounted for, and both

00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:24,310
... and Express primarily wanted to continue operating the way that they were, to be able

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:29,440
to not to have anything day-to-day change, and perhaps have a bit of a better idea of

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,440
what resources were available to them such as CI, or legal counsel, or PR and marketing

00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,940
in case they needed it, but they mostly didn't want anything to change.

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:45,560
By coming in as an At Large projects, these two projects mostly on rails doing their own

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,740
thing, as far as I know, and I'm saying this because we haven't heard anything from them,

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,700
it seems like everything's going fine, and there's been pretty much no change day-to-day,

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:01,200
and so to me, I see a lot of these projects as you do your thing the way you want to do

00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:06,220
your thing, and we are here to support you when you need it, and one of the really big

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,610
things I think we will want to be doing in the near future is codefying and making it

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:15,900
far clearer what resources are available, how to get access to those resources, and

00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,589
how to create programmes for new resources if they're not available yet.

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:24,389
>> I think we're better set up now to deal with and cope with the different requirements

00:17:24,389 --> 00:17:30,519
or aspirations that each project will have as opposed to being part of the node.js Foundation

00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:34,450
where you're a small part of a bigger project.

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:43,799
>> Do you want to talk about the membership structure and how representation works at

00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:44,869
the layer above the CPC?

00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:46,639
>> Sorry, can you repeat that?

00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:53,540
>> Do - I would love to hear more about the membership structure and how the CPC interacts

00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:59,519
with the rest of the org a little bit.

00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,039
>> I think, Adam, let me know, you're asking about how is the CPC formed and what is the

00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:07,449
structure of the foundation on the community side?

00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:08,529
>> Yes.

00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:11,769
>> I will start.

00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:16,429
One thing that is really important, and this is the only thing I really wanted to say,

00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:20,950
is that the board which we are seeing over on the left-hand side, which is made up of

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,559
a number of different members from corporate entities, as well as as well as three three

00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:30,370
community members right now, it is three, it will go down to two soon, there is governance

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:37,190
- grab me, I will explain - but that group is responsible for the things that you see

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,239
listed there.

00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:41,889
They do not have authority over anything else.

00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:47,759
The rest of the day-to-day operations of the foundation that you see under the Cross Project

00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:55,130
Council As well as the technical governance of project is completely air gapped.

00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:57,600
The boards and projects can work together on things.

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,669
It doesn't mean that we are not partners.

00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:06,039
But what it does mean is that the foundation cannot install people into a project.

00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:11,640
>> I think a good example here I can provide is what happens if a code of conduct violation

00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,720
happens with someone on leadership in one of the projects?

00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,700
What one would hope is that a project would be able to manage that conflict themselves

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,899
and resolve it.

00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:27,259
It's really hard to have to enforce those policies on someone that you've worked with

00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:32,080
for years, that you've seen work really hard, but that you're seeing disagreements on.

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,239
So, you know, by experience, we've seen this sort of happen that you could end up having

00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:41,730
it saying like, board, we need you to provide an answer because we don't really know what

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,970
to do here, and we know you have experience at it.

00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:48,940
The board, instead of saying, okay, you're going to do this thing, it's instead saying

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,679
we are going to help you provide resources, and we're going to work with you together

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,780
to figure this out, but ultimately, you're responsible for this work.

00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,360
We just want to be here to guide you and provide the monetary resources, the legal resources,

00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:09,470
to help resolve that together, and hopefully we will be better for that in the long run.

00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:15,330
>> Taking on from the board participation, we then have voting members which are elected.

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,610
We have two from the impact project.

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,529
It's up to the project to decide how they want to elect those representatives.

00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:27,070
We also have two which represent all of the non-impact projects, although this year, as

00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:32,919
a bootstrap, we accepted everybody who wanted to participate at that level into the CPC

00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:37,720
which is really great because we want to kick off with as many people as we can in helping

00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,600
to move things forward.

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,340
Then we actually can have an additional two voting members who are elected from the regular

00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,340
members.

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,049
If we see some people who haven't been elected by an individual project but are doing a lot

00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:55,719
of work and helping to move the CPC work forward, they can be elected as voting members Intel.

00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:57,289
>> Thank you.

00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,690
Coming up on time here.

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:02,109
So I just want to go rapid-fire.

00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:04,799
Starting with Myles.

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:12,559
If people leave here with one takeaway, from this panel, what would you like it to be?

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,860
>> You don't have to do this alone.

00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,369
>> Oh.

00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:17,889
Succinct.

00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:22,429
I like it!

00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:26,970
Applause for that!

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,490
[Applause].

00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,320
>> So I think I'm really excited to see how we are going to - again, as Myles said, there's

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:41,369
excitement from the summit this week, prior to JSConf EU, excited to seeing these guys

00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:45,169
saying we are excited, we didn't know there is a possibility here.

00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:52,230
Taking the work we've done in Node and talk to other people in the groups in the ecosystem,

00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,889
or in the foundation, to get to work together on these things, it's exciting to see the

00:21:56,889 --> 00:22:01,080
opportunity that we have now in JavaScript to be able to work together on this stuff,

00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,699
even from helping more on the standards side.

00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:08,580
>> For me, it's all about new opportunities, and that I see a lot more new opportunities

00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:14,429
for us to collaborate together, to have a greater impact across projects, and to achieve

00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:15,429
bigger things.

00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:18,669
We have an opportunity to achieve things we wouldn't be able to achieve on our own, it's

00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:23,129
about new opportunities across all of the different aspects.

00:22:23,129 --> 00:22:27,500
>> I have, like, 37 things I would like to share with people, but bearing in mind, that

00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,239
we have a minute and a half left, I think the first thing that I would like for you

00:22:32,239 --> 00:22:37,299
all to take away is that there is a lot of opportunity for you to give impact and what

00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:43,489
services the Open JS Foundation provides to your projects, and you can follow our work

00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:51,989
on the Open JS Foundation organisation, bootstrap, called the Cross Project Council repo now.

00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:56,499
If you have an idea for something that would be helpful to you as a member of one of our

00:22:56,499 --> 00:23:01,360
projects, or as a potential member of one of our projects, write a proposal or open

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,080
an issue on that, and start following along with our meetings and that sort of thing on

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,009
YouTube and our weekly meetings there.

00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:14,450
We have a great new email list you can start to receiving these weekly emails from us that

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:23,830
sort of summarises like what is going on, we have JS Foundation Slack Channel, so there

00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:28,119
is a lot of opportunities to start having these conversations together, and you can

00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:29,919
make a difference.

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,239
You can come, and I can't wait to see you there.

00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:40,109
>> Wonderful, I just want to say I saw a lot of this collaboration between projects starting

00:23:40,109 --> 00:23:44,159
at the most recent collaborators summit which was right before this conference.

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,649
We got people from across the new open JS Foundation together.

00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:52,340
It was historically a Node event but the conversations that actually happened in the hallway and

00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,679
in talks are things that I could only dream about.

00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:02,149
We build amazing things on the internet together, we build amazing things with JavaScript together,

00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:06,760
and like Myles put it, we don't have to do it alone, and we do it better together.

00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,179
So, definitely go and get involved.

00:24:09,179 --> 00:24:10,549
We are up on GitHub.

00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:11,809
You can go to the website.

00:24:11,809 --> 00:24:21,080
Thank you all for coming to this panel.

00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,590
