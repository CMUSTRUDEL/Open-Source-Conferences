Title: Why Can’t We All Just Get Along? by Chidinma Kalu | JSConf EU 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-13
Playlist: JSConf EU 2019
Description: 
	There’s a divisive movement around the world which has arguable impacted the software development community. How can we remain open-minded and respectful when talking about different programming paradigms or languages?

In this talk, I will be talking about empathy, how we can have divergent views and still have meaningful conversations.

My name is Chidinma.

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,619
I am Nigerian.

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:23,070
It's [ Applause ]

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,750
I am also a frontend developer at New Lab.

00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,340
I love to drink tea.

00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,030
That's a fun fact about me.

00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,800
Another fun fact about me is this is my first time speaking at a conference.

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:43,079
[ Applause ] So, please be kind to me, okay?

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,079
Okay.

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,649
So, I'm going to just go straight into my talk.

00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:54,309
I wanted to when I was preparing my slides, I thought about how do I talk to people about

00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:59,829
how we can all get along about the diversity, about everything that happens in our community.

00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:05,269
So, I decided, okay, let me look at what has happened in the past.

00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,200
Who remembers the Katie Bowman saga?

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,180
The woman who she was part of the team who discovered the black hole.

00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,780
Who remembers?

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,390
Okay.

00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:22,700
Who remembers how much she was bullied on Twitter, on Hacker News, yeah.

00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,040
Who felt very angry?

00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,689
You wanted to find those guys on Reddit.

00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:27,790
Good.

00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,880
We are all together.

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,830
Who has ever posted a question on StackOverflow?

00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,180
Good.

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,630
I like the communication we're having.

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,909
Who remembers who was ever like posted a question and then got very negative feedback.

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:45,909
Oh.

00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:46,909
Yeah.

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:49,810
We're all in the same shoes.

00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,400
My personal story is I posted my first time ever I posted a question on StackOverflow.

00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,990
And I think I it was about jQuery.

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,049
Something about jQuery, and somebody said, can't you read?

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:03,240
And said go read the docs.

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,530
If you can read, go read the docs.

00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,969
After refreshing for over three minutes to get an answer, and somebody said, go read

00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:10,969
the docs.

00:02:10,969 --> 00:02:12,349
I'm coming from the docs, right?

00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:18,390
If I'm coming from the docs and coming to StackOverflow where everyone is to ask questions.

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,030
How do you want know feel as a beginner?

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,519
That was devastating to me.

00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:29,159
I was trying to remember all the stories when I was coming up with this talk.

00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,690
Today we're going to have a conversation about why this talk is important.

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,120
We're going to look at practical examples.

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,139
We are going to look at a proven solution.

00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,909
We are going to explore ways to apply this solution to our community.

00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:46,559
We're also going to look another how working on this problem can actually benefit us as

00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:50,989
individuals and help our community.

00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,620
Why do we need to have this conversation?

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,969
We need to have this conversation because we are unique in so many ways.

00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,150
We all come from didn't backgrounds.

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,549
We have different parents.

00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,639
Even if we're sisters and brothers, I mean, we have different ideologies, right?

00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:10,150
We need to have this conversation because can be despite our differences, instead of

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:15,730
embracing our differences, we are actually making it allowing it to cause discomfort,

00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,180
disconnect and friction within our community and amongst ourselves.

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,739
Okay.

00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:22,739
Practical examples.

00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,709
I'm going talk about the condescending tone.

00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:31,109
If you've ever asked a question on Reddit and then somebody down voted your question,

00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:32,109
right?

00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:35,359
Or somebody said, this is not right for this thread.

00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:37,799
Is it called a thread or a room?

00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:38,799
Right?

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,069
Somebody says this is not right on StackOverflow.

00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:46,359
Have you ever been in code review with your manager or team lead and somebody says, or

00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:51,010
your team lead says what you did makes no sense, right?

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,260
Maybe puts you down in a very bad way.

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,540
How did you feel?

00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,090
Did you feel anger?

00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,669
Did you feel sad?

00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:00,989
If you felt anger, just like, okay.

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:02,989
Who felt sad about it?

00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:03,989
Okay.

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:09,829
So, the reason I'm talking about the condescending tone is I think we have a problem as engineers.

00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:12,069
In our community, we have a problem with communicating.

00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:16,500
I'm not sure everyone wakes up in the morning and says, I want to be condescending.

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,400
I don't think people wake up and say, every junior developer in my office has to hear

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,539
it from me today.

00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:24,500
I think it's because we don't know how to communicate.

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:30,099
And especially when we learn something new, and the beauty of this when we learn something

00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:34,650
new, oh, yeah, anyone who wants to talk to me today, has to learn.

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,970
Let's say you learn about React hoops, for example.

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,840
And tell yourself, anyone that asks this question.

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,129
This is not, this is what we're going to say or to do.

00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:49,240
A junior developer says something, no, that's not how it's meant to be done.

00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,410
We don't tell them why.

00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:52,840
We just put them down.

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,180
That's not nice.

00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,360
This is a problem in our community, and we need to work on that.

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,270
Yeah.

00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:07,169
Also, one that gets to me the most is the backend versus frontend.

00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,870
If you've ever heard about people say frontend developers do not do a lot of work.

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,699
Frontend developers are just there.

00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:17,729
I mean, you can relate to what I'm trying to say here.

00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:22,490
I have been in situations where people tell me I'm a frontend developer so I'm not doing

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,430
as much work as the backend developers so I shouldn't get paid as much.

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,770
Or I'm just there for decoration or something.

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,360
Maybe they didn't mean it that way.

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,160
Maybe I'm trying to be nice to them and they didn't mean it that way, but this is a problem.

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,840
We are having so much division in our community because we feel some people are doing all

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,139
the work and some people are doing absolutely nothing.

00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:46,690
Developers versus non developers.

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,250
I actually went around talking to people about this.

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,250
I spoke to designers.

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,740
I spoke to people in the grid team, spoke to sales and markets and logistics.

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,430
And people actually feel that we don't treat them nice.

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,250
Shame on all of us.

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,860
We don't treat them nice.

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,939
We do not think that they play an important role in the company.

00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:10,530
And that is really bad.

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,470
We need to work on this.

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,389
Everyone in the company is working hard to make the company profitable.

00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:19,479
We shouldn't make them feel that we are smarter than them.

00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,669
We shouldn't make them feel that we are the most hard working or we are doing the most

00:06:22,669 --> 00:06:23,669
important job.

00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:28,719
I mean, if we finish working on the product and there is nobody to sell the product, there

00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:34,069
are no sales people or marketing people, do you think the world will see what we've done?

00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:35,249
No.

00:06:35,249 --> 00:06:36,430
Okay.

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,330
As a tech community, we must treat documentation I saw this Tweet and I have to put it.

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:48,400
As a tech community we must tweet documentation and infrastructure work with as much respect

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,129
as engineering.

00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:53,340
We have to actually work on this.

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,340
Yeah.

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,029
I'll just give you a minute to read.

00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:00,210
Read it quickly.

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,270
Okay.

00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,169
This one we can all read to it.

00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:07,199
And I was guilty of this a few months ago.

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,800
I used to be a React developer.

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,159
And I got hired to be a Vue JS developer.

00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:13,159
But guess what?

00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:17,749
I was always I always had the bias against Vue JS developers.

00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:19,779
I always said Vue was trash, right?

00:07:19,779 --> 00:07:23,020
I mean, why would you use Vue when you can use React?

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,849
Why would you use Vue when you can use Angular?

00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:31,250
But I'm here to tell you today that this framework shouldn't be so.

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,520
We shouldn't have these words.

00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,440
They're all tools, right?

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,340
We are supposed to use these tools to actually work on something, to create product.

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,139
The fact that we've had one bad experience does not mean that we should spread our biases.

00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,720
And if you ask me why I had a bias against Vue, I don't know.

00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,819
Maybe somebody told me Vue was trash and I said, okay.

00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,740
Everyone, Vue is trash.

00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,430
And I did not even put and that is if question actually set ourselves, why do we hate Angular?

00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,520
Why do we hate Vue?

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,129
Why do we hate jQuery?

00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:02,930
Sometimes we don't have a concrete answer.

00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,919
Someone told us our or mentors talked on Twitter and we said, okay.

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,949
If you're smarter than me and say Vue is trash, then maybe Vue is trash, right?

00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:18,580
I think this is a problem and we should it's discouraging beginners from actually spreading

00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,999
their wings.

00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:25,490
Discouraging beginners from being with open minded because we are just being biased.

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,860
How can we make this better?

00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,770
Empathy.

00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,599
I'm sure we've heard about empathy so many times.

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,800
This is not new, and I will not waste our time.

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:41,229
But empathy in the simplest forms is trying to put yourself in other people's shoes.

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,199
It's trying to understand why people are acting the way they are acting.

00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:51,190
It's trying to when somebody flares up, trying to understand why is this person doing this?

00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:54,920
That's what empathy is.

00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,790
Not just your colleagues, people in different communities.

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,320
People from didn't demographics.

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,630
So, I'm sure if I ask everyone here, yeah, we show empathy.

00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,130
That's why I put the more in the brackets.

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,339
Because we all show empathy here.

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:13,800
So, how can we show more empathy towards one another?

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,010
It starts with a question.

00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,440
How would I feel if I was on the receiving end?

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,930
So, let's say you're going through StackOverflow and you see a question and you want to answer

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,120
the question.

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,490
Before you press send, why don't you ask yourself, if I was a beginner or if I asked this question,

00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,650
how would I feel if I got this answer I'm about to send?

00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,650
Right?

00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,730
That's the question we should ask each other before or ask ourselves, rather, before we

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:44,320
do anything.

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,860
Put yourself in the shoes of the person who you're about to reply.

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,940
It may seem like a random answer, but would you like it if you got that kind of answer

00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,399
from people?

00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,080
I'm sure it's no.

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,390
Why show empathy?

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:03,060
I'm sure we already know with seeing talks about why you should know empathy.

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,759
But I would just use a few of them.

00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,889
You should show empathy because you are going to be treated better.

00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:10,390
You're going to treat other people with care.

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,140
You should also show empathy because you understand the needs of your colleagues and you also

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,560
understand the needs of your end users.

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,449
You should show empathy because when you show empathy, actually understand what people say

00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:23,839
when you're not speaking.

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,899
Understand my body language and I'm not comfortable and this is not something I want to hear.

00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,089
And you understand how to deal with conflict better.

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:37,990
Also, I understand we did not start this problem.

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:45,050
I mean, I feel when we came into tech we were answered in very rude ways.

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,279
But, I mean, we have the solution.

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,050
We can actually take a stand and say we do not we shouldn't speak to other people this

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,050
way.

00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,050
Right?

00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,220
So, how do we how do we actually come together to make this better?

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,450
I mean, imagine a community where there are more mentors and very few bullies.

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,959
Maybe we should just tune into our inner minds, right?

00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,709
And try to imagine a community where there are more mentors, less bullies.

00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:19,250
Where you can ask questions on StackOverflow or Reddit or anywhere and not get rude answers.

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,449
Imagine a community where everyone from every demographic is welcome.

00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:29,560
Imagine a community where there are no gatekeepers, no one is trying to bring you down.

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,079
Imagine if we are focused on trying to bring each other up and not trying to bring open

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,750
other down.

00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:43,300
So, in closing I would encourage you to see something, say something.

00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,430
I would encourage you to pause.

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,300
I would encourage you to listen.

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,910
I would encourage you to change your point of view.

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,389
I would also encourage you to apologize when due.

00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:54,910
I would also encourage you to speak up for others.

00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:58,290
Because it's not enough that we understand how to empathize.

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:02,420
But when you see somebody actually bringing other people down, say something about it.

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,339
I would encourage you to share what you know.

00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:11,810
And trust me, our community will be better for it.

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:16,749
Thank you.

00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:19,220
