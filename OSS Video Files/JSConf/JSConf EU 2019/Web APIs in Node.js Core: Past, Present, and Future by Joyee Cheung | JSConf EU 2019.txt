Title: Web APIs in Node.js Core: Past, Present, and Future by Joyee Cheung | JSConf EU 2019
Publication date: 2019-08-09

Description: 
	Web APIs developed and standardized by the browsers have been serving client-side JavaScript applications with a wide selection of features out of the box, while Node.js have been developing another set of APIs that are today the de-facto standards for server-side JavaScript runtimes. There is now a conscious effort to bring the two worlds closer together, in particular by introducing more Web APIs into Node.js core, but itâ€™s not an easy ride - not every Web API, designed for the browsers, makes sense for Node.js.

In this talk, we are going to take a look at the story of Web APIs in Node.js core - what Node.js have implemented, what are being discussed, what are blocking more APIs from being implemented, and what we can do to improve the developer experience of the JavaScript ecosystem.
