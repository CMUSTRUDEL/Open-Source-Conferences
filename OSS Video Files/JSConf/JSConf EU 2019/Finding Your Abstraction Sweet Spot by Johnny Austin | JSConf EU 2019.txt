Description: 
	Many would argue there are only two hard problems in software: naming and cache invalidation. I’d argue there’s a third problem - abstractions. Whether you’re implementing an API for devs outside of your organization or creating a reusable library for devs on your team, creating the right level of abstraction is difficult. You have to balance flexibility with the ease-of-use. The correct choice is often a function of time constraints, compromise, and trial & error. I’ll talk about how to navigate these issues more efficiently.
