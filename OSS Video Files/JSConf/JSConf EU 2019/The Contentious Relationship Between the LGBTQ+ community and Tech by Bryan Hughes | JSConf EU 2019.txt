Title: The Contentious Relationship Between the LGBTQ+ community and Tech by Bryan Hughes | JSConf EU 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-13
Playlist: JSConf EU 2019
Description: 
	“Queers hate techies,” the slogan proudly proclaimed in a window in San Francisco. Being a queer techie, I was immediately conflicted.

The tech industry provides a safe haven for many queer folks, myself included. It offers stable employement to us more willingly than other industries. These benefits don’t extend to all queer folks though, and these benefits are often revoked as soon as we step out of line. Queer folks are a model minority in an industry who’s products often negatively impact our community.

This talk will dive into these complications and how we can improve the tech industry to make it a truly welcoming place for queer folks.

	00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,620
So, yeah.

00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:19,730
My name's Bryan Hughes, find me online in all the places.

00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,740
This is a talk I have been thinking about for a long time.

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,460
Actually, first came up with like the original kernel of an idea for this talk at this very

00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,919
conference two years ago.

00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:34,370
So, I think it's fitting that I'm able to actually give it here at JSConf EU.

00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,340
Because this is a really special conference.

00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,710
I think we've all felt that.

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,160
You know, it's great technical content, of course.

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,260
Some of the leading technical content.

00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,190
But really, we're a community, more than that.

00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:51,400
And so, like, as you can probably guess, especially if you have read my Twitter bio, I'm bisexual,

00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,450
polyamorous, and you can read it there.

00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,890
Some things that aren't in my bio.

00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,670
I was born in Texas in the United States which is one of the most conservative parts of the

00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,670
country.

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,170
I grew up there in the '80s and '90s.

00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,590
A little older than I look.

00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,039
Things were a little bit different back then.

00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:15,929
I'm going to talk about queerness and tech and how these things intersect in all kinds

00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:17,060
of different ways.

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,970
The truth is it's complicated.

00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,259
There's no binary tech is good, tech is bad or any of that.

00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:26,090
It's just all over the map.

00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,759
I really want to dig into what these things are, really.

00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,060
How tech helps, how tech hurts and how tech can be better.

00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,260
I'm just one person.

00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,830
We talk about the queer community a lot.

00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,430
But it's not just one community.

00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,060
Not just one type of person in it.

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,889
The queer community is a federation, really.

00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:49,469
There are lots and lots of different communities with a lot of different people and a lot of

00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:50,469
different experiences.

00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:53,630
Of course, disclaimer, I speak for myself.

00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,729
I did reach out to a number of queer folks that I know, friends of friends, things like

00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,720
that, to try to get a lot of different perspectives.

00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,939
You'll see quotes from other folks.

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,799
Hopefully not just speaking for myself.

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,430
Before we get into it, this talk comes with content warnings as I'm sure you can imagine.

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:18,000
So, if any of these parts of the talk are difficult or uncomfortable, take care of yourself.

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,480
Feel free to step outside, anything like that.

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,570
I want to start by setting the stage a little bit.

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,849
Go back in time a little bit.

00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:29,940
Talk about one of the fathers of computer science, Alan Turing.

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,680
Made contributions to computer science as well as art official intelligence.

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,090
The renaissance in tech, artificial intelligence, the big new thing.

00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,620
Alan Turing was talking about it in the first part of the 20th century.

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,590
And Alan Turing was also gay.

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,189
And he was persecuted for it.

00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:57,870
It.

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:19,890
I think in a way it's fitting that we start by talking about tech and queer employees

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,190
given in the way that Alan Turing was the first queer tech employee.

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,939
At least that we know of.

00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:32,239
When we talk about being a queer employee, tech is very complicated, you know?

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,150
I'm queer and I'm a tech employee.

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,980
I think a lot of folks in this audience here are.

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,140
And so, it's really complicated.

00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,000
Like the first thing I want to talk about one of the best things is that tech offers

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,709
us stable employment.

00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,090
And as queer folks, this is really important because a lot of queer folks are just not

00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,849
financially stable.

00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:57,879
Regardless of the family we come from, so many were, you know, kicked out of their homes

00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:58,879
when they were young.

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,540
So, even if there was wealth in the family, that often didn't translate to the queer kids

00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,209
themselves.

00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,780
Having financial stability is important.

00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,270
And in tech, compared to other professions that pay about the same and offer the stability,

00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,700
tech tends to be one of the most accepting.

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,780
At least in that strata of professions.

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:24,620
As a queer tech worker, I have a job that is intellectually challenging and offers economic

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,150
stability.

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:31,170
I do my best to pay it forward and pass that money along to people who need it.

00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:39,380
One of the first issues that we tend to run into, and this is kind of a meta one, is corporate

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,250
pride is rainbow capitalism.

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,300
All right.

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,199
Throughout I think about three different definitions to use to break this down a little bit.

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,040
First, the concept of pride in the queer community.

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,050
That's really, really important to us.

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,780
Because for centuries and millennia, we were told that who we are is something to be ashamed

00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,139
of.

00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,139
It's not.

00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,490
And it's taken a lot of work for us to become proud of who we are.

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,940
And so, pride is very, very important us to.

00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:14,530
And we're starting to see a lot of companies expressing queer pride in various different

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,530
ways.

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,030
So, this corporate pride is kind of it's a new thing, of course.

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,970
But we really look at it, though, it's what we call rainbow capitalism.

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:30,880
And so, rainbow capitalism is whenever companies, institutions, whoever, engages with the queer

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
community.

00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,120
Not to help the queer community.

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,070
But in order to further their own interests.

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,810
Usually to sell more products, make more money.

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,949
And what we end up seeing is that corporate pride end up just being another reflection

00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:46,780
and lens of rainbow capitalism.

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,240
The tech industry is engaging in a queer specific version of diversity theater by sponsoring

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,560
events like the pride parade.

00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:01,110
They market to sell more products, and most are not doing anything to make the life better

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,350
for queer people.

00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,300
Queer ERGs, employee resource groups, should be run by queer employees.

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,650
However, it's also important that you value the work people are putting into this.

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,450
I was the head of the queer employee resource group for a while.

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:24,060
And that work was seen as completely extracurricular and I missed out on a promotion as a result.

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,810
See, companies want to take the work they do in order to further their own interests

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,180
and they don't actually give back.

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,509
They don't support us in that.

00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:36,080
They only take it from us.

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,960
And our other intersections are compounded.

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,879
You know, we talk about social justice.

00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,250
We talk a lot about intersectionality.

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,220
And that absolutely applies to queerness as well.

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,310
And one of the things that I think is important to note about this is, you know, we tend to

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:56,100
think about diversity, inclusivity as like different axes.

00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,300
This is not necessarily wrong, but they are not independent.

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,139
And this is something we have to remember.

00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:05,440
When people have more than one marginalization they're dealing, this is not an additive,

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,910
it's a multiplicative one.

00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:14,060
They inform each other and makes things more complicated.

00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,699
When my disability became ongoing, it was hard to tell if I was put on small projects

00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:27,729
because of my disability, gender, or actual job performance.

00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:32,169
I'm definitely more marginalized for my Judaism and ADHD, but that's only because I have been

00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:37,169
working in queer friendly cities.

00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:40,229
I'm marginalized for both my queerness and my race.

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:42,949
Queer rights isn't an equal playing field.

00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:51,580
Race always had something to do with it.

00:07:51,580 --> 00:08:22,069
Our pain is ignored and dismissed.

00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:25,860
Just after the Pulse nightclub shootings, I mentioned to a co worker that I was going

00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,990
hold a moment of silence at an upcoming all hands.

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,010
My co worker said, I don't think tech companies should take a stance on that kind of thing.

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:38,039
I like the idea of being neutral.

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,779
What the fuck?

00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,329
I didn't say anything because I didn't feel safe to speak up to this person that thinks

00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:50,300
companies shouldn't condemn gun violence against queer people of color.

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,779
Tech is never neutral.

00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,270
And the only way you can think that tech is neutral is if you love in a place of extreme

00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,779
privilege.

00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,120
Tech is a part of this world.

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,550
It always has been.

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,760
[ Applause ] And it shape this is world in a way that no

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,120
industry does in this day and age.

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,310
And, you know, actually, I should say something else on this.

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,709
I actually have my own story with Pulse as well.

00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,040
I had been working at Microsoft for three, four months.

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,580
I was working on a product team before I got into my current role now.

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,500
And Pulse nightclub shooting happened on a weekend.

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,850
And I think every queer person remembers that weekend pretty clearly.

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,700
At least if you were connected to the queer community at that time.

00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,890
I was working on a remote team, something I was grateful for in retrospect.

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,510
And we had a stand up Monday morning.

00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,320
I'm devastated.

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,350
Every queer person I know and talked to was a complete and utter wreck.

00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,990
I hop on the call, a virtual call, thankfully no video.

00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:03,560
I'm barely able to speak, and all the people on the team, all cis straight men, they were

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,750
asking about weekends, laughing and joking as if nothing had happened.

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,890
And like I'm struggling so much already.

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:17,930
And that made me feel so much more alone in that moment.

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,670
Because it was a reminder that, you know, most people aren't queer.

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,680
Most people don't have to deal with that.

00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,670
And most people don't care.

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,209
So, what can tech employers do?

00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:35,040
First, let's talk about hiring.

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,140
And this is just a few things.

00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,829
Like we could spend an entire talk on this alone.

00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:41,100
I'll just give you a couple of things.

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,780
First of all is ignore social media.

00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,120
Like, if you're higher, just don't even look at a person's social media account.

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,930
Because the truth is, if we're going to talk about our daily lives, that means talking

00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,510
about some things that people find controversial.

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:56,760
If we're not going to talk about our daily lives like privileged, straight, cis white

00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:03,389
folks do, we get punished in ways they don't or we have to hide it, which is effectively

00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:04,550
going back in the closet.

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:09,180
If we talk about other marginalizations on top of it, it's even worse.

00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:15,010
On my bio on Twitter, I mention that I'm bi and poly.

00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,010
I try to be out about that.

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,170
But you know what with?

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:22,130
If a bi queer woman, especially of color said the same thing, that would probably disqualify

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:26,010
them from being hired, but not me.

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,490
The other thing is to understand variances in employment history.

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,329
This is especially true for trans folks.

00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:37,980
Because the truth of the matter is queer folks in general have a tougher time finding employment.

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,079
There are more issues we have to deal with.

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,529
And the more marginalized intersections it is, the more difficult.

00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:50,410
People are in bad situations at work and are discriminated and have to leave.

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,079
Especially the more marginalized followings tend to hop jobs.

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:57,420
It's not the fault of the queer folks, but it's the companies.

00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,910
And in hiring, the queer person is punished all the time.

00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,640
We need to stop looking at that.

00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,149
And talk about HR once in the company.

00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:11,370
Implicit bias training.

00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,800
This is kind of an obvious one.

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,020
And there are a lot of problems with current implicit bias trainings.

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,180
But this is still important.

00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,680
We all have biases.

00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,970
This is the nature of the human condition.

00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,220
Every single person has some biases.

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,640
We can't understand everyone's viewpoint in the world.

00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:32,370
We didn't simultaneously grow up in every single country to simultaneously being born

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,889
to dozens of different types of parents.

00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,639
We cannot understand everyone's position innately.

00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:40,040
We don't have the experiences.

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,529
And the best way to get through that is through education.

00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,890
And also, we need to improve implicit bias training.

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,360
And also, we need to take sexual harassment claims seriously.

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,760
This is especially true for clear women.

00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,740
Because this is an issue in the industry for all women.

00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,360
But again, intersectionality.

00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
This comes into play.

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,950
Queer women face even more issues.

00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:08,160
There was I remember a study came out a while ago that showed bi women actually face more

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,029
discrimination than lesbian or straight women as it turns out.

00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:15,600
There's a whole complicated host of reasons for that.

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
But it's true.

00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:21,550
And so, taking these claims seriously benefits queer people especially.

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,930
And people of color and other intersections as well.

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:25,930
Inclusion.

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,079
You know, gender neutral language and bedrooms.

00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:31,850
We have gender neutral bedrooms here at the conference.

00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,649
It's actually part of the venue.

00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:36,339
They didn't do that last minute switch that a lot of conferences did.

00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:40,660
You can do it at a concert venue, you can do it at work.

00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,430
And the same thing with language.

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,430
Don't use he, him in documentation language.

00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,649
Depending on the language, this is a little bit different.

00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:52,430
Some languages it's easier to do gender neutral pronouns than others.

00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:57,710
Regardless, think about what they're talking about in the language and the culture and

00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,210
figure out how to support them with language.

00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,360
Preferred names and pronouns.

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,709
This is important in companies and comes up in a lot of places we don't think about.

00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:13,500
For legal reasons, most companies need your legal name.

00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,300
A trans person, their legal name is often not their real name.

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,840
We need to understand that and propagate that through a system.

00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,690
If you have HR systems to log in, show their preferred name there, not the legal name.

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:33,820
In their email, corporate email account, show your preferred name and not your legal name

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,589
and so on and so forth.

00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,170
Create queer only spaces.

00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,850
I bet a lot of us use Slack at work.

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,500
Make sure in the Slacks there's a queer only space.

00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,130
Same for other marginalizations.

00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,860
We need a space to talk about ourselves where we're not constantly having to do one on one

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,980
education.

00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,089
And let queer people speak and listen.

00:14:57,089 --> 00:14:58,300
Stop speaking and listen.

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,770
Stop thinking you know what's best for queer people at your company.

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,520
Let's back out and talk about tech in the broader queer community.

00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:14,050
This is one of the biggest benefits of tech and the most transformation I have seen.

00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,980
Tech lets us escape our isolation.

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,380
This is a big difference, when I was kid to when I was in college.

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,050
When I was a kid, there was no Internet.

00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,800
Even when I was in high school, it wasn't really there.

00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,870
But now we can actually find community online.

00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,160
And this is deeply powerful.

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,920
Tech makes it easier to find and meet community.

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,320
Grinder, et cetera, make finding like minded people or people with the same sexuality is

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,080
a lot easier than flagging my friend Dorothy.

00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,730
There's a reason, read up on it.

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,910
Tech makes it easier to find porn which helps with sexuality discovery.

00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,910
This is important.

00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,441
A lot of people don't think about it.

00:15:57,441 --> 00:16:02,860
But when we grow up in a society when we are supposed to have a certain orientation, certain

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,100
sexual desires.

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,110
We have to dispel with that.

00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,440
We have to figure something else.

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,230
And interestingly enough, porn is a really good way to do that.

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,889
And porn is tied into tech.

00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:21,610
So, we need to this is so useful in so many ways.

00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,050
Queer folks spend most of our lives in some form of social isolation due to the hostility

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,290
and violation of the cis hetero normative society we are forced to live in.

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:37,339
Having tech for a space to be ourselves and meet people like us matters.

00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:40,760
Tech has a lot of isolated people, allowing them to find thousands or millions of others

00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,589
just like themselves.

00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:47,350
Queer folks of all types have found a large, receptive community to help them feel normalized

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,230
and legitimate.

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:55,009
The trans rights movements has advanced due to the isolated people finding a multitude

00:16:55,009 --> 00:17:01,660
of peers going through the same process.

00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:06,820
But tech asserts its biases on the world.

00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:12,500
I think the biggest harm is training AI systems that incorporate existing bias and then treating

00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,710
those systems as Oracles and always correct.

00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:19,820
Also, unlike with human interactions where you can negotiate, if a tech solution isn't

00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,800
coded to do something, there's no way to do it.

00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,300
If you're a queer, non binary or trans person signing up for a service and they have only

00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:33,630
a male/female check button, you can't talk to the website and have that button appear.

00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,760
It's not there.

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,090
You don't do it.

00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:44,000
It's driven by powerful cis men, and the tech is baked with the world they create.

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,780
And put out into the world via the Internet.

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:57,940
It's a small portion of the straight world who is setting that culture.

00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,521
Tech is also explicit in gentrification.

00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:05,440
Now, gentrification is a complicated topic and there's not just one single cause.

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,120
But tech absolutely does play a role in it.

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,940
Societally some of the safest spaces for queer communities are in big cities like New York

00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:16,830
and San Francisco and, yes, here in Berlin.

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:22,010
However, tech is hyper gentrifying those areas, making it impossible for queer folks to live.

00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,760
When queer folks can't live in places that are safe for them, they have to live in places

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,880
that are not safe for them.

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,530
I live in San Francisco.

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:35,700
My local community pretty much got destroyed by gentrification, along with everything else

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,680
that's good and beautiful.

00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,880
I live in San Francisco.

00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,720
And I have to agree.

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,080
Social media tech refuses to fix hate and bullying.

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,430
Online spaces have been increasingly hostile towards marginalized groups speaking up about

00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,730
their expressions, and that's fucking shitty.

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:03,621
I have seen friends and friends of friends stand up against white supremacists, tech

00:19:03,621 --> 00:19:09,280
doesn't ban the Nazis, they ban the queer people standing up for themselves.

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,200
I've seen this many times.

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,000
The tech industry is profiting from social media platforms that enable harassment of

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,210
queer and trans people as well as spreading fascist ideologies.

00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,350
The tech industry has the power and resources to quarantine harassment and hate speech.

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,850
We do it with Spam in email.

00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:37,780
It's just harassment and hate speech don't affect the white men in charge of the industry.

00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,490
And the harm of viralness is intersectional.

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,500
I think we've all heard various stories in the media about someone does something, says

00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
something, whatever.

00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
It goes viral.

00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,570
And then their lives are ruined.

00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,931
This is compounded by intersectionality.

00:19:52,931 --> 00:19:55,540
There's a lot of stories I could tell.

00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,550
There's actually a very specific story I want to tell, though.

00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:03,980
About two months ago a trans black woman in Dallas, my hometown.

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,310
I grew up in Dallas.

00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:12,800
Her name was Malaysia Booker, assaulted in a parking lot and someone recorded it and

00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,960
it went viral.

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,800
After the attack, she had this to say.

00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,190
This time I can stand before you when I was attacked.

00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:30,570
Whereas in other scenarios, we are at a memorial.

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:52,870
So, what can tech companies do?

00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,980
The first is safety.

00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:56,650
And start by banning the Nazis.

00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,170
Get rid of real name policies.

00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,370
Like Facebook still has a real name policy.

00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:04,480
And I use Facebook, these are not people's real names, they're legal names.

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,790
And I've seen this abused in many ways.

00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:10,740
Trans people are banned from Twitter because they dare to use their real name.

00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,690
And speak out against anti queer legislation.

00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:19,420
We're seeing more and more anti queer legislation in the United States, here in Europe and around

00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,260
the world.

00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,910
And there is precedence for this, by the way.

00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,140
A year or two ago in the United States when some of the really bad anti immigration policy

00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,300
was first being force the through, Microsoft released statements condemning that.

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,240
We should do that with anti queer legislation too.

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,820
And, again, ban the fucking Nazis.

00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,820
It's 2019.

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,920
Why are we having this conversation again?

00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,220
And respect.

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,940
Stop using us as props to promote yourselves.

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:50,660
We are not things in your game.

00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,090
And put your money where your mouth is.

00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,860
Companies will spend tens of thousands of dollars on one float in one pride parade.

00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,290
Yes, they actually cost that much.

00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,290
But you know what?

00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:04,810
They don't give a single dollar to any nonprofit that actually helps queer people.

00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:06,410
They only want to look good.

00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,730
They don't give a shit about us.

00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:13,720
So, like, where will the future take us?

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,990
And, you know, this is something I'm torn on myself.

00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,860
I don't know where we're going to end up in all of this.

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,850
Some days I'm pessimistic.

00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,850
Some days I'm hopeful.

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:26,640
And today I'm going choose to be hopeful, though.

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:35,621
I want to read you some excerpts from a speech from some time ago by Harvey Milk who was

00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,370
a famous queer activist.

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:42,580
And I think he had a lot of really good things to say.

00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,980
Like every other group, we must be judged by our leaders and by those who are themselves

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,140
gay.

00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,270
Those who are visible.

00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:52,260
For invisible, we remain in limbo.

00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,980
A myth.

00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,000
A person with no parents, no brothers, no sisters.

00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,810
No friends who are straight.

00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,030
No important positions in employment.

00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:07,970
The anger and the frustrations that some of us feel is because we are misunderstood.

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,660
And friends can't feel the anger and frustration.

00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,740
They can sense it in us.

00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,410
But they can't feel it.

00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,610
Because a friend has never gone through what is known as coming out.

00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:25,090
I will never forget what it was like coming out and having nobody to look up toward.

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,270
I remember the lack of hope.

00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,750
Our friends can't fulfill it.

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:37,270
I can't forget the looks on faces of people who've lost hope.

00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:40,300
Be they gay, be they seniors.

00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,620
Be they black folks looking for an almost impossible job.

00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:48,380
Be they Latinos trying to explain their problems and aspirations in tongue that's foreign to

00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,740
them.

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,030
I use the word "I" because I'm proud.

00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:59,030
I stand here tonight in front of my gay sisters, brothers and friends because I'm proud of

00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,710
you.

00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:06,700
In San Francisco, three days before gay pride day, a person was killed just because he was

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,430
gay.

00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,170
And that night I walked among the sad and the frustrated at city hall in San Francisco.

00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:17,500
And later that night as they lit candles on Castro Street and stood in silence.

00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,380
Reaching out for some symbolic thing to give them hope.

00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,330
These were strong people.

00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,160
These faces I knew from the shop, the streets, meetings.

00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,520
And people who I never saw before, but I knew.

00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
They were strong.

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,780
But even they needed hope.

00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,830
And the young gay people in the Altoona, Pennsylvanias, and the Richmond, Minnesotas, who are coming

00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:48,530
out and hearing the story on television, the only thing they have to look forward to is

00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,530
hope.

00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,520
And you have to give them hope.

00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,670
Hope for a better world, hope for a better tomorrow.

00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:59,760
Hope for a better place to come to if the pressures at home are too great.

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,220
Hope that all will be all right.

00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:11,560
So, without hope, not only gays, but blacks, Asians, seniors, the handicapped, the uses.

00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,070
The uses will give up.

00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:20,540
If there's a message I have to give, is that I found one overriding thing about my personal

00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:24,380
election, if a gay person can be elected, it's a green light.

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:40,610
And you and you and you you have to give 'em hope.

00:25:40,610 --> 00:26:00,690
Thank you.

00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:10,730
