00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:55,379
who's using it okay that's good so the

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,140
other ones are using any other

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:08,840
frameworks or completely new to web

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:08,840
development or I know yes - all okay

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:25,830
okay so really all yeah okay okay yeah

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:32,820
it's just a good question for us because

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:36,930
and we want to also - - to prepare our

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,640
talks and to our audience so yeah if new

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:45,659
people are here who doesn't have any

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:50,159
futures and from future as knowledge

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,930
thank you yeah it's easier for us to say

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,360
okay we want to focus more on the

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:58,049
general stuff and the beginner stuff and

00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,799
yeah that's why I'm asking and who used

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:06,390
already future as who already deployed

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm just projects on some server okay so

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:13,860
most of you okay so this talk is about

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,830
the magic black box because

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:22,490
or cloud so when you just put in stuff

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:25,920
and it magically works and yeah it's

00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:28,290
what we will cover is we will cover

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,100
different available cloud providers so

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:34,740
there's a lot of services out there we

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,310
will see a difference okay which one is

00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,770
easy to use especially for developers we

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,709
will also use a local repository and

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,570
upload it to different services and I

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:48,330
will also give you a tip how you can

00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:51,660
appoint you to me in via CloudFlare to

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:56,690
do to this service as you can also have

00:02:51,660 --> 00:03:00,420
some ssl in the background for free so

00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:03,390
yeah our main character is our own

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,950
website so who sees it for the first

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:11,430
time okay damn it so we have to do more

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:15,000
marketing and to shared more so just go

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:18,570
to futures - Vienna org

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:24,720
we will also post when the next meetup

00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:29,220
is is happening and this also called for

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,310
actions so it's not much information on

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,380
there so if you have time if you I don't

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,209
know if you need a new hobby if you

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,299
don't want to learn from university or

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:39,720
if you are put aboard at work could also

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,489
happen

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:47,400
feel free to fork it you can create a

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:49,260
pull request and there's a lot to do for

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,320
this website so I don't know which just

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,320
maybe want to show also the videos that

00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,840
are recorded here online we can also

00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,000
have some kind of type feedback so any

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,209
eight years and that you come up it's

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,769
highly appreciate to enhance this

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:09,690
website and yeah so yeah and it's also

00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,640
really nice because if you do a pull

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,290
because you can finally widen your CV

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,470
that you're an open source collaborator

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:19,530
which also sounds really fancy so just a

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:24,630
tip from my side so feel free to play

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:26,490
around and yeah the first question comes

00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,150
to my mind when I'm starting a new

00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,460
approach

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,620
for work not refer back but for hobby

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,919
Portuguese okay it's running locally

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,020
perfectly fine as I'm expecting it but I

00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:39,389
want to show it to colleagues to family

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,930
to my grandma and say hey it's so

00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:46,229
awesome check this out and the so many

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:50,340
service providers and I've no idea which

00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:53,060
one I should use so any cloud hosting

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:58,710
names what comes in your mind

00:04:53,060 --> 00:05:06,180
digitalocean yes that's one what also a

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:08,639
good one yes if we get an extra slice of

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:14,190
pizza okay okay who also wants some

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:18,330
pizza fire paste exactly

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:22,350
Google cloud yes so there really a lot

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:24,720
of services online who say the kids the

00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:32,340
best one and use me as a service

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:36,930
provider and yeah so I just put some

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:39,360
logs on there so we could I don't spend

00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:42,900
days with uploading images because every

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,300
new month some I know startup is calling

00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:48,419
his of the best cloud provider

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,270
whatsoever and they will focus also on

00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:54,060
some of those and see in real time now

00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,669
if our demo project how easy it can be

00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,010
to deploy it online and I can also

00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:01,229
recommend this one here of course that

00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:05,449
we also check out later

00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:07,460
is anybody already using the IBM cloud

00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:13,340
okay okay

00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:13,340
could be more but we can't change that

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:21,720
okay so let's be honest there are lot of

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:24,590
logos there and everyone is telling you

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,760
okay use me and the best one and I

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:31,560
personally can't really tell the

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:34,349
difference between between those so we

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,969
could now spend the next I don't know 30

00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:41,190
or 45 minutes just to go and fuey

00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:42,780
to exactly point all the keys

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,240
because this merchant just want this

00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,750
much but it's so flexible and high

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:52,020
scalability whatever part and think that

00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:58,410
we're all here to hear this boring topic

00:06:52,020 --> 00:07:00,900
so we will jump in and try view cloud

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,090
providers and with the seal eyes and

00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,710
that they are providing and just see

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:09,270
okay

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:12,120
is it good or not so yeah the first one

00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:14,580
is watch it's creating you a finding on

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,530
the market since I know one year and

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,420
they're also selling them themselves was

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,730
aesthetic that publishing for front-end

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,940
developers so it seems really awesome

00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:26,640
for us so they also say okay to have a

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:30,060
lot of deployments and terabytes of data

00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:33,090
published and you can also see if you go

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,890
on different github projects that a lot

00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,490
of them are using it for the

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:40,860
documentation or just a landing page and

00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:45,240
they also tell us okay MPM install our

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:48,300
globally our search NPM package one

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,510
search and that's it so let's check this

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,510
out

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,700
yep okay let's mirror it so we have here

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,370
our website

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:06,080
that's um I can show it to you again

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:10,500
this fancy looking website and I I

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:16,770
already did it but we do you to know to

00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:18,330
search you shouldn't take that long

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:25,650
because I already did it

00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:29,210
I mean now one such so you just looked

00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,210
on I forgot something

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:47,070
yeah sure okay if there's no fine for

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:51,570
you so yeah before we want to deploy it

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:54,370
we also want to want built so I'm using

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:57,160
the few CLI

00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,930
and it's important they're also watching

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,680
it on the documentation site that you

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:05,260
have to run this command in the and the

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,610
folder that will be that it's already

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:12,060
compiled and stuff like that

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:15,100
so CD dist that's our place and

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:20,110
onesearch so the first time it will ask

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:23,710
you for username and password and that's

00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:29,050
it so far so we can also say ok we want

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:32,589
to call it like few GS - Vienna does

00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:36,640
your dot H you can type in whatever you

00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:40,540
want if it's not taken we upload it it

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:45,820
says ok success we will check it already

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:52,510
opened it it runs easy-peasy

00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:57,690
so yeah there's nothing more to say so I

00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,690
can really recommend you this one so

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:05,890
what's next who heard about sighted co

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:10,600
dot now ok one two three

00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:15,160
ok they're also I'm selling themselves

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:16,990
as SS cloud platform so you can also run

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,290
your go scripts your lambda functions

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:27,310
whatsoever in there but we still use it

00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:31,720
for our static sites no so basically you

00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:34,600
just also installed no package and and

00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,690
then you have an out or JSON file and

00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:41,230
you describe the version so other

00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:43,420
version would be version 2 of gif the

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:45,940
API you can also use version 1 but

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,220
doesn't really make sense we also can

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,580
specify a name so it will create

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,550
automatically in the now dashboard

00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:57,730
platform and your project for you and

00:10:53,550 --> 00:11:01,089
also will create the correct sub to me

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:04,750
we can also specify where the build

00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:07,510
package is located and where are our

00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:09,670
routes are located

00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,800
we can also the documentation is really

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,740
huge so we can specify if you want to

00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,770
enable cash or not and whatsoever so I

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:24,160
kept it really simple and you also have

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:25,450
to do um p.m. scrip so we can also can

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,320
also show it

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:32,500
that's our NPM script if you don't add

00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:36,160
this it will break so that's really

00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,960
important and that's it so I can show

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,960
you again the now Chasen

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:45,880
it's like in a screenshot and I also

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:51,540
created a script name for that so we

00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:57,390
just run the building script again and

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:59,770
yeah probably publish it too now so NPM

00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:03,370
that's the only difference between

00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:05,650
storage and site now that we have to run

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,360
this in the root 4 because if we aren't

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:11,580
at this forward you wouldn't recognize

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:15,550
the NPN command obviously so NPM run

00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:18,670
know it's built

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:21,040
we might need some elevator music in the

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:23,770
background I don't think that it won't

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:28,930
take that that long so he's already

00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:32,110
uploading it and you also have now a

00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:35,770
fancy dashboard and you can see that we

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:39,970
just triggered a new deployment so for

00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:42,970
more complex applications weak useful

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:47,830
because you can see all the specific

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:50,110
steps he's doing also if some errors are

00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:54,040
I'm coming up during the deployment you

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:57,330
can see in real time yeah so it's really

00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:02,770
nice and you can do a lot of it also

00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:07,360
cited Co is offering more services they

00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:09,880
have networking service someday no have

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:15,090
here little cheat sheet you can set up

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:16,750
domains and come specify SSL and coffee

00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:21,890
[Music]

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:26,570
more options for the main and SNL stuff

00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:30,950
like that so yeah it really makes a cute

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:34,600
first look so in the background it's

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,600
still building

00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:48,740
hey-ho and if it's finished it will

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:55,090
automatically refresh the page and shows

00:13:48,740 --> 00:14:00,650
it to us so we list wait for word the

00:13:55,090 --> 00:14:02,570
focus is also on developers so five more

00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:11,330
seconds and we should see it in

00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:17,540
production okay that was it so that was

00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:21,920
also really easy I think yeah so as next

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:29,839
topic we have Amazon as free who is

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:38,000
using it for static hosting sometimes

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:40,970
okay okay so the big advantage of Amazon

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,550
s3 is obviously if you have a large

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:45,740
ecosystem and if you have I don't know

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,870
docker containers and databases and

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,740
stuff like that running it's much easier

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:56,089
to integrate all two service into ones

00:14:50,740 --> 00:15:02,480
so that's maybe an good way or you have

00:14:56,089 --> 00:15:04,460
think why you have to do it so but it's

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,190
also really easy if you don't have that

00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:10,280
huge ecosystem and just want to try it

00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:14,390
out so basically you just looking with

00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:17,510
your Amazon credentials you choose as

00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:19,360
free service you can create a pocket so

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:26,690
in this case we created if if

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:29,540
www.fewdoit.com forward you have not

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:33,049
that much possibility to set up

00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:35,329
so okay you can set up that you're

00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:39,230
automatically creating different

00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:40,939
versions for each deployment or don't I

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,119
don't know you want to unlock some

00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:46,040
access whatsoever but the interesting

00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:49,040
point for us is that you can also

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,829
specify some static website hosting so

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,949
in this case we just specify this the

00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:57,949
disp specific packet is hosting a

00:15:54,949 --> 00:16:00,649
website so we say okay the entry point

00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:03,949
is the index.html we can also specify

00:16:00,649 --> 00:16:06,649
that we have our dot HTML so in this

00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:12,279
case it would be I know 4 4 or whatever

00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:14,660
you name it and that's it basically so

00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:17,600
that's the first setup you have to do

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:21,499
before you do any stuff in your kit

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,499
repository so I personally can recommend

00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:26,149
this NPM package so you can see it it's

00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:29,720
down it's getting down with a lot of

00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:35,329
times per week and it's a kind of famous

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:39,709
and so we just install it in your

00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:47,480
repository NPM install - - safe sv -

00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:51,230
deploy and we also created an NPM script

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,600
here so again we are running the new

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,720
build that's one of the thing I'm always

00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,559
forgetting so I'm deploying stuff online

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,649
and I'm thinking why the hell doesn't it

00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:06,079
work and after 20 mins I'm coming to the

00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:08,480
realization okay damn it I forgot to

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,089
build it so that's why it's always in

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:16,069
where's our script I'm a lazy guy also

00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:20,510
and basically we just also specify where

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:23,449
our bills or production build is located

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:25,490
the signature version here is important

00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:29,450
because that was one of the pitfalls I

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:30,919
fell in because if you're hosting you

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,149
can choose for the packet in which

00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:37,250
region you want to host it so it can be

00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:40,419
America US they have a lot of different

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:42,940
regions to choose but also I'm thankful

00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:45,580
Londyn whatsoever and if you want to

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:49,450
host it which makes sense in Europe you

00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:53,080
have to specify the signature version v4

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:56,019
otherwise it won't work and then again

00:17:53,080 --> 00:18:00,129
we specify the name of the packet that

00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:04,989
we previously created I also installed

00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:07,690
the AWS CLI tool so I don't have to type

00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:09,669
in every time my secret pass and

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:14,590
whatsoever so it gets saved on your

00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:23,859
computer and that's it and then we can

00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:28,570
also run NPM one type or s3 and in the

00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:33,279
background it's running we can show it

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:36,609
to you so the overview we can see the

00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:40,960
files that are getting uploaded it's now

00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:42,879
running in the background you can yeah

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,049
we said there is a static website

00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:49,119
hosting and it's also important to

00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:53,049
specify that everyone can read this

00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:55,480
bucket so by default it's it's the

00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:58,090
settings are for false so if you would

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,249
now go to the link that you're getting

00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,919
so if you go here you can see okay

00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:05,529
that's the link directive that we are

00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:07,139
getting provided from Amazon you would

00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:09,639
see that you don't have any access

00:19:07,139 --> 00:19:14,590
credentials so that's also a good tip

00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:17,739
from my side and what I also did is I

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:20,350
created a second packet which is just

00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:22,720
call without that www and this is

00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:25,299
because I will also show that to you

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,690
later on that I set up

00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:33,879
Auto mean by a CloudFlare so if anybody

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:39,039
enters without www we specified that you

00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:43,889
should redirect all the traffic to the

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:49,269
correct bucket but nothing more to setup

00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:52,330
and we can see in the background ok he's

00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:53,680
also checking if we are we up loading so

00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,900
to save

00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:59,020
fake checks okay is it really new or not

00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:04,290
that can't kind of helpful because

00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:07,780
you're paying at Amazon pure gigabyte so

00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:10,450
but my experience I'm hosting a few

00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:14,260
websites and it cost me about two cents

00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:17,880
a month so it's kind of free and but

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:20,590
it's always a nice feature of them so

00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,810
yeah we could also go on a few cheers -

00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:31,720
viendo talk and see it's okay it's

00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:33,690
working okay and then we have our IBM

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:39,670
cloud of course

00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:43,270
so yeah that's also a question of the

00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:46,030
ecosystem I'm using because we are

00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:49,210
obviously using a lot and it also makes

00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:51,490
sense because we have a lot of micro

00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,590
services running up there and as I said

00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,150
it's really easy to connect all those

00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:59,800
things if they are on the same network

00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:02,620
and so on and service provider and yeah

00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:05,020
you have a lot of stuff you can do with

00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,890
the IBM cloud it goes from using Watson

00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:12,510
is an AI system you can set up your

00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:17,110
blockchain yeah almost everything and

00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:22,780
they were doing it really well and yeah

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:27,190
I've my patch here but we are using is

00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:35,880
the SDK for node GS and it's a little

00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:40,720
bit yeah okay yeah so what we will do is

00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:43,270
you can create a new service and type in

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,000
the app name hostname which domain you

00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:48,580
want to have it at the end you have to

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,470
choose organization stuff like that to

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,570
organize all those services because it

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:56,230
can happen that you will suddenly have

00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:58,660
30 services and you don't know which one

00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,460
is doing that so if you're doing it real

00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:04,600
in production make sense to have it

00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:07,250
separated and you choose a pricing pen

00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:10,250
once again it's zero points you

00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:18,110
fifth five to six euros per gigabyte per

00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:22,880
hour so you're almost free so there's

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:26,930
one tricky thing to do because IBM cloud

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:29,840
doesn't support yet the service to just

00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:33,740
host all static files that we need so

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,690
via using the SDK from the OGS and you

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:39,920
have to set up a few things and I will

00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:43,100
show it to you once again in the

00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:48,020
repository so the first thing you can do

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:51,440
is manifested Yammer let's in find where

00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:53,930
you can specify the chart phone tree

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,840
service name so if you want this year.i

00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:59,690
tool just say okay C F partial I pushed

00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,820
you don't have to enter every time the

00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,370
whole name of the application and can

00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:07,880
also set up the memory you want to use

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:13,340
so normally 64 megabytes in this case we

00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:17,810
have two 128 megabytes just to be on the

00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:20,330
safe side for this demo but it doesn't

00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:26,170
really need much so you can also save

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:29,920
money on this and we can also specify a

00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:32,630
CF ignore so when we deploy it we won't

00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:36,500
deploy or upload the node modules

00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:39,200
because yeah you know you do an imp and

00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,940
install and you only have 500 packages

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,220
you know you have no idea where

00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:48,530
companies just need them and it takes a

00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:51,920
lot of space so we can save that and you

00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:56,960
have here we created server dot Jas and

00:23:51,920 --> 00:24:00,140
this use we have to use it because we

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,000
use the SDK for no GS and if we won't do

00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,640
that

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,280
he wouldn't know that he has to open the

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:11,240
index dot HTML so we are just pointing

00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,970
every request that is coming to our test

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:15,670
folder to the index dot HTML and list on

00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,679
the port 8080 so really straightforward

00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:20,400
just a minute or Express and you're good

00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:31,110
to go

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:34,800
so so we can also know and PM IBM and it

00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:37,380
built again and then it was our CF push

00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:40,890
what I already mentioned in the

00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:43,350
background you can see okay he's

00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:45,870
crapping the manifest that ya know he

00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:49,080
already knows okay that's the service

00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:53,309
name that we want to use this quote

00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:56,760
memory whatsoever and you get the locks

00:24:53,309 --> 00:25:00,090
on what he is doing and the cool thing

00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,850
is that the cloud from visualize also

00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:07,200
providing a lot of tools we can I know

00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:09,960
get the latest logs if anything stopped

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,820
working or if anything broke during the

00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,670
deployment like when you're concerned

00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:19,020
you don't have to go like we have to do

00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:21,630
in the site calm dot CEO website

00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:25,920
directly on the end clicker keep iran so

00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:29,490
if everything in one place and if you

00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:32,550
know would go to our application you can

00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:34,950
see that it's running we can also scale

00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:37,380
it updates all the one is a feature from

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,090
the IBM cloud see if you can see okay

00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:50,460
you have a lot of requests click the

00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:55,440
plus button and that's it so I was a

00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:58,530
pretty straightforward and what I did

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:01,350
for our website is because I bought it

00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:07,320
for example on name chicom it's really

00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:10,679
easy and yeah doesn't cost much and you

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,510
can set up CloudFlare to point for

00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,740
example we are hosting the website on

00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:20,309
Amazon s3 said there's a cname so if we

00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:22,880
now type in WWWE it would point to our

00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:25,760
alias and that would also point to our

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,670
website and that's one of the easiest

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:33,720
ways to also provide SSL for free

00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:36,360
without any setup to yourself and your

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:43,440
colleagues or whoever is using this

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:46,350
application okay if I will share this

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,950
presentation also on twitter twitter as

00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:52,290
i mentioned and if you have any further

00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:55,170
questions i can recommend the

00:26:52,290 --> 00:27:01,010
documentation of future CLI so you have

00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:04,380
step by step tool about every common

00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:07,410
cloud service so it also tells you how

00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:11,760
you do a tip alone on github pages which

00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:14,670
is possible and Heroku what we already

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,740
heard and stuff like that so get

00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:22,980
generally the futures documentation is

00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:25,640
really good on point and yeah so that's

00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:29,309
it so far thanks

00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,309
