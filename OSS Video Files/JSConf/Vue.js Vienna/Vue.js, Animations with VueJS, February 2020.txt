	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,040
so my presentation was called like

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:06,960
animation with vue.js and at the end it

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,790
will be like yes but it's still vue.js

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,080
so white called the TBD this is this

00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:15,750
presentation the recycled from the

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,480
script Kampf where I was giving this

00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,789
presentation on the warmup even the day

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,640
before and I saw of course I forgot the

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,490
name the the presentation I didn't send

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,920
anything so they invent life with TBD

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,859
and then I came with the name transition

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,649
by design and basically we will be it

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,809
will be guide to dark J's and we will be

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,480
using a lot e which is a pretty cool

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,450
JavaScript library with you with that

00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:47,129
you can do a great magic and then gem

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:49,860
stacks just a quick showcase how gems

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,449
tech is cool so let's jump into it if

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,579
you want to follow me also there is like

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,960
the link for you and this presentation

00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:00,180
is yeah that's from the view G's meter

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,250
this is me I'm a big star Wars fan and I

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,530
was working like a Friday night for a

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,650
few years in Switzerland Germany mostly

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,869
and then I was also working and talking

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,180
about the design ups and design systems

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,360
and nowadays I'm del relish in them the

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,650
relationships some I'm like develop

00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,560
advocated story blog which is the

00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,020
company I left the tea set for sorry but

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,700
is yeah it Starbuck is a headless iam as

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,600
I was using for more than two years it's

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:30,119
really cool product which I really love

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,979
so I'm advocating for storyboard huge as

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,450
an actress and if we want to talk about

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,040
the real Star Wars then come to me we

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,850
want to talk about the new starett don't

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,619
don't come to me as we are going to talk

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:43,799
about the animation today and I have

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,390
only 35 minutes there is the best way to

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,399
show the animation or talk about them

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,530
you should show them so at first I would

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,579
like to show you the website I created

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:56,369
like in 2016 or 17 which is built

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,860
without any al girl and goulart vue.js

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,530
react any framework out there it was a

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,750
simple library called smooth jazz and

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,079
vanalai javascript and of course some

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,619
hat Amala and CSS this website is

00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,200
basically

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,690
oh I didn't want to click there the

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,120
website is built like in 180

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,430
hours it's a all I will show you it's

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,820
like the whole website there is nothing

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:24,070
more and what was the reason why I'm

00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,630
showing it's like it's there the smooth

00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,600
transition between the pages there are

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,790
no there is not like hard reload there's

00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,620
always like fading animation or leaving

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:36,010
addition of all the elements and then

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:39,400
the older parts of the websites coming

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:42,430
to the view slowly so if we for example

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,040
go to the projects and then we are going

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,470
to show like one of the project then

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,830
there is like some intro because the

00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:53,230
company is like creating a short ads and

00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,240
videos and then if we go to the next

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,370
project and everything's moved to the

00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:02,260
left and the next project should come

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:04,030
from beginning and it was like 80 100 80

00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,650
hours it's like a lot of time a lot of

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,820
small adjustment and what I showed you

00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:14,380
that this all nowadays every agency

00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:16,750
won't have it's called cultural website

00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:18,730
so basically basically show the culture

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,730
so they are creating a special website

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,830
and this was one of the last projects I

00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,650
worked on in one of the agencies I've

00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,120
worked and the website is like if you

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,770
scroll down they're coming the

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,980
allegation from the bottom it is

00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:35,080
continue scrolling come on it's not

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,580
working now of course because I don't

00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,680
have a mouse and on the director is

00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,500
there it'll be tricky then we can jump

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,180
to the next page the URL is always

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,130
changing but there is like no feeling

00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,930
that we are changing the website sorry

00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,630
the pages that's the point

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,180
so if I go really fast down there's

00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,070
another and then it's also starting the

00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,370
contact loading and the next page coming

00:03:54,070 --> 00:04:01,450
from the bottom if I go into the menu

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,760
and go to second chapter where it will

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,590
more visible and then go to home then

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,970
there will be lot also something like an

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,670
animation or transition between the

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:12,100
pages and my talk will be about that how

00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:16,630
to create this kind of animation

00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:18,489
transitions very easy and quickly so

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:21,729
that's what click and little tasting and

00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:24,160
now we will need to cover some basic and

00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:26,320
theory and that is the you should know

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,460
something about the css3 transitions and

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,139
animations of course

00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,210
which I think it's pretty basics and

00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:34,539
everybody who knows and heard about css3

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,650
should know about that then I'm going to

00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:37,300
show you the amazing view just

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,789
documentation and why I'm showing you

00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,590
the documentation of the Blue Jays yes I

00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:43,300
could copy all that stuff into my

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,310
presentation but the next time you will

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,229
need to find this information you will

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,330
have to look for my presentation that's

00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:51,639
a little bit damaging so it's better to

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:56,050
show it into documentation as I think

00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,669
the documentation of the UGS is one of

00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:59,680
the best documentation I've ever seen

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:02,770
there is there are few chapters about

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,830
the transitions in the villages and the

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,780
basics are that in the view just exit

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,570
the wrapper component which is called

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,860
transition and using this transition

00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,530
component you can create those

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,050
animations I already showed you so how

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,530
it work it's pretty simple basically in

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:22,930
your template you just use transition

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,789
you can go you can give it a name with

00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,340
property name in this case its fate and

00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:30,250
then inside of this transition wrapper

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:35,320
component is the one P tag hello with

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:37,810
content hello with a condition we just

00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,280
like taking care of that if it's shown

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,110
or not

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,810
then of course we have to initialize

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,610
data that in this case is like the show

00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,909
and the default starting value is true

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:52,080
and then we just write these six lines

00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:54,940
of the CSS which will take care of the

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,800
transition or animation and in this case

00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,310
we will be changing the opacity in 500

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,349
milliseconds and after that we can

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,389
toggle that element so what is here

00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:06,190
happening is only that transition is

00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:08,199
like the wrapper component which will

00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:11,770
show you the content and we'll apply

00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:15,280
those class some classes on the element

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:17,530
or component inside of it so let's make

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,570
it a little bit with explanation and

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,580
little bit theory there will be six

00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,310
classes it's a we enter we enter active

00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:28,000
we enter to win to leave we leave active

00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:30,330
we live to the we in this case will be

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,699
replaced by faith and these classes are

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:37,659
added by the vue.js into your HTML code

00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:39,849
in some order in the text so at the

00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:41,560
start it will be if you are entering

00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:43,389
than and beginning it will be

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,300
diandra because that's the stage start

00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:49,720
so it on this diagram you can see it

00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:52,540
then during the whole transition there

00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:56,500
will be under active and at the end you

00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:58,419
will be going to the we enter to so in

00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,720
the our case I'm going from opposite is

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:03,580
0 to opacity:1 and why in the CSS is not

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,230
defined the opposite II one is because

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,950
the opposite II 1 is the default state

00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:12,190
of the CSS for the opposite e so we

00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:14,830
don't define it it's one that's it and

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:19,630
the same thing wise versa it's for the

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:21,400
Leo ok basics so if we don't change

00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,340
anything in template and anything in

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:33,310
script and we change of the CSS so we

00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:37,540
will write some different sorry so we

00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:39,130
will write a different transition for

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,729
the entering so we will define the three

00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:44,740
hundred millisecond and timing function

00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:46,630
will be easy and for the leaving we will

00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,390
define an eight hundred millisecond and

00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:52,750
Quebec Bezier will be a function then we

00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:54,640
will get something like this so the

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,890
leaving is much longer as the entering

00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,080
and in this case we also define the

00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:02,710
transfer so we are always going to right

00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,720
side it's yeah also your right side so

00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,460
we are leaving very slowly

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,360
it'll millisecond entering very fast

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:12,190
from the right that's the basic we can

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,080
do a lot of stuff there are JavaScript

00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:16,240
hoops you can integrate green socks you

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,760
can library which is a great library for

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,220
the animations you can also do it do

00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,490
this with the keyframes and start the

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,320
animation is in keyframes but one more

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,710
important stuff here is that you can

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:32,560
also do it between the elements and in

00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:34,930
this case we have a transition which

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,050
contains two components or two elements

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:40,959
one is a table and one is a p-tech but

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:43,150
there is a weave which is basically that

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,310
if there is a content for the table we

00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,930
will show the table but if there is no

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:48,040
content and we will show the p-tech

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,430
which is saying that there is no

00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,740
continuity table the point here is that

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:55,150
the transition wrapper component can

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,460
show only one element

00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:00,340
one time so there cannot be like true

00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:04,030
for ball of this element inside keep it

00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,800
in mind if there are if we are changing

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,420
between these two elements inside the

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,080
transition element a transition

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:14,530
component wrapper we we can define also

00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,230
the mode transition modes and that's the

00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,720
last thing from the basics of the theory

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,810
which I need you to understand and this

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,400
is our three modes also like the

00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,930
documentation is basically saying there

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,940
are two modes but there are three mode

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:31,060
the first mode is like undefined

00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,980
if you don't define any mode then

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,930
basically you're entering classes and

00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:38,380
leaving classes are applied in one time

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:39,910
in the same time so if one element or

00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:41,950
component is entering the screen and

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,050
another is leaving there will be in the

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,540
same time happening so it's like here if

00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,550
you see there is a override on the

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:51,610
on/off button and there is no way like

00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:54,070
between the buttons that there is an

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:57,250
empty screen if I go a little bit down

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:59,890
down you I will show this sample what is

00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:02,530
here happening is like it used out in

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:04,570
mode so at first are applied leaving

00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:07,150
classes on the existing element and

00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:10,270
after that are enter entering classes

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:11,920
applied on the entering element so for a

00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,890
short time there is like nothing on the

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:18,070
screen kind of if we would use a mode in

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,560
out at first we would enter the screen

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,270
and after the entering is done then we

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,580
will start leaving the screen and that

00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,470
would look like like this if we talk

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:28,740
about the buttons so at first the button

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,300
is coming from the right side and then

00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,850
after the entering is done the button is

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:37,300
leaving to the left

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:43,480
these were basics so let's start with

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:44,800
the noxious more documentation so now

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,230
I'm just building on the UGS

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,690
documentation is using this already a

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:52,270
theory I already showed you and there

00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:54,940
are the pages and the every page in the

00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:57,730
next J's at the end is only a component

00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,470
it's like funny way to define the

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:01,990
component but is nothing else just

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,700
making a abstraction layer for us to

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:08,110
make it easier and faster to create a

00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:10,570
new page so by default

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:13,089
there is already different a transition

00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:16,240
between all the pages in the 90s so if

00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:18,640
you define at CSS for it you will get

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,589
the very smooth transitions between the

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,589
pages as I showed this in the samples on

00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:26,470
the beginning you can do this by

00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:30,220
defining the transition in the each page

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,930
by string object or function but if I

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,329
scroll a little bit down you will find

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:37,810
out that by default default is called

00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:39,910
page and the default mode is mode is out

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:43,029
in that's very important to know that

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,440
there is already defined mode not in the

00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:47,620
view jazz is not a different mode

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,390
normally and there's one more special

00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,579
special things about the view J's and

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:54,190
not J sorry that there is the layout and

00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:56,079
now if you don't know about an access

00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,630
just think about the layout it's another

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,970
lever layer of the component which is

00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,459
very poor for the pages so if you watch

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,350
every page have a defined layer layout

00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:07,720
and if you change in between the pages

00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,000
you can apply the transitions but if you

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,279
changing the layout also then you cannot

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,649
transition between the pages because you

00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:16,750
change the wrapper of those layout pages

00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:19,630
so you have two different animation

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,670
between the layer layouts that's it but

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,970
the same principle as the pages is

00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:29,079
already some default and you can define

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:33,160
the mode name also like function etc so

00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:36,130
I promise that was all the little bit

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:40,120
boring stuff now we jump to the some

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:45,180
code and the transitions so where's my

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:47,470
coat here tell me if it's too small and

00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,769
if you can read it can you read it on

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:53,680
the black screen if I show you code so

00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:56,980
let's show you next config is it

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,870
readable okay cool and everybody is ok

00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,130
does the black screen I shouldn't change

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:06,850
it to the white screen or something

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:12,880
either ok let's start our next how many

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:16,300
of you used already next yes ok you will

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,459
understand so now I started my local

00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,589
environment for the Nexus this is just

00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:22,040
the starting template of the knife just

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:24,019
with little bit added pay

00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,949
pages and component really nothing

00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:31,339
complicated and there is like stss as

00:13:27,949 --> 00:13:33,889
the CSS framework or if it's framework

00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:35,449
and that's it what I am going to show

00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:37,639
you is like if I go to the first page

00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:39,769
then the page is coming from bottom next

00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:41,720
page is coming from the bottom and next

00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:42,380
page coming from the bottom if I go to

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,990
back home

00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,300
two black rectangles offering the screen

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:49,009
and then we are the home page or as I

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:54,589
call it now intro page if you look here

00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:56,779
up so how this happening what I need to

00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:58,370
do to do this so at first I will look in

00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:00,350
the next config how I called the

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,360
transition so you look here in the

00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:05,389
transition there is a page transition

00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:09,500
and I name it default and mode is like

00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:13,430
undefined or an testing empty string so

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:17,839
then I have a page first I think and

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:21,079
there is no magic happening that's just

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:24,290
the content so let's show you the CSS

00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:28,730
for the pages if I am navigating between

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:33,829
the pages I have these 26 lines of the

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:35,750
code okay here 26 lines of code and

00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:38,300
that's it that's the whole own image

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,819
that's all the code which is taking care

00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:44,870
of the animation between those pages

00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:46,399
from up to down so if I what I am doing

00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,740
here is like I am creating the class

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,389
default under active I'm changing the

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,680
opacity and the transform if I'm

00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:57,079
entering the screen then I'm fixed and I

00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,829
moved the entering page and the default

00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:03,500
like right beneath the screen and then

00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:08,120
if I'm leaving so the original page is

00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:10,069
leaving to opacity 0.2 and it will be

00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,329
little bit slower because it's leaving

00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:16,579
only the 80% of the screen height and of

00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:19,399
course the entering page is going just

00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:23,269
to the like to the top where it should

00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:25,730
be so let's prove it let's make it a

00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:29,360
little bit slower so now you could see

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:31,880
it was rebuilt and now if I click on the

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,199
first you can see the leaving page is

00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,180
little bit slower as the entering page

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,800
and it's the opposite is always like

00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,670
still

00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:43,810
there that's it so that was the code but

00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:50,170
I can show it even better if I go to the

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:53,649
code yes and I will show you the layout

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:55,750
and there's the main and if I click on

00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:57,790
the next page then there will be a two

00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,260
mains one way and one main will be

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,600
applied the leaving classes and

00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:05,320
understand on the second one will be

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,329
applied entering classes so now you can

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,820
see this is the living and this is the

00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:12,279
end drink so enter active and enter to

00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,440
for a short moment on the beginning

00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:17,260
there was applied also the class default

00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:23,370
enter but it's like very very short time

00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:25,899
it's called tick one tick in next so

00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:30,070
let's do a little bit experiment with it

00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:34,930
if I define the mode here so out let me

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:37,839
yeah let's first in out so the first is

00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:43,720
it mean out should be rebuilt very fast

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,920
we can see it in the right corner and no

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:49,420
it's not happening

00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:52,240
sometimes happen so now we are just at

00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:56,680
first entering and then after the enter

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,959
is done so at this moment it's happening

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,060
the leaving I didn't prepare for this

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,160
case because it was not the point of it

00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,780
so you can also write this better CSS

00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,990
and then it would not happen this one

00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:10,780
but if I show you the code that I'm

00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:13,059
lying to you then there is the main so

00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:16,990
if I click the next page only the

00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:19,360
entering classes are entered and as soon

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,790
as it's done then here will be added the

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,459
leaving classes and the entering cards

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:29,470
are removed and that's why this is like

00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:31,540
fall apart if I change the mode there to

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:39,070
out in there will be like one big

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:41,770
difference and the big difference will

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:45,340
be that in the code we will see only one

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:47,380
main and this is because we are at first

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,360
entering the leaving classes so we don't

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,390
need to have the entering element

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,640
and after this and living is done then

00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,830
we just switch the mains and at the

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,390
entering classes and this is basically

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,429
the whole trick you can use for a lot of

00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,770
different animations or transition

00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:07,150
between the pages so let's move it

00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:09,190
because we don't have a lot of time so

00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:12,190
in the neck Jess as you can see I

00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:13,960
deferred defined the defined the default

00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,030
but if I'm going to back to the

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,160
interpreter this to blue electron go

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:20,890
spinning the screen how to do that

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,419
let's jump into the interview this is

00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:28,929
the page just written in the view Jess

00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:31,450
it's in pages and here I just defined

00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:33,520
for this one page the name the

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:36,010
transition named intro and mode with out

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,400
in because I'm filling the screen with

00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:41,919
the black rectangles so I don't need to

00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,480
have both of the mains in the screen at

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,210
first I would just leave and then I

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,400
enter if I go to the transitions CSS

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:51,940
transition then this is also like 20

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,980
around 26 lines of code and basically I

00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,919
just did it with the beaver after with

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,600
little delay if we are leaving then we

00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:00,400
filling the screen with the black and if

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,640
we are entering we are starting with the

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:08,110
black filled in and leaving of the black

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:15,130
rectangles so I now did it like little

00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:18,160
bit slower it should be already done and

00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:22,690
yes now you can see how very slowly it's

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:28,090
filling and I'm not fast enough I should

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:31,210
show it to you so one more time so now

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:33,480
you will see there is like the same

00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:36,580
thing it is that just the leaving

00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,860
it's only a second wait is taking ages

00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,080
and then behind the curtain with switch

00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:43,900
domains and this is the trick which a

00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:48,640
lot of the pages are using our website

00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:51,760
out there okay but there is one

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,280
important stuff and that if you saw a

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,040
lot of pages like the pre loaders so we

00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,559
are on the intro page if you go to do

00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,450
localhost on the index then there's a

00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:03,889
preloader and then it started jumped to

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:05,269
the intro page but no animation had

00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:08,269
the question is why and this is the

00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:10,129
trick I used here is that I'm using and

00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:14,889
defining the layout so I'm switching

00:20:10,129 --> 00:20:14,889
layout from the index page to intro page

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,960
and why I'm doing that just because I

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:24,950
want to have a different animation from

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:27,649
the preloader to the intro page so in

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:30,080
this case I also defined the CSS for the

00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:33,679
layout I just defined that it will be

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:38,210
called LT so if I go transition layout

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:43,700
so a few code of lines of code and then

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:47,330
if I go to index then we will do a pre

00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,759
loading which is just fake but why not

00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:53,720
if all the people like it and there's

00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:56,179
like this happened it's happened sorry

00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,480
that I don't want to be like designers

00:20:56,179 --> 00:21:01,909
are asking for that from no reason so if

00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,499
you always changing the different layout

00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:08,029
there will be like this animation

00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:09,980
happening okay so this was like quick

00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:12,110
heck and trick how you can do something

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,539
like that but still I mean like you

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:17,090
could see a lot of that stuff around the

00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:19,429
web and it's like nothing right so okay

00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:22,220
let's move to something interesting

00:21:19,429 --> 00:21:22,639
because this is boring already and let's

00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,710
try this

00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:26,179
so let's flow the screen so what I'm

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,919
talking about is like flow the screen so

00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:29,450
if they have these kind of animations

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,879
you don't have to play with the

00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,350
transition like rectangles and stuff you

00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:35,779
can play those over with the real

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,460
animation you can flow the screen make

00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:39,499
it just blue behind the curtain change

00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,119
the screen and then it successfully

00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:43,190
animate it and the question is like how

00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,860
to create like something like this you

00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:48,559
can bring a big guns like green circle

00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:50,840
libraries and do a lot all the HTML

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,240
changes and stuff like that or you can

00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,279
find something like Lahti which is a

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,369
liberal library called by created by

00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:01,570
Airbnb and I don't get why nobody's

00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:04,340
talking about it but basically you can

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:07,279
install a Buddha moon plugging into your

00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,080
After Effects then using the After

00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:11,330
Effects you can explore a JSON file

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,399
which you can integrate directly into

00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:16,340
your website using the JavaScript and

00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:19,070
this a JSON file will be transformed or

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,600
rendered as SVG so there is like no

00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,150
bridge between the designer and

00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,220
developer because there is no gap we

00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:28,429
just burn the bridge and we are there

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,840
like what are we asking all for it you

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:34,370
can integrate the vanilla JavaScript

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:39,950
vue.js angular iOS Android react native

00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:44,179
etc so what I am talking about so let's

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:46,700
say there is a library on the github of

00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:48,710
course called Lodi web that you can

00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:52,039
integrate and all these animations are

00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:54,860
SVG's they are super small super fast no

00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:58,159
readers required basically work works on

00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:00,559
everything I tested it on internet 411

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,750
it works I mean okay

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,460
some people need 10 you can still find

00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,140
the way around and I think it was

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,700
working also on Internet Explorer 10

00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,220
there is like some problem with the

00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:14,960
scaling as with SVG but still the same

00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:17,029
as VG problems and then how to find

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,549
these things so you know there is like

00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:21,260
something called Lahti files basically

00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:23,029
there's already a market place for all

00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,740
the animations with all the designers

00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:27,260
who can create these animations for you

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,090
you didn't have to do it yourself just

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,309
find the people you need it or just

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:36,980
define the free animations like this I

00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:39,950
just found so how I did it I have a

00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,720
water page and here I created a

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:46,490
component which I called page water

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:49,340
transition okay so what is page water

00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,640
transition is basically a component

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,590
which is loading a lot of component and

00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:58,340
sending there some options in this case

00:23:54,590 --> 00:24:00,890
is this JSON file so if I show you what

00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,880
is in this JSON file yeah I didn't

00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,820
created it believe me

00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,370
I mean it's so big that usually the vs

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:10,880
code just said like this is a

00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:13,909
problematic to index not in this time

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:18,890
and then I have this Lahti file and this

00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:21,440
Lahti file just import the Lahti web i

00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:23,510
showed you on the github there is a 1

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,770
diff which will be replaced by the SVG

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:29,419
and few options as for example that

00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,090
height is auto and the width will be

00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:34,850
hundred pairs

00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:37,740
just the heck for the SVG and then some

00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:39,450
loti load animation options so in this

00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:41,279
case we are just replacing which

00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:45,120
container we are replacing we will

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:48,270
render SVG we will by default loop if we

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:51,390
don't say it's false or otherwise are by

00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:53,700
default we are Auto playing and we are

00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,010
sending the JSON data and then we are

00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:59,039
Raymond red tuning or emitting back

00:24:56,010 --> 00:25:01,230
sorry the animation and then you have

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,110
also few functions to handle like make

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:06,270
the animation faster stop jump to the

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:10,140
some of the one of the frames of it or

00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:12,270
just revert it etc etc the stuff you can

00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:18,270
use to like if something happen on the

00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:23,779
website you stop the animation etc so

00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:30,149
just jump here and I will now show you

00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:32,970
that this animation on the water page is

00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:34,919
really the animation I showed you a few

00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:37,440
minutes ago so I just move it that is

00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:41,100
not under default and then I will remove

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,480
just the blue color and then you will

00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,029
see that this is the animation and

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,159
that's the whole trick okay that was not

00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:49,649
a complicated it was easy pretty and

00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:53,940
everybody should understand it but let's

00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:55,890
move to the next one because I I just

00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,960
play it a little bit with it so let's

00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:59,970
create a bikers so this is like I think

00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,820
like okay there are one pigs in the dock

00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:06,029
here so we can create a fancy

00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:08,399
transitions with a some content so let's

00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:12,000
say you are like going to the bikers

00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:15,000
page in the Tokyo Olympics or I mean

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,470
like there are some numbers or some like

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,990
something positive like check box

00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:20,789
because your email was sent or like

00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,830
something failed and you just put the

00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:25,620
cross there you can use it also for

00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,690
something like which make a sense but I

00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,360
wanted to show these bikers

00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:34,140
so how to do it very fast using CSS and

00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:38,549
little bit see a little bit a little SVG

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:42,270
so bikers page the same principle I just

00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:43,720
reused so there's a page paper

00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:48,010
transition

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:52,600
a biker transition there will be five

00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:58,360
bikers I'm loading only one JSON file

00:26:52,600 --> 00:27:02,049
of course then let's change this to 1 to

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:08,490
show them and then change this to 20 I

00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:12,250
think we should see them cool and now

00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:14,919
let's change this this SVG which

00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:19,390
basically is looking in the SVG for the

00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:21,700
part which is colored in this LGB color

00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:23,950
and feeling with the current color and

00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:26,559
then using the by the classes I am

00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,780
changing the colors to the Olympics

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,190
colors so if I remove this you will see

00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,289
that this is basically the one animation

00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:38,350
which was originally blue and I change

00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:40,409
it and that's it that was another little

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,419
trick that I wanted to show that if we

00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:45,429
import something easy as the SVG we can

00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:47,710
play with that and the last thing I

00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:49,409
wanted to show you is the dynamic

00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:52,059
animations

00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:53,740
so I'm now playing a lot of with the gem

00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:57,250
stick with a headless TM Esther block

00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,750
and there are other good stuff there and

00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:02,500
then it's like something like as I said

00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:06,520
dynamic ok that was positive something

00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,350
happen and it's like ok check it's done

00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,179
it's green but then customer come and

00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,220
will say like ok we would like to have a

00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:14,140
different animation and all the

00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,120
animation I showed you was where

00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,950
hard-coded in the code so you have to go

00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,049
and touch the code you can change did

00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,809
you have to deploy it and it's take a

00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:24,070
time but what if I tell you that there

00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:26,530
is a better way because what I'm doing

00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:29,950
is just loading JSON files from my

00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:32,409
folder structure and the JSON file this

00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:33,970
JSON files are not so big is like not

00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:37,630
bigger than the regular HTML it's

00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:43,210
usually small it's like really small so

00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:44,890
what I did is I created this space in

00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,110
the headless CMS where I have settings

00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:48,970
and then I have an input file for the

00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:51,520
JSON file I said here that there is a

00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:54,039
higher animation speed and I'm asking

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:57,070
for looking so let's say that I want to

00:28:54,039 --> 00:29:00,270
change it to orange check box

00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:02,770
so I have here the animations folder

00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:05,440
there is a checkbox in orange color

00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:08,410
which I just know because of the name

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,930
then I replace this code I can make it

00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:12,760
like faster let's say like speed for

00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:16,360
four times the origin of speed I think

00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:20,320
and that's safe then if I go to the page

00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:21,820
big home and I'm going to dynamic then

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,890
we will see a different animation and

00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:25,690
this is just the prototype if we really

00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:30,460
play with this and use it we can create

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:34,600
crazy stuff with it and stuff like I can

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:41,920
find fancy animations you can make your

00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:46,120
users or visitors laugh and do sorry do

00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:50,680
also something like this because like we

00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:52,450
shoot drink some beer today or maybe you

00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,900
like something else today so you can

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,940
choose different different drinks so

00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,560
yeah that was the last animation I

00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,110
wanted to show you and I have a future

00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:07,870
thought and then I'm finishing so five

00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:10,270
minutes great so that was like my

00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:13,150
reaction as I find out about Lottie like

00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:15,760
two years ago and I was like super

00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:18,250
excited it's like for me it was like why

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,140
I found it now and it was like exiting

00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:22,000
already lost for two years and like two

00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,800
years arrow later and I never met

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,230
anybody who was talking about it and

00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,390
using related and I mean like it found

00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,850
few people who know about it but it's

00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:33,160
like I came to ideas like there are the

00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:36,280
frames they exported JSON files let's

00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:39,220
create an icon font on each frame and

00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:42,280
they jump between the frames I mean you

00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,980
can go really crazy and stuff like that

00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:46,780
for example under we had a meet-up in

00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,640
Switzerland and we created beautiful

00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:51,100
video which was inviting all the people

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,620
like come visit us like with graphic

00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,300
elements with dates with the text no

00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,270
real people just you know graphic

00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:00,780
created in After Effects or even created

00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:03,790
in After Effects it was few megabytes

00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:05,680
because it had to be HD we uploaded it

00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,630
to the YouTube then we have to like

00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,870
somehow do it like post it to our

00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:13,300
socials etc etc and then I came to the

00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:17,050
can you please export it with the body

00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:20,380
moving it came to 250 kilobytes it was

00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:22,870
like scalable on all the website and it

00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,730
like free you know it's working and then

00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,740
I understand like my reaction should be

00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:29,080
like this because this is like big thing

00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:31,000
so even if we are on the view just meet

00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,160
up you should now make a photo of this

00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,440
link because the lot is really useful

00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:37,150
for you even if you don't know that

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,720
animations you can find the people who

00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:44,380
can create them and then you really can

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,320
create crazy stuff and to like really

00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:49,810
tell you that it's crazy just go to the

00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,550
Lottie files and look on the all the

00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:55,150
animation that people are creating there

00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:58,590
and stuff like just this here the 28

00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:00,760
kilobytes know whether it works

00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:05,470
JavaScript few lines of the code

00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:08,110
granular JavaScript done and then you

00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:10,720
can just scroll it through it and these

00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:12,220
all are will work on your website you

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,580
can play it you can create a game with

00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:21,280
it even just you know imagination and go

00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:23,140
for it so you bonus links you can also

00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,550
do this create this animation using the

00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:27,430
haiku which is also a product

00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:29,140
application it's paid still but if you

00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:32,620
don't like the after-effects you can try

00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:33,670
that lot of fast I talked about if you

00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,150
like the animations

00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:39,400
I always show the third Rasmus sample

00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:41,640
with the view jizz and noxious we just

00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:47,860
already little bit older two years and

00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:50,250
it's not working anymore but if you but

00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:53,980
if you account this reports pretty cool

00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:56,050
somebody should write her let's try this

00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:59,110
live demo no it's not working anymore

00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:00,820
sorry for that and then there is a one

00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,220
more library I just wanted to show you

00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:05,350
and this is called the ramjet and this

00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:07,510
is from the guy who created also suelto

00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:11,980
and a bunch of other crazy stuff I think

00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:15,610
and these are transforming and these are

00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:18,210
not images these are HTML blocks you can

00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:21,880
hold that stuff so this is like

00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,480
selectable these are not some SVG some

00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,790
this

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,440
is like dark magic not sure how it's

00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:31,830
working but it's working just basically

00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:35,110
JavaScript which will transform from one

00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:41,320
form to another form and you can use it

00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:45,669
to some yeah some crazy stuff so thank

00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:48,370
you very much for your time and the

00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:51,370
light make you a little bit nicer place

00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:56,049
in tomorrow you can contact me on Samos

00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:58,030
not Co best way on the Twitter and grab

00:33:56,049 --> 00:34:00,010
I picked stickers because I really like

00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:01,630
those stickers I created them basically

00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:03,910
with a few guys and I'm happy about them

00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:06,770
so go for them and even taking questions

00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:10,139
drop it on me now

00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:10,139
