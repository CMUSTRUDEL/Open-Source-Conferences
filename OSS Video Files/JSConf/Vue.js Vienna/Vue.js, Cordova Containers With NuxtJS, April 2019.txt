hi i'm simon i'm the CTO and co-founder

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:12,059
occupy and yeah just one word about

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,769
occupy occupy is a mobile top

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:18,779
marketplace but you can apply for jobs

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:21,270
easily on your phone our mission is that

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,830
we put good people into good jobs in the

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,789
fastest easiest in the most enjoyable

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:29,279
way means like everything on an advice

00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,510
or somewhere where you're around that

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,520
means you don't have to go to computer

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,940
have to write the CVE or whatever you

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,120
can do this all on unoccupied what i'm

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,940
talking about today is next yes in a

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,399
cordoba container i think probably all

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,829
of you know already noxious noxious is

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,690
practically just a preset of

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,670
configurations for few GS that makes it

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:56,539
super easy to start with and kora is a

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:59,520
native application that allows a webview

00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:02,399
to render on a mobile phone that means

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,439
you can actually publish your app on on

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,560
an app store or google play store

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:10,490
whatever and feels and looks like it's a

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,659
native app if you design it like this

00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:17,580
yeah i tried to paint this a little bit

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,520
that means like you have your iOS or

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,259
android device within that there's a

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,100
quarter what app you can of course

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:28,200
compute that at plugins access native

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,740
layers for example camera or other

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:37,799
sensor devices and within that you have

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:40,259
your next of you app okay and well i

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:45,360
took i think the best way to show you

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:48,570
that is by just doing it and there are

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,220
just two things you should have prepared

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,750
the first you probably should have

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,490
installed noches on your community of

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,590
course the second thing is you need

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,450
android studio or at least the emulator

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,270
and the adp and stop so the easiest way

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:04,229
is just install android studio its

00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:08,520
freezer no not much effort so what we're

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:10,770
going to do today we create our first

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,110
knock step and put it in a quarter bug

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,860
container afterwards so what we're going

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,200
to do is

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,150
we create I use the create knock step

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,530
CLI tool I don't know if you know that

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:25,250
but yeah it's pretty easy to use and it

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,450
just sets you up with a template that

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,880
creates all the folders you need and

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,980
just default configuration and it also

00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,320
lets you configure some things we will

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,050
see like right now project name for the

00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,490
package.json file whatever description

00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,930
if you want to have your custom server

00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,580
framework we don't need this right now

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,250
because we actually not using a sail

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,770
framework you can set up some like

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,060
linters prettier and exodus for example

00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:52,680
okay we use that for now and some custom

00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:56,280
white framework we're using tailwind so

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,530
just elect l1 right now too and we don't

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:04,440
have tests and we're creating a single

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:10,350
page app yeah MPN yeah okay alright

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:13,310
while this is installing okay maybe we

00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,810
have to wait a little bit though this

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:20,400
next great template is actually

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,410
maintained by Knox but it's not like on

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,840
the latest feature stand access or

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:27,360
everything in JavaScript is developing

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,850
very fast so what is it the next create

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,770
a template thing for example doesn't

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,570
support the typescript right now but you

00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:36,630
can actually just change it afterwards

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,250
and it also has some warnings in there

00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,810
when you start the application now for

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,450
the first time for example I'll show you

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:46,380
so this is created two directory and I

00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:48,660
just run the development environment and

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,540
you see already here one please you

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,820
would use built post CSS instead and

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:55,830
stuff like this and we actually gonna do

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,959
this quickly so you I think that's

00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:02,880
something you should know or should

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:06,660
learn when you snuck Stan fix warnings

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,410
like this and I'm gonna just open

00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,410
quickly

00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:22,230
toda whatever max demo okay so what we

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:24,460
see now is we should see now okay

00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:28,600
shouldn't we should see some folders

00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:31,840
here you see that's all of them created

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,190
the next great Knox template thing so we

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,240
have a lot of folders here already and

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:40,570
you just have ya written is and just

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,730
placeholders in there but we want to fix

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,810
the first morning first so we what to do

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:48,840
is we actually this it complains about

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:53,470
this file so what we're gonna do is I

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:58,030
just keep this okay capitis instead of

00:04:53,470 --> 00:05:01,510
the external file you use the Knox

00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:06,340
Kentucky GS file and insert the

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:11,110
configuration for post ESS here I was in

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:19,450
the big boss's property though and copy

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:21,400
these two lines over there this way yeah

00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,350
so we load this through the next comp is

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:29,470
3s file and we're gonna remove the post

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:31,090
CSS file that's it so if we run the

00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,630
application again and we get an error

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,630
okay

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:48,570
now we see hopefully our app yeah that's

00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,230
it Corvo Knox team oh I'm not going into

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,970
next any deeper or any design or stuff

00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,620
like this we just deployed this now or

00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:59,300
try to deploy this to a court of a

00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,300
container how are we going to do that

00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,080
first you have to know actually Knox

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,780
isn't made for court of all what Cordova

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,889
does is actually it's there's no web

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:13,080
server or something like this you

00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:15,060
actually use local file system of your

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,000
phone to surf the pile so you have to

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,710
use static generated files of course but

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,520
there are also some things that you

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:24,900
don't have relative test for example

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,820
usually in the web if you have hosted

00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,880
web site you have like your host slash

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:32,160
whatever your app but on a static file

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,310
system if you access your files through

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:40,280
file double point whatever semi colon

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:42,570
doesn't matter slash slash whatever then

00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,340
relative test acts differently or you

00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,770
actually don't really know how they

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,330
really act it depends on the system and

00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,740
the iOS version on the Android version

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,729
and whatever or the browser that's

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:58,400
actually used inside it so what we have

00:06:53,729 --> 00:07:01,200
to do is we have to fix kinda next to

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,430
handle these things correctly and we're

00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:08,039
gonna do this by creating a plug-in

00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:11,639
there's already a plug-in directory and

00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:19,020
we create one new file we call Cordova

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:22,410
client yes and the content of it that's

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,270
two things first it listens for own

00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,880
device ready or device ready event

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:28,830
Cordova sends the device ready if the

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,220
end when it's done the second thing is

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:35,100
it patches our order the few redirect

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,800
route this is necessary if you use

00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,440
redirect it's a pyramid or a function

00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,650
you can call so that the redirect

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,910
doesn't change to the route Google or

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,000
something like this so you have to patch

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:51,720
it I don't want to explain more detail

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,169
but yeah second thing is we have to load

00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,479
the plug-in of course

00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:57,479
that means we add in the next config yes

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:07,689
plugins we add just go up it we had this

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:12,870
plug-in okay

00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:16,419
so first step done second thing is

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:18,090
Cordova inserts a quarter by GS file

00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:20,650
that also sends the event and stuff

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,499
initialize some native plugins if you

00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,960
add them so basically what we just have

00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:28,330
to do is we add on our head tag or it's

00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:31,689
in the next GS file Lux config file

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:33,310
we had script load Cordova yes that's

00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:34,570
kind of black magic because you don't

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:36,909
know where this file is coming from but

00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,820
code about provides it for you

00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:41,829
and the second thing is that's actually

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:45,730
something you need to know or you will

00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:48,790
learn to a heart when you use Android or

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,680
with Cordova you can't load files that

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:54,550
have an underscore in it I'm not quite

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,399
sure why but it is like this and by

00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:04,920
default when we look into our demo app

00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:08,860
we should maybe lint it first or not

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,060
what about that why I don't have any

00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:15,270
lint

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:19,290
okay we see if we look into Network

00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:22,670
console right now you see it's loaded it

00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:26,700
loads like Knox loads it's ad set assets

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,470
from underscore next usually shouldn't

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,260
be a problem but for Android it is so

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,649
you have to switch the asset path how we

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:41,670
can do that I was a pretty easy actually

00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:44,760
if I find my presentation again usually

00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:49,050
or actually put for this part we just

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:53,370
have to set the the public path inside

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:56,459
the build property to something else to

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:58,529
make it complete though because we just

00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:00,300
preferred that Knox can always so you

00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:03,029
can always switch to different rendering

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,529
path for example SSR instead of single

00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:07,560
page application of stuff like this I

00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:12,330
also add a server middleware that means

00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:21,959
we show you the directory immediately

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:25,880
have a middleware middleware you I call

00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,880
it whatever assets yes okay

00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:36,129
what this basically does is just it

00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:39,529
serves the compiled tour the build

00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:44,230
client files through slash knocked pipe

00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:48,019
knocks twice okay so if we reload now

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,920
you should see that it's not unless

00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:52,939
connection anymore

00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:55,399
it's knocks twice so all good and the

00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:57,589
third thing we have to fix we have to

00:10:55,399 --> 00:10:59,269
change is the route them out there are

00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:02,689
two modes the usual amount of the

00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:05,480
regular one is set to I don't know the

00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:07,160
name actually actually but when you

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,139
switch to a page you have the route like

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,879
this and a new page whatever and the

00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,410
hash mode is actually you always stay on

00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,569
the same page and then inserts just a

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,029
hash and the path behind it

00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:19,249
so you can imagine another Cordova

00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:22,749
container where just a five system you

00:11:19,249 --> 00:11:28,309
can't really go out to anything sorry

00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:29,989
and therefore we just switch to the mode

00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:33,529
and that's also pretty easy in Knox we

00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:36,290
just said router mode hash you see easy

00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:40,189
step if you know it if you don't know it

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:42,679
you just check out my documentation so

00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:47,559
we added in there too so all good now

00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:51,379
you see our app still running hopefully

00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:52,879
okay so that's all we have to do to get

00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:54,589
ready for Cordova we see already it's

00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,149
already tries to load the quarter

00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:58,160
battery has filed on the web it's not

00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:59,629
available of course this one is just

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,769
cause I have a serviceworker running on

00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:06,139
this localhost port just can ignore that

00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:09,139
okay so now we're actually ready for

00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:11,660
portable how we can start Cobra actually

00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:14,959
also pretty easy we just switch back to

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,980
our directory run the command Cordova

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,169
create Cordova

00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,470
the second parameter is actually the

00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:23,629
directory and we call the app team web

00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:28,989
easy so we have directory Cordova now

00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:28,989
and there we at the platform Android

00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:35,929
that's all we have to do second thing is

00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,339
we need to run the emulator because if

00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:39,350
we run it on my phone actually I would

00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:41,760
recommend if you develop use your phone

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,470
it's way easier the emulator to

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,420
sometimes hang so it doesn't really work

00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,420
and you don't really know why so what I

00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,170
do I start the emulator or actually chop

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:55,260
you up already

00:12:49,170 --> 00:13:04,529
it's up already yep and just try if our

00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:07,220
plane caught about project once and

00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:07,220
hopefully it does

00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:15,180
okay it doesn't appear that's exactly

00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:18,210
the issue I was talking about when this

00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,820
happens I have to reset the SD or the

00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:22,380
emulator through the Android studio I'll

00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,180
just quickly show you and then maybe you

00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,680
if you run in the same interview you can

00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,680
just figure it out quicker

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,240
hmm sorry was a plan

00:13:53,310 --> 00:14:00,740
yes

00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:05,519
those that's the EBD manager and you can

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:09,870
wipe dater yes do that let's just start

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,850
it again now you see it it starts like

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:14,339
it's a new Android device puts it up and

00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:22,050
stuff like this shouldn't take so long

00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:28,529
though hopefully no super slow

00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:33,390
usually it's faster okay it starts our

00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:35,610
app right now you can see it yeah you

00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:37,230
see this is just the plain Cordova

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,750
container we didn't put any content in

00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:41,790
here yet so it's just it's an app you

00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,390
can see it actually there can close it

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:46,980
or whatever

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:52,550
it's native and if we have our demo app

00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:54,899
here yeah just start it again okay so

00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,790
okay cool we have our cord wooden

00:14:54,899 --> 00:15:00,420
container we have our except now we

00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:02,339
should combine that and how we can

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,260
achieve that I already told you that

00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:06,540
Knox is actually not really ready for a

00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:10,829
filesystem thing but we can overcome

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:14,190
with it and I actually created a build

00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:15,899
script for that it basically does and

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,520
ensures that Knox is built in the spa

00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,010
mode and a single page application mode

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,839
it replaces all the relative paths for

00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,510
example if you have slash knocks twice

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,480
the boot access to root directory it

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:30,839
replaces it which just max files that's

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:33,060
that for almost everything then it

00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:37,560
builds the next project of course it

00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:40,500
copied the copies this this folder where

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:44,250
the build process actually outputs the

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,949
data to the www directory of Kaurava and

00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:50,899
start the call about container so I'll

00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:50,899
just quickly show you that script here

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:02,449
yes exactly

00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:04,970
I'm starting the app with the root part

00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:06,800
of it it's like the index.html and from

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,930
there every every pass is actually

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,370
relative from it so that's the reason

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:20,290
why I also set the mode to hash

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:20,290
otherwise if it's kind of yeah right

00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:32,110
sorry

00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:34,519
that's correct and okay so this is the

00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:37,220
thing what we do there we build this

00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:41,120
publication we replace the relative pass

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:43,339
we run coca-cola bar and run Android

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,410
there are the scripts behind that Knox

00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:47,089
built with the spa option actually we

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,860
set up more already in the nuts convict

00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:51,649
so it's not really necessary but we

00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:54,800
place some stuff there we copied over

00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:59,089
and we run Android so let's see if this

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:02,769
works out so we copy the package Jason

00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:02,769
to our project

00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:17,570
then we inst worse which directory in

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:24,710
stone st replace we need we use the NPM

00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:27,500
package called replace here and the

00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:29,450
words we actually execute this command

00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,090
that executes all the other commands and

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,840
hopefully this thing will work

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,840
what's so slow again

00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,370
yeah super slow

00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,860
hello

00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:15,649
as so right finally installed it okay so

00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:16,369
now it runs all the commands I built the

00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:19,369
application

00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:20,989
it replaced the relative pass we will

00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:23,889
see that hopefully in the next step it's

00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:23,889
really really slow right now

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:46,809
we usually just build some way faster I

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,809
don't know

00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,400
yep

00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:24,970
super exciting yeah okay

00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,620
finally generated it that's the output

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,799
of the replace commands and replaces

00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:33,940
some Kaurava or Tibet absolute path to

00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:38,440
the relative tab and now it runs the

00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:44,850
Kaurava built and starts our app whew it

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:47,590
was even quick and we should see our

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:49,269
website or the next container

00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:52,000
it's nothing in it it doesn't look like

00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:58,299
a mobile phone right now but it works

00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:00,100
and all right so we up and running so

00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:02,559
but other things that you can check out

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,169
is for example make it way more look

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:08,259
like a native thing there's Knox 7 for

00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:10,059
example available but it's like more

00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:12,009
mobile like you could check that out or

00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:13,120
check out push notifications out of

00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:15,759
things what I want to show you quickly

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,919
is how you just use native plugins

00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,840
because that's the main reason why you

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,480
actually use Corriveau besides the App

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,909
Store and stuff like this and I prepared

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,649
just the custom will scheme so you have

00:20:24,909 --> 00:20:29,080
deep links in your app for example if

00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:31,570
you with some app links to your link to

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,580
your app or if you started from a web

00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:37,000
server or something like this and how

00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:40,200
you can do that it's like you switch

00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,399
back to the corner of a directory enter

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,139
Cordova plugins add the block the

00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:44,409
plug-in there are a lot of plugins out

00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:49,389
there

00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:55,590
already ready to use edit it alright

00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:58,360
then we that's actually part of the

00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:01,809
setup process that's described in this

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:04,269
git repo that you have to include this

00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:07,169
launch my app file you're gonna do it as

00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:07,169
quickly tear to

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:19,830
okay almost then we check I think that

00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:22,940
should be fine the last time at least

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:25,950
and then we had the Annis installation

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:29,700
initialization code for this plug-in in

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,880
our Cordova client plugin that's the

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:35,789
code for that you can also find actually

00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:42,570
on the github page at least part of it

00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:44,100
wrong so what we do what we do when the

00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:47,820
device is ready we call their own device

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,309
ready function then we try to you need

00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,140
to start this ball is just an example

00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:55,169
and we try to in it our custom will

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,090
scheme that basically just registers the

00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:59,400
handle what should actually happen when

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,320
a deep link is called and I just make

00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,780
another box right now so you should see

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:09,059
a dialogue with the well that that I

00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:13,230
sent to the app and yeah so what we do

00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:14,820
we rebuilt it process and p.m. rank

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:21,049
order began hopefully this time it's a

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:21,049
bit faster yeah

00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:42,070
alright it starts the app began with our

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:44,170
new source code hopefully and we see

00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:46,990
it's still up and running and we added

00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:50,260
this alert box so with the adb shell I

00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:52,720
can send commands to my app this way at

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,370
this time I sent the link my cool app

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,330
that's the namespace we defined for the

00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:00,930
custom wall scheme and my collapse test

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:05,650
so we have dialog my cool app test

00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:07,240
worked out well that's it I just wanted

00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:09,810
to show you a simple theme of a plug-in

00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,790
or how you can access the native library

00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:14,410
through a plug-in in with in Cordova

00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:18,790
Hoxton that's it

00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:21,670
thanks for watching I hope you learned a

00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:23,560
little bit especially the the tricky

00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:25,600
parts I think that's really useful if

00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,490
you do or if you try buy own they're

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:30,580
basically the two slides I presented how

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,530
to do the plug-in to override the

00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:36,190
redirect thing and the three steps to

00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:37,630
make it run able on android and yeah and

00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:41,920
by the way we're also looking for

00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:43,930
front-end few developers I also put the

00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,940
presentation up to github and on the

00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,860
last slide you can find some links to

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,170
some useful plugins where you can play

00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,950
around or just test it

00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:55,859
alright open

00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,859
