thanks very phone for coming my name is

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,569
Robert X Austin I'll be giving a talk

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,429
about a quite simple talk and just

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,980
nothing advanced here is using a DJ's

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:15,780
package I'll be going over creating a

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,920
Kanban board with vgs using vgs plug-in

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,310
or package called

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,460
view Kanban so really simple stuff

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:25,529
because it's simplified for us

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,310
my name is robert Axelson i am a

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:33,930
software developer by day I'm a meet-up

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,540
organizer by night I love when coding

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,700
people come together and when I get to

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:42,059
meet new people talk about geeky stuff

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,190
and try to help any way I can

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,780
I organized this meetup which is the

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,480
view just Vienna organized free code

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,840
camp Vienna and also a goal-line user

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,160
group or Meetup Vienna would go yeah I

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,469
think that's it you can find me most

00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:00,030
places as with the handle at Rob Axelson

00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:02,219
if you want to have a fun you can also

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,060
look everywhere for on all the things

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,700
because I have I'm on I'm at on all the

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,590
things on all the things it's an

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,140
alliance for now on some of the media's

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,420
but when I found I could be on all the

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,340
things on all the things I just had to

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,799
grab the chance

00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:22,200
so all that aside and as I said in the

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,470
beginning this is nothing fancy or

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,110
complex here if you're familiar with web

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,549
pack or NPM or VHS or combination of

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,369
those you should be able to do this on

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,619
your own this is more to be able to show

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,360
something interactive with code on the

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,579
screen that you can do yourself

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,890
and after the slides we'll do this

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,409
together on the screen as well because

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:47,220
the talk is recorded please keep your

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:50,880
questions till the end but I'll sure to

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,829
answer them then so all that aside I

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,350
mean before we even get to view Kanban

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:58,409
by show of hands here does anyone not

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:01,170
know what a Kanban board is everyone

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:02,909
knows Kanban okay cool so for the people

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,790
on the video maybe Kanban is just a

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:09,030
representation of showing to manage work

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,709
to show tasks from for example in

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,890
different states from new to in progress

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:17,970
to completed I will see that more in

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,740
as we see the example project on the

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,680
screen and to be able to do that in view

00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,480
Jess you can of course work and start

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,030
from scratch and do it all yourselves

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,890
you'll have to I do stuff like keeping

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,660
track of mouse drag events and stuff

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,090
like this which in and of itself can be

00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,300
time-consuming maybe not the most

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,880
complex stuff but it's not yeah what you

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,440
start out as a beginner so if you just

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,030
want to have something like prototyping

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,710
or something up quick and dirty view

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,380
Kanban is a package ready for you there

00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,520
to use it's an adaptation of a code pan

00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,280
that looks really nice which is

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,480
everything in in plain JavaScript you

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,070
can have a look there's a link here you

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,800
can burn itself is really simple it's

00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:01,200
just a job well it's it's constantly

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,900
customizable we are slots so it has a

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,220
predefined data structure and on based

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,140
on that data structure you can have

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:14,340
slots for all the different yeah

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:16,500
data elements it comes with the SS style

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,239
that you can just import in your project

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,720
and you can modify it so you get a feel

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,000
for for the style to work with and the

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:30,239
data structure it work operates on it

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,489
calls it blocks so every block or item

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,870
on the board is a block when it's an

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:40,470
array of blocks cool installation is as

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,360
simple as following these steps I think

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,410
this should be as complete that you can

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,780
just do all of this after each other I

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:52,020
hope I'm not wrong but viewing it this

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:57,540
is if you just install I have an

00:03:52,020 --> 00:04:00,690
additive you have to first yarn global

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:04,080
install so yarn add global I think the

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:06,209
command is and view CLI if you do that

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,050
now you get still the view see light too

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:12,840
and this example uses that but view CLI

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:16,049
tree which is even more awesome and

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,459
fancy it's in release candidate so by

00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:19,080
the time you watch this talk or by the

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,299
time you get to look at this at home

00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,280
it might be what you would want to do

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,789
but it's not hard to put it on top of

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,740
that either

00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:26,790
this is just what you need to get

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,150
started and to

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:33,240
stutters so you viewing it web pack

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,890
simple and you give it your project name

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,680
so in this case I've just used Kanban

00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,900
you go into your folder you gonna

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,790
install as you normally do this is not

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,710
given in the view camp and instructions

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,180
but you should have some babel plugins

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,190
otherwise you'll get some errors so

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,080
that's here for you then you just view

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,300
add view Kanban the package to the

00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,800
project and then you start doing the

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,530
stuff with main.js meaning you're

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,310
importing view Kanban and then you're

00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,930
using the Kanban in your project

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:04,230
nothing fancy if you use to view

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:07,260
backpack and view and view CL and/or

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,870
view CLI this is not new to you but this

00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:16,560
is how this is your cheat sheet to play

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:18,870
around this is not the default Kanban

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,180
board component example but this has

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:25,620
some formatting for us some slot

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,970
customization this makes it so that when

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,480
we're testing it afterwards it looks

00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:33,120
fancy enough for us I'll give credit

00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:35,970
where credit is due my talk started

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,040
being motivated by an article I read

00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:40,290
where they give examples like this and

00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,470
also include some persistence in terms

00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:48,540
of a real-time database and I'll mention

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:51,000
that article at the end and then if you

00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:54,540
familiar with view Jess you can just add

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,970
States the data locally in the view

00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:03,060
single file component and this is what's

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:06,540
needed stages key with an array value of

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,880
the different columns and then you have

00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:12,360
blocks that then will have what it needs

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,530
to put it in the right column and that's

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,140
all there is to it

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,180
and then for the styling if you just do

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,550
it by default it does really looks messy

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,790
there's nothing there so you should at

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,500
least use this like default styling to

00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,900
get a feel for where to start or what to

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,490
customize it's available if you click

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:33,030
link here I'll show you afterwards and

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:35,790
the official Kanban repo and you just

00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:38,669
take that sass file and import it into

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,680
your project that's about it I'll spend

00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:42,150
like five seconds

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,210
company's hiring full stack web

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:48,030
developer back in reg developer sip

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:50,580
vice.com there's the links there's an

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:52,020
email ask me questions afterwards if you

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:57,090
curious that's it

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:58,590
all that said demo time I think for the

00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:00,949
sake of the structure we'll talk before

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:04,110
we go to the demo these slides were made

00:07:00,949 --> 00:07:06,150
in the command line with vim using

00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,699
remark J s I recently started using

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:12,120
remark yes and it's really awesome its

00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:14,639
marked down in an index.html file it's

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,590
quite diverse you can do styling to make

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,930
your code localize all the code I had

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,320
here there's not images that is marked

00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,090
down with CSS styling so if you're

00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:26,310
curious have a look at remarks yes and

00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:29,300
this slides are already online in a view

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:43,710
gsv on our repo awesome

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:54,630
so let's demo this stuff so if i follow

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:57,289
the instructions we can just remove the

00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,289
previous

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:12,840
awesome so maybe this easier to see now

00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:16,409
I'm just following the current release

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,879
UCLA version - just giving default all

00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:21,960
the stuff for the sake of this and

00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:23,759
process explicitly saying yes then we

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,620
can go into the project folder that we

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,990
just created I can blow it up even more

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:32,550
and then we can instead of NPM to keep

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:38,250
it consistent here we can do yarn

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:45,870
install we also save a bit time for the

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:48,750
demo stuff not being synchronous awesome

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:52,440
and then just to prepare here it's good

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:59,940
to add these so we don't get any

00:08:52,440 --> 00:09:02,720
conflicts or build errors and at the end

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,720
we'll add the actual package we're using

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,720
so

00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:16,360
also so I'm a bit unsure but I think

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,300
we'll use code

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,210
I'm not Visual Studio code user normally

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,860
I'm a team user but my experience with

00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:26,920
copy pasting and formatting on the fly

00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:32,740
in a demo I'm going to live dangerously

00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:34,870
and use this tool makes it easier for

00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:41,620
the talk as well I think so let's add

00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:43,210
this for in the main chairs so now we're

00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:48,700
importing the view Kanban package that

00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:52,270
we just added with yarn and then let's

00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,130
go one step further and what we have now

00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:58,120
maybe for the sake of people not so

00:09:54,130 --> 00:10:02,290
familiar with view if you do view so if

00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,030
you do if you run the default

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:07,330
scaffolding or the boilerplate that you

00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:10,890
get with view CLI it ends up looking

00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:13,150
like this so we're taking this

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,820
boilerplate and we're just adding the

00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:22,089
Kanban because a lot of stuff is there

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:27,339
done for us right cool so what I'm doing

00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:29,020
now is I'm just taking in the app view

00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:30,880
that just had a content we just saw on

00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:35,230
the screen I'm replacing everything

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,930
there inside the div with the Kanban

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:42,520
board I'm sure someone can tell me how

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:44,710
it's super easy to just know format with

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,680
a plug-in or something let's just ignore

00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:52,330
the formatting for now will still work

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,930
and then we'll add data so we already

00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:57,850
have a data returned in the boilerplate

00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:05,640
so what we'll do is we'll just get the

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:08,640
actual state we need and we'll replace

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,640
this

00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:16,500
is it big enough yeah cool I think that

00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:23,160
should work even though the formatting

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:30,600
is a bit of and then this is the

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:34,860
official repo were some of these

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:40,050
examples are taken from before I forget

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:50,700
I'll just do this so we can cover that

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:52,800
at the end okay cool so here you see in

00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,770
the source and the assets it has the

00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:01,020
styling we need so I'm going to take the

00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:14,120
same just copy it bring it into our

00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:14,120
project like so now I think

00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,670
yeah

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:29,660
awesome so we'll just take we'll import

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,660
the file we just created

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:42,520
awesome then we should be good to go so

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:51,270
let's see now

00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:51,270
baptism by fire let's do that here so

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,480
awesome

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,360
so that's the beauty sometimes of just

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:07,019
having packages to use it's you can be

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,809
addictive and remove you oh there's an

00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:14,009
extra it doesn't matter it can remove

00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:16,199
some complexity but also make soft stuff

00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:18,540
not so easy to customize but in this

00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:21,360
example I think for prototyping and for

00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:24,420
making something giving a functionality

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,879
to a project you have you can be quickly

00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,660
up and running and this is of course not

00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:33,019
persistent but I can drag the stuff from

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:36,779
from one state to another and then

00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:38,369
adding firebase or some other back-end

00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:40,410
or your own recipe pie or whatever is

00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:43,019
not doesn't need to be real time you

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:44,850
really just need to keep track of the

00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:47,730
state so the block state that we saw in

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,189
the code example here we can add new

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:55,949
blocks to this this is all that

00:13:50,189 --> 00:14:02,459
constitutes the Kanban board items so we

00:13:55,949 --> 00:14:04,819
could add second one and a third one and

00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,819
this is

00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:18,560
like this then we have it here maybe it

00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:21,320
needs review and it's very soon approved

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:26,390
because the meetup is over so that's

00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:30,770
mainly what's to it as last side this

00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:32,630
article ever is worth a look most of the

00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,820
steps that I mentioned that are

00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:37,700
mentioned in here but it also has an

00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:41,420
additional section of quickly adding

00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:44,540
some real-time sync functionality

00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:47,390
I used harmony sync but I didn't choose

00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:50,300
to use it in the talk because be aware

00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:52,700
it seems a bit new and fresh and not

00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,920
complete when you create an account you

00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:59,900
cannot delete account you cannot delete

00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,970
the app ID so if I accidentally shared

00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,980
my account ID and appetit with with you

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:07,040
guys on the talk I couldn't have deleted

00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,810
either one of them so maybe it matures

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,570
and becomes good it's scary but it does

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,580
maybe but Himani also just doesn't give

00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:16,610
you the chance to look into your data

00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,020
and see what data is there it just gives

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,720
you what you need to have the

00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:23,630
functionality so I want to recommend it

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,330
but it's what it's a quick thing to play

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,410
around with copy paste code and you'll

00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:29,690
have the same thing you saw on the

00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:35,900
screen now but it'll be real time sync

00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:41,780
and persistent so that's nice yeah

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:42,560
I think that's it thank you for your

00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,770
attention

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,770
