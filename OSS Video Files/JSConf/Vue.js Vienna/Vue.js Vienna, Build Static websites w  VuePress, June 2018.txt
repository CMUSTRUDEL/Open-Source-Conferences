all right so welcome today's I try 10 50

00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:10,860
minutes how to build a website with you

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:15,570
chess a static website so anybody is

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:19,830
still building websites do anybody has a

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:23,240
blog or everybody on Facebook so

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:26,910
WordPress is the big number one

00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,070
wordpress.com and they even claim 30% of

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,560
the Internet are powered by WordPress I

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,690
think these are like 50 million websites

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:39,230
or more so the rest this is all Facebook

00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:44,760
so let's get started

00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:47,100
this so ten years ago so it's 11 years

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,680
ago who are the big guys if you build a

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,649
website who is the number one so we'll

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,280
process a number one and then there's

00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:59,129
Facebook but so the 2-tuple and tumblr

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,190
so these are the big guys 10 years ago

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,619
and it's a dynamic website what's the

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,600
difference between a dynamic website and

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,330
a static website so the big difference

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:13,890
is if you have a dynamic website you

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:16,670
need a database in case of WordPress you

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,780
have MySQL database SQL database

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:23,790
application server so the application

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:26,820
server would be PHP and then of you have

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:30,900
the web server and the important part is

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:34,560
on every request it built it builds the

00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:39,210
page on the fly and so for example if

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,030
you go to if you use WordPress they even

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:46,320
have a documentation page they show you

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,450
like if you try to request a page like

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,210
behind the same what happens you know

00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:54,509
there is it's trying to connect to the

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,880
database it's including the functions

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,860
it's you know hundreds of queries it's

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,290
trying to activate the plugins you know

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,159
and there's so much going on so it's

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:10,080
actually surprising that it's what it

00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:13,349
works and today you know 10 years later

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,370
because if you use JavaScript there's

00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:16,650
every weakness in

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:20,069
you frame work every week there's a new

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,470
tool to build you press every new week

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:27,060
there's a new tool to build a website

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:29,310
but ten years ago WordPress Drupal and

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,900
Joomla are the big guys and now ten

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,940
eleven years later do you know like who

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:38,370
are the big guys today in 2018 so today

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:43,680
PHP rules you know and the big guys

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:47,730
WordPress is growing 30% and to porch

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,359
Amla so there's no change the last

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:54,599
fifteen years but the static websites so

00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:55,170
who are the big guys if you build static

00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,629
websites

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:02,209
what's the WordPress in the static

00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:02,209
website compile a building scene

00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:08,640
whoo-hoo go check oh yeah these are good

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,930
ones so the big ones in the past like if

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:15,450
anybody remembers Microsoft front-page

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:18,540
Dreamweaver let's keep composure and so

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,150
the big guy who go is in ink oh so who

00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,709
go is a big one and cycle so they

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,079
usually pick name

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:29,010
Victor Hugo and cycle and hide the big

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:31,079
names from the world literature so we

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:35,340
press this trying you know to compete

00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:39,690
not with the gets P or with WordPress

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:44,760
but there was mentioned you know the big

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:48,470
brother is react well and so in the

00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,930
react ball gets P is the established

00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:55,049
static website builder for react the big

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,889
guy in the reactor and so what's the

00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,799
react worse

00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,549
are they blue version for sorry I lost

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,049
this one

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:05,220
oh here what's the the version for you

00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:09,510
to catch peace the big one

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:12,239
and there was Rob mentioned that weed is

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,449
now more popular than than react on

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:21,989
github it has more than 100,000 stars

00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:26,210
and so hello we press so we press is

00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:30,289
pretty new and it was must started

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:35,900
by even you so if anybody knows who's

00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:38,900
the sky so even you doesn't mean you so

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:42,740
even you he is the the main developer

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:46,970
and the inventor of view itself and it

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:50,930
just started the history was started the

00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:53,419
first release 0.1 in April this year so

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,500
it's just April that might be three

00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:57,770
months ago or something

00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,229
so it's pretty new and so what was the

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:03,590
point you know if I go back there are

00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:11,270
hundreds or even there are thousands of

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:17,030
static website builders static this is

00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:19,970
the the list ranked by that the list

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:23,180
ranked by github stars so the word press

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:26,960
in the word press in the static world is

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:30,110
cycle and who go is the number number

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,720
two and next doesn't really count for

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,000
react and gets P is the number three and

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,759
HECO is the number four it's in

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,580
JavaScript and anybody knows how we

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,580
built its documentation its main website

00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:51,289
so we we spelled in in hexa and they are

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,840
using kit book for some sub projects and

00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:59,509
so the idea was from the inventor of

00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:02,330
view was of course why are we not using

00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:04,400
view for building our websites and our

00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:07,310
documentation you know we have you guys

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,009
yeah we know we best why are we not

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,620
using a static website builder in view

00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:16,520
and so what he has done so that's the

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,259
idea that we build the documentation

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:22,030
website with view itself so he built a

00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:28,639
new website builder sorry

00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:33,469
why okay so he started a new one and the

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:35,719
the motivation was to use it for the for

00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:39,349
view itself for all the documentation

00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:42,589
websites and of course

00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:44,569
the view is always good it looks at like

00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:46,819
you know before view there was angular

00:06:44,569 --> 00:06:48,199
and it doesn't start from scratch but

00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:50,869
they are pretty good at looking you know

00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:54,349
getting the best ideas from what comes

00:06:50,869 --> 00:07:05,089
before and so if you go to the press

00:06:54,349 --> 00:07:07,999
website on the guide there is why not so

00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:10,580
there is heck so if anybody knows heck

00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:13,999
so that's in JavaScript that's a clone

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,919
of Keuchel cycle is in in Ruby and so

00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:19,099
some people don't want to use if you

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:22,249
want to extend cycle you have to do some

00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:24,349
Ruby so HECO is popular because it's a

00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:26,659
chai tea alone in JavaScript so you can

00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:29,479
use JavaScript for everything and hexo

00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:32,360
is used for the UTS dork for the

00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:35,479
documentation and so there's get booked

00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,029
and here you can read and next was it's

00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:40,990
the blue version for next in the rect

00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:44,089
ball and it also has a feature for

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:48,469
server-side rendering and Static export

00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:52,430
so it can be used for for static

00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:55,159
websites but it's not really but if you

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:57,769
see in to sum up you know these are all

00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:00,469
great but the great part about view

00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:04,099
itself is that it's super simple and so

00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:07,099
even you bite it in not use all these

00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:10,009
once because he wants to have something

00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:12,050
that is super super simple and that is

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:16,749
you know he is a good design I could

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:20,269
coder so he built something that is

00:08:16,749 --> 00:08:24,019
super easy to use but gives you all the

00:08:20,269 --> 00:08:26,479
power of view and so how does it work to

00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:29,029
get started one two three to get started

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,930
it's super easy so all you have to do is

00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:36,829
you install it's on the node package a

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:40,969
module repository and you install it one

00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:42,769
version is globally with yarn and then

00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:46,160
you get the command line which is called

00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:48,350
repress and the idea is you know if you

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:51,410
create a new page you create at the page

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,790
in text with markdown so in this case I

00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:56,270
read me

00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:59,480
page and then hell will be press and if

00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:03,170
I build it I have my complete website

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,690
and the second option is you can start a

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,850
local development server and the local

00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:10,310
development server has the web pack

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:13,580
magic which means you have hot hot

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:15,200
reloading so if you change your page it

00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,660
automatically if you have the browser

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,060
open you know it automatically repels

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:25,250
and updates the browser you don't have

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:29,380
to refresh yourself and so it's super

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:32,690
easy that's the idea to get started and

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:35,030
it's also minimalistic so it has

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:38,210
essentially it has two commands it has

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:42,500
three but they're two main commands is

00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:44,870
the built is they mean so you have the

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,360
files and then the templates and it

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,700
builds your web static website and it

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,040
has the developer mode with the

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,560
development server so you can you know

00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,550
you can edit your files and it

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,140
automatically rebuilds and it

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:03,470
automatically refreshes your if you have

00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:06,860
the browser open your your pages in the

00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,990
browser and the each act is if you want

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,510
to change it has a built-in template and

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:15,050
design theme if you want to use the

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:18,010
building and change the building design

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:27,760
theme you can it checked which gives you

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:32,690
all the components for the layout and

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:36,470
yeah but usually what you do is what you

00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:38,510
do is so you add it to a project let's

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:42,500
say you have your your project and

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:45,980
currently we press is used for

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:50,000
documentation so it's we press documents

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:53,090
we press and then it documents many sub

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,240
projects of view the router and some

00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:59,780
others and so how do you add it to to an

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,030
existing open source project it's super

00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:05,360
again it's one two three so the

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,650
difference is you add it to assuming

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,370
it's a JavaScript proto

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:11,300
with a package.json you just added to to

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,880
the package.json

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,450
the V press module and here the

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:19,310
important part is the currently only

00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:23,750
yarn is working

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:27,050
so the NPM manager is not working with

00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:29,930
view press so you have to use yarn it

00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:33,740
has to do with the if anybody knows NPM

00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:37,160
you know it's a turtle and the turtle

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:39,320
and a turtle it's the older modules the

00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:40,910
modules include modules and they are in

00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,990
folders and sub folders and subfolders

00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:49,730
and the yarn try to improve it by having

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:51,980
a flat structure and so the NPM cannot

00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:55,810
handle the installation of the we press

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:58,910
it will break for now so you have to use

00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:02,840
you have to use the yarn so I think they

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:05,240
are trying to fix it sometime but anyway

00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,310
so you use yarn but you still have the

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,490
package to change and then what you do

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:13,070
is you can just use your documentation

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:15,710
in a subfolder and the convention on

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:18,320
github or the convention is Doc's you

00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:20,840
know talks for documents so you put your

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,620
documents in the docs folder so you make

00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,630
a directory the docs folder and you are

00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,480
off to go you know you add your

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:32,390
documentation pages in the talks and so

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:36,590
I with me this would be your index page

00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:39,410
and it's the same principle and now

00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:42,560
because you have it locally installed

00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:45,620
inside your project what you can do is

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,800
you can add the script in the package

00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:51,080
station Jason and then you do we press

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,830
Steph talks and we press build talks and

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:58,880
so instead of using the local version

00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:01,460
the global you use yarn talks belt and

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:04,390
young talks development and it's using

00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:09,980
you know the local install and it also

00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:13,550
pills it into so how does it look so the

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,860
idea is to keep it we press the ideas to

00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:19,150
keep it super simple and what's the the

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:22,900
easiest simplest minimalistic way

00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,640
it's zero configuration so you if you

00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:28,690
want documentation or build your website

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:31,420
you don't need any configuration all you

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,630
need is your pages so in this case the

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,520
minimalistic would be I have the readme

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:40,510
that it's the index page and then I have

00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:42,790
page 2 page 1 and two extra pages of

00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,680
course you can name these pages you know

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,190
you're free to name these pages as you

00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,310
like

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:51,700
but the point is you know there is no no

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:54,970
theme no layout no configuration but it

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:58,660
gives you a high quality documentation

00:13:54,970 --> 00:14:01,330
website but in this case that the truth

00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:05,410
is if you have no configuration you

00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:07,720
don't get any navigation bar so you

00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:11,410
actually have to add a configuration

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,300
file and how it works is there is a you

00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:17,410
have to create a view press subfolder

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:20,680
dot V press and in the dot V press you

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:23,670
add the config yes JavaScript and so

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:28,300
that's the configuration for your

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:30,310
repairs website and it's JavaScript so

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,680
how would it look like or how does it

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:35,200
look like for a simple site now you get

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,839
the navigation and a site bar and a

00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:42,100
title so my B press site and then you

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,350
have the site part page 1 page 2 and the

00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:47,880
slash that's the and how does it look

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:52,410
like so if you compile it it looks like

00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:56,230
this one it's actually the same so that

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:59,350
represses the title that's the site bar

00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,900
on the left and it even has a search

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,720
building but the search is local and

00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,430
it's just searching the headings so it

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,910
can only search for the heading so how

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:12,430
it works if I do works you know it finds

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,770
the heading so it automatically it gets

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:17,339
the heading 1 heading 2 for the search

00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:21,690
or why or because it's a single page

00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,690
application your static website

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:30,750
and that's that they're building you

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:35,710
have seen repress that's the built-in

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:39,280
design team and because of course that's

00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:43,300
the part by about your use of you by its

00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:45,880
it called repress its you are encouraged

00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:49,360
or of course it works perfectly with

00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,260
view components so how it works is if

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:56,110
you want to add your own components

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:58,090
there is the components folder so that's

00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,970
the convention so you add a components

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:05,350
folder in your view press folder and

00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:09,040
then you can add your your own view

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:14,590
components so in this case it's the as

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:17,800
an example this is the counter you know

00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:20,380
it's a button and plus one minus one and

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,630
so how would you add it to your

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:26,290
documentation and so that's the great

00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:30,880
part of libras you can add you can add

00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:33,760
your view components to your text marked

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,120
on pages and now how do you add it to

00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:40,750
your market on pages there's no no

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,740
metric it's just as you would add it to

00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:45,640
your HTML page

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:49,330
so everybody is familiar with markdown

00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:51,520
so you write your your pages in text and

00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:55,180
then if you want a heading 1 heading 2

00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:57,490
or bold or italics you use simple

00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,640
conventions so if we're heading one

00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:04,959
there's the the pound sign a heading 2

00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:09,100
is 2 pounds and a bold would be with 2

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:12,220
stars so that's a bold but in this case

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,650
number modifier so the extension of the

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,949
purses you can just add your we press

00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:22,839
components inside your you know your

00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:28,120
pages and not only that you can add your

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:30,760
components you can also program inside

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:35,200
your pages so if you don't have a

00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:37,210
propelled component you can use in this

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,320
case you know 49 plus 30

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:44,230
this is just a view template expression

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,690
so inside the markdown you can use the

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:49,720
expressions and I don't not only you can

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:53,230
also you know you can use HTML and then

00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:56,440
you use HTML with this view so in this

00:17:53,230 --> 00:18:00,100
case paragraph for one of three you know

00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:04,720
and then it gives you a list it builds a

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:07,240
list of paragraphs three paragraphs so

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,550
it's not just you know in in your

00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,120
regular static web site you can use

00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:16,600
markdown but you cannot use the inside

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,850
your Mac down but in in view press you

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:23,560
can have best the best of both worlds

00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:25,300
you can use markdown and a Tesla if

00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,240
there's interest it has some great

00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:31,480
marked on extensions and you can use and

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,120
how to build it you know all yarn talks

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:37,060
built and what you get in the

00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,640
distribution by default you can provide

00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:42,610
the folder the output folder but if you

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,750
don't see anything you it it built it

00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,690
into the dist

00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:49,540
for distribution folder and that's the

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,790
the static website so the definition of

00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:54,070
a starting website is you can these are

00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:56,680
just a bunch of files and they don't

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:59,680
need a database and this is your ready

00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:03,840
to serve website you just have to upload

00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:06,000
it you know to get up to Heroku to s3

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,610
any you know you don't need a

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,620
application server you don't need a

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:14,200
database you don't even need a web

00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,420
server if you go server less you know

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,700
you can use a storage service s3 or

00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:21,220
firebase but of course you need a web

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,040
server an s3 is the web server

00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:28,660
but static the definition it is just a

00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:31,300
bunch of files and you see here it has

00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:33,040
again it has the best of both worlds if

00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:35,710
you want to have search engine

00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:38,590
optimization then you want to have

00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:41,620
single or pages you know if anybody is

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:44,380
going to hit page two then you want you

00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:48,670
know the page two ready to be served as

00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:50,770
simple HTML but on the other hand if if

00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:53,080
you if you click from one page

00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:56,200
to another page you don't want to reload

00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,570
you know every page and so in this case

00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,640
because it's with Jess and it's webpack

00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:03,310
and everything it builds a single page

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,220
application and here's the magic with

00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:08,650
the JavaScript bundles so once you load

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,990
a page you know it's a single page it's

00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:14,050
not reloading the next page but it's you

00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:17,800
know it has the machinery with service

00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:20,140
workers and everything that if you flip

00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,180
to the next page it's actually an

00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,940
illusion you know you're never flipping

00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:29,710
to the next page it's high technology

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:31,690
super efficient and of course it's all

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,370
server-side rendering it because that's

00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,910
all server-side rendering that's the

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:36,310
whole point

00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:38,680
so all this if you add a bootcamp

00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:41,470
component you can only add new

00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,000
components that are universal and that

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:45,580
are made for server-side rendering

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,130
because the different you know the

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,680
static is the definition that you build

00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,810
it ahead of time everything has to get

00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,420
built ahead of time and so there's

00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:58,780
server-side rendering for you chess

00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:02,080
components and so what what we press

00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:05,080
actually does is it has the router and

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,000
then it knows all the pages and if you

00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,570
do built what it actually does is it

00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,520
hits every it pings every page and then

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:15,330
it saves the pages that HTML snapshot

00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:18,970
every individual bus but it also has the

00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:21,070
view dynamic application but to get the

00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:25,060
static snapshot but it actually does you

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:27,580
know if you do built it does go through

00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:32,260
the router with every page and makes a

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:35,680
snapshot of every HTML page and that's

00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:37,540
that's the whole thing so the last is

00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,300
where's the theme that design coming

00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:42,520
from so it has currently they built in

00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:45,540
beautiful theme for documentation and

00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:48,430
it's on the on the on the roadmap to

00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:49,240
extend it for with plugins and for

00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,660
blogging

00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:55,090
but for now you know it's a perfect

00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:58,930
fantastic for documentation and you can

00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:02,440
adjust it and that's how it looks like

00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:04,720
if you eject you get the complete theme

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:08,740
and of course that was the whole excess

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:11,740
sighs that the design and the layout and

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:14,110
the theme is all in envy and so if you

00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:17,309
look at the theme you know you have the

00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:21,570
page view search box we site purview and

00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:24,730
the styling is with the stylist language

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:28,419
but if you look at the the home page

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:32,740
home be you know there's no no big magic

00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:36,880
it has the hero the hero image and that

00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:40,240
configuration and that's that's pretty

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,870
much it and so if anybody's interested I

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,789
recommend you know with the V press

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:51,640
you're looking here you're looking at

00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:55,630
the repress website on which s and it's

00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,970
built with repress of course and it also

00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:01,330
you know how to get started or the

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:03,549
Mactan extension goodies how you do

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,669
tables table of contents you just need a

00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:11,409
macro or it has like containers you know

00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:13,450
if you want to have tip warning error so

00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:17,500
that's a great markdown extension which

00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:19,840
is missing in in all the others it has

00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,270
code highlight code highlighting and so

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:27,159
on and the force but the important part

00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:32,320
is you know al-kitab that's the repress

00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:36,250
project and so it actually practice what

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:39,190
it preaches so it has the code and then

00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:41,650
that documentation is just the sup it's

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:44,679
inside that project so in this case it

00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:46,539
would be talks you know so it has that

00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:50,740
documentation and you see here's the

00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:53,020
setup which is the readme is actually

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:56,200
the site which you have seen you know

00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,760
and then it has the different section so

00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,500
the config is actually not the

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,650
configuration but it's they talk to come

00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:07,659
explaining the section for configuration

00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:10,299
let's read me just to read me and it's

00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:12,130
all a bunch of markdown files and the

00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:15,460
idea is if you have your own components

00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:18,340
and your own configuration you give it

00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,909
in dot V press so in total

00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:23,740
there's the configuration and they've

00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:27,070
got the components here are just silly

00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:30,960
examples so it has just you know foo and

00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:34,059
bar which are getting used as a showcase

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,809
because the real components are in their

00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:40,330
theme hidden and and if you look at an

00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:43,419
important part feature of view because

00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:45,039
the his half-chinese so it's one

00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:49,480
important feature from the start is

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:51,789
multilingual and all the documentation

00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,640
sites they are at least in Chinese and

00:24:51,789 --> 00:25:01,480
in English so they are all so if I click

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:05,529
on the config yeah so that's here that's

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:13,179
the the config let's see all it does you

00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:18,220
know is it shows the sections and then

00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:20,950
it has the section for for English the

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:23,169
section guide configuration reference

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:29,500
default theme and then it has the same

00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:34,779
section for for Chinese yeah so the last

00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:38,799
one on the readme it has more examples

00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:43,059
so it's not getting used for now for the

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:45,640
main for the main which s but the

00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:49,590
showcase you know you see the ecosystem

00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:53,500
so they will router the wheel loader we

00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:56,649
test you tells you X we client these are

00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,750
already using the view press for the

00:25:56,649 --> 00:26:01,240
documentation and if you click you know

00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:04,059
the actual it's open source you see

00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:07,179
their website and how they are using it

00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:17,820
and the documentation and so as a last

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:17,820
one if you do the view okay sorry

00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:24,950
so we chess dork

00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,510
how do I know that it's hex oh you know

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,960
here is the link

00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:34,790
muchas dork and that's the the source

00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:38,120
for the website and so this website is

00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:41,960
built in in hexa which is the the

00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:48,080
treichel clone which is using a kind of

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:50,210
jungle templates for the seaming so it's

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,130
pretty good but you know you it's hard

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,760
to use it miss view so that's the

00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:58,490
hacksaw which the idea is to get

00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,050
replaced with repress and they're

00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:03,050
starting with the small with the

00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:05,630
sub-projects before taking on the big

00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:08,120
one but it looks you know for just two

00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:10,760
three months super easy to get started

00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,370
if you remember to use yarn it's not

00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,940
working with NPM so question and all the

00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,940
thanks for

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,979
