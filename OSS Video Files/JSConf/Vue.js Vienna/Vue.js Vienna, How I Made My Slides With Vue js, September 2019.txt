Description: 
	Talk by Björn Ganslandt

Björn talks about how he made the slides using Vue.js and Eagle.js, for his talk "Aligning Development & Design": https://youtu.be/dylMmBvoMhk

He explores how Eagle.js builds on Vue to create interactive slides, and shares his slides code, and shares his observations on the pros and cons of this approach.

all right so the slides you just saw

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:12,269
were hosted on Natalie five hospice

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,240
isn't my computer but we're online

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:22,170
anyway and we're hosted on github and

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:24,330
created in Blue Jays so the way to I

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,609
mean there are many ways to create

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,210
something like this in UJS

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:36,050
but the way I went about to do this was

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:41,489
with the help of UJS so your dress is

00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:47,550
whoop this right here hackable slideshow

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:51,390
framework for view and there's a example

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:54,539
slideshow with everything from in here

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:58,500
right at the beginning so the nice thing

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,629
is if you want to present code then you

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,019
can just throw your coat in there and

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,260
you have croch highlighting out of a box

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,270
small s and you can also do things like

00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,400
life coding like you have your small

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,200
black box in here and change some CSS

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,840
and then that's reapplied to your slide

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,280
slide straight away so that's really

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:24,210
nice and yeah so here's some code that's

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:28,680
highlighted and this also shows you like

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,990
the basic structure you can use to if

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,189
you have images so you Jess

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:39,210
at its core is a mixin which provides

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:42,299
you with this slide tech this whole

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,310
thing is written in pack I don't know if

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:50,520
you know this and I think it'd just be

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:53,159
called Jade its HTML but without all the

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,979
brackets and indentation to show

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,250
structure so if you if you like Python

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:03,939
you will love

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:06,399
and forefingers you have this slight

00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:08,050
component where you can put in some

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,989
stuff and it will be displayed on a

00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:14,650
slide and yeah when you have another

00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:17,470
slide with two properties right here

00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,450
slide and left as for transition on

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:22,269
enter there's also a leaf transition you

00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:24,450
can set and that's interesting thing you

00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:27,250
can set a property steps if you want

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:33,069
things to happen while you're on a slide

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:37,000
when you define a next like hit the next

00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:39,640
button then this depth variable property

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,220
is pumped into the component and when

00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,190
you have this the best all of our

00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,319
Freight frameworks and so on get

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:52,030
displayed one after after in every ever

00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:56,040
as you hit next and you can do stuff

00:02:52,030 --> 00:03:02,950
like this so this is a slide but it has

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:06,780
toggles and you can consume variables

00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:12,609
and then continue to use these variables

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:18,989
on the next slides so if we continue at

00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:23,530
some point this name might be used again

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:26,889
so yeah that's huge yes it's really

00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:33,549
mainly a bit of CSS to do styling and

00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:36,940
this component and if you want to change

00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:39,069
for Styles first interesting mechanic in

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:47,340
that that you have to watch out for

00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:47,340
because so let's inspect this

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:53,560
slides are kind of very much unlike the

00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:56,349
rest of the web because and WEP usually

00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,390
you want text reflow based on the space

00:03:56,349 --> 00:04:00,879
you have slides you really want to

00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:05,680
behave like an image so they have to

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:08,260
resize depending on the screen size so

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:13,120
you want smaller text not text that's

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:16,239
being reflow and let me try to show what

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,739
this does so yeah this text is being

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:26,650
resized and the way egauge is dustless

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:31,870
is a bit peculiar so if I resize here

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:38,919
you see the font size at the Aptech gets

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:44,080
changed and what this enables me to do

00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:50,590
is if I set my size for all the things

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:53,320
more or less in M all of elements

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:58,660
beneath AB are going to inherit this

00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:02,169
font size and the e/m sizes according to

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:07,900
the font size of a parent so e/m is a

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:11,800
bit weird so this one here inherits the

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:15,820
font size from the app and this right

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,340
here which has a width for example this

00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,830
width is set according to this inherited

00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:23,410
font size so basically what this does is

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:27,240
when I change with everything that sized

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:29,740
in the M will be resized as well and

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,080
this really limits your options if you

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:35,020
want to size things in eager chairs you

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,820
have to define your CSS in m or in

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,889
percentages that's of course also

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,860
possible because that's also related to

00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:44,229
the parent tech and if you using CSS

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:48,639
grid fractions would be fine everything

00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:50,530
that's related to the parent and in some

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,120
instances you might be able to use

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:57,130
viewport units like VH we W but that's

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,740
already a bit dangerous so that's kind

00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:01,150
of weird because if you look at other

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,670
frameworks for

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,540
creating slides like reveal.js maybe you

00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,300
know that one

00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:11,080
that's real popular but it's kind of

00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:14,590
old-school feel kind of like developing

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:19,300
with FDMA and Jas like eight years ago

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:22,240
so completely different area era what

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:25,300
that does is user transform on the main

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,790
container so you have a CSS transform

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:31,120
which is scared something or if you look

00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:34,660
at spectacle which is like the main

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,530
react presentation to four four slides

00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:42,190
that adds transforms to all the elements

00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:44,980
that needed basically also changes some

00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,590
of a font size at at the root container

00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:50,200
but not to resize everything I think

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:53,620
just to give it a base font size which

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,990
is a bit responsive so yeah that's the

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:58,150
main thing to look out for if you want

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,490
to create your own theme it comes with

00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:03,610
theme already so you don't really have

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:11,470
to think about it if you don't want to

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:17,560
and whoop so what this looks like in the

00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:21,430
end is a standard views here I app so

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:24,540
standard structure you have your yarn

00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:28,860
which starts with whole thing and then

00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:36,310
in the source you have a app which

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:42,070
contains a lot of stuff so you have your

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:45,400
slides this for example all of them use

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:48,250
a very short fade-out animation on leaf

00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,340
this comes with all the animation in

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,530
animate CSS like a standard animation

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:57,100
library so you have a nice selection of

00:07:53,530 --> 00:08:00,550
effects for going from one slide to the

00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:03,520
next and you have of course the

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,440
possibility to use components within

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,200
this so if something gets too complex

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:13,060
like my title slide or the prompting

00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,680
then you can put it in its own component

00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:17,880
of course and

00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,430
then useless this is just a standard

00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:24,039
single fire component and yeah you have

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:29,470
a bunch of slides and move through them

00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:31,840
and you have to have your slideshow

00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:35,289
mixin which also provides you with your

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,789
slide component will be interesting to

00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:41,589
see how they do this thing and you free

00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:47,230
but I guess mix-ins will still be around

00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:52,209
just not encourage with much and this

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:56,170
also exposes like navigation functions

00:08:52,209 --> 00:09:02,459
so if you want to add a possibility to

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:05,050
use your slides with mobile touch

00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:09,459
navigation that's possible I'm just

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:14,080
using hamachi is focus looking on the

00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:17,050
main main container and if I detect the

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,270
swipe right I have a previous step and

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,330
swipe left next up that's pretty easy

00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:25,420
and I want some extra keyboard

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:29,110
navigation for my slides

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:31,740
not just the left and right also our up

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,320
arrow down enter in space should work so

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:39,750
also mapping these to next step in

00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:42,790
previous step and that's almost all of

00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:47,080
JavaScript I have to do if I don't want

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:54,700
extra stuff like palm and yeah otherwise

00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:59,770
it's some basic CSS a kind of abstracted

00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:03,100
with EMA away and created like a basic

00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:05,740
space variable which is like my basic

00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,040
unit because the CM doesn't really make

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,829
sense because it doesn't really met two

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:16,899
pixel size changes over time so created

00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:20,170
space services sass and within the

00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:25,810
variables where space is defined as one

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:27,260
yem probably yeah and yeah that's that's

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:30,590
the basic of of

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:33,410
so if you want to create your slides and

00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:35,800
code you can do it with you and it's

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,800
pretty nice

00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,950
