Description: 
	Talk by BjÃ¶rn Ganslandt

A great website is always a team effort by designers and developers. Still, it often feels like there's a gap keeping them apart. In this talk we'll look at ways to bridge that gap. Not only with better tooling, but improved workflows and good old fashioned communication.

my name is beyond I'm a freelance

00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,550
front-end developer and I would like to

00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,070
talk about collaboration between

00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:14,309
developers and designers or to put it in

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:19,880
other words aligning development and

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:23,150
design yeah not used to this yeah okay

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:27,180
so aligning development and design and

00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:30,689
if you want a design takeaway right at

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:35,520
the beginning don't do block formatting

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:40,920
on the web creates weird gaps which make

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:45,300
things hard to read so yeah what's the

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:49,489
problem in my experience it's a fairly

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:52,890
big and persistent one that designs

00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:57,989
don't get into production and to wired

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,789
the way we're intended to and that's a

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:03,000
big one because especially if you're

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,090
talking about b2c the web is a fairly

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,860
polished place nowadays so if you want

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,080
to compete with your product with your

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,939
company you have a fairly high standard

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,460
to meet design-wise

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,420
and if you're not there it's going to

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,549
hurt your bottom line at some point and

00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:24,000
it's a fairly persistent problem because

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,189
even as our tools improved a lot in the

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,890
last 10 years so we have things like

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:32,220
view now which make building complex

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:36,150
websites a lot nicer still this problem

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:41,009
seems to be getting worse maybe you're

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:43,079
staying the same and so it's it's not a

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,979
easy one to solve and I don't think it's

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:51,470
one to solve just by throwing more tools

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:55,439
at it so wave this problem usually

00:01:51,470 --> 00:02:00,479
surfaces is that they seem to be gaps

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:03,950
between product and specification for

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:08,129
example if I get a design from a

00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:10,830
designer a mock-up usually there's maybe

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,840
some harvest ayats but there's

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:14,760
definitely no active styles so I have

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,650
make them up myself is this really

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,099
specified there's definitely you know

00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,230
focus sides we're talking about

00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:24,150
animations that's really hard to spec

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,760
out completely if you're talking about a

00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,560
text-based medium and maybe some images

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,340
to go with it and say okay this thing is

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,640
supposed to go over here but the exact

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,069
timing and the timing function the

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,989
easing function office that makes a big

00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:42,030
big change and how this is perceived at

00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,920
the end and it's also really hard to

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,190
spec if you're just using images and you

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,349
rarely get like movies to specify this

00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,690
and of course if you're talking about

00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:53,069
responsive design you usually get like

00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:57,690
if you're lucky

00:02:53,069 --> 00:03:00,569
free different PNG is one for the small

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:04,430
break point when medium one and vanilla

00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:08,700
one and the thing about is this is the

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:12,269
small one that's nice to some degree and

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:16,049
stretches out well just try this out

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:20,489
this is a really tiny grabbing point so

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:24,239
yeah small is nice but when you hit this

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:27,989
length of the unknown until you reach

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,209
safe harbor of iPad land again and you

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:33,870
kind of have to make up words in between

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:38,280
so specification again is really lacking

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:40,620
in here and this isn't really the

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:45,060
thought of a bad designer this has to do

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:48,239
with how design is communicated and many

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:52,950
instances and so what's keeping

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:56,489
developers and designers apart well in a

00:03:52,950 --> 00:04:00,810
lot of cases Jireh if you don't know

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:02,880
what tyra is it's a you're lucky it's a

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,400
ticketing system where you can define

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:10,620
like a back or a issue for someone to

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:13,049
work on mostly developers and it's a bit

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,299
of a ill-suited medium to talk about

00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:18,090
design because it's mostly text-based

00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:20,940
and the suited medium to talk about

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:23,550
interactions because we are kind of hard

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,800
to specify completely if you try to

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,259
expect them out and if Jarrah is your

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,050
single point of truth and your only

00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:34,199
point really where communication happens

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,389
between developers and designers and

00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,940
sometimes that's the case then this is

00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:42,370
really limiting and leads to these gaps

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,830
in specification that we just saw but

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:48,520
it's not completely fair to come or

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:51,490
blame this on Jireh because this mode of

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,490
working together is really connected to

00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:57,550
something else which is this idea that

00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:59,620
you have mostly scrum sprints which are

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,330
protected at the beginning and at the

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,970
end you have your definition of ready

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,370
which says ok this thing has to be

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,560
expect out to this degree until this can

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:10,930
go in and we can do our estimate and

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,849
work on this and then we put our

00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,919
headphones on and two weeks later we

00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:17,979
present you with something which is then

00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:23,349
meeting the definition of ready so it's

00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:27,219
really limiting communication but enable

00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:30,250
only things like doing estimates which

00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:32,500
is really hot still and another thing

00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,599
that's really keeping developers and

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,690
designers in part is them being

00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:39,400
overloaded developers having to work on

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:42,279
too many tickets on a sprint and really

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:45,130
rushing but in my experience the bigger

00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:47,020
problem problem is usually designers

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,169
being overloaded because if you're

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:54,039
talking about a technology driven

00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,659
company or one which is or anything

00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:59,590
that's not designed driven and that's

00:05:55,659 --> 00:06:01,779
most companies honestly they're going to

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:04,270
have like maybe one designer who does

00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:06,849
everything so that designer has to do

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:10,479
the print stuff they have to do the

00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:13,750
Bennis for advertisements and Facebook

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,150
campaigns and then if you do some UI

00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:18,610
overhaul they have to do that on top and

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:20,440
usually they're quite excited to start

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,930
on that but then they realize that their

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,949
week is already full and then of course

00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:28,840
we're happy to put things into JIRA and

00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:31,569
be done with it and get back to very

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,370
word so maybe that's the first takeaway

00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:37,409
which is quite obvious if you want

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,409
better design hire more designers yeah

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:45,060
what's the solution to bridge this gap

00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:48,780
well there's a number of solution which

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:51,210
are pushed by people in technology

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,980
business and venture capitalists so

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,990
naturally if you take that combination

00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:59,190
we're talking about tools which you pay

00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:01,710
for in the end and one direction

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,290
business moving in is a better Jayram

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:08,250
might be something like Zeppelin or

00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:10,740
envision which is more visual and that's

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:14,670
a good idea because you take out some of

00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,560
the limitations of Jireh to have a

00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,570
proper version history for different

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:23,190
designs and to be able to talk about a

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:25,650
specific point in the design but the

00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:28,110
thing is if this is all you're throwing

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,700
at your communication problem it's going

00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,560
to be eased somewhat but in my

00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,120
experience it's not going to solve it if

00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:35,400
you have a good communication basis

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,190
already then this is a great tool

00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:42,420
something like Zeppelin but on its own

00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:44,430
in my opinion not a complete solution so

00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,530
what about a better photoshop there's

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,780
also a lot of innovation happening in

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:52,830
this field if you're looking at sketch

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:55,680
and now figma and that's also a good

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:57,300
improvement which also has to do with

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,090
communication because if you look at

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,390
something like Photoshop if a designer

00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:06,060
defines a shadow around something a box

00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:08,940
shadow that thing works totally

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,000
different than CSS so if I want to

00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:14,340
recreate the same shadow I have to look

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,650
at and it and create something that's

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,070
kind of like it but to hit it exactly

00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:22,380
that's really hard but if you're talking

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,780
about Sketchup figma where feature set

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,570
is really aligned with what's possible

00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,860
on the web so I can just copy and paste

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,500
more or less and that makes

00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,810
communication a lot easier because we're

00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:39,300
talking about the same parameters at

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:42,780
least so yeah sketch and figma and as

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,570
improvement because moving things closer

00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:49,460
to web and make communication easier but

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,460
complete solution in itself also

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,920
and what about Design Systems if you

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,180
don't know about Design Systems for

00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,940
something like its target where you put

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,040
in all of your important components and

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,709
document them for developers and

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,800
designers alike and they are pretty much

00:09:04,709 --> 00:09:11,040
supposed to solve anything these days

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,529
and they're also part of a puzzle but

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,140
only if establish a common language

00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:18,870
between designers and developers so what

00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,450
I'm saying is you need to get designers

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:24,270
involved early on in this system to

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,040
create names and structures for things

00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,320
that work for them as well

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,410
if you just put your components in there

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,910
it's not going to be enough they're not

00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:34,920
going to use it because it's not useful

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:37,860
to them but if you sit down at the

00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,410
beginning and talk about what dark blue

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,930
is supposed to be and if that's the

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,450
right name for a finger you want to

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:49,709
design then that's good because again

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:52,140
you made communication easier so yeah in

00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:54,899
itself maybe not a complete solution and

00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,670
I don't think everyone needs a design

00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,279
system it's kind of like micro services

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:04,200
so if you're big enough it's a good idea

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:09,209
otherwise it's a lot of overhead so what

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:13,770
is in my humble opinion the resolution

00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:16,589
to it this is not to improve the handoff

00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:19,320
by creating a better driver or a better

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:21,779
Photoshop but to abandon the idea that

00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,270
there is one point in time where were

00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:26,370
involvement of the designer ends and the

00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,670
involvement of a developer starts and

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:33,570
then one is done and the other is ready

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:36,089
to work but to work together from the

00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:39,149
start and more or less of course not to

00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:42,720
the same degree but nobody really gets

00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:47,970
to cop out early and how's this supposed

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:52,560
to work well talk early so designers go

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:55,260
ahead and idiot designs in your favorite

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,589
design too if it's Photoshop all right a

00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:01,920
few quick inves that's that's great but

00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:02,520
involve me as a designer before you hit

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,760
something

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:08,070
that's polished because if you discuss

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,680
trade-offs before you get to high

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:13,910
fidelity designs they're much easier and

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:17,040
cheaper to to discuss them let me just

00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,080
explain this if we're designer has

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,780
taught over a design for hours and hours

00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,550
and involve three very important people

00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:26,130
who all said okay this is a great design

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:29,540
we're going with this one it's very hard

00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:32,190
to change course afterwards but if

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,860
developer gets involved early on when

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:36,030
this is just more or less a sketch it's

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,640
fairly easy to say okay

00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:43,290
yeah we can do this but it's not going

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:46,200
to work in AI 11 if that's a thing we

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,390
are worried about we can do this but

00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,090
it's going to cost us performance

00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:53,880
overhead and maybe we can do with but we

00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:57,240
need to find accessibility solution to

00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:00,390
this so maybe there's a different design

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,510
solution to a problem that's also very

00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:06,300
nice and acceptable to redesign up but

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:08,550
not the one he chose or she chose right

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,620
away and if you're talking about raw

00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:15,390
sketch it's easy to change course to the

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:18,810
other one so involve developers early in

00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:21,720
the discussion and then move to code

00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:24,480
early not right away because in my

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:28,110
experience it's easier to develop design

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,900
ideas without code something like sketch

00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:34,500
or Photoshop or whatever your favorite

00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:36,360
is iron two is but high fidelity is

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:42,300
something that should be done in

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:45,300
browsers so never do like 100% polish in

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:49,050
sketch unless you have to this is

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:52,320
something we can do as a pair and at the

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:55,770
browser so what I get as a developer is

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,110
a more or less rough sketch and what I

00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,240
do with with us is like a rough

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:03,060
implementation and then I carve a

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,320
designer over so we can push pixels

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:09,390
around until this gets to polar state

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,630
basically learning to pair as a designer

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:16,080
develop a pair and the nice thing from

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:16,380
my perspective as a developer is that we

00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,930
took

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,590
can make tweaks before they feel like

00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:23,610
criticism so if I get this really expect

00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,070
out 100%

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,770
polish design and I do my best to

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,590
recreate it in HTML and then I get like

00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:33,540
a 10 page PDF pack with a lot of red

00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,820
lines with things that are supposed to

00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,730
be moved to pigs to the left or to pigs

00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:41,610
to the right kind of feels like realism

00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:45,060
which of course is an adult being I'm

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:46,650
able to accept but if that's the main

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,650
mode of our interaction between

00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:53,220
developer and designer that's not off to

00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:55,050
the best start but if we both agree okay

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,630
everything we have right here that's a

00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:59,460
rough version and we do the polishing

00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:01,470
together well it's fine it's not

00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:06,150
criticism it's us together creating

00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:08,790
something that's nice so yeah learn to

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:11,100
pair and the nice thing about that is

00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:13,010
you start to build up respect for each

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:17,100
other's craft you understand that

00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:19,800
designers are doing a hard job

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,440
creating a design that's flexible enough

00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,260
to work with all these different

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:27,960
situations and as a designer you've

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,550
learned to understand that front-end

00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,380
development is also hard because you

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:34,290
have always different desires devices

00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:36,090
and situations and browsers where you

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:39,330
need to find something that works every

00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:41,550
every where more or less and so you

00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:43,230
understand that you're just not just

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:45,300
slacking off all day you're actually

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,520
doing hard work and you start to

00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,700
understand what the limitation of each

00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:53,760
other's craft is so you as a designer

00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:57,540
the designer can do designs that more or

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,640
less work afterwards for front-end

00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,190
development and as a foreigner developme

00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:05,370
I can understand what the intent behind

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:09,020
the designers so we both get better at

00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:11,850
our jobs really and this is good because

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:14,190
unicorns don't scale so a unicorn would

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:18,030
be somebody who can do both who can

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:20,310
design and at the same time is a great

00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:23,160
front-end developer and these people

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:25,380
exist and it's awesome to have them on

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,050
your team because that's this problem

00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,680
soft basically you have code that

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,890
matches for intent

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,080
for design but if you will rely on

00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,270
having someone like that on your team

00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:40,000
the day they leave your whole process

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:42,760
breaks down and if you try to scale as a

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,420
company you're not going to get unicorn

00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:49,330
for every team so it's not something you

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,370
can rely on as well but I think that you

00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,620
can do is create these pairs between

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:56,290
developers and designers because this

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:59,200
takes new superhuman abilities just

00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:02,740
takes working together and respecting

00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:07,209
each other and that's totally scalable

00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:10,750
and of course this doesn't come

00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:14,320
completely for free so the thing the

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:17,950
hand of dust really well is protect

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,100
everyone's ass so if you're a designer

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:24,630
and you create a design and this is

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:27,100
signed off by your boss and everybody

00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:29,230
agrees this meets the definition of

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:32,410
ready then this is a good design and

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:35,020
you're ready and you are out of a game

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:38,650
and if end result isn't good it's it's

00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:42,100
not your fault and as a developer if you

00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:47,260
get this design and you implement it the

00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:51,220
way it's shown in the mock-up at 1024

00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:54,160
picks then you also don't have a problem

00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,900
because yeah you did everything that was

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,080
packed and everything is out of scope

00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:03,100
and it's nobody's fault really if entry

00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:06,339
result isn't so great but if you move to

00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:08,500
something like the thing I just talked

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:11,130
about what you're really moving to is a

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:15,730
workflow which is more relying on trust

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:20,500
because you entering a sprint or

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:22,689
something like that with with a task

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,720
that is not fully expect out that will

00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:27,730
be expect out as you move along so of

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,309
course it's much we're much more

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,020
unknowns is harder to estimate and you

00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:34,900
have to trust that your team will be

00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,880
able to deliver on time and deliver

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:42,540
something that's nice even if you don't

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,540
know every detail of implementation and

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:49,799
it also means that everyone involved is

00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:51,870
responsible for the end result so as a

00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,880
designer if I think that goes to

00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:56,400
production is isn't great

00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,669
that's part of your responsibility even

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:03,059
if it's not completely your job and as a

00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:05,490
developer same goes for you so it really

00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:08,760
needs more trust but in my opinion it

00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:11,059
pays off because you get much my end

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,919
results and you able to do stuff that

00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:17,460
designer alone doesn't wouldn't be able

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,679
to think of because you he or she

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,809
wouldn't really know the limitations and

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,570
also not the possibilities of a web

00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:29,640
platform which is expanding so quickly

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:31,890
and very nice ways and yeah so this is

00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,190
why I think this is a nice way to work

00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:38,100
and that's really all I have to say

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:41,399
about this but if you want to you can

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:44,820
follow me on Twitter and also the slides

00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:48,029
for this online including the source

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:51,840
code which we will look at next but

00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:54,059
maybe first you have some questions or

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,100
remarks maybe you work differently and

00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:58,200
that works great for you or you do

00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,140
something similar and that works great

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,030
or not for you and I would really like

00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,579
to hear that thank you

00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,579
