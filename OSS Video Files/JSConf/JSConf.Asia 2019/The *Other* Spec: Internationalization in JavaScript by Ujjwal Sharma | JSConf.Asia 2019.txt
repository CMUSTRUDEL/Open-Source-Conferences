Title: The *Other* Spec: Internationalization in JavaScript by Ujjwal Sharma | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-24
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	No matter what kind of developer you are, in 2019, Internationalization is honestly kind of a big deal. Especially if you're building interfaces that transcend linguistic and cultural boundaries.
Over the years, the community has developed a set of tools for solving the problems in this area but they are non-standard, hard to keep a track of and in the best case, pretty huge.
I will talk about the new Internationalization APIs in JavaScript, which solve these problems and give you a decent set of tools to build apps that work across different languages, currencies and cultures.

Ujjwal is a Node.js core collaborator, Electron maintainer, Google Summer of Code mentor and ex-student. An international speaker and a JavaScript/C++ developer, he has been working with the V8 team and the TC39 committee to help make JavaScript better, one commit at a time. He loves to talk about open source software, DevOps, JavaScript, Web Standards and the Open Web.
