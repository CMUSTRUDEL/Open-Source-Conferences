Title: The *Other* Spec: Internationalization in JavaScript by Ujjwal Sharma | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-24
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	No matter what kind of developer you are, in 2019, Internationalization is honestly kind of a big deal. Especially if you're building interfaces that transcend linguistic and cultural boundaries.
Over the years, the community has developed a set of tools for solving the problems in this area but they are non-standard, hard to keep a track of and in the best case, pretty huge.
I will talk about the new Internationalization APIs in JavaScript, which solve these problems and give you a decent set of tools to build apps that work across different languages, currencies and cultures.

Ujjwal is a Node.js core collaborator, Electron maintainer, Google Summer of Code mentor and ex-student. An international speaker and a JavaScript/C++ developer, he has been working with the V8 team and the TC39 committee to help make JavaScript better, one commit at a time. He loves to talk about open source software, DevOps, JavaScript, Web Standards and the Open Web.

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:25,710
awesome hi everyone and welcome to the

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:28,320
talk if you're if you're feeling sad

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,470
that my voice is broken you have a

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:39,270
gentleman to thank that for so I do not

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:46,260
regret that but hi and welcome to the

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:48,870
talk a mojo I am planning to work I work

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,110
on nodejs and a lot of stuff as I told

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,850
you but talking about

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,710
internationalisation today I'm sorry I

00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:02,309
just early I was not in the right kind

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:06,200
of food but so because I have to make

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:10,380
this about myself first I work on nodejs

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,909
also electron well and I contributed

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,630
different projects in the JavaScript

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:19,950
ecosystem now that includes v8 and test

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:21,470
- six - that's how I'm barely qualified

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,930
enough to talk about this subject

00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:30,000
because I worked on some of the stuff

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:33,150
that relates to this right and also the

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,340
beauty and related things in the

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,070
ecosystem I'm a student as they pointed

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,189
out I been working with Google Summer of

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,750
Code for the past couple years and I'm a

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,450
speaker this this is not for you this is

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:50,810
for me to reassure myself all the time

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:54,570
times like you got this but so yeah I

00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:59,549
about the talk actually so we need to

00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:03,689
talk so we know how this works right a

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:07,110
couple of months ago I made a proposal

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,729
for something that I want to work on so

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,950
a lot of months ago I was working on

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,530
these things that was like oh it'd be so

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:17,910
amazing to talk to people about

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:22,080
and I I mean a CFP proposal for this and

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:24,660
I saw working on the talk and I realized

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,910
that I'll be talking at the awesome at

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,180
desk on fascia - oh you're some people

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,850
about this subject and a super stoked

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,940
one of my friends in Russia set up a

00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:39,350
meetup group like - for me to test this

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:42,000
talk out I went to the meetup group

00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:45,959
amazing young talented software

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,330
engineers sitting down listen to this

00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,880
guy about internationalization and I

00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:54,110
completely tanked the presentation like

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,550
it's it was so terrible that I like I

00:02:54,110 --> 00:03:00,660
get chills till it's I'm getting

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:03,300
flashbacks so I thought maybe I could

00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,850
like of course you're not as critical or

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,180
savage as the like Russians there was

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:11,489
like oh no but I thought I had the

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,160
courage to come up to this stage and

00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:19,200
talk to you guys about that presentation

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,280
I I think I do not so let's skip it it's

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:26,970
it's super boring anyway

00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:29,790
so yeah a lot of stuff I had when but oh

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,370
yeah atmosphere proposals right who

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:37,110
cares

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:39,030
so yeah you ever done I skip the like

00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:43,920
entire presentation like three minutes

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:46,410
so yeah don't want to bother you

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,290
actually now that we have a bunch of

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,720
time and I'm a speaker and I oh yeah

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,530
I've got you ears let's talk about

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,310
something else

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,920
something that we all care about if

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:02,989
anybody is like even borderline sad that

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:05,459
that I you did not get to hear about

00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:07,680
what you came here for let me tell you

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,959
about a cool website that I found on the

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,269
internet it's super amazing you

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,860
convinced so the deal how this works is

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:17,040
you can just go to the website and

00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:21,720
you'll get my entire talk it's called

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:24,000
MDN so yeah that that was that was the

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,280
original top you you so if you scan this

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,970
QR code you go directly to the

00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,350
internationalize

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:33,060
same page I'm sorry I cannot like come

00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:35,070
up here and talk to you people about

00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:39,390
like the nitty-gritties of the API

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:41,940
you'll just hate me for that so yeah go

00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:46,200
there and this will drop you directly to

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,790
the intel page let's talk about

00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,190
something else let's forget about the

00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,290
talk it was boring and pretty much

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:56,070
useless let's talk about software

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:59,040
development right it's I hope everybody

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:00,540
is okay with that and let's talk about

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,870
software development because software is

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:08,160
hard right I mean so so let's get this

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:10,230
straight like you all spent like at

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,740
least three important days of your life

00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:17,160
and and pretty much like most probably a

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:20,640
lot of money thousand dollars ticket

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:24,060
Jess conf right and like travel all that

00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,540
stuff to listen to a bunch of nerds

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,490
talking about nerdy stuff like why would

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,800
he do that right you could spend that

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,690
time doing nice things you did that

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,150
because software is hard it's really

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,700
hard to do software and you want to like

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:42,930
do it better do it more efficiently you

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:46,440
know what else is hard currencies so so

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:50,130
I mean one of the things that I do is I

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,410
ask engineers to - when when you go back

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,260
to your company find the guy who works

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:59,280
with find the guy or the person working

00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:01,820
on currencies and and payments and hug

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,060
them like really they're miserable

00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:10,590
because currencies are hard and if you

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:12,479
think currencies are hard like me it the

00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:14,610
the reason for that might not be that

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,010
you're as bad of a developer as I am

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,950
because currencies are hard for everyone

00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:22,350
like the people who you look up to like

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,110
all the damn time screw up with

00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:27,330
currencies all the damn time so there'd

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,550
be Google it's like so United States

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:33,300
always some arbitrary Omar years with my

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:35,640
three euros or it's it sucks when you

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,010
create your undefined civic type-r it's

00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,700
like how do I pay you like not a number

00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:42,700
dollars right

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:44,530
or when you get a leap late fee because

00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:49,090
you do not know how to pay like to your

00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:50,620
dollars Bethesda say a that that's an

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:55,810
awesome thing you should definitely pay

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:58,180
that much for that modify like you you

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,130
don't expect more if I do this like do I

00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,250
paint pants do I pay in dollars do I

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:06,100
paint neither of those and and also like

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,560
obviously the almighty euro dollar

00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,480
so it's hero is dollar it's your another

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,650
hero the next time

00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,960
I think the hell right and and you know

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,970
you know this this is the right if you

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,880
if you work on product stuff if you work

00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,250
on design this is these are the pretty

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,870
cool like microseconds right these are

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,120
the critical microseconds we have

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,700
already converted a user that they're

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,160
waiting to make that payment and the

00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:36,070
users basically like shut up and take my

00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,880
money like just this is the body we very

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:42,310
do not screw up right everything else

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,250
you got a free pass but like do not show

00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:48,340
our payments because like you finally

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:51,520
convinced them to pave that's amazing

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:54,810
right some people kind of get it though

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,310
I mean like I like a lot of things about

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,110
some of the Google web sites for example

00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:04,090
when I was giving this talk in Russia

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:09,700
like I already thanked the top talk and

00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:11,950
they were deporting me they detected

00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,400
that that I was in Russia and that I'd

00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:17,650
probably use roubles to go and so they

00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,410
deported me to the next slide mister

00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:23,470
Latvia so I ended up being in Latvia and

00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:26,860
I to go back home somehow so and then

00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:31,360
they detected I had to use euros and

00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:33,400
then coming here from home I on are you

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,290
go there you can go there right now it

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,090
probably detect you're in Singapore and

00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,920
just like show you all the things in s

00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:43,080
unique and that's great user experience

00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:48,370
right so so how's this sound like like

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:51,040
get me through this it's easy so it no

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,990
hard rules really straightforward so in

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,950
in the english-speaking world it's

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,950
fairly easy right

00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:59,620
so we use this is as God intended it to

00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,720
me we have the decimal point when it

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:05,230
needs to be we have the comma separator

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:10,690
x' dollars pounds and euros of your

00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:11,920
Island but but it thinks as soon as you

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,550
move out of the english-speaking world

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:19,570
things start to get complicated so you

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:25,029
can have like yeah yeah Europe I get

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:26,980
that like but why like I like that that

00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:29,709
defies mathematics that's not like a

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,810
valid number that's why would you do

00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,180
that it was like Europeans like oh it's

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,250
okay but like so many people live in

00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,079
Europe and and like have some context

00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,790
about this it's like it's fair to assume

00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:41,320
like eighty percent of the people in the

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,500
world like probably have some idea about

00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,709
this format so it's like it's still bad

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,779
if we look at this one and Latvians so

00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:52,570
so that means used to use a space for

00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:54,160
like the delimitation i'm like what it's

00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:57,040
like that's not what do you use spaces

00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:02,140
for but okay at least they're not using

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:05,470
stabs so and then it's like is that a

00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,620
fraction like it's not what I do I do I

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:11,560
have to do math every time I'm like I

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:14,760
and of course the Japanese drop the drop

00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:18,220
the fraction because there's no fraction

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,570
but like so so an Indonesian people like

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,870
you know Indonesian people in the

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:27,910
audience could like right we need to

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:30,970
talk so what the hell is this what the

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:34,420
hell is this because that that is

00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:36,610
totally one point two three five I'm

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,399
gonna come up to you and I gotta pay you

00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:43,000
one point two three five not and I think

00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:46,810
it's not silly if you're reaching levels

00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,569
of like confusing Ness but it's like I'm

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:52,779
not even joking anymore right so the

00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:54,699
swiss franc using an apostrophe it's

00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:59,319
it's not a valid number but it's about

00:10:54,699 --> 00:11:02,410
its trained eyes and so this is

00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:04,529
interesting if you're Canadian you

00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,600
should like reconsider life choices

00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:08,550
because so big

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,910
not you when I say if you're in

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:13,589
Canada if the person like the format in

00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,329
which you write the currency depends on

00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,910
which language the person is speaking in

00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:20,430
so you write that if they're speaking

00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:23,310
English you write this if they're

00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:25,230
speaking in French it's like how how do

00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,810
you determine that's like do you wear a

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,370
tag it's like it says French and then

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:34,800
people like Izumo they're they're

00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:36,750
probably not as smart but but yeah it

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,209
doesn't have to be that way so let's

00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:45,000
talk about the the most important thing

00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:46,319
life let's talk about anxiety is what I

00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,600
feel when I work in multiple currencies

00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:53,759
and it doesn't have to be that way let's

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:56,220
fix this so we did if you go to your

00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,990
browser if you go to your friend

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:02,459
friendly browser right now or know Jess

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:05,250
and and try this API so you go currency

00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:08,670
you go Canadian dollars boom

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,079
English you got that French you got that

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,360
and it's like it that's just one

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,250
currency in two languages you can you

00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,029
can try that with all combinations it

00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,939
just works

00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:20,160
it takes out like so you can have

00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:22,079
variables for the currency and for the

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,350
language and then like it you can take

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,569
the guesswork out of the printing you

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,939
can just you do not use a static string

00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:36,269
just like number format your currencies

00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:39,269
and so so I'm sorry right for what I'm

00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:40,980
gonna say next but I have bad news it's

00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:42,870
like I hate to be the bearer of bad news

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,160
but it's not just currencies that are

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:53,329
hard right internationalization is hard

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:59,339
it's really damn hard so so actually oh

00:12:53,329 --> 00:13:01,050
this is we we have a small problem so so

00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,420
I was Brian to talk about a lot of other

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,910
things actually with just one next thing

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:09,240
but the problem about this is I cannot I

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:11,339
think because like a lot of you are not

00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,740
as smart as me and do not know as much

00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,630
math so I think we need to like revisit

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,370
some of the fundamentals if I like want

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,520
to want you to be at the same level of

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:22,589
thinking as me I am of course so

00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,510
let's let's take a couple of minutes to

00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:27,630
revisit the fundamentals if that's okay

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:30,660
yeah first class of kindergarten

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:33,600
counting so so let's let's start

00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:37,250
counting and we all love cats right so

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,709
so let's count cats so you're one cat

00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:42,120
you've six cats and you have zero point

00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:44,790
seven cats now don't ask me how that

00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,560
works maybe maybe you have like nine

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:51,149
roommates and seven cats between all of

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,610
you but like yeah so but like if you see

00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:55,170
the pattern here English is like two

00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:58,020
when it comes to claw realization

00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:01,110
English as like two things which is one

00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:03,060
not one which is like pretty simple it's

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,640
like it's either one or not one like it

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:09,860
might be a fraction it might be like non

00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:13,430
one number but it's not one and

00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:17,730
polarization is easy life is good

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:20,899
let's actually let's so let's move on to

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:23,670
a different breed of cats Welsh cats and

00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:28,190
Counting Welsh cats you have zero Kitab

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:32,730
you one get the 1.5 cat you have to get

00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:38,149
your three got your six yet you're 42

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:38,149
cat so pluralization is in English

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:44,320
and that's just death that's just the

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,660
second language that's just velch and

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,000
feels like so do SuperDuper close to

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,690
England right that's like how do you

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,190
 that up

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,880
but like you you go to like countries

00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,420
across the world

00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,759
Arabic is like for plural forms and like

00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,519
languages of like plural forms so

00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:05,440
English has like one and other and and

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,639
other languages that few and many and

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,310
like how do you determine that looks

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:15,100
like it's so hard to figure this stuff

00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:18,100
out but it doesn't have to be so we have

00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:21,130
a plural rules API for stuff like this

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:26,050
so you can you can tell it okay English

00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:30,759
us I like beef jerky but PR just like

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:33,670
zero it'll throw up other 0.5 other one

00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:36,370
is one and everything else is other you

00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:39,850
can just use this underlying low level

00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:43,870
API to determine what plural drew you

00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,940
need to use and you could I'm going to

00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,709
show a bunch of code next please do not

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,899
bother with like trying to read all of

00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:52,449
that it's like just just trying to

00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:54,910
demonstrate make a point you'll get the

00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:58,720
code later on but you can use this

00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:01,529
underlying API if you notice to to spin

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:05,529
up a quick script to like format your

00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:07,810
sentence right so English and just

00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:10,779
change it slightly and make it work for

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:12,630
Welch and this is this an amazing API

00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:15,399
you can use it for ordinals

00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:19,120
so you've got 0 at first second third

00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,880
fourth 11th and 21st forty second

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,970
hundred third in any language that you

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,490
want so these examples that I showed you

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:30,790
I I'm not smart enough to write them but

00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,589
the amazing people at v8 are and they

00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:35,439
have like a huge blog post op it

00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:37,810
explains the all the feature in detail

00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:39,850
it's amazing you can also find the code

00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:45,069
there just scan the QR code if you want

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:49,240
to just follow this link but yeah that's

00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:50,740
that's that API so like let's let's talk

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,730
about now that you're talking about

00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,639
stuff I have

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:57,010
zoo Asian right everybody loves relative

00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,310
time expressions like you do not want to

00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:03,579
know that your driver is for 42 seconds

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:06,370
away though but like the other

00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:07,660
observation I have is nobody really

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,910
knows how to do it

00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,829
and and everybody tries to do it I'm

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,720
like I'm just playing a video game it's

00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:16,030
like what what is that number

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:21,490
do it do I reach one this year I just

00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:24,549
want to play csgo and why is that so

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,230
specific it's like what's gonna happens

00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:30,580
that is that like the next Eclipse or

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:33,549
something but but you don't have to like

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:35,620
you don't have to be like super smart to

00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:37,809
do it anymore because you also have an

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,179
API for that so relative time formatting

00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:42,760
it's called relative time format numeric

00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:45,570
auto is like the format but you want it

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:49,530
to be in you can like do it short narrow

00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:52,990
whatever and and - one day is yesterday

00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:55,720
zero day is today one day is tomorrow -

00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,910
one week is last week zero week is this

00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:03,370
week one week is next week that's so

00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:05,860
cool right now they you can do this you

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:08,590
could already do this like this is this

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:11,549
is not that hard to do you'd be thinking

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:14,140
but I'll leave up to your imagination

00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:16,720
how hard it is to do in multiple

00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,660
languages if you want to support like 15

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,059
languages you're not gonna do it on your

00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:25,990
own and you'll not been people have been

00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:27,850
trying to do this kind of stuff relative

00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,070
time formatting especially on the

00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:32,770
internet for like all the time and

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,750
you'll probably do it as well you might

00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:38,049
use something like moment or globalize

00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:42,309
but definites with that now there's a

00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:46,210
problem with this and and where my segue

00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:49,330
into that is gonna be this right so I'm

00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:51,400
sorry but Laurie who you might find

00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,470
Brown is like better react in the

00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,049
browser you comments and I it's like

00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:58,390
it's a joke we get it but then if you

00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:01,690
think about it Laurie's on to something

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:04,330
right I mean like how many of you are

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,560
friend developers by the way people who

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:07,810
do front-end stuff that's

00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:15,210
quite a few I cannot say anybody but

00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:17,920
that's quite a few people yes and the

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:21,130
so bill reactant or browser you comments

00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:25,840
and so you are making front-end web

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:27,880
sites and the thing is that you like

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,870
pretty much every modern front-end web

00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:34,690
site like uses some sort of decent dome

00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:36,400
API right you use react or something and

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,890
it's like why can't you just standardize

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,230
that that will shave off your bundle

00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,360
sizes that would also like make a

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:46,480
standard API then people can that people

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,370
can just build upon and then and people

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,600
are doing that people are expanding the

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:56,430
web platform virtual Dom we're coming to

00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:59,620
the HTML standard so that's cool like

00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:03,280
talking about these kind of things let's

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:07,030
talk about sizes and like this is

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,190
completely safe for work but so so react

00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:11,050
and react I by the way I do not want to

00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,750
be controversial about this please do

00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:15,550
not separate me I have no idea what

00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,770
these words even mean like I I just

00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:22,390
write C++ please leave me alone Twitter

00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:24,040
but this is just data but like because

00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,450
people come up to me is like oh yeah

00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,320
isn't that supposed to be half the size

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:32,920
of Rick I do not know you tell me but

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:39,130
but react is is six like it's 187

00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:42,010
kilobytes if you if you react in itself

00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:44,380
is a package that has a huge download

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,880
it's like around 60 kaveri but then

00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,800
people come up to me it's like it's not

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,870
what it has to the bundle it's just what

00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,880
you download it's like fair enough so it

00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:54,430
just had six one five kilobytes to the

00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,620
bundle while pre-act adds 900 bytes now

00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,750
that's basically cheating because if you

00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:03,220
also add react on that basically adds

00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:05,890
like 104 kilobytes which is like but but

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:08,280
let's not dwell into that again but so

00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:11,800
comparing the magnitude you add in view

00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:14,340
and it's like it's sixty three point

00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:18,250
five kilobytes if you just see the the

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:20,289
bundle size and then when you are

00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:23,110
an angle that does this angle the slash

00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:24,820
core so so you need a bunch of other

00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,980
angular modules as well to make angular

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:30,460
websites but let's compare that to the

00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:35,169
seal D our data now we gotta talk about

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:39,039
this because so that's over six

00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:40,480
megabytes for dates you need numbers to

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,630
work with dates so that's four point

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,960
three megabytes another one and but

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:50,380
there's a huge likes earlier or also

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,539
data that you need and then this like

00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,820
obviously you need something to query

00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:58,000
this data with so you need a Jas library

00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,650
for that and other like but these are so

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,240
abysmally small compared to these that

00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:06,070
like let's not even talk about that

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:09,429
right but that data is large imagine

00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:11,409
having this so I tried to like include

00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:13,090
the the bundle size which is the same

00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:15,640
because like this is JSON

00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,530
you can't tree shake that right you need

00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:21,850
all the data you need like you can't

00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:24,190
just drop languages but so so if you

00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,559
like have to compile all that data and

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:30,150
push that video bundle that's like over

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:33,429
it 11 megabytes if you have a manager

00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:36,730
even somewhat like the managers I've

00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:42,520
seen it's a non-starter like 11

00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:44,640
megabytes in no way but it's the

00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,559
relative time format API you know how

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,080
much the model size and this one is zero

00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:54,340
because it's built in the browser and

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,590
and you can you go from narrow 3/4 one

00:22:54,340 --> 00:23:01,960
day and you can go for Spanish which is

00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:05,200
so cool a lot vien or yeah this does not

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:08,580
make any sense or Chinese and this is so

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,919
cool right you can just use these two to

00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:14,710
check out what yesterday and today is I

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,840
tomorrow is I pretty much wrote a script

00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,470
just to know what these words are in

00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,780
different languages I have nothing to do

00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:25,900
and so it's like what about comparing

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:28,600
strings by the way yay we have got later

00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:31,840
for that because for some reason the

00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,359
Germans deal with the Avett accents

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,950
completely different from the Swedish

00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:37,899
it's like did they're right across the

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,779
border like get this sorted out right

00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:42,549
it's like just but yeah you if you want

00:23:40,779 --> 00:23:44,440
to compare strings if you want to sort

00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:48,700
strings or search strings which you have

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,719
to do like so so many damn time you can

00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,799
use this for that

00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:55,690
it's local specific and people people

00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:58,149
come up to me when I talk about this API

00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:02,409
and they would be like oh imagine the

00:23:58,149 --> 00:24:06,219
possibilities we have so this date time

00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:09,039
formatting less formatting like again

00:24:06,219 --> 00:24:10,479
these all things were despite whichever

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,659
language you're working on this

00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:15,489
segmenting so you can iterate over

00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:19,089
sentences paragraphs whatever you don't

00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:21,940
have to like do dot split period because

00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:26,830
like that only works so so far right and

00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:32,259
and it's all a part of to please come

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:42,549
help out now I think I can mirror my

00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:45,969
display on this one okay if you go can I

00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:48,339
use for internationalization it's

00:24:45,969 --> 00:24:50,320
putting all over the boat like most of

00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:53,200
the internationalization features you

00:24:50,320 --> 00:25:00,190
can use in your applications right now

00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:04,210
if you say the test to six to rip out on

00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:06,609
the internationalization API test this

00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:09,909
was the day we people put up this

00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:14,139
website remove cha-cha Creek or our IP

00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:17,769
and if you if you see the

00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:22,330
internationalisation API it started off

00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:27,009
with around 57% coverage with v8 going

00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:30,909
71 yeah in spider monkey 50% JavaScript

00:25:27,009 --> 00:25:33,339
poor for the 8% okay and if you see that

00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:38,289
the day the numbers have improved right

00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:40,839
so as of yesterday actually we didn't

00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:42,839
build it today yet and remove a little

00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:45,490
excess also if we don't care about it

00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:47,860
it's 61 percent and

00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:51,250
he's hitting 86% and spider monkeys

00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:53,710
improve to 54 javascriptcore says at 44

00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,200
but like things are improving things are

00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:58,090
getting better the deaths like the

00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,950
number of tests increase between that

00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,929
time so it's like even if somebody

00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:02,950
stayed at the same number they added

00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:06,190
some features

00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,100
I'd say v8 is like technically if you

00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:11,550
look at it we it is pretty much 100%

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:14,860
covered a lot of this comes from like

00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:16,780
features landing in v8 right now plus

00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:19,150
like one API which is called v8 brake

00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,670
iterator which we have like they handle

00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:23,650
differently it's like yeah if you're

00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:26,050
using no GS if you're using if it

00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:31,059
refuses use Chrome which I think they do

00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:33,070
I mean the numbers a 10 you can or any

00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:35,980
chromium based browser for that matter

00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:39,850
you can be perfectly sure that this will

00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:41,920
like chess work right so please use

00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:45,820
internationalization API Singapore is

00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:48,550
the only big GS Khan city that I can go

00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:51,100
to and be like four languages you know

00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:52,720
how bad it is right and people like yes

00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,340
because like Jess Condon for us people

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,630
would be like oh yeah just use English

00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:57,630
I'm like that's not the point

00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:13,809
okay so yeah thank you for that stuff

00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:16,059
and there's actually also on the tank a

00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:18,760
bunch of awesome people before I leave

00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:19,570
so there's Satya works on we thank you

00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,220
for all your work on

00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:23,050
internationalization and thank you also

00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,280
for like helping me out working on

00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,590
internationalization so much you're

00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,200
amazing thanks to my peers for helping

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:33,220
with this talk so much you're the best

00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:35,980
thanks for Rick at tc39 for for helping

00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:38,290
me through all my work with this desk

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,360
and and all this stuff

Thank You Steven for like literally be

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:46,510
