Title: Learning From Machines by Ashi Krishnan | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-24
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	Why can't you tickle yourself? How do you know where you are? Why do DeepDream images look so trippy? Why does trauma come in waves, washing over us again and again? Computational neuroscience provides insight into these questions and more. In visually lush presentation, we'll go on a journey through biological and artificial minds, exploring how models of cognition informed by machine learning and computation can help us illuminate and reconfigure our own processes of being.

Ashi is a visual poet who has been telling stories with code and words since she was a childâ€”perhaps before. She has worked at seven-person startups, fought fires in the trenches of SRE at Google, and spent the last three years teaching at coding bootcamps. She now works as a senior software engineer at GitHub, where she hopes to dissolve the walls between us and our tools. She is learning to regard every moment, and the creatures within them, with love.

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,720
yeah so this talk is that it's not

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,210
actually that's scary it just has some

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,000
unusual things some flickering moments a

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,410
few unsettling pictures nothing graphic

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,090
nothing where you'll be looking at it

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,669
and you'll say like wow this is

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,219
disturbing I and I know why it's

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,960
disturbing no it's it'll be more like I

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,649
don't know why but this looks this is

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,780
weird to me and we'll be asking why and

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,129
we'll also be talking about some things

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,760
some of the kinds of things that we

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,680
don't usually talk about and all sorts

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,750
of stuff kind of wants to pour down

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,750
river when you open locks like that and

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,760
so I want you to be here for it but if

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,590
you can't be here for it then take care

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:05,790
of yourselves otherwise hello my name is

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:08,640
Oishi and today I want to talk with you

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,990
about a hobby I want to share some of

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,760
the things that I've learned at the

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,540
intersection of computational

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,610
neuroscience and machine learning for

00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:21,299
years I've been fascinated by how we

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,580
think how we perceive how the machinery

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,430
of our bodies results in qualitative

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,470
experiences and why we have the kinds of

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,680
experiences we do why they're shaped

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,770
like this and not like that why we

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,860
suffer for years

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,530
I've also been fascinated by AI and I

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,770
think we all have we're watching these

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,740
machines begin to approximate the tasks

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:50,399
of our cognition sometimes in unsettling

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,740
ways and so today I want to share with

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,829
you some of what I've learned some of it

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,860
is solid research some of it is solid

00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:01,200
speculation and all if it speaks to

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,469
truth that I have come to believe which

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,500
is that we are computations our worlds

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:12,760
created on an ancient computer powerful

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:20,620
beyond imagining so let's begin

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:24,440
part-1 hallucinations this person is

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:27,620
Michaela pareo Nieto and he has

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,630
something to show us it starts with

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,510
these simple patterns and splashes of

00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,480
light and dark kind of like images from

00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,880
the first eyes

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,720
these give way to lines and colors and

00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,040
then curves and more complex shapes

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,660
what's happening is that we are diving

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,200
through the layers of the inception

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:51,560
image classifier and it seems that there

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,709
are whole worlds in here shaded multi

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,910
chromatic hatches the crystalline farm

00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:03,050
fields of an alien world the cells of

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:06,280
plants to understand where these visuals

00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:09,110
are coming from let's take a look inside

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,300
the job of an image classifier is to

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,910
reshape its input which is the square of

00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,950
pixels into its output which is a

00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:18,320
probability distribution so the

00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,660
probability that this image is of a cat

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,230
the probability of a dog a person a

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,820
banana a toaster it performs this

00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,850
reshaping through a series of

00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,660
convolutional filters now convolutional

00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:35,239
filters are basically Photoshop filters

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,940
each neuron in a convolutional layer has

00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,070
a receptive field some small patch of

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:43,310
the previous layer that it's looking at

00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:45,590
and each convolutional layer applies a

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,190
filter specifically it applies an image

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,810
kernel a kernel is a matrix of numbers

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:54,290
where each number represents the weight

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,450
of the corresponding input neuron so

00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:58,850
each pixel in a neurons receptive field

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,650
is multiplied by its weight and then we

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,519
sum all of them to produce the output

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:07,130
neurons value we apply that same filter

00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,989
across every neuron in a layer and the

00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:11,810
values in that filter are learned during

00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:13,370
training so we feed the classifier

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,150
labelled image that's something where we

00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:17,120
know what's in it

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,609
it outputs predictions and then we math

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,830
to figure out how wrong those

00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:25,220
predictions were and then we math again

00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,910
to figure out how to change the values

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,240
in this fill

00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:33,980
to produce a better result so the term

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:36,050
for that is gradient descent the deep

00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,500
dream process which is what's creating

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:42,320
these visuals inverts that so this

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,870
visualization is recursive to compute

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,090
the next frame we feed the previous we

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:49,040
feed the current frame into the network

00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:51,170
we run it through the networks many

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,770
layers until we find that layer that

00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,900
were interested in and then we mask what

00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:59,900
could we do to the input layer to make

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,880
that layer activate more and then we

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,850
adjust the input image in that direction

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:08,900
so the term for this process is gradient

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,460
ascent finally we scale the image up

00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,590
very slightly before feeding it back

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,750
into the network for the next frame that

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,490
kind of keeps the network from fixating

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,620
on the same details in the same places

00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:22,580
and it also creates this really wild

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:25,250
zooming effect every hundred frames or

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:27,890
so we move to a deeper layer or a layer

00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:30,410
that's off to the side inception has a

00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:35,900
whole lot of layers and they are not all

00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:39,530
arranged in a neat linear stack and that

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:41,960
gives us this so we started with these

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:44,960
rudiments of light and shadow and now

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:48,620
down here we kind of have a city of

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,000
kodamas situation happening but then

00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,160
we're about to enter the spider

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,190
observation area in which spiders

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,390
observe you but it's okay because soon

00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:04,480
the spiders will become corgis and the

00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:09,140
corgis are going to become the 70s later

00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:14,270
we've got this space of nearly human

00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:20,060
eyes which will transform into dog slugs

00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:23,110
and then dog bird slugs deeper

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,090
unfortunately we had a saxophonist

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:31,159
teleporter accident

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:37,909
and finally the flesh zones

00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:39,349
with a side of lizard so when I first

00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:40,639
saw this I was like should I tell the

00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,489
story when I tell the story when I first

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,860
saw this I I thought it looked like

00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:49,399
nothing so much as US President Donald

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:51,649
Trump and and I resolved to never tell

00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,869
anyone that certainly not on stage until

00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:57,050
my best friend was watching the same

00:06:53,869 --> 00:07:00,319
video and she said you know this this

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,429
just kind of reminds me of and I think

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,559
that actually says more about the state

00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:05,809
of our neural networks than this one I

00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:06,759
think the lizard juxtaposition has

00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:09,439
something to do with it

00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,059
but I do want you to notice and think

00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:19,719
about what it means that all of the

00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:26,949
flesh in this network is so very pale so

00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:29,419
this is pretty trippy yeah why is that

00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:33,199
what does it mean for something to be

00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:38,959
trippy to figure that out let's take a

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:41,479
look inside ourselves meet Scully Scully

00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,699
doesn't need all this trust we're just

00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:47,539
looking at Scalia's visual system which

00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:49,789
starts here in the retina now Scully is

00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:51,860
retina your retina our retinas they're

00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:53,869
actually pretty weird light comes into

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,749
them and it immediately hits a membrane

00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:58,879
there's a layer of ganglions which are

00:07:56,749 --> 00:08:01,519
not actually particularly photoreceptive

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,469
that they are a little then there's a

00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,749
layer of more stuff that does important

00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:07,429
things presumably and at the back are

00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:11,659
the photoreceptors the rods and cones

00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:13,459
which sends luminance and color so when

00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:15,349
light comes in it has to go through

00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:17,839
these four layers of tissue hit a

00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:19,999
photoreceptor that photoreceptor is

00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,009
going to get excited it'll send out a

00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:25,249
signal to its ganglions which then have

00:08:22,009 --> 00:08:27,139
to send it to the brain somehow through

00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:30,169
the optic nerve which is drilled through

00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:32,180
the center of your eye which means the

00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:34,819
sent the sensors in our eyes are mounted

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,740
backwards and there's a hole in the

00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:40,810
center of them and it's all okay because

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,810
we patch it up later in software

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:47,310
a couple of other problems with our eyes

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:50,440
too one we have about 120 million

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,060
photoreceptors and there's 10 times your

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,399
ganglions than that so it can't be a

00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,190
one-to-one mapping and to the bandwidth

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,620
of our optic nerve is 10 megabits which

00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,389
is not you know like a lot I don't know

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,550
when the last time you tried to watch

00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:06,339
video over a 10 megabit connection is

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:09,160
but it's much slower than Wi-Fi our

00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:11,829
cameras are about 100 megapixels it's

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,019
not gonna work and so our retinas do

00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:16,360
what you would do if you were given does

00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:20,829
design constraints they compress the

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:22,829
data each ganglion is connected to a

00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:26,110
receptive field that's a hundred or so

00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:27,850
photoreceptors that is that are divided

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:31,209
into a central disc and a surrounding

00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:34,570
region so when there's no light on any

00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:36,910
of them the ganglion doesn't fire when

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:40,810
the whole field is illuminated the

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,850
ganglion fires very weakly when only the

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,339
surround is illuminated and the center

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:48,279
is dark half the ganglions in your

00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:50,500
retina fire release strongly and the

00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:53,800
other half don't fire at all in the same

00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:56,290
situation but those ganglions behave the

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,050
opposite way they fire when the center

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:01,390
is bright and the surround is dark so

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,589
these different species of ganglions

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,120
they're not actually different species

00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:06,180
they're just ganglions that naturally

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,260
behave this way they're scattered

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,660
they're distributed evenly throughout

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,880
your retina and if you think about what

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:17,199
this does creates an edge detection

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:20,140
filter so we're doing processing even in

00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:22,000
our eyeballs in order to down sample the

00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:24,399
image coming in from our photoreceptors

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,680
a hundred times while retaining vitally

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:32,019
important information namely where the

00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:33,970
boundaries of objects are okay so then

00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:36,790
the signal is going to go into the brain

00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:38,139
it's gonna hit the optic chiasma where

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,019
the data streams from our left and right

00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:43,209
eyes cross where we extract stereo

00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:45,130
vision it's gonna get processed by the

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:47,079
thalamus which is a switching center for

00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,699
all kinds of signals in your brain it's

00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:52,060
responsible amongst other things for

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:53,890
running our eyes autofocus each step in

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,940
the signal pathway is doing a little bit

00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,020
of processing

00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,510
extracting a little bit of information

00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:01,930
and that's all before we even get to

00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:05,950
hear the visual cortex all the way

00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:08,850
around back our visual cortex is

00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:11,440
arranged into a stack of neuronal layers

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,480
the signal stay is actually pretty

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,760
spatially coherent throughout the visual

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,890
cortex so there's some slice of tissue

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,110
in the back of your brain that's

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:22,060
responsible for pulling faces out of

00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,220
this particular chunk of your visual

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:28,420
field I mean more or less your brain is

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:30,600
very squishy each neuron in a layer of

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:33,280
our visual cortex has a receptive field

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,090
some chunk of the entire visual field

00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:40,330
that it's looking at and neurons in a

00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:42,660
given layer tend to respond to signals

00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:45,550
in the same way and that operation

00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:48,450
distributed over a layer of neurons it

00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,950
extracts features from the visual signal

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:54,430
early layers extract simple features

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:56,860
like lions and curves and edges and then

00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:59,980
later layers extract more complex ones

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:04,180
like gradients and surfaces and objects

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:05,560
Aya's faces and movement it's no

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,750
accident that we see very similar

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,220
behavior in Inception because

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,950
convolutional neural networks like

00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:16,420
Inception were inspired by the design of

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:18,460
our visual cortex of course our visual

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:22,720
cortex is different from inception in

00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:25,570
many ways inception is a straight shot

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,020
through it has branches but no cycles

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:31,540
our visual cortex contains feedback

00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,570
loops these pyramidal neurons that

00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,730
connect deeper layers to earlier ones

00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:39,070
those feedback loops allow the results

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,830
of deeper layers to inform the behavior

00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:44,680
of earlier layers so we might turn up

00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,900
the gain for edge detection along the

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:51,520
edge of what is later detected to be an

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:54,070
object this lets our visual system adapt

00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,589
and focus not optically but

00:12:54,070 --> 00:13:00,160
attentionally it gives us the ability to

00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:02,050
ruminate on visual input well because we

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,589
become consciously aware of it improving

00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:07,960
our predictions over time you know this

00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:08,680
feeling I think you think you see one

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,060
thing

00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,830
and then you realize that something else

00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:17,050
and these loopback pyramidal cells in

00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:20,140
our visual cortex are covered in

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,820
serotonin receptors different kinds of

00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,790
pyramidal cells respond to serotonin

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:28,779
differently but generally they find it

00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:30,700
exciting and don't we all you might be

00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:32,230
familiar with serotonin in its starring

00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:34,029
role as the target of typical

00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,320
antidepressants which are serotonin

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:37,270
reuptake inhibitors

00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,800
when serotonin gets released into your

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:42,040
brain they make it stick around longer

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:45,730
thereby treating depression some side

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,830
effects may occur most serotonin in your

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,470
body is actually located in your gut

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,149
where it controls bowel movement its

00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,100
signals to your gut that it's got food

00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:56,920
in it and it should go on and do

00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,209
whatever it does to food and that seems

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,310
to be with the molecule signals

00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:03,250
throughout your body resource

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,860
availability and for animals like us

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:08,290
with complex societies resources can be

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:11,170
very abstract social resources as well

00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:13,930
as energetic ones that your pyramidal

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:16,630
cells respond excitedly to serotonin

00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:21,250
suggests that we focus on that which we

00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:23,350
believe will nourish us now it's not

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,450
correct as a blanket statement to say

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,550
that pyramidal cells are excited by

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,770
serotonin there are different kinds of

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,740
serotonin receptors and their binding

00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:35,920
produces different effects so 5-htt 1a

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:39,550
receptors tend to be inhibitory somewhat

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,220
drowsiness inducing 5-htt 3 receptors in

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,920
the brain they're associated sensations

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:49,390
of queasiness and anxiety and in the gut

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:52,240
they make it run backwards so

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:56,230
anti-nausea drugs are frequently 5ht 3

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,990
antagonists there is another serotonin

00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,390
receptor one that the pyramidal cells in

00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,420
your visual cortex find particularly

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:07,540
exciting

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:09,910
this is the 5-htt 2a receptor this is

00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,980
the primary target of every known

00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:14,050
psychedelic drug this is what enables

00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:18,830
our brains to create psychedelic

00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:21,110
experiences so

00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,660
you go to a show you eat a little piece

00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:25,910
of paper and that piece of paper makes

00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:28,459
its way down into your stomach where it

00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:30,470
dissolves releasing molecules of fly

00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:34,490
surgit acid diethylamide into your gut

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:36,260
now LSD doesn't bind to 5 HT 3 receptors

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,420
particularly so if you feel butterflies

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,860
in your stomach it's likely just because

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,810
you're excited because you know what's

00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,290
gonna happen and what's gonna happen is

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,880
this LSD will diffuse into your blood it

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:48,649
has no trouble acrossing the blood-brain

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,890
barrier because it's tiny but powerful

00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:54,079
like you it will diffuse deep into your

00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:56,540
brain into your visual cortex where it

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,839
finds a pyramidal 5-ht to a receptor and

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:02,510
locks into place it will stay bound

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,209
there for around 221 minutes that's 4

00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:06,890
hours which is a very long time they

00:16:05,209 --> 00:16:09,260
think that a couple of proteins snap

00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:12,620
into place and form a lid overtop of the

00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:14,660
receptor trapping LSD inside which would

00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:16,760
help explain why it's so very potent

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:20,779
with typical doses about a thousand

00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,420
times less than most other drugs so

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:26,029
while it's rattling around in there the

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,399
little molecule of LSD is stimulating a

00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:31,760
feedback loop in your visual cortex it's

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,910
sending the signal pay attention what

00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,040
you're looking at may be nourishing the

00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,410
pattern finding machinery in your brain

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,959
then starts to run over time and at

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,820
different rates in one moment the

00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,950
pattern in a tapestry seems to extend

00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,839
into the world beyond it in the next

00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,149
it's the trees that are growing and

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,800
breathing the perception of movement of

00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:56,420
visual hypothesis that's been allowed to

00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:58,520
grow wild with deep dream we asked what

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,829
would excite some layer of Inception and

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:04,339
then we adjusted the input image in that

00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:05,929
direction but there's no comparable

00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:09,079
gradient ascent process in the

00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:11,089
biological psychedelic experience that's

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,610
because we're not looking at a source

00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:17,589
image we're looking at the output of the

00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:20,689
network we are the output of the network

00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:23,329
the output of your visual cortex is a

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:26,240
signal carrying visual perceptions these

00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:27,890
like proto qualia which will be

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,900
integrated by other circuits in your

00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,710
brain into your next moment of conscious

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,650
experience

00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:37,000
inception poor thing never gets that far

00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,010
we never even run it all the way to the

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,110
classification stage we never ask what

00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:46,029
it sees in all this but we could we

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,340
could perform the amplification process

00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:51,190
on a final result rather than an

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:54,130
intermediate one maybe we ask what would

00:17:51,190 --> 00:18:00,250
it take for you to see this banana as a

00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:04,450
toaster or say don't these skiers look

00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:06,760
like a dog so these are adversarial

00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:09,070
examples images that have been tuned to

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,049
give classifiers Frank hallucinations

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:13,289
the confident belief that they're seeing

00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:16,179
something that just isn't there and

00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:19,240
they're not completely wild these robot

00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:20,860
delusions I mean that sticker does look

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,250
quite a lot like a toaster and it's very

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,919
shiny and those skiers do kind of look

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:29,409
like a dog if you squint and I mean

00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,990
there's the head there's the body and if

00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:35,190
you were far away and tired and drunk

00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:37,600
you might think that it was a big dog

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:40,779
but she probably wouldn't conclude that

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,059
it's a big dog there are current

00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:44,169
properties of our visual cortex not to

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,029
mention the whole rest of our brains

00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:48,610
mean that our sense of the world is

00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:50,919
stateful it's a continuously refined

00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:54,039
hypothesis whose state is held by the

00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,440
state of our neurons laying the

00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:58,630
groundwork for capsule networks sera

00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:02,200
sabor Nicholas frost and Geoffrey Hinton

00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:04,809
write a parse tree is carved out of a

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,860
fixed multi-layer neural network like a

00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:12,279
sculpture is carved from rock our

00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:15,669
perceptions are a process of continuous

00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:17,409
refinement which may point the way

00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:20,080
towards more robust recognition

00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:21,640
architectures recurrent convolutional

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,429
neural networks that ruminate upon

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,380
images making better classifications or

00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:29,100
at least providing some kind of signal

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,960
that something is off about an input

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:35,590
there are adversarial examples for the

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:38,049
human visual system after all and we

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:41,169
call them optical illusions and they

00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:43,780
usually feel pretty weird to look at in

00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:44,679
this image we can feel our sensory

00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,240
impression of

00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,450
scene flipping between three

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:53,320
alternatives a box a little box in front

00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:57,730
of a big one a box in a corner and a box

00:19:53,320 --> 00:20:00,100
missing one in this monkey illusion

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,379
there is something scintillating about

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:06,730
the color of the dots which are all the

00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:08,169
same and are all brown if we design

00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,210
convolutional neural networks with

00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:13,029
recurrence they could exhibit such

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,619
behavior as well which maybe doesn't

00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:16,480
sound like such a good thing on the face

00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:17,889
of it like let's make our image

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,659
classifier it's vacillating and

00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:22,450
uncertain and then put them in charge of

00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:26,200
driving cars around but we drive cars

00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:28,269
around and it's our ability to hem and

00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,369
haw and reconsider our own perceptions

00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:32,490
at many levels that gives our perceptual

00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:36,009
system such tremendous robustness

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:38,230
paradoxically being able to second-guess

00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:41,350
ourselves allows us greater confidence

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:43,749
in our predictions we are doing science

00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:46,090
in every moment the cells of our brain

00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:48,279
continuously reconsidering and refining

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:51,070
shifting hypotheses about the state of

00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:53,289
the world and this gives us the ability

00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:56,230
to adapt and operate within a pretty

00:20:53,289 --> 00:21:03,869
extreme range of conditions even while

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:03,869
we're tripping face or well asleep

00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,559
dreams

00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:26,270
these are not real people like the

00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,920
unpeople of Monica showed us yesterday

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:31,260
these are the photos of fake celebrities

00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,930
dreamt up by a generative adversarial

00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:38,340
Network a pair of networks which are

00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:39,990
particularly creative the networks get

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,680
better through continuous mutual

00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:47,820
refinement and it works like this on one

00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:50,790
side we have the Creator this is a deep

00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:53,780
deep learning network not unlike

00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:55,980
inception but trained to run in Reverse

00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:58,110
this network we feed with noise

00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:02,700
literally just a bunch of random numbers

00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:05,010
and it learns to generate images but it

00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,690
has no way to learn to play this game

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:10,260
and the technical parlance it lacks a

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:14,490
gradient without another opponent the

00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:16,230
adversary the adversary is an image

00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,090
classifier again like Inception

00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:21,840
but trained to run on only two classes

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:24,530
real and fake it's job is to distinguish

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,030
the creator's forgeries from true faces

00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:29,820
we feed this network with the ground

00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:33,840
truth with actual examples of celebrity

00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:35,670
faces and the adversary learns and then

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,100
we use those results to train the

00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:41,040
creator so if it makes a satisfying

00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:43,140
forgery it's doing well if it's

00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,550
forgeries are detected we back propagate

00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,660
the failure so that it can learn I

00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,490
should tell you that the technical names

00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,680
for these networks are the generator and

00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:55,680
the discriminator I changed the names

00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:58,020
because names are important and also

00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,670
meaningless they don't change this

00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:03,900
underlying structure of the training

00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:05,790
methodology which is a game these two

00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:09,960
neural circuits are playing with each

00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:12,570
other and competition is inspiring when

00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,640
we spar our opponent creates for us the

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:17,640
tactical landscape that we must traverse

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,700
just as we do the same for them together

00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,680
our movements ruminate on a space of

00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:26,790
possibility is much larger than any

00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:29,250
fixed example set agains can train

00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:30,820
remarkably well on relatively small

00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,650
amounts of data

00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,750
and it seems likely that this kind of

00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:38,290
adversarial process could be helpful for

00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:42,190
neural circuits of all kinds it was not

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:44,670
without its quirks games are not

00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:48,340
particularly great at global structure

00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:50,980
this is fallout cow it is a cow with an

00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:52,570
extra body just as you may have spent a

00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,080
night walking through a house that is

00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:57,670
your house but with many extra rooms

00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,360
these networks are also not super great

00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:01,780
at counting

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:05,530
so this monkey has eight eyes because

00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:07,360
sometimes science goes too far do

00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:11,890
something for me next time you think

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:15,330
you're awake which i think is now count

00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,330
your fingers just to be sure

00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:21,670
I've been awkward if I didn't have five

00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:24,400
now if you find that you have more or

00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:27,660
fewer than you expected please don't

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,980
wake up just yet we're not quite done

00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,510
another interesting thing about this

00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,300
training technique is that the generator

00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:36,460
is being fed noise a vector of noise

00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:39,070
some random point in a very high

00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:41,710
dimensional latent space and so it

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:44,550
learns a mapping from this space onto

00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:47,350
its generation target in this case faces

00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:53,700
if we take a point in that space and we

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:53,700
just kind of drag it around we got this

00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:02,380
which is also pretty trippy no I mean

00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:04,420
this resembles things I've seen things

00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:07,660
someone who isn't me has seen on acid

00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:09,430
this resembles the sorts of things that

00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:14,350
you may have seen in long-forgotten

00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:16,600
dreams now I don't have a Magic School

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:20,890
Bus riot to take us on to understand why

00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:23,110
that is but I do have a theory when we

00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:24,820
see a face there's a bunch of neurons in

00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:27,040
our brain that light up and begin

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,450
resonating the signal that is the

00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,650
feeling of looking at that particular

00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:35,560
face taken together all of the neurons

00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:38,590
implicated in face detection produce a

00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:41,110
vector embedding some mapping from faces

00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:43,750
to positions in a high dimensional space

00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:44,620
and so as we drag around the generators

00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,190
vector here

00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:50,020
we are also dragging around our own

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:55,419
which is a novel and kind of unsettling

00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:57,490
sensation so that's a wild theory but

00:25:55,419 --> 00:26:05,580
it's not totally without neurocognitive

00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:08,140
precedent here we have a rat in a cage

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:10,150
so we've hooked an electrode up to a

00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,549
particular neuron in the rat's brain and

00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:15,580
these pink dots are the locations where

00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:17,919
it's firing if we speed this whole thing

00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:22,360
up then we're gonna start to see a

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:25,539
pattern emerge this neuron is a grid

00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,020
cell so named because the Centers of its

00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:30,520
firing fields produce a triangular grid

00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,120
there's lots of different grid cells in

00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,919
your brain

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,230
each aligning to a different grid and

00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:37,630
they collect data from your visual

00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:39,929
system from head Direction cells which

00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:43,630
encode the position of your head and

00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:46,029
together these cells can they construct

00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:49,000
an encoding of our position in 2d

00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:51,130
euclidean space this operates even in

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,720
our sleep if earlier you discovered that

00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,250
you were dreaming and you want to see

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,559
the end of this talk which are having

00:26:54,250 --> 00:27:00,669
trouble not waking up oh neuro knots

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:03,159
recommend spinning around this detaches

00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:05,559
you're perceived body the one with 12

00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:09,000
fingers and three extra bedrooms from

00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:11,289
your physical body which is lying in bed

00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,450
this positioning system is something

00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:17,020
which on some level you always knew

00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:19,960
existed after all you know where you are

00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:22,600
in space you have a sense of space as

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,409
you move through it and it's likely even

00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,179
necessary

00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:28,149
if we believe that cognition is

00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:30,130
computation that our qualitative sense

00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:34,029
of position has a neurocognitive

00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:37,840
precursor some signal in the web that

00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:40,140
tells us where we're at in many senses

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,140
of the word

00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:51,969
part three sticks and stones they say

00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:53,579
you can't tickle yourself because you

00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:56,440
know it's coming

00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:58,779
specifically when your brain sends an

00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,809
action command to your muscles it's

00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:05,979
called an efference when an efference is

00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:09,309
sent your brain makes a copy now makes a

00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:11,499
copy sound so planned so engineered your

00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:13,690
brain is this big messy evolved signal

00:28:11,499 --> 00:28:18,489
processing mesh so another way to think

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:20,469
of efference copies is as reflections we

00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,759
take the efference and we send it out to

00:28:20,469 --> 00:28:23,969
the peripheral nerves where presumably

00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,309
it's going to make some muscles contract

00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:28,839
meanwhile from the efference copy we

00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:32,349
predict how our body's state will change

00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:35,949
and we use that to update our brains

00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:37,449
model of our body's state now if we

00:28:35,949 --> 00:28:39,549
didn't do this then we would have to

00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:41,379
wait for sense data to come back to tell

00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:43,659
us what happened I mean where is our

00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:45,249
hand right now and then we would face

00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:46,839
the same problem is trying to play a

00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:49,599
twitchy video game over a crap

00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:51,729
connection signals take about 10

00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,440
milliseconds to travel from our brain to

00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:56,619
the periphery and about 10 milliseconds

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,419
to come back it's just not that low

00:28:56,619 --> 00:29:00,759
latency or high bandwidth our nervous

00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:03,429
system and so to enable smooth

00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:08,919
coordinated movements our brain has to

00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:11,859
make predictions so life goes on but in

00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:14,019
a moment we have another problem see we

00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:16,569
still receive sense data from our nerves

00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:19,209
and if we update our models again they

00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:22,359
would fall out of sync and so we

00:29:19,209 --> 00:29:26,199
attenuate this signal and keep the model

00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:28,209
in sync this attenuation applies even to

00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:31,409
our sense of touch when that touch is an

00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:34,419
expected consequence of our own movement

00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:37,119
now expected consequence that's quite a

00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:38,709
complicated model and aspects of it are

00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,869
likely distributed throughout our brain

00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:44,219
but there is one place that is

00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:48,579
particularly important in maintaining it

00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:49,209
the cerebellum the cerebellum is very

00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:52,029
special

00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:55,000
it contains half the neurons in our

00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:56,860
nervous system all action commands

00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,049
from the brain to the body wrap through

00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,110
it and all sensations from the body to

00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:03,640
the brain as well it has long been

00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:10,030
recognized as vitally important to motor

00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:11,799
coordination like this people with

00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,740
cerebellar damage have trouble

00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:15,880
performing this action smoothly with

00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:19,570
cerebellar damage

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:23,830
it's our movements become jerky and

00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:27,100
laggy it's theorized that the cerebellum

00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:29,049
acts as a Smith predictor our brains

00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,510
controller for our latency distant

00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:34,030
body's able to estimate the body's

00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:36,850
current state integrate sensory feedback

00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:38,740
to update that model and decompose

00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:41,049
grouse action commands generated

00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:44,970
elsewhere in the brain into a fine-tuned

00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:47,500
continuously varying control signal and

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:50,830
once you've evolved it the thing like

00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,630
that has many uses there's a growing

00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:55,659
body of evidence implicating the

00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:58,049
cerebellum in language which makes sense

00:30:55,659 --> 00:31:01,000
uh pterence is a kind of movement and

00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:05,169
language she said kind of gesticulating

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,539
is not limited to utterance the work of

00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:09,220
moving words it's not so different from

00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:11,890
the work of moving the body they are

00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:14,740
both transformations from the space of

00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:17,350
internal states of efference and ideas

00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,390
to the space of world coordinates and

00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:23,830
external sense impressions and back

00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:26,770
again and what happens when this

00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:28,809
predictor encounters a problem when

00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:31,590
there is an irreconcilable discontinuity

00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:31,590
in the model

00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:08,430
[Music]

00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:23,890
these are not extremely different

00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:28,690
they're both visceral and guttural they

00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:30,330
shake our bones and jokes too are shaped

00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:33,340
like trauma

00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:35,850
they're both shattering the

00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:42,090
Illuminations of discontinuities

00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:44,980
paradoxes which cannot be and yet are

00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:47,740
things that we must revisit again and

00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,780
again water smoothing the edges of

00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,690
cutting stone the machinery of our

00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:57,310
brains trying to make sense of a world

00:32:51,690 --> 00:33:00,940
that resists it these last few months

00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:06,550
have been very difficult for me the

00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:09,880
world is heavy my heart is heavy we

00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:11,890
build cages for kids to Diane we live in

00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,100
drowning cities built by slaves

00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:19,390
meanwhile I spend my days trying to make

00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:21,520
numbers into bigger numbers there are

00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:23,860
days when I open my email and every

00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,780
subject line is a stone and I think I

00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:32,500
should put these all into my dress and

00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:39,310
walk into the sea but I don't because I

00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:43,630
remind myself because I remember that I

00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:46,810
am a process of creation I am a song

00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:51,040
singing myself we our story is telling

00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:54,550
ourselves a see understanding itself our

00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:57,929
churning waves creating every moment of

00:33:54,550 --> 00:34:04,560
exquisite agony and exquisite joy and

00:33:57,929 --> 00:34:10,270
everything else it's you it's all you

00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:13,390
you are everything everything you have

00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:15,580
ever seen every place you have ever been

00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:17,890
every song you have ever sung every god

00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,910
you have ever prayed to every person you

00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:22,030
have ever loved

00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:28,210
and this boundaries between you and them

00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:30,960
and the sea and the stars are all in

00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,960
your head

00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:48,400
thank you

00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:48,400
