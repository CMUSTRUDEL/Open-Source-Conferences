Description: 
	What does shape the current state of Web Design? How can we leverage CSS to support the art movement on the Web?
Letâ€™s dive into art direction and trends to find a new way to express our design ideas in CSS. During my talk you will find more about the intersection of CSS code with collages techniques, anti-design aesthetics and much more. Everything will be combined with practical CSS and many examples you can use on your websites right away. I will be presenting some of my CSS experiments to show you that art has a true impact on CSS properties and new features.
Find your inner designer and join me on this artistic CSS journey.
