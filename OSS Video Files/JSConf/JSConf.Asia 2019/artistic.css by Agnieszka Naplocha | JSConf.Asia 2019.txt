Description: 
	What does shape the current state of Web Design? How can we leverage CSS to support the art movement on the Web?
Letâ€™s dive into art direction and trends to find a new way to express our design ideas in CSS. During my talk you will find more about the intersection of CSS code with collages techniques, anti-design aesthetics and much more. Everything will be combined with practical CSS and many examples you can use on your websites right away. I will be presenting some of my CSS experiments to show you that art has a true impact on CSS properties and new features.
Find your inner designer and join me on this artistic CSS journey.

00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:26,550
are you excited over to CSS yes oh my

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,859
god yes I'm so happy I'm so happy

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,410
because I'm going to tell talk a lot

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,160
about CSS so I'm gonna blow hot I'm

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:38,760
super super excited to be in Singapore

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,370
and my talk is titled artistic CSS and I

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,860
hope that you're going to join my CSS

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,160
journey in which I'm going to tell you

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,070
how CSS and art intermingle with each

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,460
other how art movements and design

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,699
movements actually inspire me to dig

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,739
deeper in CSS I hope that you'll find it

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,170
creative I hope that you will find your

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,470
inner artist I hope that you will be

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,689
eager more to experiment and I'm going

00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,850
to share some facts about history of art

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,090
so I also hope that it's going to be

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,280
useful interesting in your daily work

00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:16,049
you can find me on Instagram and Twitter

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,030
and I'm really eager to get some

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:25,500
recommendations what to do in Singapore

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:28,049
also in terms of art and design yes

00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:34,079
but before I actually start I would like

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:36,420
to ask all of you to close your eyes all

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,909
of you I can see some eyes open okay so

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,299
close your eyes try to be relaxed don't

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,790
fall asleep so try to remind the moment

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,200
when you were recently inspired by the

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:52,229
art or design think where was it in the

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,450
art gallery the art museum or maybe on

00:01:52,229 --> 00:02:01,190
the street was it painting

00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:03,050
the sculpture maybe the performance what

00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:06,800
was very specific

00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:11,300
was it the color the shape the

00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,190
composition or the overall style what

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:16,700
did you actually do about it

00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:22,160
did you apply it somewhere did you tell

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:26,930
about it to your friends okay so you can

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:30,110
open your eyes and I have to confess dad

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,420
art and the real word is something that

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,489
I'm super inspired by although I'm web

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,110
designer and coder and I spent a lot of

00:02:34,489 --> 00:02:38,780
time in front of computer screen

00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:42,410
actually the real word the analog part

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:45,650
bring brings a lot of ideas to me and I

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:47,959
always try to keep myself awake and keep

00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,300
my eyes wide open whenever I travel

00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,330
whenever I visit museums or art

00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,700
galleries and I'm also addicted to it I

00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,880
traveled a lot this year and I visited

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,890
tons of museums and cool exhibitions and

00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,160
what I found is that there is a

00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:07,430
connection between Web Design CSS and

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:11,720
art and this was actually the stimulus

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:15,380
that pushed me forward to create this

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:17,780
dog another one was the tweet by

00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,660
Christopher fond son in which is writing

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,000
which more people knew what CSS is

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,180
capable of there are so many

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:30,079
possibilities now for more creative fun

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:32,900
and unique layouts but I just don't see

00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:34,850
them happening that often and it's true

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,329
because we're still strapping 12

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:41,209
Congress and three boxes we always see

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,280
the website like as a box a thing so I

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,829
hope that my talk about artistic and

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,730
design movements will give you an

00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:53,720
incentive to explore and experiment with

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:56,180
CSS because it's a very creative tool so

00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,420
the first design movement I'm going to

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,359
mention well actually you're going to

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:06,319
guess which which one is that my hand is

00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:08,480
that it's celebrating 100th anniversary

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,900
dessert and what I would like to do

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,970
right now

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,610
is to open Twitter if your user account

00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:16,269
Twitter account if not you can pair up

00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,049
with someone who has a Twitter account

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:19,489
and I'm quitting

00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:22,160
I've been uploading as my Twitter handle

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:25,729
and when the law I'm twittering a poll

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,300
on Twitter right now I hope that you're

00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:33,320
going to see it second and I'm going to

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:36,350
give you ten seconds to vote so there

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:40,370
are three design art movements mentioned

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:43,190
so which that celebrate 100th

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,940
anniversary this year is it daddies is

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:51,139
it Bauhaus or is it impressionist

00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:52,190
so I'm waiting for your votes refreshing

00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:57,650
Twitter nervously

00:04:52,190 --> 00:05:02,660
I can't see anything but just giving ten

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:09,860
seconds more maybe I'll switch to my

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:12,940
mobile beta let's see whether your heart

00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,940
experts are not

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:28,240
don't see any votes can you see the

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:35,900
tweet with the poll yes

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:39,229
have you already voted okay so and did

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:43,099
you see the result you can see okay so

00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:44,979
oh okay I can see it right now so

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:50,440
there's a half half for it that has

00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:55,250
Impressionists so the proper answer is

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:57,979
happy birthday bad house so impress.js

00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:01,190
was in as a bit before because it was

00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:05,810
19th century and bad house was created

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:09,020
in 1919 so it's like the true 100

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,870
anniversary so bad house is a this I was

00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:16,490
Design School it was operating between

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:18,470
1919 and 1933 in Germany it was created

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:23,860
by Walter Gropius in Vemma and in

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:23,860
Germany and it was something totally new

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:38,570
hello okay thank you so that has was

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,740
something totally different

00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:46,610
it was a definite of a new art school so

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:49,789
in bath house they wanted to unify our

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,400
architecture and crafts together they

00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:55,400
also embraced technology so they weren't

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,469
afraid of experiments they also

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:03,289
encouraged students to dig more into

00:06:57,469 --> 00:07:07,960
typography theory of colors and

00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:11,150
performance so they really were into

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:14,479
simplicity minimalism and pure geometric

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,219
forms as you can see this is the example

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,300
that the works that were created in

00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:23,300
around 1920s and you can see that there

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:27,169
is still very modern and designers from

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:29,120
21st century could created it so what

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:33,050
was also very special about a bath house

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,680
is that they wanted to have mass

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,300
production

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,030
in its course so they think very

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:43,660
practically in all works of life and all

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:46,250
disciplines of art and design and also

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:51,590
practical minds of Bauhaus they were

00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:55,070
focused on minimalism and pure form in

00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:57,710
terms of like visual stuff so they

00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:00,470
worked on a grid a lot and this is

00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,330
something that we also have in CSS and

00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:07,940
this is the connection between power

00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:10,400
house very practical and an CSS so we

00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,220
all know that CSS is shipped to browsers

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,810
we know that we can experiment a lot but

00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,530
I'm sure there are some people who

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:20,360
haven't already dig deeper into it and

00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:22,490
in terms of the browser support it's

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,910
getting a lot of better you can see the

00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,110
green light so it's a good sign for us

00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:29,870
at the same time you might think that

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:34,459
grid also it's kind of a limitation and

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:51,350
it also pushes forward pushed us

00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:56,080
actually toward more back Celia I don't

00:08:51,350 --> 00:09:00,709
think okay I'll try to not to laugh and

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:04,490
so so what is very important in terms of

00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:07,850
grid is actually it yeah of course it

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:10,130
has some constraints some limitation but

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,920
actually breaking the grid breaking the

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:15,589
rules is super interesting from the user

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:19,180
perspective because when you when you

00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:22,580
see the Luft Hansa like Swiss like

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,290
poster you will see that a letter L is

00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,860
of the grid and it's something that

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:30,620
attracts user attention

00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:35,390
so we can also trade the grid just like

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:37,580
the way of experiments and also a way of

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:42,500
putting elements in in different places

00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:45,010
not very usual and what I love about CSS

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,819
grid and Firefox developer tools is that

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,709
it actually

00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:51,019
read the gap between designers and

00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:53,660
developers and this is very bad house

00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:56,149
like idea because Bauhaus wanted to

00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:59,209
bring engineers designers technologists

00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:01,759
together and also deaf I think that deaf

00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:06,019
tools is a perfect example of doing it

00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:09,859
because you've got a great panel for for

00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:13,579
CSS grid which you can immediately dive

00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:16,309
into it so if you work closely designers

00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:20,839
I strongly recommend you to show it to

00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:23,600
to your fellow friends and also new

00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,699
thing is happening so subgrid was was

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,369
already mention a test configured this

00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:31,669
year in Berlin by Ranger Rachel Andrew

00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:34,189
and with SAP grid you can create even

00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:38,809
more complex and complicated layouts

00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:40,879
because you can nest grid inside and you

00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:44,839
can also use the tracks definition of

00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:47,539
the parent in terms of support well it's

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,399
not that good yet but I took this

00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:53,169
screenshot a couple of years a couple of

00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:56,629
days ago and I also opened Twitter after

00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:59,239
after a while and I stumble upon this

00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:09,259
tweet by John Simmons that sub bread is

00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:11,059
actually coming to Firefox so it's so so

00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:13,369
you can experiment in Firefox nightly

00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:17,029
because currently it's it's in a working

00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:21,919
draft and when mentioning about the grid

00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:24,559
I also want to tell about dish towl so

00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,509
this is the movement which was created

00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,989
actually one year before bath house in

00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:33,699
the Netherlands what do we have people

00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:33,699
from the Netherlands hello

00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:43,220
III by the way yeah so their style is

00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:46,399
for me it's super inspiring in terms of

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,889
forum colors like biography and the most

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,879
famous representative of the stylist

00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:55,639
Mondrian and I hope that you you've seen

00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:57,649
his work somewhere it's super grid

00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,850
oriented and some people might think

00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:02,850
that well is it an art but for me

00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:07,050
it's so fascinating there there are

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:09,540
primary colors in like pure form which

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,269
is for me super super a big inspiration

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:15,899
for building the layouts and this is

00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:18,209
what also Jen Simmons does with with

00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,220
experiment layout lab this is her

00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:23,310
website and I strongly recommend you to

00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,980
dude visited and to dig deeper and I

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:30,600
love that she rotated the whole grid and

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:34,649
it's such a playful thing so as you can

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:37,980
see it's open grid another website that

00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:39,389
our stumble upon is the deck so this is

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:42,149
this website actually won the

00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:46,380
competition on Smashing mag for the most

00:12:42,149 --> 00:12:50,009
creative usage of grid not only it's a

00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:53,490
perfect example of creativity with grid

00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:55,740
but also I love the pure form the color

00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,920
that shapes enter a very Mondrian like

00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:02,310
and taking a lot of inspiration from the

00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:05,939
staff so summing up the first design

00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:08,610
movement which was badass in digital we

00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:11,399
have CSS grid and sub grid and please

00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:14,189
use it use it in a creative manner use

00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:17,670
it with crazy ideas I hope that that you

00:13:14,189 --> 00:13:20,699
will enjoy it so coming up to the second

00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:24,209
one I would like to mention about

00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:27,420
post-modernism and collage so the term

00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:29,420
collage was actually mentioned in the

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:33,930
beginning of 20th century

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:35,880
by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso I I

00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,899
guess that you know the second one for

00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,970
sure

00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:42,209
so collage is all about mixing different

00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:46,350
media and you must say that it looks

00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:50,370
very creative and I think that working

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:54,360
with paper and scissors brings a lot of

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:57,110
ideas and that only is very relaxing but

00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:02,850
also abroad in your artistic horizons

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:05,850
and and bring a lot of ideas so I'm a

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,870
super inspired by one Polish girl one

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,990
polish designer

00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:13,340
her name is Baracus and she does a lot

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:16,730
of work with paper and digital art or

00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:19,490
with collage she she she's been working

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:23,210
with many widely known brands like

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:25,790
Spotify also fashion brands and when I

00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:27,529
see her work I immediately think how I

00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:30,830
can reuse some of the concept and

00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:35,000
transfer it to to the World Wide Web so

00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:38,000
I started seeing CSS just like ik

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,970
Caesars and and and I think that's super

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,560
creative tool so I'm such a huge fan of

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:46,480
barcodes that I also attended her

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:50,589
workshops where we were supposed to

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:55,370
create collages for for Coco Chanel and

00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:57,610
it was tons of fun you have to try one

00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,050
day to do the collage only with paper

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,600
because it's something it's just like

00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:06,950
with sketching before you actually sit -

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:11,270
the graphics editor you can just take

00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:13,640
all your creative ideas and just present

00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:17,150
it on a paper it's it's much more easier

00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:21,170
rather than collecting and and pushing

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:24,500
pixels so this is one of my work I

00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:26,000
started to experiment with CSS what you

00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:30,230
can see here if there are some images

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,690
but I used CSS to actually cut it out

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,820
and you can see some see-through you can

00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:37,940
see some flowers coming up from from the

00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:42,140
jacket you can see some glitter and also

00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:48,200
glitter under women's eyes so I used CSS

00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:51,230
masking so masking helps us to reveal or

00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:54,170
excite some some elements in CSS it also

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:58,430
defines the transparency levels so we

00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:02,810
have we can we can influence luhan's on

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:05,410
on the Alpha Channel so the mask image

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:09,890
is combined with the image source and

00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:13,959
and it's counted like the the levels of

00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:18,830
transparency so here in this example

00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:20,420
there's a we've got a simple image and

00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,990
we have the

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:26,089
apply so it just cats out the part of

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:30,709
the jacket and underneath I applied a

00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:35,079
gift file as simple as that for the

00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:38,200
glitter splash I also use masking and

00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:41,450
here's the example so I've just had the

00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:44,180
simple container with the background

00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:48,410
which is this gift and I apply masking

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:52,250
and some sorts of collars addition using

00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:54,529
blend modes if you would like to have

00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,769
the different transparency levels you

00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:58,970
can do it with masking and here's the

00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:02,600
example of masculist

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:06,500
it's like fading out to the corner and

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:11,660
you can also see that the splash the

00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:14,360
glitter is fading out so you just simply

00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,339
apply it with with one line of code but

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,970
you need to remember about the vendor

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,860
prefixes as well

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:25,280
we have also CSS clipping which is to me

00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,740
just like scissors and paper and it's

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,130
kind of similar to masking but for a

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:35,299
masking we can use images and for a CSS

00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:38,270
we can all only use vector vector images

00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:40,460
so paths paints basically so in clipping

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,590
we decides whether something is visible

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,500
or not we don't have the option for

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:48,770
transparency levels and this is the

00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,260
example kind of my digital collage I

00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:55,760
made with CSS so you've got the plan

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:58,940
that is cut it out with clipping so what

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,040
I did before is I had to prepare the the

00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,710
path the shape of the of the path of the

00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:06,049
plan I did an illustrator exported an

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:11,200
SVG and later applied it and clip path

00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:14,090
so I to the SVG code face it and an HTML

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,640
between death stacks so it means that it

00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:19,880
won't be generated anywhere but at like

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,520
the our website knows what is the

00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,559
definition for the path and later we

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:29,080
just reference to it in CSS

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,080
so we've got clip path property

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:35,710
and this is how it looks in real life

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:39,370
we've got the plans I also applied some

00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:41,860
background and some blend modes and if I

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:48,909
comment out the flip pass you'll see the

00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:51,400
whole image so simple as that and if

00:18:48,909 --> 00:18:53,799
you're not very convinced that actually

00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,990
CSS masking and clipping are the future

00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:58,120
of web design I would like to show you

00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:03,039
New York Times website this is one of

00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:05,260
the article although they didn't use CSS

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,690
clipping or masking fur for cutting out

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:09,640
those shapes I think that more collage

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:12,250
like websites will be coming soon

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,070
because I think it's it's at the prime

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:18,159
tire right now so we're talking about

00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:21,520
masking I would also like to put an

00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:24,190
accent on storytelling so we all want to

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,100
have our users attracted to our website

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:30,370
and the content and some shapes some

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:33,610
visual elements actually help us to draw

00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:35,679
the attention of the users and I was

00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,600
super inspired by one of the example by

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,720
Razvan elements so I decided to do my

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,220
create my own version so you can imagine

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,270
that you're reading national geography

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:51,490
or some blog post about that travel to

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:54,490
to Iceland so what is done here is that

00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:58,929
we've got the heading that has the width

00:19:54,490 --> 00:20:02,649
and the height fixed so we can apply the

00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:06,760
background and we can apply the mask so

00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:09,370
the mask helps us to cover the heading

00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:13,029
and we have the impression that it's

00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:16,149
actually emerging behind the mountains

00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:19,720
so we also have the text fixed and in

00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:22,919
span tag and and it's just simple as

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:26,080
that and we also need to apply mask size

00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:29,980
to to make it match to that to the

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,659
background we have for the heading and I

00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,090
really like this example because it's

00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:37,750
very approachable for designers but also

00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:40,120
gives us like it's very impactful in

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,440
terms of user experience and the overall

00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,960
impression of the

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,360
website of the article so what I

00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:50,500
predicted needed to prepare before is

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:54,070
the mask image so I I cutted it out and

00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:57,610
in Photoshop and after applying a mask

00:20:54,070 --> 00:21:00,639
we have the visible area so the area

00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:02,919
where where the text will be visible so

00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:06,370
if we have the background it's going to

00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:09,309
be transparent and the text is what

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:12,669
would be will be emerging from from this

00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:15,159
space and when talking about masking I'm

00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:18,850
super excited about math composite so

00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:23,049
mask composite lets us to combine to

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:26,409
compose many layers of mask of masks

00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:31,450
image images so let's imagine we've got

00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:34,990
two masks splashes and one gradient so

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:38,200
what we do is we apply two masks and

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:40,840
then we just need to define the

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:44,289
compositing mode so here it is mask

00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,269
composite add and what's it's good to

00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:48,399
remember is that the first one is called

00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:50,710
the source and the second is the

00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:53,440
destination and once they're combined

00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,710
later than can be applied for the image

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,990
that we're masking we're going to mask

00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:01,240
so this is the example I created and I

00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,789
was inspired by some fashion magazines

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,610
and I really wanted to keep this like

00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:09,610
very artistic vibe so we have the image

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:12,700
and here you can see it's actually

00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:21,000
animated you can see different different

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:24,909
compositing modes and in this example

00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,179
you're seeing that we're having two two

00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:30,909
masks and if we apply only one it looks

00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:32,830
like this but if we combine them and

00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:36,039
actually add another image to make it

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:38,019
more collage like we can see that it

00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:40,840
gives us a really interesting in fact

00:22:38,019 --> 00:22:43,360
very artistic so for this one we've got

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:49,149
intersect compositing mode we can use

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:49,750
add and we can use the friend we've got

00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:51,730
four of them

00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:55,010
and I'm going to show you in a minute

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:59,630
and for this I also used blend modes to

00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:03,290
make it like more more natural effects

00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:05,120
of the flowers and make it more blended

00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:07,970
with the first image that it's

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,090
underneath so something that we've got

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:14,660
for blending for compositing modes

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:17,090
we've got add subtract intersect and

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:19,970
exclude operators and in terms of

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:21,980
browser compatibility well it's not that

00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:24,410
best yet but it doesn't mean that we

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:29,660
can't experiment with it in general

00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:31,610
masking is is better so I think that

00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:36,050
this is the moment to start digging into

00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:37,730
now summing up the collage movement it

00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:42,530
was originated by Pablo Picasso and

00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:45,680
Georges Braque in France and CSS is

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:48,890
deriving a lot from it through masking

00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:51,530
and clipping so the next movement its

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,600
pop art and I and I and I hope that

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:56,720
you're familiar with some works of Andy

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:59,300
Warhol and what I like about his worse

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,720
is the color so when I think about color

00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:06,140
and CSS one thing comes to my mind and

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,820
these are blend modes so I'm talking

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,460
about and thinking about blend modes

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:14,870
there is do a ton of fact a widely

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:16,940
popular widely used by by Spotify and I

00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,980
was wondering okay can we do something

00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,560
like this with CSS and of course we do

00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:24,680
so this is the simple image without any

00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:28,370
changes and these are some experiments

00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:31,130
with with blend modes so we've got the

00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:34,160
container and inside there is an image

00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:36,320
but there are also pseudo elements

00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,540
before and after created for the image

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,000
container where we have different

00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:44,900
background values red and pink and

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:47,900
different mix blend modes we've got 16

00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:50,240
of them so you can you can experiment a

00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:54,920
lot as you can see we can have very

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,600
various effects and again it's pretty

00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,390
simple to apply and I'm pretty creative

00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:03,110
to have on the website so summing up

00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:05,950
we've got pop art and we have blend

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,950
modes in CSS

00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:11,950
last art movement I want to mention is

00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:14,770
one of my beloved it's anti design it

00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:18,059
actually was taken from architecture in

00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:22,570
brittle and Brutalism in architecture so

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:24,970
for instance Bloomberg applies a lot of

00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,610
anti design ideas so you can see that

00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:30,250
some some some of their their ideas are

00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:33,429
kind of pretty kind of likely so this is

00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:37,600
all about anti design where we where all

00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:40,179
the errors and jamming is welcome so

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,149
this actually became a very hot design

00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:45,850
trend this year and laughter as well and

00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:48,039
in terms of representatives and art for

00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:52,330
for anti design there is fluxes group

00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:53,950
for instance Yoko Ono belong to it so it

00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:58,059
was originated in 60s

00:25:53,950 --> 00:26:01,059
and what they wanted to do is like the

00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:03,970
freedom in art so they blend it a lot of

00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:06,760
different genres and they were trying to

00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:09,520
make some ideas from typography from

00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:12,220
performance to yard so they were

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,289
experimenting a lot and I also really

00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:17,799
liked the typography experiments that

00:26:14,289 --> 00:26:19,690
are presented here so what's happening

00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:22,990
on the web are the brittle ice website

00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:26,020
that I truly love because like they're

00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:28,059
not afraid of experiments they're kind

00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,549
of weapon on come for mists and if I

00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:33,490
look for the inspiration even if I work

00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:36,190
for serious clients I always I always

00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:39,970
visit Brit Silas website have you ever

00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:42,309
heard about them by the way okay so

00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,049
people so if you if you haven't visited

00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:46,299
this website I strongly recommend you

00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:48,850
it's British websites I've come and it

00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:51,880
and it's now states that British website

00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:55,750
our dad but if you use inspect also you

00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:58,840
can easily explore the website so when

00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:01,779
looking for some ideas from anti design

00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:05,350
and like having something it's different

00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:09,100
and more and being more Rebell on the

00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:11,710
web i i i found this website and i love

00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:15,760
it because it's it's very simple but

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:19,000
they used one effect with playing with

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,750
with perspectives and skewing and i love

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,970
the fact that

00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:25,030
the website is dedicated to architects

00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:29,230
actually so so playing with perspectives

00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:31,360
it's very wise and I was wondering okay

00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:34,630
so how can we apply it on the web is it

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,539
difficult and it was super easy to find

00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:40,049
this code pen by James Boswell but first

00:27:37,539 --> 00:27:43,360
and you can find the address out there

00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:47,140
so it's just the wave with CSS

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:50,020
transforms we're skewing and with some

00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:52,330
upsetting a front from the left side and

00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:57,309
scaling the text and it's done on hover

00:27:52,330 --> 00:28:00,059
so it's super super cool and I also was

00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:05,190
exploring other website and found this

00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:07,900
with a kind of playful typography and

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:10,049
think that immediately came to my mind

00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,700
with variable fonts and I hope that

00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:14,559
you're saying for Mandy's dogs because

00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:17,679
she's going to show you some awesome

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:19,419
experiments with variable fonts although

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,539
that this is an image I think that we

00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:25,600
can finally do some crazy stuff with CSS

00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:28,480
to have playful typography and a bit

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,340
different than usual and also playing

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,870
with the perspective and I think it's

00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,750
it's something that it's not

00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:38,039
very frequently used but I think that we

00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:41,289
should start triangle 3d with some

00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:44,950
skewing in CSS because it gives a

00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:48,580
totally different different impression

00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:51,220
on the web summing up the design trend

00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:54,309
we have brittle ISM in architecture

00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,500
we've got flexes group and everything

00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:59,530
what's happening in in Britain in

00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:02,679
British web sizes is super attractive so

00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:06,789
please don't forget about transforming

00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:09,880
CSS and variable fonts well if you're

00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:13,210
afraid of experiments and you think that

00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:16,690
some it's not that easy to take a risk

00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:20,230
and apply all those all these CSS

00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:22,690
properties which are not fully yeah I I

00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:25,809
just recommend you to use supports rule

00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:28,030
which works like just like media query

00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:30,760
so if the browser doesn't support a

00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,760
block of code of lack of CSS it will

00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:36,860
just skip it

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:41,690
so we use it in this manner and if you

00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:43,940
don't visit museums often or or or don't

00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:47,390
want to look for inspiration in in the

00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:51,020
analog world I if I could recommend

00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:53,240
something I would recommend interest so

00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:56,590
I have my own board which is called CSS

00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,970
inspirations and I usually take some

00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:02,090
some things from the print and the

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:05,360
tutorial because I think that print

00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:11,240
gives us a lot of ideas what we can do

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:13,730
with CSS so summing up we have CSS graph

00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,550
I mentioned about clipping and masking

00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:21,050
which for me art dislike scissors and

00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:24,100
CSS we have variable fonts

00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:26,600
we've got blend modes I didn't mention

00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:29,540
writing modes but this is also super

00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:33,560
cool super creative to have different

00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:36,290
ways of showing and aligning the text so

00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:39,500
I hope that you'll feel inspired

00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:43,010
you'll feel inspired and you're eager to

00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,840
start digging into CSS and before I

00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:47,750
finish my talk I actually would like to

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:51,020
invite you for a quiz I have some some

00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:53,630
prizes candies from Poland and stickers

00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:57,110

the music is out there okay so this is

00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:09,380
the the code you should enter in a

00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:12,320
browser and then the important thing is

00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,990
that you're going to choose the shape

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,600
not the answer so please pay attention

00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:19,820
and you cannot change the answer and

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:28,210
only one is correct so we're waiting for

00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:28,210
