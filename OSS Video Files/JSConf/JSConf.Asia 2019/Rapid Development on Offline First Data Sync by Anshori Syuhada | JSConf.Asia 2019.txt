Title: Rapid Development on Offline First Data Sync by Anshori Syuhada | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-24
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	Wondering how to build offline first web apps nowadays? Let's build our own recipes to iterate faster creating offline first web app with data synchronization capability.

Anshori is part of engineering at eFishery (an Indonesian IoT startup on aquaculture). He crafts code by night 'till morning and debug human and process at noon. He loves data and engineering much while enjoying product development side. He dedicated himself for social cause and accessible technology for equality. The terminal console is where he grew up.

00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:23,070
good morning everyone

00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:26,039
okay sure you're not sleepy - okay I'm

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,099
actually a show today for this talk with

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,989
my college - person talks but he still

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:38,190
sleep when I went out he's not feeling

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:43,379
well so when when I will I was walking

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:47,039
here I stumble upon this gravity on the

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:50,640
a linear periodic road so it I just took

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:54,750
it two hours ago and I think descriptive

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:59,780
so provoking for me and it's true so

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:03,600
that with my teeth talks often force

00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:06,450
okay I'm and I'm from when do I work for

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,750
if you see it it was an IOT stirrup in

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,470
upper cultures a confessors domain I

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:17,460
don't know if have anyone of you I first

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:19,799
see this kind of shrimp ponds do you

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,970
know where your streams come form your

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:28,430
luxury seafood dinner this this is

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:34,229
shrimp ponds and it's wonderfully spawns

00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:36,270
and what is uh what else they do they

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:41,909
usually feeding they're faced recently

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:44,720
by this burst defeat human and this

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,790
causing a lot of downside for them

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,960
because our feeding could cause she's

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:57,570
dead and it happens in just a one night

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:59,640
offer a feed waste will go down the pond

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,939
and it will release the ammonia and I'm

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,329
gonna kill the fish so we built a

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:09,090
product like this and I do some hardware

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:11,180
I do some software I do some data but

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,470
most of the time I do nothing I just

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,740
talked with people

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,820
and actually we are practicing extreme

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:24,030
programming we caught by the pond

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:30,090
literally extreme programming okay

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:34,050
anyway I chest my title talks to simple

00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:38,610
development rapid doesn't really mean

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:42,060
simple but simple could be can help us

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:45,480
wrap it and it was kind of absolute

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:49,050
title often first web it web but offline

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,750
first so what's on the menu we are

00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,630
talking with offline first actually

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:59,310
single parts going out there my own

00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:02,370
solution my and then we were talks with

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,050
an other walks in this kind of area so

00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,090
just like everybody else before

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:11,820
can you please stress the hand if you

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:14,880
have have ever heard offline first okay

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:19,760
rigidity like I said 80% haven't heard

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:22,440
offline offers before okay so I first

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,560
know the terms of offline first like two

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,630
years ago we are building an application

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,540
an Android application for to be exact

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:36,780
and it's not working for our customers

00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:38,390
and we found this site it's it's like

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,280
kind of movement it's like an

00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:44,190
organization with it it's a little

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,800
community that talks anything libraries

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:51,900
lighting technology can that can work in

00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:54,090
two countries so this it's like more

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,340
design actually design a fruits for

00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,239
building application so it's not it's

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,830
more like a paradigm it's not abstract

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,410
concept it's a like paradigm how to

00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:06,320
build application and so why you should

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:11,810
care always we should care

00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:14,880
first thing rural areas yesterday

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:18,560
speakers from India Krishna or yep treat

00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:20,880
nur talk about rural areas India so why

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:25,080
because they were marginalized by

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,030
technology I don't know if we are

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,150
creating technology for rural areas

00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:36,470
beset nonprofit organization and social

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:40,259
cost in Africa or anything and this one

00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:43,830
rural areas is one of our customers in

00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:48,210
Indonesia and look at their Metro

00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:50,490
perforates it was no internet connection

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:55,440
almost no internet connection on the

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:57,919
seashore so that one is in north of Java

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,550
if you have heard Java before Indonesia

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,539
not just Bali

00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:05,069
I also meet people and where you come

00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:07,740
from Indonesia or Bali Bali

00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:13,020
oh no nobody I'm from Bandung Indonesia

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:17,490
yes Indonesia okay and this is data come

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:21,389
from 2016 we have three billions

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:23,879
Internet user but just 1 billion get

00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:27,900
access for high-speed Internet it is one

00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:33,000
third of total users and the others

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:35,460
still living with connection but not

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,069
necessarily good connection the first

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:46,800
one is India China and Indonesia my

00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:49,729
country comes third so why why we we

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,279
call this world wide web but we just

00:05:49,729 --> 00:05:55,020
make it for West wealthy Western web

00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,289
it's not my quotes

00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,629
it's from Bruce Lawson so it's not

00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:04,139
biased from me but yeah I grew it with

00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:09,120
him so did some what wide web should be

00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:12,379
encouraged more and why people by 2050

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:19,860
we will have population boom I mean a

00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:23,610
lot of people going multiplied merits

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,080
have kids every year every day but it

00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:28,500
will be an unconnected work because

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,330
India China Indonesia will have a

00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,460
massive population but I don't know if

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,770
our infrastructure technology or network

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,570
of roads will catch up really fast by

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,610
2050 and maybe

00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:45,250
it was their first internet interaction

00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:49,480
by smartphone I am sorry one of our

00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:52,150
customers they just know it was

00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:56,970
smartphone they told it was a small team

00:06:52,150 --> 00:07:03,250
what control at first man he only span

00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:04,720
like 2 gigabits quota but next year when

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:09,550
we come back again

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:12,870
his son using smartphone and spend more

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:17,320
than 20 gigabits quota I think wow ok

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:21,910
we thought we give them access and now

00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:25,330
they are consume more internet but with

00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:28,570
20 gigabits quota no his son playing

00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:32,110
drone flying drones in rural areas

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:35,230
because he knows that oh this one drone

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:35,770
and where where where can i buy it so

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,170
absolutely

00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:42,040
after she knows internet connection he

00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:45,270
can learn much faster you can learn you

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:48,570
can gain knows anything by connectivity

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:52,990
ok that's good but it comes with a

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:58,240
drawback smartphone user we are living

00:07:52,990 --> 00:08:00,850
in to 10 20 years before we are first

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:03,970
exposed to internet by except

00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:07,000
application and there's another bear

00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:10,660
it's barriers its design language icons

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,850
and anything it doesn't work with our

00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,490
users because they know their first

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:18,880
interaction by smartphone so they don't

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:22,410
know what hamburger icon is what the

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:26,350
home icon is they just read the text

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:29,500
that's not a barrier and next

00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:34,390
availability you won't have connectivity

00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:38,770
to senior data so we have to remember

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:40,630
this and I took it from the distributed

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:43,030
system network fellows this network is

00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:46,150
your enemy the network is never reliable

00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:48,190
so if you think that network is variable

00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,700
then you can have to wonder fallacies in

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:56,340
the submitted system

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:59,930
okay so I already show to you what's the

00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:04,370
problem what's the initial cost and how

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:06,360
today's technology approach this problem

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:09,600
you know the traditional kinds of

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,900
remodels and this one is often force

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:20,490
model so with the traditional pencil

00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:24,090
models we are really have to access the

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:26,280
cloud to get the page but in the often

00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:30,320
first module the data the assets the

00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,320
anything should be on the client side

00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:36,810
well it comes progressive web apps comes

00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,220
with the solution we have native look

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,820
like we have service worker we have

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:44,900
network Begaren sing and you need just

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:49,080
to create a manifest that can catch your

00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:51,960
assets you need you have that work at

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,030
that you yeah you can intercept the

00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,650
network request

00:09:53,030 --> 00:10:00,030
so is it progress about ups enough

00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:02,610
how about data synchronization how about

00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:06,510
conflict resolution when your users

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:09,630
online you can transact data real-time

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:13,620
but when your us user offline and your

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:15,180
users mutate or modify the data how

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:20,970
about when they're coming online

00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:23,460
how about to sing this data alright

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,920
first we have progressive web apps to

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:29,100
check the network we have network casing

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,460
but the other evolution it's not a

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:38,100
revolution the other movement progresses

00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:39,660
is how to sing the data based on my

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,700
experience there's two type of

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:47,670
synchronization document state and

00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:50,160
common state if you use what box yeah

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:53,040
yesterday that that was progressive web

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,480
apps workshop right if you use workbooks

00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:04,400
and you use network break dancing and

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:08,580
network you can sing your applique

00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:13,910
like groan they comment by storing the

00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:17,010
net what's the request and execute after

00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,470
you are online it was a it is a

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,570
convention that scene so let's see about

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,240
the document state I board from the

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,640
trailers synchronization architecture in

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,000
it was the first time I learned about

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,190
synchronization and cut the depend on

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,820
central object has to be implemented in

00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:38,010
the client and they only send Delta's of

00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:41,250
the data modification it was a

00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,600
documented so you have a prior document

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,760
and your current document and you're

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,980
sending the Delta State it was a

00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,230
document state and how about the

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,740
comments dead there's another libraries

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:57,570
really screwed us offline basically it

00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:59,640
was right your request to store it and

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:03,420
then if you are coming online it will

00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:10,560
execute your previous requests

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:16,350
sequentially and it and I was using this

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:19,970
kind of approach okay but it's terrible

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:24,209
if I use this the comments that sing and

00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:26,640
comments that sing I still implement on

00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:29,400
the back inside the synchronization

00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:34,320
mechanism how to configure is looting

00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:38,640
with users data and it all it was all

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,790
handled on the back inside it's a it's a

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,850
converse um and really not a good

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:47,190
experience for me and then you know

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,470
every my all from Google crossfire saw

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:52,320
it it is a beckon as a surface it comes

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:58,380
with reactive synchronization it comes

00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:00,650
with offline support but it takes your

00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:05,270
many way too fast

00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:08,100
yeah too fast I wrote

00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:12,030
little prototype when i--when five

00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:19,890
storages comes out one years ago I think

00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:21,900
a year ago I did some bad with

00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:26,400
architecture or bad implementation and

00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:32,640
it it took $20 for two weeks application

00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:35,910
that's bad and I found Coach DB it is it

00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:40,580
is an alt document database it's come

00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:43,350
before MongoDB become well-known it's

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:45,360
but it comes with pots DB it's an

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:49,020
implementation of coach DB in JavaScript

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:52,470
client so the possible we could live in

00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:56,510
your application where JavaScript it

00:13:52,470 --> 00:14:02,310
with a little or a bit little size and

00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:05,730
it it has approach sweet must multi

00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:08,340
master nodes so actually that database

00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:12,950
replication the database not only on the

00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:16,470
cloud but your device is also a database

00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:20,070
and it comes with a HTTP protocol for

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:23,070
replication so no need urine you don't

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:28,170
have to create another sing mechanism

00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:30,090
because it was ready by the design okay

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:32,850
so what I'll tell you what do we choose

00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:35,670
actually for all of ours of course we

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,870
need some requirement we need to web

00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,490
development ready we need to mobile

00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:43,140
development ready and time to implement

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:48,900
faster I don't put any economical

00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:51,510
constraint here and I just caught the be

00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:55,980
enforced to be with react why would

00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:57,930
react yeah because I we were familiar

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:02,070
with react and react native that's way

00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:03,750
and we can react react already

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:08,520
implemented surface rock already so you

00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:12,390
just uncomment or sorry you just remove

00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:14,030
two words the unregister change you to

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:17,280
register

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,060
that's we we gather offline first web

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,700
app

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,440
but it's not very simple development you

00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,970
get who you have a lot of boilerplate

00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,980
then you have to make a lot of

00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:30,240
abstraction with the pots and pots DB

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,790
and we are coming with the another ideas

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,980
how do what if we create a reactive

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:39,740
rendering for pots and coats so your

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:45,110
your application cool render by

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:48,570
instantly yeah how do you interact with

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,860
in like a stack container what if we

00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:56,400
create like a stack to endure to

00:15:49,860 --> 00:16:01,470
interfacing odds with page century side

00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:02,940
and this was classic approaching whereas

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:06,720
we have surfer we have component

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:10,650
renderer and this component state and if

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:16,770
we introduce offline first by using this

00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:20,940
kind of thinking if we use redux we have

00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:24,150
global stat Redux that that halt with

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:27,750
local storage that that interact with

00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:32,100
surfer interact with component and if we

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:34,650
design with without Redux you only need

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,760
a local storage to store your data state

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:43,380
and if you remember this one from its

00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:46,470
tremolo I think we're gonna use the

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,720
offline for sweet at radix because it's

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,600
much more similar with what other people

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:54,350
already had and we won't take another

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,880
step to reinvent the wheel

00:16:54,350 --> 00:17:01,230
so we're creating that container

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:04,860
interfacing with data synchronization we

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:07,590
call it pot store it was in production

00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:13,230
ready yet but we use it for our internal

00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:15,330
tools and we have a story what gist or

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,760
example and it was a it is a to-do list

00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:20,430
because nothing to trail in the world

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:24,480
that came with tout a to-do list simple

00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:30,600
app ok this is how we initialize the

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:32,010
store which you just need to set your

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:37,460
URL remote

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:43,380
config and your authentication if it's a

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:50,100
label and this one is for the component

00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:54,510
side you went to component mount you

00:17:50,100 --> 00:18:00,780
have to subscribe the VIP I to render to

00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:03,600
render your pets reactively and if you

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:07,110
want to add some item you just call the

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,230
add item API and for dello to you you

00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:14,070
could just call the direct item so we

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,540
abstracted more of odd squad of pods

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:23,760
implementation to add end to the other

00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:27,990
item and if you want to fetch the data

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:30,630
you could just call the dotted data it

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:37,500
contains your data and you can play with

00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:40,980
it because this one this is our store

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:45,510
looks like in detail you have local deep

00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:49,310
local DB ok remote DB and it will

00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:54,240
replicate from and synchronous from

00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:57,540
local and cloud vice versa and it will

00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:01,530
it is what's your it was watching your

00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:03,090
data changes so basically your your

00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:08,220
application will read from the memory

00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:13,410
not from the local storage and it comes

00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:14,580
with crude IPA called mitosis really so

00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:22,200
you don't have to create another

00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:25,580
boilerplate few lines of code we are we

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,110
put in front for react different ring

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:30,780
but how about the relative support

00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:35,310
because we we want to make what will

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:37,380
develop on radio also pots or pots

00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:41,160
application I'm sorry what's libraries

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:45,000
use indexdb and it will fall back to web

00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:50,160
a scale if there is an next DB what how

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,800
was recognized by whiskey l & SQ what's

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,140
use web SQL dragnet if can use SQLite

00:19:52,800 --> 00:20:01,230
why not create an adapter for react

00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:03,990
native for SQLite adapter and we stumble

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:08,940
upon Cordova SQLite stories and we we

00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:13,950
just modified recognize post reg native

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:15,810
implementation by I think storage be

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,820
asking started to use the SQLite store

00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:20,160
right why we asked you let storage

00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:24,810
because it's much larger and much bigger

00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:27,030
index DB can can hold about 50 to 60

00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:33,630
megabytes I think I forgot the exact

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:35,310
number and SQLite do also okay so we got

00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:41,600
a simple development often force web app

00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:46,290
with reactive rendering and it's it is

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:49,920
thinking that online this one from web

00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:57,180
and this one from mobile you can upload

00:20:49,920 --> 00:21:03,090
it and if within goes offline you can

00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:06,830
use your app as usual and with your

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:12,930
playing with the data and we can sing

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:16,130
directly after it has a connection so no

00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:18,860
need to create another power of plaid

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:21,000
but we still have problem with a

00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:25,230
processor limited about next connection

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,530
and we still have basic features need to

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:32,970
implement another slightly filtering and

00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:36,120
my lesson was most conclusion is do not

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,789
create your own synchronism it's the

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,179
nightmare to creature

00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:44,179
one thing mechanism and for other works

00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:45,979
you have you could see the others like

00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:48,830
Gandhi be looking for software by Martin

00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:51,649
clip one you saw read what Martin click

00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:54,769
on okay

00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:57,080
I think the half of these tops I like

00:21:54,769 --> 00:22:02,090
become a lecture because it was too

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:05,299
technical but III want to have a talk

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:08,499
with op and force and yeah you can think

00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:08,499
