Title: Designing Components for Fun, Profit and Sanity by Yishu See | JSConf.Asia 2019

Description: 
	In recent years, web applications have largely converged to a modular approach, where self contained components make up the basic building blocks of an app. Components have offered us a way to logic in bite size digestives but they can also grow to become huge unwieldy monsters.
Imagine you find yourself five years into a project, in a team of 10, over a thousand components, and a chance (albeit daunting task) to start with a fresh codebase. How would you begin designing the components?

Yishu is bad at things. Bouldering, speaking Japanese, crow pose; all bad. Thank goodness she's okay at making computers do things. Currently she is a software engineer at Carousell, contributing to the web platform. Before that in her career, she has taken on multiple roles - iOS engineer, backend engineer and fleetingly a product designer. Her current favourite function is .split().
