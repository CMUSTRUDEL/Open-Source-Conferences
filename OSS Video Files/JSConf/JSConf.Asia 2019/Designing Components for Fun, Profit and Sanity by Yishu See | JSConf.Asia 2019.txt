Title: Designing Components for Fun, Profit and Sanity by Yishu See | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-21

Description: 
	In recent years, web applications have largely converged to a modular approach, where self contained components make up the basic building blocks of an app. Components have offered us a way to logic in bite size digestives but they can also grow to become huge unwieldy monsters.
Imagine you find yourself five years into a project, in a team of 10, over a thousand components, and a chance (albeit daunting task) to start with a fresh codebase. How would you begin designing the components?

Yishu is bad at things. Bouldering, speaking Japanese, crow pose; all bad. Thank goodness she's okay at making computers do things. Currently she is a software engineer at Carousell, contributing to the web platform. Before that in her career, she has taken on multiple roles - iOS engineer, backend engineer and fleetingly a product designer. Her current favourite function is .split().

00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:22,400
hi good morning everyone so I'm really

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,070
glad that I'm sharing a stage with two

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,289
unicorns today so just I always you say

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,330
that she's gonna speak with like half

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,649
British half Singaporean accent but I'm

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:37,290
gonna go out Singapore next so I am from

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,350
Singapore so if you are from out how

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,750
welcome to Singapore it's the way that

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,469
this really is a not bad it's actually a

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,710
lot hotter on other days yeah so many

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,230
people okay so my name is issue I'm a

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,199
software engineer at carousel

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,930
so what carousel is okay this is how our

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,690
website look like is actually a place

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,830
where user get to buy and sell directly

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:08,460
from each other so a little similar to

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,750
eBay I guess yeah so what people do on

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,810
carousels that they care to buy

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:17,509
limited-edition goods usually and then

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:20,310
sometimes they buy Avengers footage from

00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:22,710
other people before so that they can

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:27,780
wash before their friends voice them so

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,729
I realized that that's only one bullet

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,909
point which is a period so I'm gonna put

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:36,210
a second one I got myself electrical

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,299
engineering degree before starting my

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,150
career as a software engineer so usually

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,409
when people ask me like can you tell me

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,689
something about electrical engineering

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,049
and I'll tell them do you know how your

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,960
keyboards they are not individual the I

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:56,610
individual buttons but then the the

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:59,990
wires crisscross yeah so I'm currently

00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,600
working on the web platform at carousel

00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:08,940
this is an article that come out about

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:12,540
half a year ago October more than that

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,590
okay so this is this is Stacy who is our

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,330
web team

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:20,640
he joined he wrote down like how this

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,739
project came about so this project is

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,959
like carousel like if you had seen like

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:27,060
Twitter like we have a carousel like

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,200
version and then we only serve it to our

00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:33,030
mobile users and that's only one goal in

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,280
this like version which is to make it as

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,910
performant as possible okay so I didn't

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:49,319
plan for this

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:52,829
but then so two days ago Alex Lakatos

00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:57,630
went to our office for a meet-up and

00:02:52,829 --> 00:03:00,440
then booms he tried to like profile our

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,440
website and

00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:35,450
oh thank goodness he said it was a good

00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:37,489
performing website okay so from we had

00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:39,200
and but on this project because our

00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:40,639
previous code base was about five year

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,810
old it was showing a lot of signs of

00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:47,359
aging and so then the decision was sent

00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,909
to halt all new features and then to

00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,859
concentrate so every single engineers

00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:55,489
who was working a web platform stopped

00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:59,510
our normal work to move on to work on

00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:02,359
this migration and who engineers this is

00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:04,760
this is just great news because we got

00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:07,400
to work on completely a complete new

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,400
code base from scratch and then we make

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,719
to me we can make design decision we and

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,340
then because we were already working on

00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,400
our code base we know other features

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:20,060
that we have so we solve have more like

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:25,580
a 20/20 hindsight to building this and

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:30,020
then we get to try new ap eyes yes so

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,190
but it's not without problems so today

00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,250
I'm going to share about some of the

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:37,370
lessons that I've learned and

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,380
specifically pertaining to components so

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,409
Schroeder he's sure where we have always

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:47,050
been trying to break our code up into

00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:50,690
pieces so this is a chart of the journey

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,370
there's a lot logo I guess yeah I gotta

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:55,280
understand mm-hmm

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,050
PHP server so we try to break things out

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,740
on the server we try to do it on

00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:04,009
JavaScript with moo-stache

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:06,949
handover and then of course there was

00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:09,770
backbone and then we move on to angular

00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:12,110
react view today and also web components

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:16,400
so what's that small logo at the bottom

00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:20,360
okay let me zoom it in components so

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,340
today everything is a component if you

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,930
like it it's great if you don't like it

00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,770
everything is still a component so

00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,750
component has become the de-facto

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,090
building

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:34,450
patterns of front-end framework today

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,580
and depending on like the framework that

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,000
you're using or you are not using

00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:43,990
framework this the semantics it's a bit

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,390
different so my favorite description of

00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,170
it of what the component is is that it

00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,070
has data

00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:53,340
yes structure and yes algorithm so not

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,380
not this one not this boat but

00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:59,140
separately they attach structure and our

00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:00,880
algorithm so data I think this is a bit

00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:03,340
it's quite straightforward we know like

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,440
this is what the information this

00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,930
component contains and you also have

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,380
structure so for web to us this is the

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:13,090
Dom and algorithm algorithm it's

00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,730
sometimes it's called met that's

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,620
sometimes called functions these are

00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:21,130
things that determine what this

00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,660
component can do so a lot of the

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,150
discussion about components usually

00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,000
bring up two concepts so first concept

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:29,740
is the single responsibility principle

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,900
which is that every single class or

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,610
every single module or in our case every

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:38,140
sink component in a program should have

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:42,070
responsibility for just a single piece

00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:43,390
of the program's functionality and the

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:47,620
second concept you should talk about is

00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:50,169
composable composable which is that the

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,020
components can be selected and assembled

00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:57,520
in various combination to satisfy the

00:06:53,020 --> 00:07:01,300
user requirement okay so for this talk I

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:05,530
will try to be as framework agnostic as

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:08,410
possible but then I like react a lot if

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:13,240
we can do everything we're I would have

00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:15,550
done everything we react so today's

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,110
point of view it's gonna come from react

00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,800
but then hopefully it can also apply to

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:24,220
different different other different

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:29,229
forum was also so for show hand over

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:31,570
here who uses react and like yeah oh my

00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:33,669
goodness thank goodness I was I was so

00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,880
afraid that everybody is gonna save you

00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:35,880
view

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:43,870
okay okay so I'm sure everybody is

00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,820
familiar with the concept of atomic

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,790
design so this is atomic design this is

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:51,460
not atomic CSS I think as an industry

00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:53,800
it's time for us to ask one of them to

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,610
change the name because it's a bit too

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,210
confusing

00:07:54,610 --> 00:08:00,460
so using in this conservative design we

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,320
we start the smallest element and they

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,250
are atoms and then we use them as

00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:08,350
building blocks to build bigger larger

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,460
building blocks and then this larger

00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,830
building blocks is then used to make

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:15,280
even larger building blocks and then in

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:20,080
our in web this is called a page usually

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:21,760
and this is a really good concept that

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,630
we can apply to start building a

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:30,070
component library so we start by sassing

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:31,930
out across the different pages and what

00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,030
kind of components that we will reuse

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:38,560
them over and over again and I really

00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:40,690
start by building them so if I worked on

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,700
a component library before usually we'll

00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:46,270
start with button we will start with

00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:48,310
select so this process is great because

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:51,310
it's gonna give you the look at a few of

00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:52,990
a site very very quickly sometimes the

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,700
thing about like look at few I think I

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,210
mean this is how your cat look like or

00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,710
this is how your animation look like but

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,020
a lot of times it's actually determined

00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:04,120
by your phone sizes your phone family

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,760
what kind of type scale you are using

00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,820
okay color palette you're using and this

00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,440
is very it's it's gonna come off very

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,140
soon once you build your first pattern

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,940
and you build your first like select

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,730
component or your style your first

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,150
select component so it's gonna mentally

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:24,190
influence how you build your component

00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:26,440
on the very lowest level and so these

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:29,590
are like the atoms the the the two the

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,690
one with they go block and then so once

00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:33,400
your beaut finish or this your thing

00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,350
okay what's the next step should be your

00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,390
cut because you know every single

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:41,770
website has a cut

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:43,750
it's it's everywhere so once I be okay I

00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:47,320
have my button I my select on my cut and

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:49,150
I realized oh am i stuck i what do I

00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,960
mean UNIX you know

00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:56,890
so I think okay Oh the very common

00:09:52,960 --> 00:10:00,040
reusable components one is Napa so no

00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:04,260
every page has a Napa but they always

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:07,120
look the same okay maybe not that usable

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,700
and then we have a footer okay yeah as

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,220
long as you don't have infinite

00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:16,810
scrolling users I could not see a food

00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:18,970
and okay so I got myself my batter I

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:22,360
might select my cut my nav bar my footer

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:26,470
and I look at the design and then I see

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:29,529
okay this this iPhone iPhone next iPhone

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,870
x7 plus pure looking thing so this is

00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:33,250
this is our search result page and then

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,170
when you go into a search result page

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,360
most of time we will try to suggest you

00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:41,740
other terms that we think you might be

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:44,550
like like do you mean you want to you

00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:47,920
want to search for iPhone 6 instead so

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:51,910
to me this looks like a very reusable

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,040
component so I look deeper into our

00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,320
Zeppelin and I realized that there are

00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,570
actually variations to this component

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:04,450
there are different colors and then this

00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:06,790
one that has a close button so the one

00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:09,310
on top what's more like an anchor

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,959
because just now you see I'm on the

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,850
iPhone page and then when i click on it

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,180
i will go to iphone 6 page so it's like

00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:18,850
a navigation but then the close one it's

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:22,480
not gonna navigate anywhere so don't

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:24,580
wise it's gonna be an anchor and then

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:29,380
the one below is probably gonna be like

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:32,980
a deep wrapping a pea tank and then have

00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:34,660
a close button as a sibling like oh okay

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:36,700
this is actually a lot more complicated

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:41,529
than what I was thinking in the first

00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:44,890
place and the suggestion here is those

00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:47,350
soft imaginary problems because as

00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,930
engineers we don't want our code to come

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,910
back and buy us so we try and design our

00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:56,170
API is to keep it as flexible as

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:58,360
possible and and then we need to pre

00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,820
Emma log and we might end up pre-empting

00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,630
for a problem that we'll never

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:09,270
happen or we leave a room for an API

00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:12,240
that will never gonna create later on so

00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:14,130
it's in our code guideline which is also

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,920
known as I'm not going to approve you up

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,710
here that you shouldn't be solving for

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:23,880
imaginary problems and I'm gonna coin

00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:27,530
the term here instead is to tackle your

00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:31,830
components outside in in this approach

00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:33,990
we instead of going from bottom upwards

00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,000
like how atomic design is we're gonna do

00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:39,990
it very similar to how we have always be

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,140
HTML which is from top to the bottom so

00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,820
top level we will have the pitch you

00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,740
start with a blank page you start

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,930
filling up the spaces you put in your

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:53,460
header you put in your left sidebar you

00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:54,780
put in your right mean body and you

00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,490
couldn't realize that this whole pitch

00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,590
component this one single component it's

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,330
gonna be really really big don't worry

00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:04,350
about it we'll get to that on how to

00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:07,080
breaking them up so first step is while

00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,790
you're building you will realize that

00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:12,150
sometimes there are things that you go

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:15,150
that actually should have been a library

00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:18,030
and this is gonna very commonly come out

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:21,780
as like pagination to keep error

00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:23,550
messages or like a localized they labor

00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,690
so this kind of thing when you are

00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,990
building your page you'll be like

00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:35,490
actually this one somebody should have

00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:37,740
done it right so this and this is when

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:41,100
you realize that okay this is where I

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,770
need to break it up into a component we

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,270
have a text component in our in our code

00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:48,620
base it's got it somewhere because

00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:51,210
you'll be like isn't that just a P tag

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:54,420
one we have encapsulated in this

00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:56,220
component functions and style

00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:58,800
they will make our life easier so for

00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,750
example what will happen if you overflow

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,080
sure you should you put like the

00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,880
ellipses the three dot should use the

00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,370
point multi-line she only support single

00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,530
line this has things that will she built

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,070
it into our text component so that once

00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:17,330
you use it you stop having to worry

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:19,070
about it so in fact we have built a lot

00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,970
of components in our component like

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:23,120
media like this

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:26,560
they sound like HTML element button

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,290
input text and girl they all sound like

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,390
HTML element but what we did was to put

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,820
a lot of functionality into it that

00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:36,530
makes your life easier every time you

00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,420
think oh it should have been solved by

00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,760
someone else it'd have been solved by

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,830
all these components and this is where I

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:48,860
recommend starting your component

00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:51,170
library so on a sidenote iterate often

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,610
because of the outside in approach you

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,130
can realize that sometimes it gonna mean

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,410
something out so for example our error

00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,780
message here we missed it out we built

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:01,640
it as part of our pitch the big pitch

00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,830
component but actually they are very

00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:08,030
they are happening quite often and they

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:11,150
should be components on their own so if

00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:12,980
you so it's okay that you missed it out

00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:15,350
the first time around because each time

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,710
rect read retro actively you try and

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:23,150
make them into components it's a very

00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:25,280
comfortable detoxing process so this is

00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:27,140
our pitch component it looks a bit short

00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,110
because they have been broken up into

00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:32,660
different render functions so now is

00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,130
because now we have so what we have now

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,110
is actually our component I read a very

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:40,370
small components that we have this big

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:43,880
pitch component what is at our next

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:46,730
guideline to start breaking it up don't

00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:50,060
make it okay I want to name this

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:53,140
technique don't make it awkward so this

00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:56,600
is content it's a little bit awkward

00:15:53,140 --> 00:16:00,980
over here we check that we should load

00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:04,190
more and then previously we did a lot

00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:07,520
more then now we should lot more and

00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:10,970
then there's a query no query don't load

00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:13,070
only then we asked for so this is

00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,660
actually just now that puce these are

00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:16,070
all that checking they returned so this

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,400
is an OCO that we have where we checked

00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:21,440
before we were loaded up you after we've

00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,660
read the refactoring we actually moved

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,190
up yourself into a component by itself

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,760
and we all

00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:33,200
we call for the API on deep mouth so

00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:35,860
this is been checked by over on the top

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:40,570
so the the parent component will choose

00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:43,910
whether do - so it's like a this or now

00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,560
so only when you have something loaded

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,560
and then inside the component you will

00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:55,100
say okay I will ask for the data myself

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:58,610
so a bit it's a bit clearer so when you

00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:02,870
want to sleep a component a good gauge

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:05,300
is fitted along your data lines because

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:08,050
the closer your data is to your

00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,610
component the easier things will be

00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:14,689
after a lot of our work is actually to

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:16,959
translate data into interface and a lot

00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:20,240
of our apps today are very data-driven

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,730
and they and data itself is very guided

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,620
by information architecture although we

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:28,040
are all friend F and then we don't trust

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:31,220
that Y and F but I believe they do their

00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,710
work also they they will split the data

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,670
properly just like how we will split our

00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:40,100
data abruptly so use it as a hint each

00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:42,020
time you realize that this is gonna be a

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,110
different model this is going to be a

00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,900
different endpoint it's a good time

00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:50,390
where you split things up so most of the

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,040
time your one pitch is not gonna be just

00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,620
one single API call it's going to be

00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,320
five use that as a chance to split it

00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,290
into five separate components and then

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:03,890
if let's say one one API returns you an

00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:07,490
array of listings use that chance to

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:13,540
realize that you can have you can split

00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:13,540
them up into a small listing component

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,620
sometimes you will realize that your

00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,600
data doesn't match how things look

00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,960
because you know sometimes the designer

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,640
and the end F don't work too well so you

00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,150
get stuck in the middle

00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,390
use a data adapter so a data adapter can

00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:35,929
happen it can be like a YouTube function

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:38,370
so you can do it after you fetch or they

00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:39,870
all right at the point where you you

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:42,570
retrieve your data up from your store

00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,970
this so they are actually functions

00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:47,070
where you will transform how information

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,500
came in from back-end to how each look

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:52,380
on the front-end try not to do it on

00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:54,179
your component itself because this

00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,429
functions is going to call we call every

00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:58,080
single vendor and you know that this

00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:01,110
this transmission just have to happen

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,650
one single time so do it right after you

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:06,029
fetch it from your API or do it right at

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:15,480
the point where you get it from your

00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:18,840
store okay so this is the definition of

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:23,460
one of our component I actually didn't

00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:28,740
count how many from there it is doing a

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:33,929
code base I'm sorry so very bleak oi

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:35,970
this is God and a protocol lips so of

00:19:33,929 --> 00:19:37,350
course I don't think any any any one of

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,480
us as engineers we want the design

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,720
things in this way but this this

00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:47,279
component has grew and grew grown grew

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:50,570
grow so big as we add more and more

00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:59,070
features and ok so let me show you how

00:19:50,570 --> 00:20:03,960
it looks like ok so this is our input

00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:06,450
text it's quite a monster so this error

00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,299
message if you take it out there's no

00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:14,640
error message and then there's a labor

00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:17,520
so you see like when you and it is also

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,799
face holding at the same time and then

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,049
there's our prefix sometimes you don't

00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,210
need prefixes so we get to get out we

00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:26,549
have different sizes to cater to

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:30,000
different use case and then sometimes

00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:33,779
you can okay this doesn't work at the

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,990
same time with area so haha and then you

00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:39,350
can be savor it then you cannot type in

00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,350
it anymore

00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,800
okay so you see actually some of the

00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,960
prompts work with each other very well

00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,800
like if you have a icon laughs and the

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,720
arrow okay

00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,400
probably the seduce kids worry a key now

00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,820
and a placeholder probably is a use case

00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,790
for it

00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,140
but sometimes the prop that's a work

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,060
with each other that you have Auto

00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:06,280
capitalized with a tight because it

00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:09,740
he'll say what's happening you so

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,870
therefore like the ad who Pro is real

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,150
isn't it because there are two props on

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,830
the same element but they will never

00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:20,240
work well with each other

00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:22,040
and but to a engineer when you come in

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,380
your lady actually there or text input

00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,260
one so I should just extend on my text

00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:30,650
input and you realize actually a lot of

00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,510
the props are optional this is how we

00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:33,410
relate to like make ourselves feel

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:35,060
better like okay

00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:39,410
the optional you know just I use it

00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:41,960
nobody else use it but then why do you

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:45,130
want to put in the same component if

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,360
they are separate split them you know

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,700
create a new component don't don't be

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,490
shy about creating new components there

00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,640
are actually ways in react that lets you

00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:59,630
do this so that you can extend on a base

00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:02,960
class and then you can have like a hello

00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:05,390
phone in input text as a auto

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,260
capitalized simple text okay sure but

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:11,690
then one thing they work across

00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:14,690
different framework is to then split

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,310
them create a new component even if it's

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:19,160
going to be duplicate code no don't be

00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:21,200
shy about having to placate code of

00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:25,190
course we always come from the framework

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,200
of clean code but in clean code at the

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:33,110
expense of like making it difficult to

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:35,870
use so the pro clips is a monster it's a

00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:38,270
Frankenstein creature because all of us

00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:39,410
we have so many web engineers all of us

00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,800
are going to add on to the code based

00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:44,840
thinking that it's gonna affect me but

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,760
someone else is gonna join the team

00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,940
they're gonna come in and I can see your

00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,230
component with 20 props and they will be

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,680
like

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:58,290
[Music]

00:22:52,680 --> 00:23:01,770
this so I gotta end of my talk with this

00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:04,710
suite that I just saw yesterday most of

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:09,620
my ideas are just not repeating previous

00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:13,440
mistakes and I think a lot of us we come

00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:15,470
and we go we listen to podcasts we come

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,140
to a conference thinking that you know

00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:20,520
there's gonna be some words of wisdom

00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:24,210
but I realized that a lot of time

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:27,360
guidelines is just one person's pain and

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,810
then they don't want to repeat that pain

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,960
anymore

00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:33,300
so every one of you will have a

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,940
guideline that you want to share so

00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:44,780
please check and make this community

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:44,780
