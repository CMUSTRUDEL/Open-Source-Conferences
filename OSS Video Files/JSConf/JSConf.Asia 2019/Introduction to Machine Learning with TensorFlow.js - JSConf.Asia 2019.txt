Title: Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow.js - JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-07-05
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Asim Hussain @jawache

Learn how to build and train Neural Networks using the most popular Machine Learning framework for JavaScript, TensorFlow.js. This is a practical workshop where you'll learn "hands-on" by building several different applications from scratch using TensorFlow.js. If you have ever been interested in Machine Learning, if you want to get a taste for what this exciting field has to offer, if you want to be able to talk to other Machine Learning/AI specialists in a language they understand, then this workshop is for you.

Requirements:
Bring a laptop. Have a recent Google Chrome, Git and NodeJS installed. You will need to run a local web server and serve the contents of a directory if you don't know how to do that Asim recommends downloading VS Code and install the live server plugin.

Asim is a developer, trainer, author and speaker with over 18 years experience working for organisations such as the European Space Agency, Google and now Microsoft, where he is leading Developer Advocacy for EMEA.

welcome few things

00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:10,309
who here was at my talk earlier on today

00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:17,070
who was at my talk earlier on today okay

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,279
who wasn't at my talk earlier on today

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,820
how about that okay yeah he wasn't okay

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:29,550
cool I will repeat for you through a few

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:33,899
things pretty fast so so kind of what

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,910
we're going to cover today is two things

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,260
really so we're going to cover two

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,230
examples we're going to work through

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,879
with ten so jess what I'm going to use

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,180
that mobile net model which I kind of

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,230
talked to talked about today in in the

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,370
talk and the other one we're going to do

00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:53,780
regression so an example something

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,780
called linear and polynomial regression

00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:58,500
and I thought I think we've only got

00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,070
time for today because if we've only got

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,629
three hours we've only got a little bit

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,580
of time today there's normally if you

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,950
want to do the full one oh this is like

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,549
an eight hour plus workshops ain't got

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,920
time for two and what I'm going to do is

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,750
I'm gonna have if I can have you all

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,560
join how would actually check these

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,890
links I just created them do they work

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,890
they don't work

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:31,180
that's all an elaborate hoax to get you

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,100
to buy more Microsoft if I don't know

00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,909
why is I not working so I made it a

00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:42,580
slack a slack so you could is that Rena

00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:45,000
working damn how is that not working let

00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,000
me go here

00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:48,310
Wow

00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:59,750
do I have to click something what I call

00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,960
it t FJ s T oh I know why let me check

00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,960
that

00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:16,940
boom so I hope it would someone try it

00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:18,290
out it should be TF j s WS / slack and

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,239
that's what I'm going to post kind of

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,050
bits of code and links and things I've

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:27,470
had to make it easier for you as you go

00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,819
through there should be a room called J

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,520
s Kampf Asia

00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:35,930
- TF j s check out there's actually the

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:38,870
my especially my the the slack for our

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:40,220
meetup group in in London so I recommend

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,720
after the workshop unless you're from

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,330
London leave this like because we

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:51,920
channel announce stuff all the time

00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:55,850
new new would you call them meetups yep

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,819
yeah so I arrived last night and I I

00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:59,510
didn't mind she have to sleep all night

00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:03,170
so I'm not too sure what's going to

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:07,670
happen today we'll see I mean the other

00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:10,660
thing Oh same here should be tfj s WS /

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,980
mobile net so basically don't clone that

00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:17,840
visit that URL and I'll take it to the

00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:20,810
github and clone that github - to begin

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,660
with I'll give you I'll give you a few

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,609
minutes for that yeah yeah as people -

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,660
just log on to the slack I have not

00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,880
checked the link at all

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,660
has anyone successfully logged in to

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:37,329
slack yeah okay excellent I can't check

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:37,329
it because uh I'm on the thingy and

00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:47,260
go try a new second screen see see if

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,260
that works

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,510
I swear

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,280
oops

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,699
start to whistle it's probably not a

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,699
good sign

00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:50,410
so I get up yeah it should be tfj s WS

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,410
yeah w yes

00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:01,520
ah sorry one second

00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,830
where's my mouse on mouse as well

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:23,610
and one of the things duets just let me

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,610
just two seconds while I set this up

00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:27,699
yes

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:44,910
yes oh my god it worked the first time

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:44,910
ever it actually worked first time yes

00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:03,250
yes yes yes oh my god this is so

00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,250
exciting hungry this is working

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,930
[Music]

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,850
you just arrived could quickly take us a

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,720
snapshot of that screen because it's

00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,720
going to go in a second

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:46,130
I'm okay actually yeah I got also it

00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,100
actually I should why am I facing this

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:58,250
way it's the wrong way to face on the

00:06:49,100 --> 00:07:01,100
face the other way yeah sorry the sec

00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,150
I'll just fix it I keep on saying yeah

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,720
I'll just fix it hang on

00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,720
oops

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:15,180
the second one is WS both of my WS yeah

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:26,550
both from a WS tfj SWS yeah mom's day

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:28,720
it's gonna be situate myself there we go

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,880
things are gonna get a little bit iffy

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,470
I'll come out this way this is the way

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:40,660
I'm going to come out sorry

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:50,260
yeah facing out probably the best way so

00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:54,669
I'll turn it round oh man this is just

00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:57,870
spectacular I'm doing here isn't it I'm

00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:57,870
gonna unplug and plug in it

00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:13,219
all right

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,550
what's behind me that thing

00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,550
okay now you have to wait again

00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:27,500
oh that man

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,520
was I going

00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:38,460
yes okay

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,090
where was I

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:53,450
all right here we go I'm just gonna go

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:55,580
it's gonna go alright so hopefully

00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,020
buddy's got that if you weren't a my

00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,640
talk this morning

00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,380
I'm trying to very very quickly go

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,580
through some of the things I went

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,280
through again this one if you're at Mike

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,950
if you were my talk this morning

00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:08,630
considerate revision so I run a co one a

00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:10,640
meetup group coffee I drove one then

00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,050
this is where you can find out

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,990
information about me especially my

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:17,570
Twitter you can follow me on Twitter do

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:22,130
you want to do that follow me oh come on

00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:27,440
take a pictures let's do a picture after

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:30,830
layer the agenda today so this is all

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,420
what we're going to cover is a really

00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:36,020
brief over you've neural networks and

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:38,500
ten so jess if you're a my talk this

00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:41,690
morning then that's gonna be old news

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,040
I'm going to go through mobile net the

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,480
thing I gained I showed you this morning

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,280
going to very quickly go over actually

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,880
to start dipping your toe into some some

00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:51,830
of this stuff and then I'm I'm really

00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:58,370
sorry about this there's just no way

00:09:51,830 --> 00:10:01,460
around it this is like this is the

00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,930
gentlest I can do it does the gentlest I

00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:07,010
can do it but it's going to be a steep

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:11,510
ramp up from mobile net to regression

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:15,830
but this is the simplest use case that

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:18,350
there is so I apologize not don't

00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:19,580
apologize you need this is just your

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:23,780
life if you want to do machine learning

00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:25,130
right just your life we're never gonna

00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:27,830
go through can what's called regression

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:30,020
linear regression and poornam polynomial

00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:31,130
regression hopefully quite a lot of this

00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:33,200
you're gonna be sitting there on your

00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:38,060
computers tapping away working trying to

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,910
fight yourself I'm I'm here if you've

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:43,420
got any questions I try and help out as

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,420
much as I can

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:49,420
turn to the person next to you do you

00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:53,690
write to twist your right to your right

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:57,670
see hi welcome that doesn't make any

00:10:53,690 --> 00:11:00,740
sense does it doesn't work at all

00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,680
say hello and introduce yourself to the

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:08,800
person to your left and to your right

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:12,860
all right okay say hi and assume I

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:15,970
Christine that's me yeah yeah

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,970
[Music]

00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,079
good help each other out there's a lot

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,790
of people in this room and it's going to

00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:35,399
be very difficult for me to kind of

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:38,009
cover up and ask and answer questions

00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,720
from everybody if you solve something

00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:42,720
the person next to you is struggling you

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,369
know help them out helped type on slack

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,929
you know if you see it sees somebody

00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:48,949
asking questions you know type loss that

00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:48,949
help each other out as much as possible

00:11:50,209 --> 00:12:01,709
because it's nice to do that yep

00:11:56,429 --> 00:12:03,689
so introduction so what we're gonna be

00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:05,220
doing there's a very different different

00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:07,859
types of machine learning we're gonna be

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,419
doing well

00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:11,519
yeah supervised machine learning today's

00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:12,959
but some essential what you do is you

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,759
get some training data in this type of

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,189
model you get some training date and I

00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:23,429
usually is something that a human being

00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:24,480
has labeled in some way as in a human

00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:26,009
being has looked to that and said I

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,069
think this is this or I think this is

00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:33,379
this okay and so training data and you

00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:35,489
kind of define that out algorithm and

00:12:33,379 --> 00:12:38,459
then you train it and that what the

00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:41,429
water generates is a model there's lots

00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:42,749
of different types of classifiers many

00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:44,939
many different types of them what we're

00:12:42,749 --> 00:12:51,749
going to do today is using a neural

00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:55,139
network method and the outputs are model

00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:57,749
right and let's say this is a model

00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:59,850
which you trained it up using sentiment

00:12:57,749 --> 00:13:02,069
analysis with some words so new a

00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,199
sentence is a positive sentence or a

00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:05,789
negative sentence and then when you give

00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:08,339
it something it's never seen before like

00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:10,049
I love Assam it can say that's positive

00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,939
so that's kind of what what this stuff

00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:14,249
is really good for is you train up on

00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:17,369
one set of data then you can give us

00:13:14,249 --> 00:13:19,649
something it's never seen before and it

00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:21,779
can come to a conclusion as to what that

00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:23,129
is that's kind of opposite to what we'd

00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,869
normally do if we're programming you

00:13:23,129 --> 00:13:26,459
have to kind of always think of every

00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:28,439
single edge case and it'll only ever

00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:30,509
give you an answer based off of what

00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:33,449
your program that's kind of the

00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:34,890
underlying fundamental power of machine

00:13:33,449 --> 00:13:36,600
learning is okay can can

00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,400
infer and give you answers to stuff that

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,940
you've never even it's never even seen

00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,100
before

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:46,520
so we're using tensor flow it is

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,920
currently I still think the most popular

00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:53,970
open source package for machine learning

00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:55,770
this is an old slide but at the time the

00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,050
next big biggest thing was like it alone

00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,820
just thirty thousand but since those 100

00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:02,790
thousand it's probably been surpassed

00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:06,600
that a lot as I said this morning we use

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:09,540
intensive ajs test by Jess comes with

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:13,260
two different api's inside the two

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:16,140
different kind of yeah api's I usually

00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,320
use something call the core API which if

00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,630
you using tensorflow

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,810
like Python and other versions of it

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:29,010
that's what you see is a core API it's

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:30,510
very low level you if you looked at

00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:33,270
something like that you'd have to really

00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:35,160
squint to see the neural network it's

00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,570
kind of like looking at a program and

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,540
trying to figure out exactly or it then

00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:41,310
it's like that the building parts of a

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,790
program so if you're really just doing

00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:46,530
neural networks all the time there's

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,690
also abstractions that you can use and

00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:51,000
for that there's there's something

00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,520
called carers if you doing in Python you

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,140
use chaos which gives you a high level

00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,900
of perspective all you're doing is in

00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:00,720
your network but what 10 to 5 J and that

00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:03,630
that in normally that's a separate sort

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:06,330
of package but intensified J's have

00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:08,720
combined it so that you two API isn't

00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:13,650
one the core API and the layers API

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,870
however today you're not looking at the

00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:18,060
layers API because we don't have time

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:21,800
for that you're going only for the core

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,800
API brisk up tonight right

00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,730
what I'm going to show you in the core

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,560
API is going to be like this mean lines

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,180
of code and if you use a layers API it

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,490
would be like two lines of code or

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,930
something but I think it's good to

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,339
understand how things work underneath

00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:41,050
because otherwise you don't know you're

00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:41,790
just using some line of code your

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,139
networks

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,850
pretty boring the rest of you because

00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:50,740
this is exactly the same slides as it

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:53,079
today anyway bases on a base based on

00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,480
biology so it's a neuron you have

00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:58,480
dendrites going in a body and axons

00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,360
going out if enough electricity flows in

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,339
the dendrites the body goes and push you

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,839
so much just via the axons that's what

00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:06,480
we do here but we're doing exactly the

00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,940
same thing just in code you have a node

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,459
the electricity going in is your data

00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,070
one sample of your data that you're

00:16:12,459 --> 00:16:16,180
pushing in so whatever that is I'm going

00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,910
to go through it but whatever that is

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,680
then you have these edges and for each

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:23,230
of those dendrites going in you have to

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,300
know how important that piece of input

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:27,850
is to the to the end result that we have

00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,730
something called a weight initially it's

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,990
just randomized to random number

00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:37,750
you just push them through an activation

00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:40,000
function and you output one whatever the

00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:42,279
output activation function outputs you

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,810
then type that into the next one's the

00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:48,579
next one to the next one there's loads

00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:50,800
of different activation functions which

00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:52,389
this is one of them very simple anything

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,880
below zero is zero anything above zero

00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:56,709
is one as I'm speaking to you I realize

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,050
that throughout what you're going to

00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:01,660
cover today we're not going to touch on

00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:03,339
an activation function but it's good to

00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,540
know because we're not going to use

00:17:03,339 --> 00:17:06,520
because normally when we using the

00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,970
layers API we start touching on the

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,350
activation function and stuff like that

00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,169
right now it's good to know so this is

00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:15,880
one of them

00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:18,939
it's good because it's really easy to

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,380
calculate and I mean through the machine

00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:23,040
learning you want stuff that's easy to

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:26,559
calculate so it doesn't require too much

00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,590
processing power and compute but it's

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:32,530
really bad because

00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:35,080
changes in tiny changes the input is a

00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,840
huge change in the output so there's

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,250
other ones that people use this is a

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:44,500
hyperbolic tanh it kind of gives you a

00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:45,790
little bit more no non-linearity um but

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,170
this is a very common one people use

00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,510
call rail you and if you actually

00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:51,220
covered off more the recipe I can point

00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,840
you out to the there's there's two

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,620
further examples you can do if you go

00:17:52,840 --> 00:18:00,100
home when you go home if you go when you

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,780
go home and they'll they'll show you

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,960
example no double using value but this

00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,490
is it's a good one okay it's kind of

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,929
it's a nice compromise because it kind

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,140
of easy to calculate and does give you

00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:13,300
some non-linearity so it's kind of nice

00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,920
you kind of pump it all together you get

00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,360
a geek rate loads of those you join them

00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,750
together you're not going to do that

00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:23,080
today you complicate it you're gonna do

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,910
one neuron and you'd be like God

00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,400
wouldn't you want so hard you doing one

00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,540
neuron today but if you did be wanted

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,740
you can connect a whole bunch of them

00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:35,290
together like this and if if here's the

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:37,840
core API you would literally be creating

00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:40,600
a neuron and urine and urine in your

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,210
between the layers API you just say a

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,580
layer with three a layer with two a

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:50,230
layer 3 and it kind of figures the rest

00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:51,460
out for you but that's what you're

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,260
basically doing then you feed it some

00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,970
input data whatever that is what are you

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,420
trying to Train on depends on what that

00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:00,910
is it just multiplies everything out and

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,380
gives you a number so I can't remember

00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:06,090
what what did I say this is this is my

00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,090
example with the faces today

00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:15,729
but what I say this when I've got the

00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:17,200
the faces in this in this slide I don't

00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:20,469
know but anyway this was supposed to be

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,979
an example of facial features you pump

00:19:20,469 --> 00:19:23,349
it in

00:19:20,979 --> 00:19:24,820
it gives that a number let's say we know

00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:27,039
this input data or should be have been

00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:30,190
eight instead of instead of three we

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,059
know it's wrong by five of course it's

00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:32,950
gonna be wrong because we would have

00:19:31,059 --> 00:19:34,749
initialized around the things randomly

00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,839
and then what you do is you do this

00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:39,820
thing called back propagation or tuning

00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:43,269
or it's actually optimization right

00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:45,579
you're trying to change these numbers so

00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:48,239
the next time you pass this thing all

00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:52,119
this data through it's gonna give you a

00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:53,799
eight and that's what the training which

00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:55,269
what training a neural network was

00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:59,279
training this stuff that's what we're

00:19:55,269 --> 00:20:04,359
doing we're just tuning these numbers

00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:06,609
using a loop and tend to flow so that

00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:09,489
the next time it goes through it's just

00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:12,369
going to give us a name I'm gonna tune

00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:16,619
those numbers to some value right that's

00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:18,879
kind of tensorflow J s then stencil flow

00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:29,519
that's kind of really high-level

00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:29,519
overview of a neural network and yeah

00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:37,520
that's right so what's go through but

00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,800
what we're gonna do for the very very

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,420
first example so what so once you once

00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,930
you trained up one of those networks you

00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:47,110
can actually save them I'll show you

00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:47,110
ah

00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,520
wait what can you see right now no

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,410
nothing you

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,730
I want to mirror this screen that's what

00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:02,450
I want to do sound dude that's what I

00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:06,600
want to do yeah

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:08,020
yes this is what I wanna do okay so if

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,529
you go to

00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,529
[Music]

00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:19,390
you go it's just business if you go here

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:23,410
there's tens of flojet tensorflow

00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:26,770
org oh it's changed since vote.org / j r

00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:32,200
/ models this is where you can find a

00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:34,929
whole bunch of the kind of pre free made

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:38,830
models that are available that is

00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:40,900
growing it's growing so the one we're

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:42,190
gonna use is mobile map we see you can

00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:45,429
see there's a bunch of others toxicity

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:50,940
is a new one so toxicity and if you've

00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:54,970
got demo of it well done

00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:57,669
then what toxicity does is it it doesn't

00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,909
just tell you if a piece of text is bad

00:21:57,669 --> 00:22:03,490
or good it tells you if it's offensive

00:22:00,909 --> 00:22:06,070
and and in what way is it offensive so

00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:09,100
it tells you where dude on confuse

00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:11,380
you are quite astonishingly stupid it's

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,770
not an identity attack it is an insult

00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,510
it's nob scene so you can see you can

00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:18,100
have life stuff is happen and identity

00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,220
attack on to what somebody it's kind of

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,480
an interesting an interesting use case

00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,500
this one does this I think this is the

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,390
latest one they've got it's growing

00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,650
you can try finding some yourself these

00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:33,429
are the ones that kind of very well

00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:34,659
nicely packaged and it's just a really

00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:37,120
great way if you just want to get

00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:38,830
started another put your jobs with

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,659
developers here so we kind of just like

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:43,890
MPM installing stuff and then just

00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:46,210
getting on with it just a good way of

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:49,210
playing around with it another really

00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,919
fun one the two really fun ones here

00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:54,309
actually posing that is a very fun one I

00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:57,780
wonder if I can start the demo myself

00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:57,780
try the demo here here we go

00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:04,510
but you know what I'm gonna be rude when

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,510
I want to get somebody to like volunteer

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:14,030
there we go I need a volunteer probably

00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:17,360
probably used to go and stand up yeah go

00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:21,530
and stand up so you can see and move

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:25,550
about that's pretty cool right

00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:27,700
yeah yeah courageous I've just haven't

00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:32,000
at the time I wanted to make like a

00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:33,440
flossing game see if you can count do

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,020
the flossing because you can actually

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,190
multiple people so I often thought you

00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:40,100
could have two people I'm making a

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:44,180
flossing game make it one of you make it

00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:48,310
right and another really fun one but

00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:51,320
I've only really started to play with is

00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:56,660
speech so you can actually can actually

00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:58,940
recognize speech online demo done I've

00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,790
got an online demo it does have an

00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,620
online demo car number is essentially

00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,710
they've got a model here which is which

00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:09,140
which has been trained up to recognize

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:11,030
the numbers 0 to 9 up down

00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:14,330
stop yes no and it can just recognize

00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:19,270
those words just using the browser on

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:19,270
the Web Audio API so that's pretty cool

00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:27,040
so it's at the bottom ah there you go

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,840
I was gonna download isn't it anyway

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:46,050
that's how it works with we're going to

00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:50,520
use the artists who yeah down eight yes

00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:52,800
oh yeah

00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,420
yeah that's pretty cool but we're gonna

00:24:52,800 --> 00:25:00,570
using the mobile on that one today to

00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:03,500
play around with so there's my slides

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,500
from another on there

00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:11,179
I think this is it actually no no that's

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:17,369
not gonna work

00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:19,590
yeah yeah that's how it so hopefully

00:25:17,369 --> 00:25:25,950
should all get cloned this thing by now

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:29,549
want your computers so we'll learn how

00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:32,070
to load and use a pre train model and oh

00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:33,989
where to find preacher moles gone the

00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:41,029
wrong way around it's okay it's not the

00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:43,109
end of the world and yeah so basically

00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:44,999
underneath all a lot of this stuff is

00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:46,859
going to be tf2 load model which is

00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:49,129
going to load those models underneath

00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:49,129
and

00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:55,860
[Music]

00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:57,210
yeah and this is mobile map let me use

00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,340
it in this way we're gonna use it in a

00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,510
slightly different way but because I'm

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,030
not gonna use import statements we're

00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:08,910
gonna do via script tags as all websites

00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:10,560
should be made script tags all right

00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:13,820
give me two seconds while I get set up

00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:18,440
because I need to get my head straight

00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:18,440
so let me get my this is not it

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:30,909
oh yeah how about that excellent

00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,730
Oh

00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:53,760
Oh

00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:53,760
oh why why do I have C++ extensions

00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:11,490
so I think I'm gonna revert this okay

00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:19,090
if you want and it's gonna be pretty

00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:21,279
simple for a lot of a lot of you but

00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:24,989
trust me you're gonna remember this

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:27,340
moment later on and you've got me like I

00:27:24,989 --> 00:27:29,739
wish we were doing mobile mobile on that

00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,369
again because it's going to get it's

00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:34,659
gonna get steep gets deep pretty fast

00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:38,070
dipping your toes in so you should see

00:27:34,659 --> 00:27:38,070
can you see this now probably not

00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:51,789
[Music]

00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:54,299
oh dang it's not supposed to do this

00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:56,950
so what this is what I'm going to do I

00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:58,629
want to load up the completed one so if

00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:00,909
it that in the folders you see main main

00:27:58,629 --> 00:28:02,769
dock completed in main dock Jas maybe

00:28:00,909 --> 00:28:05,049
some of you've already cheated you've

00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:07,059
looked at the dock completed code yeah

00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:09,460
well this is basically what you'll end

00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:23,220
up doing or should and should end up

00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:23,220
looking like oh wow that's awesome

00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,690
that's brilliant

00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,690
how's that

00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:37,550
this is good can someone take a video of

00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,550
this

00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:54,429
cool um let me just refresh that because

00:28:51,400 --> 00:29:01,840
that the canvas been all wrong there and

00:28:54,429 --> 00:29:03,610
then why is that not so yeah I think

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,570
because I'm screen showing the canvas is

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,900
a bit wrong anyway

00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:10,179
so um this is gonna not not gonna work

00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,590
because my screens it's just not doing

00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:16,450
that anyway whatever so the bottom of

00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:21,070
the screen it's detecting what's in the

00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:26,770
image this is crazy what if like ah

00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:31,020
barbershop monitor no it's not just kind

00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:31,020
of phone maybe phone great

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,669
modem I don't think because it confused

00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:41,049
because things behind it iPod iPod at

00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:43,330
the bottom iPod close enough close

00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:44,650
enough so that's why it basically what

00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:48,820
it's what it's doing this was I was been

00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:51,760
wearing earlier on today and it's how

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:57,820
we're gonna what we're all going to

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:58,900
build today so all that we've done here

00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,990
is to is two things

00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:04,480
oops this is hmm there's an old version

00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:09,840
- I haven't baited it I'm not gonna bait

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,840
it don't date it keep it as it is so

00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:13,000
what I'm doing is I'm loading up tents

00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,390
Flo Jess

00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,390
at the top is 11.0 now I haven't updated

00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:21,850
in a while so but it's the same for this

00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,049
demo it'll be exactly the same and the

00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,419
other thing I'm doing is loading up

00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:27,490
mobile net at the top there as well so

00:30:25,419 --> 00:30:32,559
you could if you're doing this properly

00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:34,299
so derisive on I properly do like import

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,280
statements in a bundle or something like

00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:38,260
that but I'm just genius script tag and

00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:41,620
I've got my career's going main dot

00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,330
jeaious test for jess is its thing let's

00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:50,169
go take a look at what mobile net looks

00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:52,630
like haha on the internet and our notes

00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:57,390
here how'd you open you didn't know did

00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:57,390
I open it no didn't yeah yeah

00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:02,950
so all that mobile and that is when

00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,320
you're when you're downloading is it's

00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:10,320
just it's just if I go into source here

00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,320
index

00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:18,269
all the mobile that's doing is if you

00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,269
look really closely at the source code

00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:22,110
whereas it going

00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:27,919
I have to be doing it different we're

00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:29,659
doing it ah okay there's another way of

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,580
bloating agent use blood graph model

00:31:29,659 --> 00:31:36,729
it's all this doing underneath this is

00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:39,830
just a nice wrapper around tensorflow

00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:41,929
just to help you it's football mobile

00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:45,080
man but all it's doing underneath is

00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:47,809
using load graph model and passing in a

00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,960
JSON file which is kind of depending on

00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:52,369
the version number it's whatever this is

00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,840
Jason or something along those lines but

00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:56,330
when done loading in this mobile and

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,899
that thing all it's doing is just doing

00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:01,519
some nice bits of code so you don't have

00:31:59,899 --> 00:32:04,940
to do all this stuff yourself but it's

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,159
just loading up a JSON file with TF the

00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:09,469
load graph model and the other kind of

00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:12,099
really interesting file and also what

00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:16,969
it's doing is when you ask classify

00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:18,349
classify that's the code that you're

00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:21,049
going to use you're gonna pass it

00:32:18,349 --> 00:32:24,080
something usually like an image we can

00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:28,159
pass a canvas a video image date or just

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:32,299
like some raw numbers and then what it

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:34,820
does is calls infer right when you load

00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:36,469
up a model you you give it some once you

00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,789
train that you call infer you give it

00:32:36,469 --> 00:32:39,589
some new data and it gives you the

00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:42,229
response back but all it's just giving

00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:43,639
you what we're all numbers like really

00:32:42,229 --> 00:32:45,589
really raw numbers it's not really

00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:47,179
giving you something you but you need to

00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,889
understand what what's actually going on

00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:51,229
and so it just has some nice helper

00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:52,489
classes helper functions to kind of turn

00:32:51,229 --> 00:32:56,149
those raw numbers into something

00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:58,099
meaningful ie a string that describes in

00:32:56,149 --> 00:33:00,999
the image and so it's caused the thing

00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:00,999
called top K classes

00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:09,220
which which which basically loads up

00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:14,260
this file and this is the interesting

00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:15,280
file here imagenet class is because the

00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,810
end of they were all the models are

00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,430
changes a number what does that number

00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:20,530
mean well this is going to tell you what

00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,630
that number means so this is these are

00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:25,260
all the thousand things that mobile net

00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:30,790
can understand is it toilet tissue

00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:35,430
toilet paper a bullet we all know what

00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:37,840
ball that is I've got several bullets

00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:44,980
agaric I don't know what this is this a

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:48,430
gyro mitra stink horn anyway scuba diver

00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,960
wow that's all that mobile net can read

00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:52,660
detect and these are the things that

00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,850
mobile net knows how to detect right

00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,790
which is why it's not so good but it's

00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:59,500
small enough so it can actually be

00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:03,370
usable on a mobile all right so that's

00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:05,550
basically what's doing let me just get

00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,550
up

00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:12,679
visually occurred inside us

00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:31,819
in fact what they ever need to do that

00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,819
here and just do this

00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:42,300
no closure yeah I'm just gonna do this

00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,300
way

00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,260
okay

00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,459
[Music]

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,520
yes

00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:19,100
all right so oh okay the icons changed

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,370
cool

00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:30,120
yeah does that happen a while ago

00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:33,360
there's a few days ago man I've been on

00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:37,680
a plane forever don't know this stuff

00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:39,630
anymore alright so you should see you

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,300
should see something like this and your

00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:43,530
main the main file first thing you

00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,930
should do is like obviously there's

00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:48,060
hints there to do one what do we need to

00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:50,640
do we need to load the mobile on there

00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:57,480
to start the camera so all you need to

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:59,610
do is do is load the model yeah mobile

00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,280
net is already in your namespace put you

00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,810
loaded up with a script tag we didn't do

00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,640
anything

00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:10,580
wow it's gonna be very difficult for you

00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,580
isn't it Oh No

00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:20,980
maybe we can turn that screen that way

00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:23,650
and you can you all see this screen from

00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:32,340
that side yeah so we can send that one

00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:32,340
for the piece behind try it go on

00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,499
[Music]

00:36:54,540 --> 00:37:01,790
Oh opportunity for myself that picture

00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:01,790
picture

00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:11,619
okay that's the wrong way around

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:27,610
every way yeah on this side this is it

00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:29,020
wait wait hang on yeah yeah cool awesome

00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:31,620
Oh got some professional ones as well

00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:51,010
don't worry I got it

00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:52,570
cool ok you get you'll get excellent and

00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,730
what that's doing underneath as I showed

00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:56,940
you before this is just going and it's

00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:59,530
caught that that mobile net is just

00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,630
getting the finding the right Jason for

00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:03,400
whatever version number we're running I

00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:05,560
mean it's just calling the load graph

00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,840
model underneath it's literally going to

00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,640
go across the network and just download

00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,830
quite a lot it's actually quite a large

00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,880
model still a Congress eyes of it is but

00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:17,710
it's there's multi megabytes downloading

00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,010
onto computer right even mobile net it's

00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:24,790
quite large right you wouldn't just like

00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:26,530
have it on your homepage for your for

00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:32,700
you don't do that because it's pretty

00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:32,700
big then

00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:46,770
okay then they pretty simple we need to

00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:50,829
pass the canvas so where am I

00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:56,950
I'm lost classify image

00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:56,950
classify me okay so then

00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:08,250
oh I can't explain what the codes doing

00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:09,990
I'm sorry so it's just doing kind of

00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:13,230
basically pretty simple pretty simple

00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:17,880
stuff it's getting it's using the kind

00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:21,200
of getusermedia API which is going to

00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:26,099
get a stream from the camera okay and

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:28,770
then what we do every second I call take

00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:31,319
snapshot so every have a sent or let me

00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:33,119
second on the call take snapshot are all

00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:34,740
about doing all that that's doing is

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,119
from the video stream it's grabbing one

00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:43,619
frame and that's a drawing

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:47,609
it's that drawing that frame interest in

00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:49,140
it into a context yeah and then it's

00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:50,730
called let me call in classify image

00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,839
right so then we have the image than

00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:54,510
what we asked you now we want to know

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,589
every second we want to after we've

00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:59,760
loaded the model in term we want to know

00:39:55,589 --> 00:40:04,369
what's inside it so it's pretty simple

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,369
really just do predictions

00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:19,880
okay predictions they gotta wait model

00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:22,040
dot classify that's it that's it right

00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:24,470
I know you're all going to stay simple

00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:28,310
assume it's real easy

00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:29,060
yes is easy I'm gonna remember this

00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:31,040
moment

00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:32,240
you're gonna dream about this moment you

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,210
know wish this man was going to come

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:42,590
back to you all right this is it all

00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:46,370
right and I can't spell predict yeah

00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:47,300
okay I don't even know why but to do the

00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:49,070
next one you can do what you want

00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,860
basically that that just returns for you

00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:54,470
like if you if you want to print that I

00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:56,810
could print it on the console and see

00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:59,360
what actually returns I think it returns

00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:00,800
an array yes it returns an array and

00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,200
then I'm just going to print that

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:08,750
somewhere on the on the page so if you

00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:10,070
if you're like a proper developer and

00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:14,150
not proper that's horrible thing to say

00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:15,800
you're if you use one of the web

00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:18,290
frameworks in the world you probably

00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,710
there's a better way of doing this but

00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:23,260
if you're a vanilla person like me

00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:25,430
there's that works I'm of another person

00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,920
I'll paste this in there just just just

00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:31,540
just for the sake of saving everybody a

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:36,560
headache and want to paste this into the

00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:39,940
slack Channel yeah just so you can cut

00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,940
you can just copy and paste that there

00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:45,680
guess what that's it

00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:53,510
done you've loaded a model and you've

00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:57,520
used it so now if I I'm still my stall

00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:57,520
looking at main but yes I am there

00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:05,520
OOP whoa look at now you can't see if I

00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,520
look at this way

00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:10,750
laughs okay back in the pirate party

00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:14,140
parrot

00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:16,860
if you're asking power hang on my scream

00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:19,170
I can't hang on why don't I just record

00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:22,320
the desktop

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:26,390
there we go

00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,390
this is just ignore me for a second

00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,780
okay

00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:42,849
very good

00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:45,130
from awesome and that's it so you should

00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:48,729
all be seeing this working well that's

00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:53,979
no I forgot that that isn't the point

00:42:48,729 --> 00:42:59,279
the point is this so hopefully on your

00:42:53,979 --> 00:42:59,279
computer people - get working yeah

00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:04,299
powerful interesting it is crazy

00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:09,450
it's absolutely crazy that we can do

00:43:04,299 --> 00:43:13,329
this so we live in this world full of

00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:15,249
surprises and technological miracles on

00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:18,819
a daily basis but just let's take a

00:43:15,249 --> 00:43:22,420
second just appreciate what's happening

00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:24,809
right now in a browser is detecting what

00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,809
it's seeing

00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:32,080
epic

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,210
it's the only word that you could use to

00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,420
describe knives maybe with some other

00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:36,420
words

00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:48,670
that's it I'll give you a moment whoa

00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:59,420
design prison let's come up with some

00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,690
weird ones

00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:11,110
oh it just said it just said I was a

00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:11,110
microphone because my bed yeah

00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:31,110
and again I'm going to leave it give you

00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:32,040
a few seconds while I plug in and was an

00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:40,070
hour already

00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:40,070
no you serious no it was 45 minutes

00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:50,630
huh toilet seat I didn't say it was any

00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:52,790
good right just that it does stuff all

00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:55,790
right little bit can it can it sector

00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:58,030
this thing what's this thing say bathing

00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:58,030
cap

00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:06,980
hairspray war ball if the background I

00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,690
think is that is that you want you want

00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:10,550
a good a good clean background as well

00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:16,400
that's probably a Zeiss guys causes a

00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:19,670
problem yes I think I hinted to it

00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:26,690
earlier on today like mobile net has its

00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:32,150
usefulness I use a lot but for teaching

00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:33,470
and training practical usefulness it's

00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:35,570
iffy cuz it's no it's really not that

00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:37,340
accurate like if you really were looking

00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:40,430
for one of those things and that image

00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:44,840
net if you're looking for whatever it

00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:47,770
was called a scuba diver alright one of

00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,880
them then maybe it's useful for you

00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:52,610
oftentimes it's not you maybe want to

00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,900
use an API one thing is useful for is

00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:55,190
something called chance for learning and

00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:56,860
we'll leave it for a second so they're

00:45:55,190 --> 00:46:01,040
all having fun and be something fun

00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:02,150
whatever have fun I can see it I mean if

00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:05,350
you want to take pictures of what are

00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:07,310
you doing and tweet it and tag jaw ache

00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:09,680
you know that would be nice

00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:12,680
and if you want to run to take a

00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:17,410
screenshots knowing after I mean you can

00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:17,410
I mean that every pleasant if you did

00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:26,049
Brida happy yeah have to buy sensual

00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,460
we're doing next somebody nice when

00:46:35,869 --> 00:46:40,040
we're doing it I said give me a second

00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:42,430
you have fun there let's get set up on

00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,430
this side

00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,530
Oh

00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:40,360
what did i do what did i do what did i

00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,360
do what did I do

00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:46,790
second figure out what I did

00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:32,190
look space

00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:50,519
so give me a second I'm just trying to

00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:50,519
figure out where my code is

00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:00,960
joy development workspace

00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:08,330
joy development workspace choice

00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:11,860
development work experience

00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:11,860
Tietjens work

00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:20,750
aggression

00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,990
yes excellent all right and

00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:40,189
all right so

00:49:42,289 --> 00:49:45,380
go on

00:49:53,680 --> 00:50:03,230
yeah yeah so my bond that is so if you

00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:04,880
are on a clean white background it'd be

00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:07,070
a little bit more accurate but not

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:14,540
massively you're still fine it's not

00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:16,610
gonna so it's good for in terms of

00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:19,220
practical use cases that you'll use

00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:21,500
today with mobile net in like your real

00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,850
world No right it's not it's not it's

00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,950
not good enough for a lot of that stuff

00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:27,590
it is good enough for certain things but

00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:30,020
it really depends on your use case well

00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:32,470
I think the real power of something like

00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:34,790
mobile net and I think one of the just

00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:39,380
talking broadly really about JavaScript

00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:44,300
a machine learning you're not really

00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:46,490
going to be training up incredibly

00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,930
complex things in javascript in the

00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:50,540
browser you're just not

00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:52,550
it's like single threaded Java scripts

00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,350
not like the best language doing compute

00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:57,040
do a lot of these machine learning

00:50:54,350 --> 00:51:00,380
models you need hundreds of servers

00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:03,020
running at it for 4 weeks you know but

00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:05,000
what it is really good at is Walton but

00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:06,800
what is the possibility of a very

00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,410
interesting use case is something called

00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,480
transfer learning right for transfer

00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:14,990
learning you take an existing model an

00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:17,360
existing brain and then this brain

00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:20,780
mobile has been has been trained to

00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:22,730
recognize one of a thousand things but

00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:28,700
during that journey of training it

00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:31,370
remember layers each layer in each node

00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:33,200
actually if you there's ways of

00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:34,750
interrogating a model and seeing well

00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,490
what does that node what does it really

00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:39,800
understand what is it seeing as part of

00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:41,300
the image I'm afraid on this I'll have

00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,790
to get the slides up later on I find

00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,500
them but they they've when they when

00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:47,110
they examine these networks they can see

00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:51,170
that actually this node at the start

00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:53,960
it's detecting this all it can detect in

00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:56,099
an image is this a curve like that or

00:51:53,960 --> 00:52:01,319
another no

00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:02,069
it learns how to detect a corner and in

00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:04,920
the next layer

00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:07,140
maybe they determine one one node has

00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:10,319
figured out how to see if something's in

00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:12,150
ear right and then that very at the end

00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:14,209
then you decide oh this is a face right

00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:16,499
or cat or dog or something like that

00:52:14,209 --> 00:52:19,769
what you can do is you can kind of

00:52:16,499 --> 00:52:21,089
lobotomize the last layer and you

00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:22,499
retrain it to learn something else

00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:23,969
because if you've got if you've got a

00:52:22,499 --> 00:52:26,249
model that already knows how to detect

00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:29,039
edges corners

00:52:26,249 --> 00:52:31,769
maybe colors if it's learned something

00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:34,829
you can then retrain it to retrain to

00:52:31,769 --> 00:52:36,539
detect other things go friend who use

00:52:34,829 --> 00:52:38,670
mobile net and it's called transfer

00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:41,430
learning and that last layer learning

00:52:38,670 --> 00:52:43,920
just trained the last layer doesn't

00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:46,109
require as much computation as training

00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,680
the whole model from scratch so it's

00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:53,489
possible to do that stuff in JavaScript

00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:54,869
possible sometimes in the browser so

00:52:53,489 --> 00:52:57,630
that's where I think mobile net is

00:52:54,869 --> 00:53:00,269
useful for okay it's not detecting a lot

00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:02,369
of very clever things but on the lower

00:53:00,269 --> 00:53:04,949
levels of that of that of a model it's

00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:06,719
detecting something's like a baby you

00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:09,329
know it's like learn something but you

00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:12,630
just need to train the last mile another

00:53:09,329 --> 00:53:16,229
way I describe it as is imagine imagine

00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:17,519
learning JavaScript from scratch imagine

00:53:16,229 --> 00:53:20,670
teaching something JavaScript from

00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:23,369
scratch or taking a Python developer and

00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:25,739
teaching them JavaScript like the second

00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:27,599
one it's not going to be as much effort

00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:31,369
and that's kind of transfer learning and

00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:33,590
that's where it can start being useful

00:53:31,369 --> 00:53:35,620
yeah

00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:35,620
Oh

00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:40,490
api's you wanna do some really some

00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,930
really powerful stuff you can get

00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:45,430
started straightaway with API if you

00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:45,430
only like train stuff up that's bigger

00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:57,290
yeah well I can't say categorically you

00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,910
you won't because maybe there is a use

00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:02,750
case where it's actually accurate enough

00:53:58,910 --> 00:54:06,440
but yeah typically now like yeah

00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:11,630
any of the questions I could not

00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:14,000
remember if you look in is it is it not

00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:15,530
downloading for you if you look in a

00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,450
network tab because that because I it's

00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:19,670
actually not one JSON file that JSON

00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:22,070
file then triggers the loading of some

00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:24,350
shard files so if you look at the

00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:27,790
network tab you'll see but it's many

00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:27,790
megabytes small

00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:37,660
so to get start with the regression

00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:42,030
clone this bad boy bad boy it's not

00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:42,030
that's not good bad person

00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:06,960
[Music]

00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:29,490
okay

00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,610
train the mouth begin the brown hoodie

00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:29,820
trading on the server come up with the

00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:29,820
new

00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:33,980
if it's very very simple and maybe you

00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:36,230
can get away with something in there in

00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:38,930
the browser I know I think I was talking

00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:41,060
to earlier on but he did stuff in in

00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:43,130
node on on the server side because it

00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:47,500
just just a computer up but yeah you can

00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:50,720
still it's doable in JavaScript yeah I

00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,460
think the is good to play around the

00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,690
stuff in the browser because you've cz

00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,950
to play around with but then if you need

00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:56,360
to get a little bit more computing you

00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:59,330
want to stay in JavaScript you can use a

00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:02,330
node.js version or tensorflow then if

00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:14,180
you really want to go for that you can

00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:16,490
rewrite it in there in there yeah I for

00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:19,010
learning and right now just for

00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:22,610
inferring in the browser mean yeah

00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:27,110
mostly just for inferring it's like yeah

00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:28,850
yeah I don't know it's difficult to know

00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:35,150
really and what people are really using

00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:38,090
it for but yeah all right

00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:39,290
did we cloned it he hasn't cloned it

00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:46,220
that's a terrible question who hasn't

00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:47,300
find it we're all good excellent so

00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:50,780
questions also different types of

00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:52,700
regression we're looking at linear

00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:55,730
regression which is kind of maybe you

00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:59,060
remember this stuff you got a hot you've

00:57:55,730 --> 00:58:00,860
got a whole bunch of dots points and you

00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:03,560
want to find the best fit line between

00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:06,650
them kind of what is the linear

00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:10,220
relationship between these two sets of

00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:13,100
data logistic regression which is more

00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:15,560
Honor that's polynomial they listed we

00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:17,810
just we have polynomial regression which

00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:19,400
is kind of a similar thing as linear

00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:22,700
regression except you you understand

00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:25,910
that the relationship is is nonlinear

00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:28,970
right like

00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:31,520
yeah we've got logistic regression which

00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:35,420
is more to do with probabilities we're

00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:37,280
not only going to that so for instance

00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:40,580
this is a famous one sir cricket chirps

00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,560
per minute and ambient temperature so

00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,770
that's actually has a linear

00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:47,570
relationship

00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:49,880
I suppose up until they die right

00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:53,090
I puts all their dead but up until then

00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:56,090
it's a linear relationship Fame some

00:58:53,090 --> 00:59:03,880
more temperature is the more cricket

00:58:56,090 --> 00:59:03,880
chirps per minute oh yeah my friends so

00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:10,220
extrapolating this data can be a problem

00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:11,330
sometimes right so you need to take it

00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:14,570
with a pinch like you need to understand

00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:15,980
your data understand where where might

00:59:14,570 --> 00:59:24,190
have a linear relationship and where it

00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:29,260
might not remember this remember this

00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:33,680
yeah yeah there we go back a school

00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:36,410
machine learning is maths its maths

00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:39,500
there's just no way around it I'm no

00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:41,450
good at maths so it's a real struggle

00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:43,310
for me and I'm very very lucky that I've

00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:45,170
got a lot of friends who know this base

00:59:43,310 --> 00:59:47,480
you are willing to to spend time with me

00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:49,970
to tell me bigger stuff RBIs maths right

00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:52,400
you do have to get to get to know quite

00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:54,940
well anyway this is this is the this

00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:59,660
little an equation that describes a line

00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:04,070
so why the position on the y coordinate

00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:09,590
of the line is equal to M some variable

01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:11,360
M times X plus B now B would be if X is

01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:15,050
zero so it would be zero so that would

01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:17,840
mean B is 5 a right that's the constant

01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:22,010
remember this stuff I feel so clever

01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:23,330
remember all this stuff from school but

01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:24,740
that's basically it and that's what we

01:00:23,330 --> 01:00:26,420
want to do here so you've got you've got

01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:29,600
you've got this whole bunch of data sets

01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:32,540
of points and you all know the linear

01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:34,740
relationship is between them all right

01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:41,010
this is how you do

01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:42,839
okay oh and why linear regression is a

01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:45,060
really good start to get to understand

01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:50,099
how to do in your networks just because

01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:55,260
of this right this is a neuron the same

01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:59,900
thing we had before we have X imagine

01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:59,900
your x and y coordinate of your point is

01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:06,480
you your expected value and your your

01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,830
input value all right so your feature

01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,109
and what you expect it's kind of like

01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:13,260
having labeled data our training set so

01:01:10,109 --> 01:01:15,030
you can train on and then your m and B

01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:17,670
what what what do we really want to do

01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:22,830
is you what you want something that will

01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:27,390
figure out given a set of points which

01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:28,710
is your data set the best fit line so

01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:31,940
you really want to shoot it's going to

01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:33,810
tune some valleys for it for M and B

01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:37,500
that's what you're gonna be doing that's

01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:39,000
why linear regressions are good a good

01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,500
first step to understand how to build

01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,070
neural networks because it's gonna teach

01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:46,800
you this it's just one neuron it's me so

01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:48,089
hard to get it's one neuron right then

01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,500
once you've got this right you can apply

01:01:48,089 --> 01:01:52,140
it to all of them and join them all

01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:54,720
together all right I forgot I actually

01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:58,880
and we're supposed to show you a demo

01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,880
let me show you a demo oh no I didn't ah

01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:03,960
cover I see this is basically something

01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:06,060
that what we're gonna build right is

01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:11,250
we're going to build today see as you

01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:12,839
add points it's gonna figure out what

01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:17,520
the line is and what that line is

01:02:12,839 --> 01:02:20,160
figuring out basically an M and a value

01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,900
for M and a value for B that's basically

01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,839
where it's gonna figure out and it's

01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:28,170
gonna automatically figure out what

01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:30,660
those are from your data sets that's it

01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:34,740
all right

01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:37,049
I think I skipped the slide let me go

01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:43,440
let me go through this again so don't

01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:49,710
skip anything so yeah and so then let's

01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:54,509
say we gave it a value X 1 and Y 16 it

01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:56,400
then figures out let's just say what

01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:58,759
have I done here what is this maths oh

01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,759
my god

01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:08,519
MX plus B yes right so if we gave a

01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:12,509
value of x is equal to 1 M is 4 B is 12

01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:16,440
y is equal to MX plus b MX is 1 times 4

01:03:12,509 --> 01:03:18,029
4 plus B is 12 y is equal to 16

01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:21,029
that's all where this neuron would give

01:03:18,029 --> 01:03:23,700
us however we know because it's our

01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:27,750
point that we created the X is equal to

01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:30,240
1 and Y is equal to 13 so we know that

01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:31,920
the values here are wrong the optimizer

01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:37,040
is gonna run and it's going to retune

01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:39,990
these things to another slide

01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:41,910
we tune those things to be better value

01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:43,500
and this thing here is called a loss

01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:46,250
function this is the most important part

01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:48,660
of it used to describe how wrong you are

01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:49,349
need a function that tells you how wrong

01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:52,500
you are

01:03:49,349 --> 01:03:53,190
that's what it's all about and that's

01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:57,079
what I'm great

01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:57,079
okay all right

01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:14,010
so hopefully you should have a folder

01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:14,010
that looks a little bit like this yeah

01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:24,830
good create one as main dejay so just

01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,720
just just create it and that's why

01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:28,430
you're gonna type stuff in because all

01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:33,230
these all these other ones are is just

01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:37,040
different bits of code that you can use

01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:42,230
okay so cool that you can use to figure

01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:44,300
out that you can go to write so we're

01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:47,150
going to go through kind of 1 2 3 etc

01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:48,950
etc at the end I want to show you linear

01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:50,180
regression and then you're gonna figure

01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:52,700
out all by yourself you're gonna figure

01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:59,230
out how to do polynomial regression so

01:04:52,700 --> 01:05:05,270
you gonna figure out all right oh yeah I

01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:11,240
checked in 10 so jess library in the

01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:15,850
source code that's how I code yeah I

01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:15,850
check independent libraries into github

01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:21,080
yeah no one thought that before I

01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:22,790
thought of it okay obviously don't do

01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,620
that if you're doing it in flux when I

01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:26,020
use that use the official version if I

01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:28,700
just checked in to make things simple

01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:30,050
we're also using a library called p5.js

01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:32,600
I'm gonna go through that very very

01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:36,710
briefly so you can see how it works it's

01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:45,280
a visualization library who here is the

01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:49,040
react developer view angular alright

01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:51,860
Hugh p5.js is not like that at all right

01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:53,150
do not use p5.js do not use in

01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,740
production you want to see why in a

01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:56,030
second you should never ever use p5.js

01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:59,180
in production it's just I'm it's an

01:05:56,030 --> 01:06:02,030
interesting way to draw stuff assist

01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:04,850
it's used a lot in teaching younger

01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:06,140
people and I just think want to get

01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:10,130
stuck I just don't wanna have an

01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:11,750
argument about a web framework

01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:15,170
I just didn't want to have that

01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:17,450
discussion so use paper at p5.js I'm

01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:18,320
also going to use a main digestible

01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:20,240
because we're just going to stick

01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:27,050
everything in I call our bar all of our

01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:28,910
code as we as we code along and I'm

01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:30,650
gonna do things today as I'm gonna go

01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:32,750
for this one experiment a little bit I'm

01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:34,370
gonna go through things I had some

01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:35,900
feedback from the last time I gave this

01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:39,290
workshop I'm gonna try and go through

01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:41,990
things in a different order fingers

01:06:39,290 --> 01:06:44,360
crossed this will work but it should

01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:46,180
hopefully be a lot more engaging for you

01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:48,320
all as you go through

01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:49,610
so right now you should have those in

01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,930
this index they station file make sure

01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:52,910
you've got a main digest and make sure

01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:56,780
you've got it here and it exists let me

01:06:52,910 --> 01:06:58,010
actually rename mine I mean just one and

01:06:56,780 --> 01:07:03,340
I'm going to just empty this one out

01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:05,750
right and then however you or whenever

01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:08,710
well you'll did it with the mobile net

01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:13,970
so I presume you'll know how to open up

01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:16,240
the thing yeah each opening with a pin

01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:19,550
in it and I'm using live server plug-in

01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:22,510
but if you serve or whatever else that

01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:27,470
you're using locally go for it

01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:31,030
and then that's it well nothing should

01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:35,600
be there because it should be it's just

01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:38,450
your main dodge s is blank I think I'm

01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:42,849
missing something in a second

01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:47,260
I'm missing explaining something am i no

01:07:42,849 --> 01:07:47,260
nothing I'm good yeah

01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:55,480
ya think I'm with alright so we're gonna

01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:58,290
go through peafowl jess super quickly

01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,290
it's a p5.js

01:08:01,330 --> 01:08:13,000
is amazing it uses Global's everywhere

01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:17,049
so everything you've been taught about

01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:21,100
Global's are bad is wrong Global's are

01:08:17,049 --> 01:08:23,100
amazing okay so what happens is is that

01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:26,170
is that basically if there's two

01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:30,520
functions available called setup and

01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:31,990
draw that's what it will call right so

01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:34,000
it's expecting these functions of these

01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:36,549
specific names to be available so setup

01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,010
is called before anything helps you set

01:08:36,549 --> 01:08:40,630
up things and draw is called well let's

01:08:39,010 --> 01:08:43,510
figure out when draw is called let's

01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:44,859
just see all right so it's just a copy

01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:47,530
and if you want you can just copy and

01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:52,650
paste it from set the blood draw put in

01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:52,650
your main j/s and it's safe right

01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:58,350
and then open up in the browser boom

01:08:59,749 --> 01:09:04,999
yeah you see that

01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:11,799
this is probably why you shouldn't use

01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:15,330
p5.js in production right because it

01:09:11,799 --> 01:09:20,950
just it just draws as fast as possible

01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:29,529
continue constantly that's it basically

01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:31,900
right pretty cool I think even does it

01:09:29,529 --> 01:09:33,520
this too even when it no no I think with

01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:39,069
chrome when you're not looking on the

01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:43,270
screen it doesn't draw it on I still

01:09:39,069 --> 01:09:44,739
draws it yeah that's basically how what

01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:46,359
happens and you you're gonna there's

01:09:44,739 --> 01:09:48,880
gonna be drawing logic that you're gonna

01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:52,680
stick and draw right on the set of

01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:55,270
budget stick and set up the main thing

01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:57,880
you want to do is you want to create

01:09:55,270 --> 01:10:01,150
canvas area which is where you should

01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:04,270
draw stuff so if you go to to canvas dot

01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:07,719
color you can grab that for that line

01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:12,760
from setup dot the set up there and copy

01:10:07,719 --> 01:10:16,239
into your main okay create canvas again

01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:18,670
another wonderful global I think oh

01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:21,040
there's other things it's not giving us

01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:25,570
window width and window height another

01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:27,430
Global's Y is a coding not like this why

01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:29,680
don't we do it like this is so much fun

01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:32,050
right basic this is the window the width

01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:33,400
and the height of the window we've seen

01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:38,710
create canvas it's ledger craying a

01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:42,190
html5 canvas the full size of the screen

01:10:38,710 --> 01:10:43,450
and once you've got a canvas you can do

01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:47,190
fun stuff like you can set the

01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:47,190
background just to the background

01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:53,650
right I don't know what color that is

01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:56,470
maybe it's gray it's red red green and

01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:57,910
blue that's all that is or you can

01:10:56,470 --> 01:11:00,870
actually if you wanted to you could kind

01:10:57,910 --> 01:11:06,330
of well let's just see it working first

01:11:00,870 --> 01:11:10,600
and again what is that doing right now

01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:14,530
every time draw is called is painting

01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:18,790
the whole thing every single pixel that

01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:26,490
color right drawing it from scratch it's

01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:29,200
gonna do it every frame I can't remember

01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:33,270
try out I think you got to put it in

01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:33,270
draw anyway you need it in draw because

01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:42,970
if you draw a line it doesn't disappear

01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:46,240
you've got a paint over everything again

01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:48,090
and draw it all again right it's great

01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:53,010
it's fun though it's fun this is how

01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:56,700
coding should be or you can do like read

01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:56,700
something out nice

01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:02,070
so you can set a background and I think

01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:04,489
this is the point where I'm going to

01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:04,489
jump ahead

01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:12,630
so again

01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:12,630
oh you know you know paper people dress

01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:21,460
no loop yeah I think I'm good with it

01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:26,160
with a capital L yeah and it stops a

01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:29,530
looping yeah boom and then loop right

01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:29,860
Luke just stop looping well let's just

01:12:29,530 --> 01:12:33,400
see

01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:35,110
yeah this is why it's so much fun yeah

01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:46,990
it just works right you just try it

01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:50,140
typed okay don't use no loop let it loop

01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:52,090
let it loop let it loop and I think this

01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:55,690
is the point where I'm going to be gonna

01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:58,060
skip ahead hang on let's get three four

01:12:55,690 --> 01:13:00,730
or five or go over very fast I'll go

01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:02,590
over it very fast three you can have a

01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:05,860
look at if you want later on but this is

01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:09,910
how you draw texts you define a fill

01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:11,710
color this is almost just like it's all

01:13:09,910 --> 01:13:13,150
sequential I know with Jarvis it's all

01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:16,000
about callbacks and stuff but this stuff

01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:19,540
is just sequential what is the color of

01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,910
the of the pen what is the font I want

01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:23,350
to use from this point onwards or is it

01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:27,660
tech sighs I want to use from this point

01:13:23,350 --> 01:13:34,150
onwards draw the text hello world in

01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:41,370
this position x and y x is at the bottom

01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:47,590
why is it the y0 is the bottom no top

01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:49,150
let's figure out if you want to see yes

01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:52,890
let's do actually and i can copy and

01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:52,890
paste that into my draw function

01:13:57,310 --> 01:14:01,400
there yeah hello world allagash AB don't

01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:05,690
like ice cream

01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:08,360
I mean I'm intolerant to milk protein

01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:16,130
not like those nuts protein very bad for

01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:22,460
me and also bricks it supporters just

01:14:16,130 --> 01:14:26,350
two things and I'm lost now I'm lost I'm

01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:30,080
lost for my any one of us to be yes

01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:33,260
three four five I Sayed your text you

01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:34,970
can also draw shapes if you're doing if

01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:37,700
you used to kind of like drawing tools

01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:40,640
that can you set a stroke wait

01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:48,470
the stroke color you can draw an ellipse

01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:50,390
of this X&Y I'm this size and then you

01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:55,160
can say from this point I was almost no

01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:59,180
stroke right so that's I'm gonna do here

01:14:55,160 --> 01:15:03,470
as well just gonna have these drop in

01:14:59,180 --> 01:15:04,850
there okay I'm just going to draw a

01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:06,440
circle in the center of the screen

01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:09,440
theoretically in the center of the

01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:14,080
screen because it's window width / -

01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:14,080
window height / - right

01:15:14,499 --> 01:15:20,519
let's see let's go to that let's go to

01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:20,519
that let's do that

01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:29,880
let's give it up man boom very very

01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,300
faint circle why is it that color I

01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:31,650
don't know

01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:35,330
Oh cuz happens that they lost the

01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:40,200
background let's set the background

01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:43,460
background background background oh my

01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:49,700
god I just feel great

01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:53,330
GRE why or a why a is other both valid

01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:53,330
are you serious

01:15:53,930 --> 01:16:04,530
have you just like blowing my mind

01:15:57,739 --> 01:16:06,950
no wait I have both valid was that the

01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:06,950
same shade

01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:16,510
it's the same if I just learned

01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:19,900
something I feel I should have known

01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:22,900
this already by now I didn't know that

01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:25,300
okay excellent

01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:26,770
I'm the stroke I said the stroke to like

01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:32,010
red or something like that you can do

01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:32,010
this yeah so you can draw circles right

01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:39,200
Riley feels I should have known that

01:16:39,349 --> 01:16:44,440
why the center why I think I must have

01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:44,440
said it

01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:50,570
Oh interesting I think that's the film

01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:58,280
the film must be white by default if I

01:16:50,570 --> 01:17:03,940
set fill to bloom a fill oh my god how

01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:03,940
do I not do that escape yeah blue

01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:12,690
but the makings of my next website right

01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:15,140
here alright color color selection

01:17:12,690 --> 01:17:15,140
spot-on

01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:22,830
the next thing I was going to skip over

01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:24,660
was five on lines okay did I go over

01:17:22,830 --> 01:17:25,290
lines no didn't so lines is coming very

01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:27,420
similar

01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:29,400
you just have a line that you can draw

01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:36,290
in fact let's just draw a line in the

01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:42,720
middle of it let's not go nuts so a line

01:17:36,290 --> 01:17:47,340
X Y to begin X Y to end another x1 y1

01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:53,480
your x1 y1 x2 y2 so 10 just should be

01:17:47,340 --> 01:17:56,240
kind of going no that way down I think

01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:59,970
yeah

01:17:56,240 --> 01:18:01,950
so the X&Y is top left which is really

01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:03,480
annoying when you join graphs on lines

01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:06,390
because you want you want the Y to be

01:18:03,480 --> 01:18:09,960
here what Y is there to be there baby

01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:12,110
that draws a line boom you can draw a

01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,110
line

01:18:13,699 --> 01:18:16,849
all right

01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:23,240
okay and now I'm gonna skip to seven

01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:30,510
boom

01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:32,820
okay cool things you can do a game

01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:34,860
loving the Global's you gotta embrace

01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:37,530
the Global's okay they're great they're

01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:41,130
fantastic if a function called

01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:44,880
mouseclicked exists guess when it's

01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:48,570
called every time the mouse is clicked

01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:54,510
why's life why is it not this simple

01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:59,010
simple right mouse clicks Mouse X and

01:18:54,510 --> 01:19:01,710
Mouse why are helpfully set to the x and

01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:03,050
y position of the mouse at the moment

01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:07,950
that it was clicked

01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:12,720
then you can set draw a circle at that

01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:14,070
position of radius 10 let's just copy

01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:15,900
and paste that in fact I'm going to get

01:19:14,070 --> 01:19:21,000
rid of my get rid of my draw function

01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:24,269
just to clear out oh no oh no oh god

01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:33,010
sakes boom

01:19:24,269 --> 01:19:34,630
and Adam mouseclicked this is it and

01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:36,269
huge will copy and paste this you can

01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:43,059
pop copy and paste it from seven

01:19:36,269 --> 01:19:49,889
mouseclicked right then that's it now if

01:19:43,059 --> 01:19:56,050
I go here yes you should be able to now

01:19:49,889 --> 01:20:00,820
do this all over the screen pretty cool

01:19:56,050 --> 01:20:09,340
hey pretty cool view now you started to

01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:11,650
like p5.js aren't you yeah yeah my

01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:13,090
wandering and mines trying to think of

01:20:11,650 --> 01:20:19,240
ways you can release this in production

01:20:13,090 --> 01:20:21,990
you can't don't write

01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,990
they go

01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:41,380
you're a second

01:20:38,019 --> 01:20:46,739
to try and get out while I frantically

01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:46,739
remember more the next thing is

01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:58,080
okay

01:20:56,180 --> 01:20:59,790
hopefully you're all working on that

01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:01,850
what I want you to do want to give you a

01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:07,080
little bit time now to focus on this

01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:11,810
create two variables that are am i

01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:16,910
letting these am i letting these I'm on

01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:21,729
let's let them yeah let oh my god

01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:28,039
X's all right

01:21:21,729 --> 01:21:29,389
but wise right I just want you to every

01:21:28,039 --> 01:21:34,340
time the mouse is clicked through this

01:21:29,389 --> 01:21:36,440
X&Y just start collecting them collect

01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:41,559
all the x's and the X is irate but all

01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:41,559
the Y's in the wiser right just do that

01:21:44,789 --> 01:21:49,459
it's getting gentle gentle instruction

01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,890
[Music]

01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:05,710
Oh

01:23:26,979 --> 01:23:30,030
so I'm just

01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:55,320
hopefully wasn't too too difficult if

01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:56,880
this is how this is all this is this is

01:23:55,320 --> 01:24:06,440
all you should hopefully have needed to

01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:06,440
do X is that push Mouse X

01:24:08,429 --> 01:24:16,340
why's that push and that's why okay

01:24:22,449 --> 01:24:31,659
let's not bother drawing it for our so

01:24:27,079 --> 01:24:31,659
that's it right in fact I can just

01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:36,350
[Music]

01:24:38,999 --> 01:24:43,989
it's a clever way of writing all this

01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:47,340
stuff isn't it like you use a D

01:24:43,989 --> 01:24:47,340
structure or something and then

01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:54,730
man I'm tell me if I'm being an idiot

01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:54,730
what am i doing right now

01:24:55,889 --> 01:25:02,820
okay does this work man how am I even

01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:09,010
doing how am I even thinking right now

01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:12,489
is that thing that thing can do that

01:25:09,010 --> 01:25:19,599
well that's it if this works I'm gonna

01:25:12,489 --> 01:25:22,210
be I'm happy okay okay okay okay it's

01:25:19,599 --> 01:25:25,809
working so that's basically creating me

01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:28,239
two arrays one with all the X values and

01:25:25,809 --> 01:25:30,039
one with all the all all the what is it

01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:32,440
how comes Tony going printing one

01:25:30,039 --> 01:25:38,559
actually printing - here we go is - one

01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:40,530
- right okay X's and Y's right however

01:25:38,559 --> 01:25:44,170
you can see it so she's storing in like

01:25:40,530 --> 01:25:47,739
the actual x and y of the position in

01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:51,099
the screen on my screen might be

01:25:47,739 --> 01:25:52,300
different to your screen so a lot of the

01:25:51,099 --> 01:25:53,619
time when we're doing with stuff with

01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:55,179
machine learning what we want to do is

01:25:53,619 --> 01:25:56,769
we want to normalize our date and you

01:25:55,179 --> 01:25:59,980
usually want to normalize it to between

01:25:56,769 --> 01:26:02,019
zero and one that's kind of a really

01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:05,590
good thing to do keep everything

01:26:02,019 --> 01:26:07,420
normalized between zero and one so if

01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:08,980
you know the width of your screen you

01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:11,650
know that you clicked kind of there then

01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:12,460
that's probably probably bout 75% or

01:26:11,650 --> 01:26:15,280
0.75

01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:18,250
well p5.js has it like a nice function

01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:25,329
that allows you to to do that and that's

01:26:18,250 --> 01:26:27,599
called math okay and with map what it

01:26:25,329 --> 01:26:27,599
does

01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:35,870
I'm just gonna copy and paste the whole

01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:35,870
thing

01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:39,960
the Africa

01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:54,600
so what map does is it kind of Maps a

01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:58,050
value from one range to another range so

01:26:54,600 --> 01:27:01,890
what this is saying if you've got the

01:26:58,050 --> 01:27:06,600
number 500 that rain that comes from a

01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:11,430
range of 0 to 1000 and I want to map it

01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:16,290
to a range of 0 to 1 right it's just

01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:19,770
gonna normalize it to 0 to 1 Sophie if I

01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:24,780
actually now if you look at that printed

01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:28,610
out or shizzle we're just done it's been

01:27:24,780 --> 01:27:30,630
0.5 okay

01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:32,340
what we want to do is want to use the

01:27:30,630 --> 01:27:33,720
window width because depending on where

01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:38,580
you clicked in the window width you want

01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:40,320
it to say that be 1 that be 0 I'm gonna

01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:42,750
normalize on number this is just a

01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,920
standard thing you want to do in machine

01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:46,320
learning with your datasets you want to

01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:51,650
normalize everything observe to 1 so

01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:54,770
given that given that's how map works

01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:54,770
all right

01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:05,600
normalize the X's the XS and the Y's so

01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:10,610
that it's storing a value from 0 to 1

01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:15,680
instead of 100 150 something like that

01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:17,960
you got me the helpful variables you

01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:22,810
want it you want is window width and

01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:25,850
window height right there's two clues

01:28:22,810 --> 01:28:29,750
I'm giving you right

01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:31,460
it's a map window with window height if

01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:34,610
you want to see other examples of map

01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:39,230
working you can look in 6 dot map but

01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:41,240
j/s there's lots of examples there to

01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:44,200
play around with but that's basically

01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:44,200
what we want to do here

01:28:46,269 --> 01:28:53,390
give you a few minutes

01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:54,590
we're not you haven't touched on

01:28:53,390 --> 01:28:58,150
tensorflow yet have we

01:28:54,590 --> 01:29:00,739
right I know I know we're getting there

01:28:58,150 --> 01:29:02,060
again as I said previously you wanna

01:29:00,739 --> 01:29:04,570
remember those moments when you were

01:29:02,060 --> 01:29:07,930
just drawing circles on it on a page

01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:07,930
remember it fondly

01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:18,130
okay

01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:40,540
alright I'll just show you I give the

01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:44,320
answer so basically how you would make

01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:45,640
that work would be this and what I'm

01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:49,390
really doing is I'm we're gonna we are

01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:51,250
going to start I'm not gonna I'm showing

01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:52,510
you enough of the codes that later on

01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:53,680
when you need to when you need to start

01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:55,720
changing some of the stuff you stopped

01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:57,220
you kind of know what you're looking at

01:32:55,720 --> 01:33:00,130
but in terms of drawing the drawing

01:32:57,220 --> 01:33:04,090
drawing stuff and in terms of getting

01:33:00,130 --> 01:33:07,240
data in the right way so if you want to

01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:13,420
normalize the X's okay we're going to

01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:15,970
push X the input is Mouse X between zero

01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:17,410
and Max and Max from the X is going to

01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:22,450
be the width it's just when your window

01:33:17,410 --> 01:33:24,550
width right and then we want it we want

01:33:22,450 --> 01:33:31,800
it to map from zero to window width to 0

01:33:24,550 --> 01:33:35,790
to 1 same thing goes for the Y's Mouse Y

01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:35,790
but this time it's window height

01:33:36,470 --> 01:33:42,010
okay that's the map that's the

01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:48,100
usefulness of the map function so now

01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:48,100
you go to what's calling me

01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:57,530
so now wait ah I should stop it stop it

01:33:56,239 --> 01:34:00,400
printing out other stuff why is it

01:33:57,530 --> 01:34:00,400
printing it like here again

01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:07,120
okay so now if I should click it there

01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:11,300
it should be zero zero close to it

01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:16,120
yeah zero if I click it right to the end

01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:16,120
there it should be near like one 4x

01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:28,530
yeah yeah this is the second one I'm a

01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:31,450
big bomb right it should be almost 1:1

01:34:28,530 --> 01:34:32,740
yeah Sumbul point nine nine no point

01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:35,730
nine seven four so we've just kind of

01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:43,830
normalized everything from zero to one

01:34:35,730 --> 01:34:47,650
all right if you look in the functions

01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:49,540
packet line no calculate collect points

01:34:47,650 --> 01:34:51,550
which is kind of it that click pointers

01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:53,200
is where we're going towards what what

01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:56,200
we should end up with you can see I've

01:34:53,200 --> 01:35:00,000
actually got some functions here and all

01:34:56,200 --> 01:35:02,890
they are is just a map function but

01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:07,390
we're just kind of created a help of

01:35:02,890 --> 01:35:10,960
helpful versions of them to do the same

01:35:07,390 --> 01:35:17,290
thing so norm just saved him having to

01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:18,860
write all of that stuff yourself so if I

01:35:17,290 --> 01:35:23,000
put it here

01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:24,680
just paste them at the top like that so

01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:29,150
with these all this is doing is calling

01:35:24,680 --> 01:35:31,760
map be providing in the max and norm X

01:35:29,150 --> 01:35:34,280
is just doing the same thing where it's

01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:36,920
just giving you window width so with

01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:47,030
these helper functions you can replace

01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:48,680
this with just norm X and norm Y that's

01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:49,850
all that those functions are doing so

01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:52,910
don't be scared of this function the top

01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:56,350
all they're doing is what you just did

01:35:52,910 --> 01:36:01,280
for in just fewer characters right

01:35:56,350 --> 01:36:05,020
hopefully let's see if that works yes oh

01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:08,740
my god so good at this coding stuff

01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:08,740
should be paid for you

01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:11,890
yeah actually look at collect points

01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:15,020
that's that's all I'm doing

01:36:11,890 --> 01:36:16,130
we should be basically here wow that's

01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:18,790
how you do that's a clever way of doing

01:36:16,130 --> 01:36:18,790
it there you go

01:36:23,619 --> 01:36:39,099
yeah so now let's look at let's take a

01:36:28,179 --> 01:36:40,420
look at map points between lines so I

01:36:39,099 --> 01:36:45,090
think I explained lines very briefly

01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:52,900
before so you have a line x1 y1 x2 y2

01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:56,080
before I showed you the equation of a

01:36:52,900 --> 01:37:03,040
line remember that y is equal to MX plus

01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:06,849
B for some reason I don't in a coder

01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:12,280
then changed it to Y is equal to ax plus

01:37:06,849 --> 01:37:14,050
C and I must have had a reason so oh and

01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:16,570
they shouldn't be constants so all I'm

01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:19,920
gonna do is at the top of my here I'm

01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:24,270
going to add another few let's let a

01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:28,540
let's see okay there's just two values

01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:30,099
and then I'm gonna create a function

01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:37,710
which you're gonna give me a value of y

01:37:30,099 --> 01:37:41,710
given a value of x right oh ok so get Y

01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:43,960
given some value of x this is just MX

01:37:41,710 --> 01:37:45,969
plus C but for some reason and I cannot

01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:47,340
figure out oh I remember now why yeah

01:37:45,969 --> 01:37:51,550
hang on boy

01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:53,580
I used a a X plus C that's all that's

01:37:51,550 --> 01:37:58,770
doing all right

01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:58,770
that's all that's doing so

01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:05,960
given that given that this is some new

01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:09,830
information that you've got given that

01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:13,280
you know how to draw a line can you draw

01:38:09,830 --> 01:38:14,990
this line you know this is a line and

01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,730
they should have it should look like

01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:19,040
that or it should look like that or

01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:22,160
maybe it looks like that you don't know

01:38:19,040 --> 01:38:29,690
draw this line on the screen and where X

01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:33,250
is zero here X is a window width on the

01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:35,410
other side that should give you X 1 X 2

01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:38,360
and the function should give you the Y's

01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:43,010
then you should be able to join to two

01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:46,340
dots together it's got me yeah try doing

01:38:43,010 --> 01:38:49,210
that try using this function to draw a

01:38:46,340 --> 01:38:49,210
line on the screen

01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:56,820
any line and yet let me ask you to draw

01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:56,820
the draw function

01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:50,630
you're very close to starting to write

01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:55,060
some tensorflow code I promise very

01:41:50,630 --> 01:41:55,060
close very close

01:41:56,289 --> 01:42:00,340
give you another minute or so

01:42:53,670 --> 01:43:02,760
Wow

01:42:55,379 --> 01:43:06,749
yeah I thought all right I want to draw

01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:12,229
a line now on the screen it's going to

01:43:06,749 --> 01:43:14,669
be legendary so what do you want to do

01:43:12,229 --> 01:43:16,679
let's get let's go next one

01:43:14,669 --> 01:43:18,239
where's the x1 gonna be from the

01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:25,169
furthest left of the screen so it's

01:43:18,239 --> 01:43:27,929
going to be zero let's get a y1 okay so

01:43:25,169 --> 01:43:28,949
what is the YY given the value of x well

01:43:27,929 --> 01:43:32,159
we've gotten that we've got a nice

01:43:28,949 --> 01:43:37,679
function above called get Y let's just

01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:41,909
call it get Y x1 hey yeah

01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:45,179
now we've gone x1 and a y1 let's get

01:43:41,909 --> 01:43:50,849
next to x2 is equal to the furthest

01:43:45,179 --> 01:43:58,889
right of the screen window width let's

01:43:50,849 --> 01:44:04,019
get Const Y to get Y x2 boom now we have

01:43:58,889 --> 01:44:07,579
an x1 y1 x2 y2 and then let's draw a

01:44:04,019 --> 01:44:07,579
line let's give it a stroke

01:44:08,119 --> 01:44:14,910
what's the

01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:14,910
hmm

01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:24,110
unless Kurdish a wait to get some you

01:44:18,260 --> 01:44:29,560
know weightiness thickness and then

01:44:24,110 --> 01:44:35,420
let's draw our line so ah what new line

01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:39,550
x1 y1 x2 y2 boom

01:44:35,420 --> 01:44:39,550
this should hopefully

01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:46,280
ha

01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:54,719
draw stroke stroke red

01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:11,770
what I done wrong ah I've got to draw

01:45:06,010 --> 01:45:14,110
functions the beauty of Global's there

01:45:11,770 --> 01:45:18,670
you go to draw functions right one

01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:23,350
overrides the other one right boom okay

01:45:18,670 --> 01:45:24,880
a Geordie delighted and if you wanted to

01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:29,500
do if you want to change what you're

01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:30,730
drawing what you're the line you can

01:45:29,500 --> 01:45:36,190
just change it here so you can change

01:45:30,730 --> 01:45:42,340
that to 0.5 0.5 0.5 and it changes the

01:45:36,190 --> 01:45:47,080
line it gets drawn right - - and you can

01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:48,850
change this to 300 all right so now

01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:51,940
we've created some of the draws a line

01:45:48,850 --> 01:45:57,900
based off of that equation that we have

01:45:51,940 --> 01:46:02,230
that we had before right so given that

01:45:57,900 --> 01:46:05,290
let me get back to where we were one 150

01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:08,130
Conner what was it something like that

01:46:05,290 --> 01:46:08,130
nope I'm fine

01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:22,440
that's the line so I've also got this

01:46:20,010 --> 01:46:25,700
thing at the bottom I'm still got mine

01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:28,740
there where is it here I'm gonna just

01:46:25,700 --> 01:46:32,420
want to still draw the circle give me a

01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:32,420
second ellipse

01:46:32,710 --> 01:46:35,400
okay

01:46:36,970 --> 01:46:41,880
I must give a straight way of like

01:46:38,770 --> 01:46:47,260
really black

01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:50,050
okay now go this line here you've also

01:46:47,260 --> 01:46:52,780
got this data point here okay remember

01:46:50,050 --> 01:47:01,900
we need to figure out the loss like how

01:46:52,780 --> 01:47:07,720
wrong is this line if if all my circles

01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:11,400
were here would that be a big loss

01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:11,400
number or a small loss number

01:47:14,120 --> 01:47:21,840
small/small right

01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:24,989
if all my points were here but yet it

01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:29,040
drew a line here would that be a large

01:47:24,989 --> 01:47:31,980
or small loss large loss exactly right

01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:39,500
that's what we need to calculate we need

01:47:31,980 --> 01:47:42,989
a way of knowing how far how wrong it is

01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:44,820
and we use something called a common one

01:47:42,989 --> 01:47:46,409
we use it's used all the way through

01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:49,590
you'll see all the time machine learning

01:47:46,409 --> 01:47:53,699
is mean squared error okay mean squared

01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:56,520
error and you you could get away with

01:47:53,699 --> 01:47:58,560
like ages maps using mean squared error

01:47:56,520 --> 01:48:00,239
and a lot of things because it's just

01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:05,310
it's a good loss function to use

01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:07,469
generally for for machine learning so

01:48:05,310 --> 01:48:13,159
what this says is given given some value

01:48:07,469 --> 01:48:13,159
so given this value of x here

01:48:14,449 --> 01:48:21,810
you get this is this is the actual value

01:48:18,179 --> 01:48:26,190
and this is 1 and this is 1 and yet

01:48:21,810 --> 01:48:27,719
however if you to look on the equation

01:48:26,190 --> 01:48:34,940
it would kind of give you these numbers

01:48:27,719 --> 01:48:34,940
here so you figure out the distance okay

01:48:36,619 --> 01:48:41,929
but you square it on man

01:48:40,189 --> 01:48:43,849
this is where the jet LAG's really gonna

01:48:41,929 --> 01:48:46,070
kick in for a second I need Corrections

01:48:43,849 --> 01:48:49,399
if anyone's correct me correct me you

01:48:46,070 --> 01:48:50,419
square it and then you divide it all by

01:48:49,399 --> 01:48:52,369
the means you want you end up with one

01:48:50,419 --> 01:48:53,389
number okay the reason you square is

01:48:52,369 --> 01:48:56,019
because sometimes you might get a

01:48:53,389 --> 01:48:56,019
negative number

01:49:00,020 --> 01:49:04,170
yeah and you need it to kind of you

01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:06,150
don't care about the signage you don't

01:49:04,170 --> 01:49:10,110
care the direction it is wrong right

01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:12,450
that's why you square things and that's

01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:14,580
basically what we want to to do now is

01:49:12,450 --> 01:49:18,290
you need to calculate the loss it's

01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:20,340
super important to understand your loss

01:49:18,290 --> 01:49:22,350
it's super important because number

01:49:20,340 --> 01:49:24,900
everything I showed you like it needs to

01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:27,360
know tents flow needs to know how wrong

01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:29,160
something is in order to tune something

01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:34,200
so that's all we're going to do now

01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:37,050
and in fact if you go to I'm gonna write

01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:41,490
this out yes

01:49:37,050 --> 01:49:43,020
no man it's gonna be dangerous if I

01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:47,280
write this out I'm gonna copy and paste

01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:49,490
I'm sorry I'll just go through it line

01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:49,490
by line

01:49:50,290 --> 01:49:52,950
yes

01:49:55,720 --> 01:50:02,270
so the same code you saw before same

01:49:59,570 --> 01:50:03,440
stuff you did before mouse clicks you

01:50:02,270 --> 01:50:05,410
don't you've done all this before you're

01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:09,740
storing everything in X's and Y's and

01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:11,840
then you call loss remember our ANC is

01:50:09,740 --> 01:50:18,830
fixed here right now what happens I need

01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:23,000
to call loss each of the X's okay you

01:50:18,830 --> 01:50:24,650
get the x and y we then pass it through

01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:29,060
you kind of need to do this kind of take

01:50:24,650 --> 01:50:31,550
the zero to one value I know you don't

01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:36,560
need to do that anyway that's all I did

01:50:31,550 --> 01:50:37,400
you basically get the Y value you take

01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:42,410
the difference

01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:46,190
okay but might be negative you square it

01:50:42,410 --> 01:50:49,520
you sum it all together you divided by

01:50:46,190 --> 01:50:50,710
all the X's all the values and you get

01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:56,150
like a little something called a loss

01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:57,590
and print it out right and I've actually

01:50:56,150 --> 01:50:59,240
got in the rest of the code here he

01:50:57,590 --> 01:51:01,610
copied and pasted the code from Target

01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:03,830
loss you'll see that I'm actually

01:51:01,610 --> 01:51:07,330
drawing that loss value on the screen

01:51:03,830 --> 01:51:11,060
I'm drawing it on the screen okay as

01:51:07,330 --> 01:51:12,890
text so that's all that's the only real

01:51:11,060 --> 01:51:15,380
difference between this and your other

01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:20,450
code before that's it just calculating a

01:51:15,380 --> 01:51:22,490
loss value all right so that I now load

01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:26,600
this up in the browser this is what you

01:51:22,490 --> 01:51:28,040
see and if I draw as if I click here if

01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:30,260
I add it there's no there's no X's of

01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:32,480
X's and Y's max I don't add anything if

01:51:30,260 --> 01:51:33,080
I add one close to it our fingers

01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:38,750
crossed

01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:41,930
yes the loss is low right the loss is

01:51:38,750 --> 01:51:47,360
very low if I hopefully start doing it

01:51:41,930 --> 01:51:49,940
away so loss increases and now if I add

01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:53,630
some more data points closer to it a

01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:54,579
loss reduces right that's what's going

01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:58,270
on

01:51:54,579 --> 01:51:59,650
and so what imagine this is our data

01:51:58,270 --> 01:52:04,690
here this is that this is our actual

01:51:59,650 --> 01:52:08,650
data like something like this the lines

01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:11,800
wrong the liens wrong but now you have a

01:52:08,650 --> 01:52:14,409
number that describes exactly how wrong

01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:17,349
it is and tend to flow then uses that

01:52:14,409 --> 01:52:19,750
loss to figure out how to adjust the a

01:52:17,349 --> 01:52:21,790
in the C that's all you need to do is

01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:26,230
you need to find the right value of a

01:52:21,790 --> 01:52:27,969
and C so it fits perfectly in all those

01:52:26,230 --> 01:52:29,500
dots that's all what we're doing here is

01:52:27,969 --> 01:52:31,659
we're tuning that value of a and C

01:52:29,500 --> 01:52:33,369
that's all we're doing that's a magic of

01:52:31,659 --> 01:52:35,590
tensorflow it's not really the magic

01:52:33,369 --> 01:52:39,849
it's nothing you right now you're like

01:52:35,590 --> 01:52:42,690
is this it this is it this is it this is

01:52:39,849 --> 01:52:42,690
all the machine learning is

01:52:43,949 --> 01:52:46,610
right

01:52:52,130 --> 01:52:58,320
okay

01:52:54,900 --> 01:53:01,460
I'm gonna hit tensorflow before we hit

01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:01,460
tens of Thor we have to hit maths

01:53:03,059 --> 01:53:16,590
max right matrices go let's go there

01:53:11,190 --> 01:53:16,590
matrix maths big deep

01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:21,160
big I wanted to get some food hang on

01:53:19,810 --> 01:53:22,960
what I want not food

01:53:21,160 --> 01:53:27,430
what's the other stuff that you get it's

01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:32,700
not food so coffee they don't want to

01:53:27,430 --> 01:53:32,700
come think white a coffee

01:53:35,590 --> 01:53:45,350
yeah okay matrix maths simple

01:53:42,620 --> 01:53:51,590
two-dimensional matrixes matrices okay

01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:54,410
just go remember this stuff back before

01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:56,930
back back back when when you're kind of

01:53:54,410 --> 01:53:58,760
adding kind of matrices together this is

01:53:56,930 --> 01:54:00,770
it as long as the same same size and

01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:02,570
shape you just kind of add the

01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:08,140
appropriate stuff together and it gives

01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:08,140
you the the output matrix okay

01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:19,020
skip broadcasting deniable that why do I

01:54:16,540 --> 01:54:23,680
have this oh sorry I do have this

01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:30,910
transposing takes a matrix books on a

01:54:23,680 --> 01:54:32,980
side right subtraction can the same as

01:54:30,910 --> 01:54:34,480
that pair element-wise subtraction

01:54:32,980 --> 01:54:36,280
memorize it

01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:40,720
same as addition just take me

01:54:36,280 --> 01:54:43,090
appropriate one away I didn't draw this

01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:46,780
one properly I just didn't have just in

01:54:43,090 --> 01:54:49,270
dirt you can figure out division same as

01:54:46,780 --> 01:54:52,360
normal he's kind of take that divided by

01:54:49,270 --> 01:54:53,620
that that one divided by that one it's

01:54:52,360 --> 01:54:58,210
kind of element-wise it kind of goes

01:54:53,620 --> 01:55:00,460
that way you're not just multiplied by

01:54:58,210 --> 01:55:03,600
constant all the way through but

01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:06,010
multiplies all of it together and then

01:55:03,600 --> 01:55:08,680
you don't do what's called multi element

01:55:06,010 --> 01:55:12,640
wise multiplication which is 1 times 2

01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:16,270
and this one is 2 times 3 just 6 3 times

01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:17,890
4 12 4 times 5 20 but I want to quickly

01:55:16,270 --> 01:55:20,200
go through these and you're gonna go

01:55:17,890 --> 01:55:23,050
through some examples in tensorflow or

01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:23,770
you have this in your head and then you

01:55:23,050 --> 01:55:26,290
can add you're going through the

01:55:23,770 --> 01:55:31,330
examples intensified it's sort of stuff

01:55:26,290 --> 01:55:32,200
hopefully will will go through and you

01:55:31,330 --> 01:55:35,170
also have this thing called the dot

01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:38,950
products which allows you to do kind of

01:55:35,170 --> 01:55:41,260
like a zipping up maybe that's the best

01:55:38,950 --> 01:55:44,440
way of describing it so if you've got

01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:46,600
two ones of the opposite shapes you can

01:55:44,440 --> 01:55:49,720
kind of zip through so all of this row

01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:51,400
plus all multiplied and then plus all of

01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:54,940
that row and add it up together is equal

01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:57,900
to that and that equals that goes that

01:55:54,940 --> 01:55:57,900
way dot products

01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:03,640
no I see on examples I'm going to show

01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:05,530
you now is have to do all of those

01:56:03,640 --> 01:56:16,770
intensive flow because you don't need to

01:56:05,530 --> 01:56:19,770
know that so open up no tip 10a ah man

01:56:16,770 --> 01:56:19,770
wait

01:56:20,710 --> 01:56:30,710
yes okay okay in this file you're gonna

01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:33,260
just see these things called quiz under

01:56:30,710 --> 01:56:39,530
the quiz you're gonna see the single

01:56:33,260 --> 01:56:41,990
answer don't scroll to the answer give

01:56:39,530 --> 01:56:44,180
it a go it's just just try to think I'm

01:56:41,990 --> 01:56:46,370
mad just just give it a go try it out

01:56:44,180 --> 01:56:48,790
right don't scroll all the way to the

01:56:46,370 --> 01:56:48,790
answer Oh

01:56:55,900 --> 01:56:59,250
I'm just going to stop

01:56:59,910 --> 01:57:06,400
copying these into my main in fact I

01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:07,870
will just get rid of all of this okay so

01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:12,700
this how you create a one-dimensional

01:57:07,870 --> 01:57:15,280
array a 1d tensor in tensor flow certeyn

01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:19,210
once you want you to attend to flow all

01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:20,590
that tensor is is just a race right you

01:57:19,210 --> 01:57:23,620
can have a scalar which is kind of one

01:57:20,590 --> 01:57:27,030
value this is a 1d tensor which is what

01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:29,470
you'd normally call just like an array a

01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:32,290
2d a second rank tensor is a

01:57:29,470 --> 01:57:34,090
two-dimensional array then you get three

01:57:32,290 --> 01:57:35,910
third dimensional fourth dimensional

01:57:34,090 --> 01:57:41,560
fifth dimensional signal you can go

01:57:35,910 --> 01:57:44,470
crazy deep in terms of dimensions and it

01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:47,440
gets really hard to visualize so that's

01:57:44,470 --> 01:57:52,560
why using something called rank and

01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:57,060
shape is useful so if I now print this

01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:57,060
what you'll see is Oh

01:58:00,940 --> 01:58:07,830
why they're not printing the rank and

01:58:04,540 --> 01:58:07,830
the shape

01:58:10,430 --> 01:58:13,430
console.log

01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:31,260
I don't know why that's not printing out

01:58:28,610 --> 01:58:37,860
can I see well let's not print oh yeah

01:58:31,260 --> 01:58:39,660
this printing out just above oh sorry it

01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:42,900
is printing out so this shape the rank

01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:44,340
is one because it's 1d and the shape is

01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:46,590
three because just the length of three

01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:48,060
it's just the 1d array with the length

01:58:46,590 --> 01:58:52,170
of three so it tells you the shape and

01:58:48,060 --> 01:58:54,210
then what you can do is a dot print you

01:58:52,170 --> 01:58:55,980
can't do console.log a and annoying

01:58:54,210 --> 01:59:00,630
whether you go to a dot print and that

01:58:55,980 --> 01:59:02,280
prints you out kind of a visual look at

01:59:00,630 --> 01:59:04,170
the tensor if you are printing something

01:59:02,280 --> 01:59:05,790
crazy long a dot print is nice because

01:59:04,170 --> 01:59:10,040
it only prints some of it it doesn't

01:59:05,790 --> 01:59:10,040
kill your console that's why it's useful

01:59:13,710 --> 01:59:20,950
if you do want to make it kind of

01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:23,890
clearer you can just you know say ten to

01:59:20,950 --> 01:59:25,150
one D and it will try or give you an

01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:27,610
error if you give it something other

01:59:25,150 --> 01:59:31,000
than one B if you don't provide the one

01:59:27,610 --> 01:59:32,880
day it will try and figure out what it

01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:34,410
is from the day that you're giving it

01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:37,890
okay

01:59:34,410 --> 01:59:37,890
the other thing

01:59:44,909 --> 01:59:48,210
and then you can give it like a

01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:53,760
different shape so now we're gonna give

01:59:48,210 --> 02:00:00,449
it a 2d array there do you know what I'm

01:59:53,760 --> 02:00:03,210
gonna just paste it here okay then so

02:00:00,449 --> 02:00:09,510
now I'm giving you a 2d two-dimensional

02:00:03,210 --> 02:00:12,120
array 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 so this is

02:00:09,510 --> 02:00:13,290
a rank 2 because it's 2 dimensional this

02:00:12,120 --> 02:00:14,760
helps so we're only being with 2

02:00:13,290 --> 02:00:17,639
dimensionals right now so it's useful

02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:23,360
when you do it with 3 4 or 5 you need to

02:00:17,639 --> 02:00:25,650
know this stuff and the shape is 2x2 2x2

02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:26,280
but when you print 2 hours printing out

02:00:25,650 --> 02:00:29,820
like that

02:00:26,280 --> 02:00:34,159
less tensors let me open up on the other

02:00:29,820 --> 02:00:34,159
screen so I can just copy and pastes

02:00:36,280 --> 02:00:40,130
[Music]

02:00:38,199 --> 02:00:41,809
another way you can do it is you can

02:00:40,130 --> 02:00:45,770
just give it a flat you can give it as

02:00:41,809 --> 02:00:47,599
one two three four just as a 1d array

02:00:45,770 --> 02:00:48,980
and then you can say actually I'm going

02:00:47,599 --> 02:00:53,989
to give you as a flat array but the

02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:55,369
actual shape is two by two you can do

02:00:53,989 --> 02:00:56,929
that way if you want and that's useful

02:00:55,369 --> 02:00:59,360
very useful especially when you're

02:00:56,929 --> 02:01:02,030
loading of tons of data and you're

02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:05,690
stored it as one CSV file and you can

02:01:02,030 --> 02:01:07,789
load it up and go here it is by the way

02:01:05,690 --> 02:01:09,770
this is the actual n shape don't bother

02:01:07,789 --> 02:01:11,480
you'd have to reformat it into the right

02:01:09,770 --> 02:01:19,099
shape before you give it anything you go

02:01:11,480 --> 02:01:25,989
it's just on that now we have a quiz now

02:01:19,099 --> 02:01:32,929
we have a quiz yes we have a quiz right

02:01:25,989 --> 02:01:38,539
make a oh no answers don't go to the

02:01:32,929 --> 02:01:41,719
answers make a rank one tensor of four

02:01:38,539 --> 02:01:45,199
five six and by rank 1 tensor which is

02:01:41,719 --> 02:01:48,500
the 1d array 406 and then a rank two

02:01:45,199 --> 02:01:51,650
tensor look how that's laid out four

02:01:48,500 --> 02:01:55,820
five six what does that mean call them

02:01:51,650 --> 02:02:00,520
four five six then a rank three tensor

02:01:55,820 --> 02:02:05,869
three dimensional what yeah rank three

02:02:00,520 --> 02:02:10,210
or Fuzzle oh my god four or five six

02:02:05,869 --> 02:02:15,780
that way look at those brackets

02:02:10,210 --> 02:02:15,780
insane right try to out

02:04:23,550 --> 02:04:26,689
[Music]

02:05:11,599 --> 02:05:14,900
all right

02:05:15,719 --> 02:05:25,860
I'm gonna go for it let's give it a go

02:05:18,519 --> 02:05:25,860
oh maybe maybe I'll give you a second

02:06:27,910 --> 02:06:32,890
all right let's go let's go for it

02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:42,219
all right so we have

02:06:44,740 --> 02:06:52,540
so the question was let me copy and

02:06:46,930 --> 02:06:55,720
paste the question make a rank make a

02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:56,770
Rank 1 tensor four five six let's try

02:06:55,720 --> 02:07:00,490
that there's a couple different ways you

02:06:56,770 --> 02:07:04,660
can do that you can just just type out

02:07:00,490 --> 02:07:11,140
of this four by six pretty simple let's

02:07:04,660 --> 02:07:14,620
print it out as well five six boom boom

02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:18,610
four five six there you go simple simple

02:07:14,620 --> 02:07:19,960
is you can do other ways you can hit

02:07:18,610 --> 02:07:26,710
font if you want to do you could do 1d

02:07:19,960 --> 02:07:28,420
and a bit bit bit bit bit of a that's

02:07:26,710 --> 02:07:29,710
not ten it's not type-checking it's kind

02:07:28,420 --> 02:07:33,430
of its kind of type checking but not

02:07:29,710 --> 02:07:38,170
really or if you didn't really want to

02:07:33,430 --> 02:07:41,190
be completely specific you could then

02:07:38,170 --> 02:07:43,450
say give it a shape and the shape is

02:07:41,190 --> 02:07:48,010
three you want to be really specific

02:07:43,450 --> 02:07:52,300
write a rank two tensor so for that one

02:07:48,010 --> 02:07:55,630
you would basically do well you could

02:07:52,300 --> 02:07:58,960
literally just give it this all right

02:07:55,630 --> 02:08:01,899
I'm gonna figure the rest out or all

02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:04,369
right oh no it won't

02:08:01,899 --> 02:08:07,400
that way

02:08:04,369 --> 02:08:07,400
fingers crossed

02:08:08,579 --> 02:08:11,480
as I wanted

02:08:12,030 --> 02:08:18,430
yes I want it yeah four of six column

02:08:14,530 --> 02:08:20,980
four five six right but again you can

02:08:18,430 --> 02:08:24,460
see the shape there is three one okay

02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:26,890
three rows of one value in each row so

02:08:24,460 --> 02:08:34,170
if you wanted to you could be you could

02:08:26,890 --> 02:08:38,370
give it like this four five six with a

02:08:34,170 --> 02:08:39,760
3-1 give you that way

02:08:38,370 --> 02:08:46,900
same difference

02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:48,280
okay what the hell is this what's this

02:08:46,900 --> 02:08:51,390
oh my god

02:08:48,280 --> 02:08:51,390
let's give it go

02:08:52,769 --> 02:08:59,050
what is even this what does this even

02:08:56,380 --> 02:09:01,690
look like like how can you visualize

02:08:59,050 --> 02:09:03,459
this I haven't it's just another

02:09:01,690 --> 02:09:09,340
dimension I even visualize it it's

02:09:03,459 --> 02:09:16,739
insane basically this is it uh where I

02:09:09,340 --> 02:09:16,739
do one more

02:09:19,650 --> 02:09:25,260
a daughter my daughter was doing her

02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:27,390
homework the other day

02:09:25,260 --> 02:09:29,070
this starts just like to do a computer

02:09:27,390 --> 02:09:31,230
science like she's 13 so that it could

02:09:29,070 --> 02:09:37,860
be a science at school she's like I say

02:09:31,230 --> 02:09:41,300
oh what stopped working I looked at her

02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:44,040
and she'd like missed out some brackets

02:09:41,300 --> 02:09:45,660
and yeah missed up some brackets I don't

02:09:44,040 --> 02:09:49,440
know what I missed out the brackets

02:09:45,660 --> 02:09:51,030
she put the brackets in and it worked my

02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:53,420
wife's a program as well and I said I'll

02:09:51,030 --> 02:09:56,690
doors just got her first bracket Sarah

02:09:53,420 --> 02:10:00,150
right it's imagine that the first time

02:09:56,690 --> 02:10:03,570
it's right there rest of her life she's

02:10:00,150 --> 02:10:09,300
gonna get a million of those is there

02:10:03,570 --> 02:10:10,890
for the first time anyway so that's what

02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:13,080
it looks like but still like how do you

02:10:10,890 --> 02:10:15,990
visualize it it's kind of like how what

02:10:13,080 --> 02:10:17,460
does it even mean like um this is all

02:10:15,990 --> 02:10:23,970
the shapes getting become even more

02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:25,590
useful now because it's like three are

02:10:23,970 --> 02:10:29,750
they even columns I don't know to call

02:10:25,590 --> 02:10:33,660
them three thing Leia yeah three layers

02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:35,400
three Zed's it's like another thing so

02:10:33,660 --> 02:10:36,840
that's the shape three of something and

02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:38,670
then each of those things has one of

02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:42,020
something and each of those things has

02:10:38,670 --> 02:10:45,710
one of something right you have to start

02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:45,710
thinking in this way

02:10:47,470 --> 02:10:55,190
remember mobile net yeah I told you yeah

02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:58,100
melon that was fun times Neville there

02:10:55,190 --> 02:11:06,200
wasn't it yeah I was good stuff good

02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:07,960
stuff and then yeah and that's that okay

02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:11,500
you can do other things so you can

02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:11,500
transpose a matrix

02:11:13,070 --> 02:11:16,330
let's do it here

02:11:20,239 --> 02:11:25,910
what does three-dimensional matrix look

02:11:24,230 --> 02:11:28,310
like when it's transposed I don't know

02:11:25,910 --> 02:11:31,630
let's find out let's find out

02:11:28,310 --> 02:11:31,630
I know yeah

02:11:34,300 --> 02:11:37,710
it looks like that

02:11:40,969 --> 02:11:45,440
Wow yeah I feel if we did this in A to D

02:11:44,120 --> 02:11:49,100
thing that might make a little more

02:11:45,440 --> 02:11:51,340
sense you can visualize that a little

02:11:49,100 --> 02:11:51,340
bit better

02:11:54,890 --> 02:11:58,080
we're getting there I swear we're

02:11:57,180 --> 02:12:01,590
getting somewhere

02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:03,960
we're close right zip this is four five

02:12:01,590 --> 02:12:13,010
six would then go either way

02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:13,010
transpose you can add things together

02:12:15,979 --> 02:12:22,969
let's go here okay all right two tensors

02:12:20,869 --> 02:12:24,829
we all know what this is doing now this

02:12:22,969 --> 02:12:27,499
is turning this into a two dimensional

02:12:24,829 --> 02:12:29,179
tensor to the two and this isn't just

02:12:27,499 --> 02:12:33,709
another way of describing a two

02:12:29,179 --> 02:12:38,659
dimensional tensor we can add a add B

02:12:33,709 --> 02:12:40,610
and then print it out and that's it

02:12:38,659 --> 02:12:43,909
that's doing the element wise addition

02:12:40,610 --> 02:12:44,809
that we showed before we can also do

02:12:43,909 --> 02:12:47,239
something and this is kind of more

02:12:44,809 --> 02:12:50,749
tensor Fleury than anything else this is

02:12:47,239 --> 02:12:55,070
not problem matrix and multiplication

02:12:50,749 --> 02:12:58,760
but you can broad call you can use broad

02:12:55,070 --> 02:13:03,039
they're a little broadcast which is

02:12:58,760 --> 02:13:06,530
where if some data is missing it will

02:13:03,039 --> 02:13:08,869
extrapolate it extrapolate it repeat it

02:13:06,530 --> 02:13:12,530
for you automatically sand normally we

02:13:08,869 --> 02:13:14,989
doing addition you would and then a is a

02:13:12,530 --> 02:13:17,420
two-dimensional like one to four values

02:13:14,989 --> 02:13:20,570
the thing you add it to has to have four

02:13:17,420 --> 02:13:22,789
values we can just give it one value and

02:13:20,570 --> 02:13:25,969
it will go there I'll copy it four times

02:13:22,789 --> 02:13:28,449
it's called broadcasting we're going to

02:13:25,969 --> 02:13:33,190
use an example of that and that's what

02:13:28,449 --> 02:13:35,479
works that did that broadcast eight

02:13:33,190 --> 02:13:39,639
three eight four six last one should be

02:13:35,479 --> 02:13:39,639
ten yeah i broadcast it and

02:13:43,270 --> 02:13:49,960
you can also do subtraction as well as

02:13:46,010 --> 02:13:56,179
addition it's the same wage before so a

02:13:49,960 --> 02:13:57,050
subtract be the same as addition you can

02:13:56,179 --> 02:13:58,250
also do division

02:13:57,050 --> 02:14:06,039
I'm going to skip the out we're going to

02:13:58,250 --> 02:14:06,039
need it and then you can also multiply

02:14:06,250 --> 02:14:11,289
same ways do before multiply by constant

02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:25,450
a mole to print there we go

02:14:21,130 --> 02:14:32,180
multiplied and you can also

02:14:25,450 --> 02:14:32,180
[Music]

02:14:36,070 --> 02:14:40,850
multiplied by another matrix I think I'm

02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:45,130
gonna skip the rest I think this is all

02:14:40,850 --> 02:14:45,130
you need for this particular example

02:14:45,310 --> 02:14:50,570
this is doing the same thing is just

02:14:47,180 --> 02:14:52,850
before system e 1 times 2 then 2 times 3

02:14:50,570 --> 02:14:54,140
and 3 times 4 then 4 times 5 that's what

02:14:52,850 --> 02:14:56,469
should print out the last one should be

02:14:54,140 --> 02:14:56,469
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:05,170
I don't think we need to know do the

02:15:00,610 --> 02:15:06,580
rest okay hopefully if I if I skipped

02:15:05,170 --> 02:15:08,650
enough I skip the right stuff that

02:15:06,580 --> 02:15:10,360
should be all the matrix maths you need

02:15:08,650 --> 02:15:13,199
to know in order to do the rest of it

02:15:10,360 --> 02:15:13,199
all right

02:15:16,659 --> 02:15:19,320
all right

02:15:28,480 --> 02:15:40,309
i I'm just going to

02:15:37,270 --> 02:15:40,309
[Music]

02:15:43,460 --> 02:15:53,150
read read through this am i yeah I want

02:15:50,460 --> 02:15:53,150
to get to the point

02:15:59,749 --> 02:16:07,260
give me a second

02:16:02,709 --> 02:16:07,260
I've lost track of where I am

02:16:13,590 --> 02:16:19,050
yeah let me take it from

02:16:20,990 --> 02:16:27,070
yeah

02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:27,070
let me take the calculator loss

02:16:28,140 --> 02:16:34,450
if you take the calculate lost code to

02:16:31,960 --> 02:16:37,770
begin with now we are going to start

02:16:34,450 --> 02:16:37,770
doing some real tensorflow stuff

02:16:53,850 --> 02:16:57,060
are we

02:16:57,479 --> 02:17:01,889
I've seen loss

02:17:04,619 --> 02:17:12,279
no.not example I'm gonna mess this up

02:17:08,349 --> 02:17:14,529
I'm sorry I want to show you how to do

02:17:12,279 --> 02:17:16,330
linear regression and we'll go through

02:17:14,529 --> 02:17:18,580
it and then I'm gonna ask you to do

02:17:16,330 --> 02:17:20,199
polynomial regression yourself okay

02:17:18,580 --> 02:17:23,739
I'm gonna mess up some brackets at some

02:17:20,199 --> 02:17:25,029
point I don't trust myself right now I'm

02:17:23,739 --> 02:17:25,809
just gonna talk through the code I

02:17:25,029 --> 02:17:29,859
apologize

02:17:25,809 --> 02:17:31,059
well about apologize so this is

02:17:29,859 --> 02:17:32,949
basically the same code as we had before

02:17:31,059 --> 02:17:36,969
with the lots you can see we've got the

02:17:32,949 --> 02:17:38,710
get Y the norm X addy norm Y but we've

02:17:36,969 --> 02:17:42,399
now we've got this kind of other section

02:17:38,710 --> 02:17:44,080
with some tensorflow stuff but at the

02:17:42,399 --> 02:17:45,729
bottom we've got the same stuff account

02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:47,679
kinda got a mouse clicks we've got the

02:17:45,729 --> 02:17:49,800
drawing drawing the points on the screen

02:17:47,679 --> 02:17:51,849
they're drawing a line drawing the loss

02:17:49,800 --> 02:17:53,319
it's the same per as you have the

02:17:51,849 --> 02:17:55,210
calculus but we've got this kind of tend

02:17:53,319 --> 02:17:57,630
to flow a bit at the top what's that

02:17:55,210 --> 02:18:01,739
doing all right

02:17:57,630 --> 02:18:01,739
you create a suitable variables

02:18:07,069 --> 02:18:12,030
these are things that the variables they

02:18:10,500 --> 02:18:14,340
can they can change the things you want

02:18:12,030 --> 02:18:17,130
to change the a in the C right

02:18:14,340 --> 02:18:25,859
we initialize them with a random number

02:18:17,130 --> 02:18:27,780
this is our weight store node okay we

02:18:25,859 --> 02:18:31,319
then create what's called an optimizer

02:18:27,780 --> 02:18:36,769
this is the thing that choose the values

02:18:31,319 --> 02:18:39,090
of a and C we give a learning rate

02:18:36,769 --> 02:18:42,540
learning rate tells you tells you

02:18:39,090 --> 02:18:44,609
optimizer how quickly it should change

02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:49,410
or how large it should try and tune

02:18:44,609 --> 02:18:51,780
those numbers to get to the right value

02:18:49,410 --> 02:18:54,359
okay how what a big jump is gonna make

02:18:51,780 --> 02:18:55,710
so if you did not point five it's gonna

02:18:54,359 --> 02:18:57,090
maybe try and it's not gonna do not

02:18:55,710 --> 02:18:59,639
point five it may be all change each

02:18:57,090 --> 02:19:02,609
weight by not point five as you go down

02:18:59,639 --> 02:19:04,399
and that may be that will make you train

02:19:02,609 --> 02:19:07,469
faster but at the same time maybe you'll

02:19:04,399 --> 02:19:09,330
overshoot and grow you the side if you

02:19:07,469 --> 02:19:10,740
think about it right so normally you

02:19:09,330 --> 02:19:15,359
won't have a get a pretty slow learning

02:19:10,740 --> 02:19:16,800
rate like that okay that's the ideal

02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:20,189
thing to have I think I've got not point

02:19:16,800 --> 02:19:22,160
five there for some other reason if

02:19:20,189 --> 02:19:24,120
you're looking at tensorflow

02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:27,080
documentation there's lots of different

02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:27,080
ones you can use

02:19:30,590 --> 02:19:36,619
API or AP OSHA's a month

02:19:36,780 --> 02:19:47,070
let's go ahead am i there already I am

02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:51,590
there woody yes GD oh man they've

02:19:47,070 --> 02:19:51,590
changed the stalks train

02:19:53,400 --> 02:19:56,000
yep

02:20:00,110 --> 02:20:04,550
ours is proper tensorflow that's why

02:20:07,900 --> 02:20:12,000
yeah okay there we go

02:20:12,960 --> 02:20:18,070
there's lots of different types of those

02:20:16,630 --> 02:20:19,740
optimizers that you can use this is

02:20:18,070 --> 02:20:21,940
called stochastic gradient descent

02:20:19,740 --> 02:20:23,470
simple one that you can all be can try

02:20:21,940 --> 02:20:25,170
and use there's other ones there and you

02:20:23,470 --> 02:20:29,110
go through some of the other examples

02:20:25,170 --> 02:20:30,250
you can try using some of those for us

02:20:29,110 --> 02:20:33,420
right now we're just gonna use to cast

02:20:30,250 --> 02:20:33,420
the gradient gradient descent

02:20:38,270 --> 02:20:43,200
and then we've kind of got a predict

02:20:40,500 --> 02:20:45,899
which is basically just like get why but

02:20:43,200 --> 02:20:48,090
for tensorflow it's like get Y button

02:20:45,899 --> 02:20:50,130
get Y you could just pass in normal

02:20:48,090 --> 02:20:52,830
numbers but now we're dealing with tend

02:20:50,130 --> 02:20:58,110
to flows and tenses so we do that matrix

02:20:52,830 --> 02:21:02,640
multiplication a dot mole X it's the

02:20:58,110 --> 02:21:07,620
valleys it passing in add our C so a is

02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:09,780
this a X is actually going to be our

02:21:07,620 --> 02:21:12,030
full list of X's so it's basically like

02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:14,310
a matrix like an if you've got a hundred

02:21:12,030 --> 02:21:16,229
points I'd be a hundred you definitely

02:21:14,310 --> 02:21:18,360
passing in in one go but it's being a

02:21:16,229 --> 02:21:20,640
matrix multiplication and doing all

02:21:18,360 --> 02:21:22,830
those calculations at once in the

02:21:20,640 --> 02:21:26,100
predict function and what its going to

02:21:22,830 --> 02:21:26,670
give you it's going to give you an array

02:21:26,100 --> 02:21:28,350
of results

02:21:26,670 --> 02:21:31,320
that's what predict is going to give you

02:21:28,350 --> 02:21:35,060
for a given array of X's ten set of X's

02:21:31,320 --> 02:21:35,060
it's going to give you a tensor of Y's

02:21:35,300 --> 02:21:41,600
you do this this loss function again I'm

02:21:38,220 --> 02:21:41,600
that loss function we spoke about before

02:21:41,660 --> 02:21:49,110
given the predicted Y's subtract the

02:21:47,070 --> 02:21:51,630
actualize mean square I mean squared

02:21:49,110 --> 02:21:55,649
error this is how you do mean squared

02:21:51,630 --> 02:22:00,420
error intensive flood you've got an

02:21:55,649 --> 02:22:03,870
array of Y's my what you've calculated

02:22:00,420 --> 02:22:07,229
then you've got the actual Y's that you

02:22:03,870 --> 02:22:09,870
clicked you take one from the other you

02:22:07,229 --> 02:22:11,460
then get an array all the differences

02:22:09,870 --> 02:22:12,810
between those wise so I'm going positive

02:22:11,460 --> 02:22:15,390
so I'm gonna be negative so you square

02:22:12,810 --> 02:22:19,040
them it's made them more positive then

02:22:15,390 --> 02:22:21,660
you take the mean means greater right

02:22:19,040 --> 02:22:24,120
they think is just some just a way once

02:22:21,660 --> 02:22:26,939
you're dealing with tensors you can't

02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:32,011
eat me dot print to actually get the

02:22:26,939 --> 02:22:34,410
actual value inside it go use Data Sync

02:22:32,011 --> 02:22:38,790
and then this is the actual training

02:22:34,410 --> 02:22:45,601
thing this is where it gets tender

02:22:38,790 --> 02:22:48,150
framing tensive pretends to flowy so for

02:22:45,601 --> 02:22:53,730
a given number of iterations you want to

02:22:48,150 --> 02:22:55,591
go through go through all the X's the

02:22:53,730 --> 02:22:59,221
current iteration is a current epoch

02:22:55,591 --> 02:23:03,811
it's just a normal loop right

02:22:59,221 --> 02:23:05,061
I go to TR tally in a second you create

02:23:03,811 --> 02:23:07,891
tensor

02:23:05,061 --> 02:23:10,051
okaying a one dimensional tensor of all

02:23:07,891 --> 02:23:15,511
the x's that's all this is a one D

02:23:10,051 --> 02:23:17,851
tensor done before then we're doing a

02:23:15,511 --> 02:23:19,141
one D tensor of all the Y's it's just

02:23:17,851 --> 02:23:20,940
the normal X's and Y's that you've

02:23:19,141 --> 02:23:23,211
collected from the mouse clicks what are

02:23:20,940 --> 02:23:23,211
you doing

02:23:25,061 --> 02:23:38,110
I miss the whole section which is why

02:23:34,630 --> 02:23:42,670
this is going so fast I missed the whole

02:23:38,110 --> 02:23:44,891
section I really apologize let's go back

02:23:42,670 --> 02:23:46,480
rewind right rewind

02:23:44,891 --> 02:23:49,141
that's rewind I knew this is like I was

02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:51,610
like I haven't covered this how is this

02:23:49,141 --> 02:23:56,380
not normally like this okay

02:23:51,610 --> 02:24:01,601
I missed 11 I went straight to 12

02:23:56,380 --> 02:24:04,990
I missed 11 right do this

02:24:01,601 --> 02:24:08,490
okay let's go start from scratch again

02:24:04,990 --> 02:24:08,490
okay let's delete this

02:24:10,390 --> 02:24:18,050
that went from like zero to a hundred

02:24:14,199 --> 02:24:21,140
like straight that went so yeah I'm

02:24:18,050 --> 02:24:23,630
sorry it is gonna go from zero to two

02:24:21,140 --> 02:24:29,210
thirty though so y'all say that right

02:24:23,630 --> 02:24:32,750
now okay let's create ten supply a

02:24:29,210 --> 02:24:35,330
variable name it's a variable that's all

02:24:32,750 --> 02:24:38,779
it is something that has a value it has

02:24:35,330 --> 02:24:43,609
a value of four point one two we then

02:24:38,779 --> 02:24:49,000
can then create an array of one a 1d

02:24:43,609 --> 02:24:53,000
array five long of to tttt to do okay

02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:56,199
and then just like you saw before we can

02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:56,199
perform maths operations

02:24:57,340 --> 02:25:00,340
yeah

02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:10,740
the wise to do so two x x four point one

02:25:06,780 --> 02:25:14,521
two and you get the average of it right

02:25:10,740 --> 02:25:15,720
so that should be eight point two four

02:25:14,521 --> 02:25:16,950
eight point three four eight point three

02:25:15,720 --> 02:25:19,160
four eight point two four eight point

02:25:16,950 --> 02:25:22,740
two four you're the average of that

02:25:19,160 --> 02:25:23,790
should be a twenty four right yeah okay

02:25:22,740 --> 02:25:24,271
that's what that that's what that should

02:25:23,790 --> 02:25:30,660
print

02:25:24,271 --> 02:25:33,080
let's do res dot print wow I've really

02:25:30,660 --> 02:25:36,040
skipped ahead Ben did nine before okay

02:25:33,080 --> 02:25:39,609
if I do

02:25:36,040 --> 02:25:43,750
okay we're in the lecture today but

02:25:39,609 --> 02:25:46,350
numbers they go close enough

02:25:43,750 --> 02:25:46,350
a point ago

02:25:46,660 --> 02:25:55,480
I had to save that I did didn't I

02:25:49,650 --> 02:25:57,851
alright okay and yeah this is this is

02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:59,641
why I didn't why I said didn't to

02:25:57,851 --> 02:26:06,751
actually get the value of a tensor

02:25:59,641 --> 02:26:10,480
that's one we do res dot beta sync okay

02:26:06,751 --> 02:26:12,131
so that would return a floating point

02:26:10,480 --> 02:26:17,171
array and we're just getting the first

02:26:12,131 --> 02:26:19,351
value of it alright so let me ask you a

02:26:17,171 --> 02:26:19,351
question

02:26:20,689 --> 02:26:29,370
what what would the value we want to

02:26:25,229 --> 02:26:36,869
train something here so that the result

02:26:29,370 --> 02:26:41,079
of this here is zero yeah

02:26:36,869 --> 02:26:47,770
the result of this line here is zero

02:26:41,079 --> 02:26:53,259
rs.20 okay what does X have to be for

02:26:47,770 --> 02:26:57,789
that to give us zero zero right that's

02:26:53,259 --> 02:26:59,560
me zero I want to train this with tents

02:26:57,789 --> 02:27:02,140
if I want tend to flow to turn that into

02:26:59,560 --> 02:27:05,890
zero for me I want tend to pay to turn

02:27:02,140 --> 02:27:11,199
that into zero for me right that's what

02:27:05,890 --> 02:27:13,779
we want it to do so we create got I

02:27:11,199 --> 02:27:18,789
skipped so much ahead

02:27:13,779 --> 02:27:23,649
I was shocking since when we start using

02:27:18,789 --> 02:27:26,770
tensorflow okay so we create on

02:27:23,649 --> 02:27:28,419
optimizer if we just go straight like

02:27:26,770 --> 02:27:31,719
that okay

02:27:28,419 --> 02:27:36,609
Creon optimizer oh sorry

02:27:31,719 --> 02:27:41,699
it's built it wrong no no optimizer we

02:27:36,609 --> 02:27:41,699
start off with that and we're gonna call

02:27:41,789 --> 02:27:46,869
first thing I want to do is I'm going to

02:27:43,509 --> 02:27:49,379
print out the value of x yeah let's

02:27:46,869 --> 02:27:49,379
print out twice

02:27:52,590 --> 02:27:59,279
and in between that I wanna call

02:27:56,250 --> 02:28:01,670
optimiser but minimize I'm gonna explain

02:27:59,279 --> 02:28:06,899
this in a second okay

02:28:01,670 --> 02:28:10,649
all right so prints out X it should be

02:28:06,899 --> 02:28:13,710
four point one two we want it to we want

02:28:10,649 --> 02:28:15,960
the optimizer to minimize some value for

02:28:13,710 --> 02:28:18,060
us right minimize the loss this is

02:28:15,960 --> 02:28:20,540
always we always want to loss to be less

02:28:18,060 --> 02:28:24,540
a lost number to be less will minimize

02:28:20,540 --> 02:28:26,390
minimizing a lot always we pass in a

02:28:24,540 --> 02:28:30,689
function and that function is basically

02:28:26,390 --> 02:28:34,229
going to return it's going to be a

02:28:30,689 --> 02:28:37,590
tensor so it's gonna be wise okay it's a

02:28:34,229 --> 02:28:45,149
tensor here multiply it by X X is a

02:28:37,590 --> 02:28:47,279
variable mean square right so if that's

02:28:45,149 --> 02:28:48,510
the same as always squares as well but

02:28:47,279 --> 02:28:55,590
anyway that's the same as essentially

02:28:48,510 --> 02:28:57,359
this tensorflow knows this isn't this

02:28:55,590 --> 02:28:59,069
isn't returning an equation this is Rick

02:28:57,359 --> 02:29:02,279
this is returning like the description

02:28:59,069 --> 02:29:04,020
of an equation and it knows that X is a

02:29:02,279 --> 02:29:05,310
variable so it knows it's not going to

02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:07,649
try and change anything in the Y's

02:29:05,310 --> 02:29:09,329
because the Y's is just the tensor it's

02:29:07,649 --> 02:29:11,640
going to try and optimize those values

02:29:09,329 --> 02:29:15,449
it knows that you're returning that

02:29:11,640 --> 02:29:17,550
you're giving it an equation where one

02:29:15,449 --> 02:29:22,109
of them is a variable so it knows that

02:29:17,550 --> 02:29:25,100
it can only tune the variable right

02:29:22,109 --> 02:29:25,100
that's what it knows

02:29:25,650 --> 02:29:34,360
and it's gonna try and tune it so that

02:29:29,100 --> 02:29:36,430
it gets sort of the y's become zero

02:29:34,360 --> 02:29:40,330
because if the y's become zero then

02:29:36,430 --> 02:29:42,040
that's the lowest working actually go

02:29:40,330 --> 02:29:45,340
negative actually but that's why we

02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:47,460
square it so I'm going negative so what

02:29:45,340 --> 02:29:50,729
does this show here so if we now go into

02:29:47,460 --> 02:30:03,870
here you can see there you go

02:29:50,729 --> 02:30:07,810
4.2 4.0 9/10 to flow changed value of X

02:30:03,870 --> 02:30:10,660
all by itself all by itself because it

02:30:07,810 --> 02:30:14,170
new is trying to trying to minimize it

02:30:10,660 --> 02:30:18,100
hates loss just trying to minimize a

02:30:14,170 --> 02:30:25,750
loss if you change its learning rate to

02:30:18,100 --> 02:30:29,020
like five whoa it went completely the

02:30:25,750 --> 02:30:30,160
other direction right that's why it's

02:30:29,020 --> 02:30:34,650
been that's what the learning rates all

02:30:30,160 --> 02:30:38,380
about if you change it to be like that

02:30:34,650 --> 02:30:41,550
you change it only a tiny I didn't

02:30:38,380 --> 02:30:41,550
change at all that's too much

02:30:41,680 --> 02:30:45,710
ain't it tiny tiny amount right so the

02:30:44,659 --> 02:30:47,960
learning rate is important they're

02:30:45,710 --> 02:30:51,109
learning it learning rates small you're

02:30:47,960 --> 02:30:52,640
gonna slowly slowly slowly slowly sort

02:30:51,109 --> 02:30:54,409
of get the right answer but it's gonna

02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:56,449
take you a while to get there the

02:30:54,409 --> 02:30:58,699
learning rate is too big you're gonna

02:30:56,449 --> 02:31:00,859
zoom past but then probably overshoot

02:30:58,699 --> 02:31:08,120
and go to the size that's choosing a

02:31:00,859 --> 02:31:15,170
good learning rate is an important well

02:31:08,120 --> 02:31:17,060
yeah yeah it would go negative - yeah

02:31:15,170 --> 02:31:25,939
which is why we square it to make it

02:31:17,060 --> 02:31:26,989
well yeah worry square it yeah okay well

02:31:25,939 --> 02:31:31,399
that's not really that useful because

02:31:26,989 --> 02:31:34,069
you're only running it once we need to

02:31:31,399 --> 02:31:35,359
keep on doing this until it gets to

02:31:34,069 --> 02:31:38,330
where you want it to be and all we do is

02:31:35,359 --> 02:31:45,109
wrap it in a loop that's it we just do

02:31:38,330 --> 02:31:46,550
it we just do this loads and so this is

02:31:45,109 --> 02:31:50,170
what I'm gonna do a for loop like

02:31:46,550 --> 02:31:50,170
totally wrong Oh have I got a thingy

02:31:51,449 --> 02:32:00,590
why is it not am i messing up tab

02:31:57,590 --> 02:32:00,590
Wow

02:32:02,580 --> 02:32:09,840
yeah the Oscar I'll just copy paste my

02:32:07,090 --> 02:32:09,840
little screen here

02:32:10,330 --> 02:32:16,180
nice added too much code who needs that

02:32:14,119 --> 02:32:20,149
much code still need that much code and

02:32:16,180 --> 02:32:21,529
then there alright so I'm just gonna run

02:32:20,149 --> 02:32:23,569
it a thousand times I'm just doing

02:32:21,529 --> 02:32:25,970
exactly the same optimizer thing but

02:32:23,569 --> 02:32:26,529
warning get a thousand times that's all

02:32:25,970 --> 02:32:28,640
I'm doing

02:32:26,529 --> 02:32:31,540
and so what it's going to do is it's

02:32:28,640 --> 02:32:34,970
just gonna try and tune that number x

02:32:31,540 --> 02:32:37,909
over that period of time so now you can

02:32:34,970 --> 02:32:41,090
see let's try this let me refresh and

02:32:37,909 --> 02:32:44,080
see it's tuning it remember for this was

02:32:41,090 --> 02:32:46,520
a thousand oh my god

02:32:44,080 --> 02:32:49,430
it's gonna get to zero so let's now

02:32:46,520 --> 02:32:54,020
choose something like that maybe we'll

02:32:49,430 --> 02:32:57,649
go faster see it's pretty it's gone it's

02:32:54,020 --> 02:33:02,050
pretty much gone to zero but eighteen

02:32:57,649 --> 02:33:02,050
decimal places right I was pretty fast

02:33:02,210 --> 02:33:08,250
that's all the tents those doing for us

02:33:04,290 --> 02:33:10,979
I said we tell it some variables we give

02:33:08,250 --> 02:33:14,580
it some data we wrap it all in matrices

02:33:10,979 --> 02:33:16,949
and tensors and it then goes okay what's

02:33:14,580 --> 02:33:18,659
your loss function alright whatever I'm

02:33:16,949 --> 02:33:20,100
just going to try and minimize the

02:33:18,659 --> 02:33:22,920
variable change of variables so that

02:33:20,100 --> 02:33:26,779
this loss is elite is the less it could

02:33:22,920 --> 02:33:26,779
be there's at least it could be right

02:33:26,870 --> 02:33:32,760
[Music]

02:33:28,460 --> 02:33:36,390
okay one thing to note though one thing

02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:38,069
we're kind of very very very used to in

02:33:36,390 --> 02:33:43,080
JavaScript's is you never have to worry

02:33:38,069 --> 02:33:45,600
about memory ever we just know that when

02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:46,880
we create something in JavaScript it

02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:50,479
takes up some memory on your computer

02:33:46,880 --> 02:33:54,060
but javascript knows at some point later

02:33:50,479 --> 02:33:59,960
to release that memory back out right we

02:33:54,060 --> 02:33:59,960
know that right however tensorflow uses

02:34:00,409 --> 02:34:07,170
your GPU your graphics card and your

02:34:05,279 --> 02:34:09,330
computer screen interesting actually how

02:34:07,170 --> 02:34:13,620
graphics cards work what they allowed

02:34:09,330 --> 02:34:18,689
you to kind of parallel arise all that's

02:34:13,620 --> 02:34:20,420
going on in an easy way however your

02:34:18,689 --> 02:34:22,680
graphics card it doesn't it can't

02:34:20,420 --> 02:34:24,140
javascript can't then it just doesn't

02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:26,939
know when something's not in use anymore

02:34:24,140 --> 02:34:28,770
so it doesn't know to free up memory so

02:34:26,939 --> 02:34:30,779
this actually right now has a memory

02:34:28,770 --> 02:34:32,970
leak and for kept on running this we'd

02:34:30,779 --> 02:34:34,500
run out a memory on the computer so what

02:34:32,970 --> 02:34:36,239
you need to do is use a wrap all your

02:34:34,500 --> 02:34:44,000
tensorflow code is something called TF

02:34:36,239 --> 02:34:44,000
tidy like this and like this all right

02:34:51,190 --> 02:35:00,650
what I'd done our brackets errors what

02:34:58,250 --> 02:35:03,460
we're done there I'm just going to keep

02:35:00,650 --> 02:35:05,330
one yeah there you go

02:35:03,460 --> 02:35:07,790
so what this is going to do is it's just

02:35:05,330 --> 02:35:11,721
going to tell tens up low whenever this

02:35:07,790 --> 02:35:13,090
function ends just delete whatever it is

02:35:11,721 --> 02:35:17,480
just to leave all those tensors

02:35:13,090 --> 02:35:20,860
automatically alright and that's what TF

02:35:17,480 --> 02:35:25,340
will tidy he's doing and that's it

02:35:20,860 --> 02:35:29,320
that's densified all right that's what's

02:35:25,340 --> 02:35:32,721
going on when you're using the optimizer

02:35:29,320 --> 02:35:35,990
it's just changing if it detects a

02:35:32,721 --> 02:35:38,240
variable in an equation it's going to

02:35:35,990 --> 02:35:42,290
try and optimize it giving some data and

02:35:38,240 --> 02:35:43,851
loss function all right let's go back to

02:35:42,290 --> 02:35:48,830
where we were before then all right

02:35:43,851 --> 02:35:51,400
hopefully now you've got some headspace

02:35:48,830 --> 02:35:51,400
there so

02:35:52,961 --> 02:36:01,680
I am outside the

02:35:57,180 --> 02:36:01,680
[Music]

02:36:01,710 --> 02:36:11,100
ah no no I think here sit here it's okay

02:36:05,400 --> 02:36:13,050
because it's outside you could do it

02:36:11,100 --> 02:36:15,680
inside I suppose but nothing you need to

02:36:13,050 --> 02:36:18,630
because you don't need to free it up

02:36:15,680 --> 02:36:22,110
this is kind of like at this point

02:36:18,630 --> 02:36:24,090
whatever there is delete it I don't

02:36:22,110 --> 02:36:27,290
think this is nearly rash maybe this is

02:36:24,090 --> 02:36:27,290
creating a separate tensor

02:36:32,001 --> 02:36:37,030
maybe

02:36:34,490 --> 02:36:37,030
maybe

02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:46,340
now let's grab all this okay so I'm

02:36:45,500 --> 02:36:47,779
gonna go through this again

02:36:46,340 --> 02:36:48,739
and then we're gonna go into polynomials

02:36:47,779 --> 02:36:54,310
and you're gonna do all that yourself

02:36:48,739 --> 02:36:56,810
right here we go back here a and C

02:36:54,310 --> 02:37:00,319
they're variables now because we want

02:36:56,810 --> 02:37:02,960
tensorflow to tune them right variables

02:37:00,319 --> 02:37:04,870
10 slow Tunes variables we create

02:37:02,960 --> 02:37:10,130
optimizer you've seen us before all

02:37:04,870 --> 02:37:12,949
right I'm going to train this optimizer

02:37:10,130 --> 02:37:15,409
I'm going to go through a loop number of

02:37:12,949 --> 02:37:20,779
iterations see if that IV there it is

02:37:15,409 --> 02:37:24,260
again we're going to get the X's and Y's

02:37:20,779 --> 02:37:26,029
that we've already stored and call

02:37:24,260 --> 02:37:28,370
optimize what minimize and it's going to

02:37:26,029 --> 02:37:31,100
try and minimize whatever this value is

02:37:28,370 --> 02:37:32,989
here whatever this returns is going to

02:37:31,100 --> 02:37:35,270
try and minimize that whatever that is

02:37:32,989 --> 02:37:38,270
so what do we get so we've got the

02:37:35,270 --> 02:37:40,430
actual wise from the things what are the

02:37:38,270 --> 02:37:44,090
predicted wise and that's just calling

02:37:40,430 --> 02:37:50,239
get Y now that kind of a get y is equal

02:37:44,090 --> 02:37:52,970
to MX plus ay Y is equal to ax plus C

02:37:50,239 --> 02:37:56,540
that's all this is doing given an array

02:37:52,970 --> 02:37:59,060
of X's give us an array wise okay that's

02:37:56,540 --> 02:38:00,529
not predicted wise then now we've got a

02:37:59,060 --> 02:38:03,170
predicted wise and actual wise we can

02:38:00,529 --> 02:38:04,640
get our loss and the list is that like

02:38:03,170 --> 02:38:08,149
the kind of mean squared error you saw

02:38:04,640 --> 02:38:10,010
it before you take them away all right

02:38:08,149 --> 02:38:14,771
and you want this to be as lost that the

02:38:10,010 --> 02:38:17,520
least loss as possible okay

02:38:14,771 --> 02:38:20,680
and that's it

02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:26,350
that's all it's doing and it's going to

02:38:20,680 --> 02:38:30,609
change the values of a and C repeatedly

02:38:26,350 --> 02:38:33,310
one free throws and truck and then tune

02:38:30,609 --> 02:38:35,830
it that's all I'm doing here is I'm

02:38:33,310 --> 02:38:38,350
getting the value of a and C out of it

02:38:35,830 --> 02:38:39,850
and then that's actually used you'd have

02:38:38,350 --> 02:38:51,010
to look at it if you look and draw a

02:38:39,850 --> 02:38:53,350
line oh yeah she's in get Y and that's

02:38:51,010 --> 02:38:55,630
using a and C - let's change the values

02:38:53,350 --> 02:38:58,000
a and C just the drawing function and

02:38:55,630 --> 02:39:00,160
the last thing you need to know is TF

02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:02,350
that next frame it's running in the

02:39:00,160 --> 02:39:04,899
browser so if you're running any kind of

02:39:02,350 --> 02:39:07,330
mathematical stuff in the browser it's

02:39:04,899 --> 02:39:09,370
just going to mmm take up all the CPU

02:39:07,330 --> 02:39:12,460
and it's not going to be able to have a

02:39:09,370 --> 02:39:15,910
chance to draw anything so next frame

02:39:12,460 --> 02:39:16,630
does it just goes now I've done

02:39:15,910 --> 02:39:19,210
something

02:39:16,630 --> 02:39:22,630
let yourself draw something on the page

02:39:19,210 --> 02:39:24,279
and let me do another iteration to the

02:39:22,630 --> 02:39:28,359
loop so that's just that's just for that

02:39:24,279 --> 02:39:31,569
that's what next frame does right so if

02:39:28,359 --> 02:39:37,710
I now ran this in the browser

02:39:31,569 --> 02:39:37,710
yeah fill that fresh the page

02:39:42,320 --> 02:39:55,090
Booya this is now that movement that

02:39:48,800 --> 02:39:58,521
animation is seeing right now that is

02:39:55,090 --> 02:40:01,580
ten slow learning each time it adjusts

02:39:58,521 --> 02:40:03,410
the value of a and C it moves it and

02:40:01,580 --> 02:40:05,710
these are the iterations that are still

02:40:03,410 --> 02:40:05,710
running

02:40:07,080 --> 02:40:09,800
all right

02:40:16,860 --> 02:40:23,180
I'm the mobile that

02:40:19,780 --> 02:40:26,510
mobile net was good wasn't it yeah

02:40:23,180 --> 02:40:30,080
sometimes a mobile net right

02:40:26,510 --> 02:40:33,440
I know zoomed into that but hopefully

02:40:30,080 --> 02:40:36,070
that should be enough information to do

02:40:33,440 --> 02:40:42,230
them to do the next challenge for you

02:40:36,070 --> 02:40:46,910
okay we have another type of let me get

02:40:42,230 --> 02:40:50,110
the there's a file called polynomial

02:40:46,910 --> 02:40:50,110
solution don't open it

02:40:53,011 --> 02:41:02,431
okay a curve there's another equation to

02:40:58,711 --> 02:41:07,230
describe a curved line a line with a cut

02:41:02,431 --> 02:41:09,621
curved line a curved curved line that's

02:41:07,230 --> 02:41:09,621
just stupid

02:41:09,771 --> 02:41:19,501
drum with this one then remember this y

02:41:13,621 --> 02:41:22,261
is equal to MX squared but I put ax

02:41:19,501 --> 02:41:25,711
squared plus BX plus C slightly more

02:41:22,261 --> 02:41:28,190
complicated but that's what describes a

02:41:25,711 --> 02:41:32,011
curve right

02:41:28,190 --> 02:41:36,570
oshizu and say if looking on the screen

02:41:32,011 --> 02:41:38,610
this is the same one this is the

02:41:36,570 --> 02:41:40,681
polynomial version you can see it's

02:41:38,610 --> 02:41:43,671
drawing a line drawing a curve oh my god

02:41:40,681 --> 02:41:43,671
strong a curve

02:41:45,980 --> 02:41:51,590
but still the same thing as before is

02:41:48,390 --> 02:41:55,140
it's just you're giving it some data

02:41:51,590 --> 02:41:57,870
you've you've not just got a and see

02:41:55,140 --> 02:42:00,601
you've got a B and C but three variables

02:41:57,870 --> 02:42:03,390
a B C not just a and C because you need

02:42:00,601 --> 02:42:06,570
to be as well and so what I want you to

02:42:03,390 --> 02:42:09,660
do is we just start off copy the code

02:42:06,570 --> 02:42:13,320
from 13 up on a polynomial regression

02:42:09,660 --> 02:42:16,320
start copy all that into your main dot j

02:42:13,320 --> 02:42:19,851
s well this whole bunch of commented out

02:42:16,320 --> 02:42:22,851
curl the bottom there yeah anyway and

02:42:19,851 --> 02:42:22,851
here

02:42:26,610 --> 02:42:36,130
bless you out for polynomial I put some

02:42:31,420 --> 02:42:36,910
clues in what some clues in to do if you

02:42:36,130 --> 02:42:39,311
see it to do

02:42:36,910 --> 02:42:42,101
you've probably got to do something to

02:42:39,311 --> 02:42:44,970
do tents

02:42:42,101 --> 02:42:53,170
I'm back spelling is terrible ten so for

02:42:44,970 --> 02:42:55,601
to do alright to do if only life funny

02:42:53,170 --> 02:42:59,820
life was like this funny and you're

02:42:55,601 --> 02:43:01,870
given work to do at work to put two dues

02:42:59,820 --> 02:43:04,570
Norma know you've got to figure stuff

02:43:01,870 --> 02:43:04,960
out in life I've put to do is everywhere

02:43:04,570 --> 02:43:06,730
for you

02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:11,370
there's just a couple places for to dues

02:43:06,730 --> 02:43:11,370
is it give it a go

02:43:12,601 --> 02:43:17,370
OSHA's all this should be it to do

02:43:17,580 --> 02:43:22,580
[Applause]

02:43:19,960 --> 02:43:25,190
okay don't forget that one as if there's

02:43:22,580 --> 02:43:27,280
a spare to do at the top line 30 to do

02:43:25,190 --> 02:43:30,260
also

02:43:27,280 --> 02:43:31,580
but everything else here is enough to

02:43:30,260 --> 02:43:32,900
give you the curve so you don't you

02:43:31,580 --> 02:43:35,240
don't forget anything else so just flesh

02:43:32,900 --> 02:43:38,180
the rest out and you can see here but a

02:43:35,240 --> 02:43:45,010
little bit more going on alright give

02:43:38,180 --> 02:43:48,039
that a go five minutes telling us

02:43:45,010 --> 02:43:49,270
I have a vague memory that every time I

02:43:48,039 --> 02:43:53,579
give this there's something I've

02:43:49,270 --> 02:43:57,699
forgotten on here which I then pretend

02:43:53,579 --> 02:44:03,999
was a trick question to keep you all on

02:43:57,699 --> 02:44:06,119
your toes so we'll see maybe is a trick

02:44:03,999 --> 02:44:06,119
question

02:47:05,860 --> 02:47:14,620
well while you're doing that I'm going

02:47:08,300 --> 02:47:14,620
to turn myself into it into a meme okay

02:48:29,130 --> 02:48:31,160
ah

02:48:58,030 --> 02:49:01,750
[Laughter]

02:49:04,330 --> 02:49:07,389
[Music]

02:49:28,730 --> 02:49:35,910
sorry say again yeah yeah yeah you can

02:49:34,980 --> 02:49:38,460
do it you can do that where you go you

02:49:35,910 --> 02:49:39,810
can do you can just play around or they

02:49:38,460 --> 02:49:43,080
start with a low one and if you don't if

02:49:39,810 --> 02:49:46,070
it's not converging pick a bigger one

02:49:43,080 --> 02:49:46,070
right down Oh

02:49:51,540 --> 02:49:56,220
no because you said that you're setting

02:49:53,399 --> 02:49:57,240
up the optimizer before you're running

02:49:56,220 --> 02:50:00,029
it through you could probably do

02:49:57,240 --> 02:50:03,500
something clever with batching or

02:50:00,029 --> 02:50:03,500
something like that bro yeah

02:50:03,930 --> 02:50:11,569
huh yeah yeah normal yeah yeah

02:50:16,761 --> 02:50:27,841
you don't know yet all right

02:50:23,690 --> 02:50:32,851
so some people want to chill so I'll

02:50:27,841 --> 02:50:44,041
just go through the answer let people go

02:50:32,851 --> 02:50:47,931
off do all that stuff all right okay I'm

02:50:44,041 --> 02:50:47,931
gonna go through the answer they all go

02:50:48,711 --> 02:50:55,141
we needn't need a variable ABC so much

02:50:52,711 --> 02:51:00,710
going to throw another one here let B

02:50:55,141 --> 02:51:06,471
equals two right

02:51:00,710 --> 02:51:10,910
my spelling is terrible so we need

02:51:06,471 --> 02:51:19,061
another way of calculating why is ax

02:51:10,910 --> 02:51:19,061
plus C sweet a times oh man I should

02:51:20,190 --> 02:51:29,891
plus B times I want to look prettier

02:51:24,671 --> 02:51:35,681
figure this out for me yes the a a

02:51:29,891 --> 02:51:41,740
squared plus BX plus C tensorflow needs

02:51:35,681 --> 02:51:50,440
another variable a b c okay it's going

02:51:41,740 --> 02:51:51,761
to tune another value there this is that

02:51:50,440 --> 02:51:53,320
it's probably the complex Warner he

02:51:51,761 --> 02:51:59,230
might go stuck on this in fact I can't

02:51:53,320 --> 02:52:01,480
remember all of this yeah which means

02:51:59,230 --> 02:52:04,771
another way of calculating that

02:52:01,480 --> 02:52:07,330
candidates this is the get y but for

02:52:04,771 --> 02:52:10,710
intensive flow world so how did you

02:52:07,330 --> 02:52:20,431
define that there's basically a

02:52:10,710 --> 02:52:27,730
multiplied x squared all right add Oh AB

02:52:20,431 --> 02:52:29,569
B multiply X let's see oh that's II kind

02:52:27,730 --> 02:52:36,270
of like

02:52:29,569 --> 02:52:41,729
tend to float up then how last thing

02:52:36,270 --> 02:52:46,140
want to do is just store it so it will

02:52:41,729 --> 02:52:51,589
then render on the page does that work I

02:52:46,140 --> 02:52:51,589
don't know let's see let's figure it out

02:52:52,829 --> 02:53:02,079
yeah they're working think it's working

02:52:57,270 --> 02:53:03,659
that's not working then we get that yeah

02:53:02,079 --> 02:53:11,909
we'll go ahead

02:53:03,659 --> 02:53:11,909
really yes I taught people tend to blow

02:53:12,869 --> 02:53:19,120
that's it

02:53:15,540 --> 02:53:21,550
there we go if you want to go and learn

02:53:19,120 --> 02:53:24,489
a bit more unfortunately I don't have it

02:53:21,550 --> 02:53:27,029
in a really good format but the very

02:53:24,489 --> 02:53:29,560
next thing if I was teaching this a

02:53:27,029 --> 02:53:35,920
longer version of this workshop you

02:53:29,560 --> 02:53:38,700
would go to the repo but the bitter

02:53:35,920 --> 02:53:38,700
bitter bitter bear

02:53:40,510 --> 02:53:50,439
No oh god jump straight into that maybe

02:53:44,570 --> 02:53:50,439
it was trying to it oh sure and NIST's

02:53:51,580 --> 02:53:57,040
was just the same thing em nests so me

02:53:54,860 --> 02:54:00,229
rate might be tough for you to follow

02:53:57,040 --> 02:54:01,790
without but like seeing it but he did

02:54:00,229 --> 02:54:05,479
the next thing i will show you is how to

02:54:01,790 --> 02:54:08,860
use em this is a data set where you can

02:54:05,479 --> 02:54:08,860
I'll show you

02:54:10,841 --> 02:54:19,580
so it's a dataset where you're gonna

02:54:12,980 --> 02:54:23,051
wear you can wear as eventually I'll

02:54:19,580 --> 02:54:23,051
finish my sentence

02:54:25,539 --> 02:54:33,609
shut up my here yeah hopefully I don't

02:54:30,529 --> 02:54:33,609
need to do anything

02:54:34,910 --> 02:54:39,840
okay this is the next example if you

02:54:38,940 --> 02:54:42,950
don't wanna learn it the next to the

02:54:39,840 --> 02:54:46,500
next step the next step whole step

02:54:42,950 --> 02:54:52,250
hopefully works doesn't look like it's

02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:52,250
working oh it's working yeah

02:54:52,740 --> 02:55:03,000
and this basically is training up to

02:54:58,770 --> 02:55:05,600
wrecking the is where you kind of pull a

02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:10,820
lot of stuff together and learn how to

02:55:05,600 --> 02:55:14,280
oh my god I am ruined right now

02:55:10,820 --> 02:55:16,380
recognize handwritten digits the M this

02:55:14,280 --> 02:55:18,960
data set is a famous data set of lots of

02:55:16,380 --> 02:55:20,070
lots of handwritten digits it's very

02:55:18,960 --> 02:55:22,260
open data set it's kind of a famous

02:55:20,070 --> 02:55:25,190
example and what this would allow you to

02:55:22,260 --> 02:55:28,440
do after it has finished working is

02:55:25,190 --> 02:55:30,479
right now it's training up on all tons

02:55:28,440 --> 02:55:32,010
and tons of images of handwritten digits

02:55:30,479 --> 02:55:38,870
learning how to recognize handwritten

02:55:32,010 --> 02:55:43,590
digits and then you can then use it I

02:55:38,870 --> 02:55:45,141
can make this faster wait because I'm

02:55:43,590 --> 02:55:50,721
using

02:55:45,141 --> 02:55:55,730
oh I know I'm doing the convolutional

02:55:50,721 --> 02:56:01,240
model dense model dense model

02:55:55,730 --> 02:56:01,240
okay let's try it on the same train

02:56:01,971 --> 02:56:07,480
yeah I'm using a simpler training model

02:56:10,271 --> 02:56:13,980
okay and you can put a number

02:56:17,351 --> 02:56:26,880
I'm off the bottom of the screen just

02:56:21,490 --> 02:56:26,880
how can I wait I know I'll trick it into

02:56:28,070 --> 02:56:31,631
how about that Hey

02:56:35,319 --> 02:56:43,279
it this is - you can't see it on the

02:56:40,130 --> 02:56:45,949
bottom but it's - its - right it's - and

02:56:43,279 --> 02:56:47,540
like this this is not going to be right

02:56:45,949 --> 02:56:50,510
because it gets one wrong all the time

02:56:47,540 --> 02:56:52,369
and this is like eight will be like hair

02:56:50,510 --> 02:57:02,180
or something there you go

02:56:52,369 --> 02:57:07,270
so no wait if I did it like if I did it

02:57:02,180 --> 02:57:07,270
for me yeah i refreshed it now yeah

02:57:19,300 --> 02:57:25,270
boom - so she's telling your probability

02:57:22,720 --> 02:57:27,130
that it thinks it's - so this is kind of

02:57:25,270 --> 02:57:31,600
very the next step and this actually

02:57:27,130 --> 02:57:36,149
does use more than one neuron and in

02:57:31,600 --> 02:57:37,450
that in the example on github which is

02:57:36,149 --> 02:57:41,109
gone

02:57:37,450 --> 02:57:43,870
let's get have gone oh here's this one's

02:57:41,109 --> 02:57:46,840
done a bit differently it's completed

02:57:43,870 --> 02:57:51,010
and master master kappa master started

02:57:46,840 --> 02:57:54,160
and completed is the end and you'll see

02:57:51,010 --> 02:57:59,020
here there's a built with a couple of

02:57:54,160 --> 02:58:01,060
different ways of building it a couple

02:57:59,020 --> 02:58:02,439
of different algorithms basically so you

02:58:01,060 --> 02:58:06,040
can have a look at that see how it works

02:58:02,439 --> 02:58:12,180
it's kind of very well-documented the

02:58:06,040 --> 02:58:12,180
one you might want to the mont

02:58:13,440 --> 02:58:17,800
we're gonna start off with dents I don't

02:58:16,390 --> 02:58:20,771
know it's really quite difficult for you

02:58:17,800 --> 02:58:22,180
to follow it follow it from there but if

02:58:20,771 --> 02:58:23,470
you didn't want to kind of flesh it out

02:58:22,180 --> 02:58:26,561
a little bit further that's probably

02:58:23,470 --> 02:58:32,710
where I would start all like sand off my

02:58:26,561 --> 02:58:35,790
book yeah did you sign up my book well

02:58:32,710 --> 02:58:39,100
we'll see I'll check the numbers tonight

02:58:35,790 --> 02:58:40,540
see it's out of the book because I'm

02:58:39,100 --> 02:58:42,400
gonna try and write all the stuff up

02:58:40,540 --> 02:58:45,430
because it's a little bit all over the

02:58:42,400 --> 02:58:46,840
place gonna write it all up into a into

02:58:45,430 --> 02:58:50,760
a book which I'll then release then you

02:58:46,840 --> 02:58:50,760
can you can you can learn it a lot more

02:58:50,910 --> 02:58:54,570
you sign up on

02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:59,160
but everything that

02:59:05,351 --> 02:59:08,891
and a hundred

02:59:13,150 --> 02:59:17,780
let's look at another conference

02:59:14,811 --> 02:59:19,880
recently was 1400 in the crowd I was

02:59:17,780 --> 02:59:23,271
like really excited but reached a

02:59:19,880 --> 02:59:28,910
hundred I'd like for sign ups wasn't

02:59:23,271 --> 02:59:30,710
really upset I like you know but hey

02:59:28,910 --> 02:59:33,380
maybe maybe I'll reach a hundred now I

02:59:30,710 --> 02:59:35,380
know and I want to Kickstarter I meet

02:59:33,380 --> 02:59:37,790
that I made the cover

03:01:17,190 --> 03:01:23,811
forget about tile doom I don't buy the

03:01:18,750 --> 03:01:27,141
title right and then where's this like

03:01:23,811 --> 03:01:27,141
was it slack

03:01:27,811 --> 03:01:39,440
just like there's most like there you go

03:01:31,290 --> 03:01:39,440
right open the slack do now

03:01:44,840 --> 03:01:50,909
once you click it you see the sign up

03:01:47,970 --> 03:01:53,970
for the forum where the objectives of

03:01:50,909 --> 03:01:57,659
the workshop clearly explained no is one

03:01:53,970 --> 03:02:02,090
yes is five did the workshop meet your

03:01:57,659 --> 03:02:05,069
expectations not well one very well five

03:02:02,090 --> 03:02:07,500
it's weird when I go through the forum I

03:02:05,069 --> 03:02:09,750
get so many people filling it out when I

03:02:07,500 --> 03:02:12,180
just dropped the link no one I have to

03:02:09,750 --> 03:02:14,819
go through the forum was the workshop

03:02:12,180 --> 03:02:19,040
too easy too too complex or just right

03:02:14,819 --> 03:02:23,550
so one is too complex five is too easy

03:02:19,040 --> 03:02:26,880
I'm guessing where that one might might

03:02:23,550 --> 03:02:28,560
might land here's the just one if you

03:02:26,880 --> 03:02:31,290
ask to get a five-minute presentation

03:02:28,560 --> 03:02:33,750
but tends to flow just a five-minute one

03:02:31,290 --> 03:02:36,630
how confident are you they could present

03:02:33,750 --> 03:02:40,199
this in your work or something

03:02:36,630 --> 03:02:41,819
I must go through two applications today

03:02:40,199 --> 03:02:46,439
but anyway did you go through too many

03:02:41,819 --> 03:02:49,800
or too few can tell me one thing you

03:02:46,439 --> 03:02:53,819
like to have a workshop it's the only

03:02:49,800 --> 03:02:55,590
goodness I get but no sooner goes the

03:02:53,819 --> 03:02:57,479
most important thing is what what what

03:02:55,590 --> 03:02:58,699
should I change about the workshop like

03:02:57,479 --> 03:03:00,899
what is it something I should change I'd

03:02:58,699 --> 03:03:02,279
you saw some of the things I changed

03:03:00,899 --> 03:03:03,569
this time around to kind of make a

03:03:02,279 --> 03:03:05,699
little bit more engaging what are some

03:03:03,569 --> 03:03:10,850
of the things I might change and just

03:03:05,699 --> 03:03:10,850
anything else you want to tell me

03:03:11,431 --> 03:03:14,790
thank you that's it

03:03:16,910 --> 03:03:19,219
