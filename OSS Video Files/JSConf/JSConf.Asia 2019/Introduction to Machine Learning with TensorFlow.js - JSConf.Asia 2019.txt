Description: 
	Speaker: Asim Hussain @jawache

Learn how to build and train Neural Networks using the most popular Machine Learning framework for JavaScript, TensorFlow.js. This is a practical workshop where you'll learn "hands-on" by building several different applications from scratch using TensorFlow.js. If you have ever been interested in Machine Learning, if you want to get a taste for what this exciting field has to offer, if you want to be able to talk to other Machine Learning/AI specialists in a language they understand, then this workshop is for you.

Requirements:
Bring a laptop. Have a recent Google Chrome, Git and NodeJS installed. You will need to run a local web server and serve the contents of a directory if you don't know how to do that Asim recommends downloading VS Code and install the live server plugin.

Asim is a developer, trainer, author and speaker with over 18 years experience working for organisations such as the European Space Agency, Google and now Microsoft, where he is leading Developer Advocacy for EMEA.
