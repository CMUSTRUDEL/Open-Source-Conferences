Description: 
	A short show-case of the results of the 2 day long Nodebots workshop with Pasindu. Always fun to see some robots, right?

00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:21,060
so hi everyone I'm passenger I'm one of

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,109
the organizers of node BOTS

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,779
I have chato and a who also organizing

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:31,349
node BOTS so this is fourth time we

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:35,489
organized node but at Java Script Asia

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:39,540
and so typically what we do is we start

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:43,280
with this what we call a simple bot so

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,320
it's it's two servos our dinner Nano and

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,399
just a breadboard and we just control it

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,129
and so this time what we did was we

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,949
started off from that and we try to make

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,750
I don't try add stuff to it or remove

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:04,400
stuff from it and just do something with

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:08,090
it so yeah the first one we have is the

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,090
so cameras

00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:23,760
so everything in here actually run with

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,760
powered by JavaScript yes

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:21,460
so so this is how it was so when you so

00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,920
when you so this is turning left and

00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:28,870
right so there is orange color when you

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,060
turn left and right and front it's when

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:40,750
you go front it's red and back it's

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:50,250
green that's that's pretty much it in

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:50,250
the table be careful yeah

00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:07,060
so it's by here Ash and his team is done

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:14,220
this one so no we let keep it in the

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:14,220
last one yeah

00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:37,740
so if you have seen the Twitter feed

00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,740
this called JavaScript Roomba

00:03:49,230 --> 00:04:43,930
so you are cleaning but it's affirmation

00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:45,610
yeah is the next version control them

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:51,970
from the command line from the mobile

00:04:45,610 --> 00:05:00,610
phone Oh what do we have here so the one

00:04:51,970 --> 00:05:03,010
you asked for this is a note cat it's

00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,389
for people who might not have a cat but

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:09,160
missed one of the most important

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:11,760
features of a cat which is crawling

00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:16,330
around a table and knocking stuff over

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:18,940
so that's exactly what it does it's

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:22,840
gonna search for stuff around it it has

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:27,300
like a pattern and once it's find

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,300
something hopefully it's not gonna do it

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:35,580
second try it uses a proximity sensor to

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,199
see that it has an obstacle then it

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,199
proceeds to ram it off the table

00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:55,410
it's a ultrasonic sensor no I think I

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:57,240
pressed something do it do it yeah as

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:17,849
you can see it's mostly like a cat

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:20,360
pretty useless yeah it even stopped on

00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:30,960
its own I'm proud of it

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:33,780
thank you I think the biggest challenge

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,849
in building this is that hardware never

00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,659
works like you really wanted to or like

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:41,490
document it or in any sensible way

00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:44,039
so you just figure out what you can work

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,789
with and just try to get your code to

00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:46,789
work around those issues

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,269
[Applause]

00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:03,450
okay so this what I have metrics

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:07,400
animation so my friends and I am star

00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:11,090
building the website with reactor yes

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:18,420
yeah which can do animation and display

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:21,450
animation on this grid so and this is

00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,640
the default button so you if you if I

00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:31,770
hit this it's gonna display the light

00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:35,670
here so I start doing my example which

00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:42,570
is really hard to building this with my

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:46,740
friends yeah it's a Jess car yeah so am

00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:53,700
I gonna hit deploy button we speed 100

00:07:46,740 --> 00:08:02,940
milliseconds for keyframe okay but I

00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:07,020
think it's broken now so but we have

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:10,820
backup I held it I can let let you let

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,820
you see in this video instead

00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:30,850
okay here is this okay try to hit deploy

00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:42,729
button yeah

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:45,070
as it works thank you there's something

00:08:42,729 --> 00:09:02,070
happened between me traveling from our

00:08:45,070 --> 00:09:08,740
workshop to the stage so yeah okay for

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:12,820
for mine this is called blue car because

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:19,570
it's used Bluetooth so unlike other car

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:23,610
like note cut so it doesn't need why not

00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:23,610
cut it actually tail it's a feature

00:09:34,060 --> 00:10:21,200
so I can move from afar so we also tried

00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:27,020
to make something so so this is what we

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:29,840
tried to make so this is basically uh a

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,200
pump that is supposed to inflate the

00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,200
balloon

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:43,360
he promised me explosions beforehand I

00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,360
was like don't tell me I need a license

00:10:44,780 --> 00:11:01,490
yeah you will have to say a whole day

00:10:46,910 --> 00:11:11,170
here yeah so that's pretty much it for

00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:15,650
that Wow awesome

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:19,610
that was impressive in that hard way is

00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:25,460
hard I guess like he promised explosions

00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:27,380
I'm almost I guess maybe tomorrow give

00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:32,140
them all a round of applause it's like

00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:35,769
two days of work thank you so much guys

00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,769
