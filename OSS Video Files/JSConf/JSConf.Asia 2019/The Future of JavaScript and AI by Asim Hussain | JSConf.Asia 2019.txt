Title: The Future of JavaScript and AI by Asim Hussain | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-24
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	There are many exciting things happening with AI, from which, until recently, JavaScript developers were largely shut out. But things are changing, if you can do npm install @tensorflow/tfjs or make an API call, you can now do AI. In this fast-paced talk, I'll open your mind to what's possible by demoing several AI-powered JavaScript apps and show you how they were built using either TensorFlow.js or easy to use AI powered APIs. You don't need a PhD in Maths, you don't need years of experience, you just need imagination and the willingness to try.

Asim is a developer, trainer, author and speaker with over 18 years experience working for organisations such as the European Space Agency, Google and now Microsoft, where he is leading Developer Advocacy for EMEA.
