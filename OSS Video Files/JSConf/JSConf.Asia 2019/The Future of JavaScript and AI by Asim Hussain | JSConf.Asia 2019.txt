Title: The Future of JavaScript and AI by Asim Hussain | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-24
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	There are many exciting things happening with AI, from which, until recently, JavaScript developers were largely shut out. But things are changing, if you can do npm install @tensorflow/tfjs or make an API call, you can now do AI. In this fast-paced talk, I'll open your mind to what's possible by demoing several AI-powered JavaScript apps and show you how they were built using either TensorFlow.js or easy to use AI powered APIs. You don't need a PhD in Maths, you don't need years of experience, you just need imagination and the willingness to try.

Asim is a developer, trainer, author and speaker with over 18 years experience working for organisations such as the European Space Agency, Google and now Microsoft, where he is leading Developer Advocacy for EMEA.

[Music]

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:25,920
so welcome to this talk on the future of

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:26,960
JavaScript is AI my name is my quick was

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,480
broken

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,829
my name is Aston Husain you can find me

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:38,340
on Twitter as draw eight not Jewish a

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:42,800
jaw ache I blog about angular and

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:46,680
JavaScript on my website code Croft TV

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:49,710
and I'm also a a cloud advocate at

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,559
Microsoft so if you don't know who we

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,829
are we are the open source advocates

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,629
working on the azure cloud platform if

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,640
you go to our get a link there you'll

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,680
find a you find all of us basically

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,040
there's me in the top there the world we

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,740
focus on all different technologies and

00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,140
areas my focus is JavaScript and and web

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,170
well actually I've gone into leadership

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,400
now so my focus is people but yeah if

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,330
you want to find out more about us grow

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,270
into that website and just yeah chase

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:25,049
people up um I also work with a charity

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,890
called pal internship and what they do

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,600
is they help find Palestinians

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:34,049
internships in high-tech Israeli

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,450
startups and I last year I I mentored

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,880
about 10 of them it's a really hard work

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,200
mentoring ten people by mentor ten of

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,130
them and this year I'm very very proud

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:47,159
to say that seventeen of the interns are

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:51,479
all being mentored by one God advocate

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:55,740
for Microsoft so if any of you work with

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,420
or for or at a startup or high tech

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,180
company in Israel and you have a space

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,520
or opening for an intern give me a shout

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,710
I'll connect you in with your program

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,710
director I can get the ball rolling

00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,780
anybody here

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:16,560
anybody here know about udemy anybody

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:21,800
here my students on udemy one how I

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:25,050
thank you thank you pays my mortgage on

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:29,780
udemy like this I get over a year ago

00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:35,370
now they added in automatic subtitling

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:37,610
and so they correctly sites up the spell

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:43,500
my name correctly

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:44,370
my name is awesome and this talk should

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,720
be very awesome

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:52,260
I also co-organized a meetup group in

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,090
London called AI JavaScript London

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,600
psycho organized with my friend L and a

00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:00,210
half prof. and we started early last

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,980
year it's been running very successful

00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:07,080
thing got about 1700 1800 members now

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:09,540
and we run some pre regular sessions or

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,010
all the way through last year and what

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,900
happened was at the end of these

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,240
sessions people would come up to us and

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,300
it kind of give us a link to some hey

00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:21,240
look at this javascript a I powered

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,440
JavaScript application isn't it cool and

00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,270
we thought you know it's fantastic it's

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,240
really cool let's put them all together

00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,320
in a website so everybody else can find

00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,980
them and that's what we did we made a

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,750
website called a ijs rocks and if you go

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,959
to a ijs rocks what you'll find is a

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:40,020
whole collection of a I powered

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,459
JavaScript applications now they're

00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,470
JavaScript and they're in the web which

00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,180
means you can play around them but also

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,160
means you can usually view source and

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,870
see how it's working but the very least

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,650
they'll come up with or have a link to

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,750
the source code or an article or a video

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,990
explaining how it was made and the idea

00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:00,570
is to inspire you with an application

00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:02,070
and then if you like it you can dig into

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,510
and learn a little bit more and learn a

00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,540
little bit more and that's that's been

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,150
my journey into machine learning and

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,340
jobs has been has been that process I

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,480
recommend doing that yourself and in

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,040
this talk today what we're going to do

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,220
is we're going to go through three of

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,020
the applications which you can find on a

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,260
ijs rocks I'm gonna explain how they

00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,880
work

00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,290
and then hopefully through that whole

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,730
process you're gonna learn throughout

00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,610
the course of today for the course of

00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,810
this lecture talk you're gonna learn a

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,920
little bit more a little bit more a

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,890
little bit more about what's possible

00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,540
and achievable with AI machine learning

00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,600
in JavaScript right now I know a couple

00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,700
of talks already in this conference on

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,140
this topics

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:45,070
I suppose my talk if I'm a higher level

00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:47,770
give you a bit more of a broader

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,960
viewpoint of what's possible so let's

00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,830
start off with the first application

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:58,210
it's called the moji fire it's not

00:04:53,830 --> 00:05:01,090
trademarked it's just the moji fire so

00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:04,600
it made sense and this is actually my

00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:07,470
application I built this application and

00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,470
it's going to change everything

00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:17,050
what does it do you can give an image it

00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:19,900
will detect any faces in the image it

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:23,880
will then detect the emotion in the face

00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:27,030
it will then any guesses

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,730
it will mode you fire it

00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:33,520
that's right we'll grab the appropriate

00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:38,200
Modi stick on the face and post it right

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:43,750
back at you yeah Elon Musk so nothing on

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:46,360
me yeah yeah I am open for investment

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:50,260
I hear Singapore's a start-up hotspot

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:52,270
you can use it may different ways so you

00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,060
can use it as a slack application so in

00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:56,710
fact if you go to the moji fire calm and

00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:58,030
you just click that add to slack button

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,680
it'll add it to your own slack

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:04,600
workspaces right now and this that works

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:09,760
so you basically find them image this is

00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:13,900
my son slash mode if I put the pasty

00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:17,500
image in yeah I see it can handle

00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:22,450
multiple people so if you grab that one

00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:26,680
in there we go that back there am i and

00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:29,980
I it answers an age-old question that

00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,280
has been plaguing people for hunt day go

00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,750
that's the Mona Lisa smile there you go

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,610
so the moji fire does quite a lot is a

00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,020
whole lot of things that it's doing but

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,259
i say the most impressive thing that

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:45,680
it's doing is its how the hell is it

00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:47,600
calculating emotion emotion right it's

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,910
kind of kind of complex things a lot of

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,009
us can't really tell other people's

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,070
emotion but how is a computer figuring

00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:58,100
that out right and I've got good news

00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:02,240
for you it's really easy it's incredibly

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:05,990
easy so we got two steps just two steps

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,220
okay first step detecting the facial

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,680
features we know how to do this now

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,900
we've examined in our faces we know the

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,630
different points that every single face

00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:17,560
has and so basically there's death

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:21,560
different algorithms that you can get

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:23,919
some of them are very arithmetic and

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,729
some of them are a little bit more

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,470
machine learning based essentially

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:30,949
there's lots of different algorithms you

00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:33,380
can use which can if given an image will

00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:35,389
extract for you those facial features in

00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,330
every single face has one of those

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:41,449
features

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:44,120
if I step one and step two is really

00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:47,419
really easy you just use and you're all

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,669
networks I said just two steps extract

00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:54,440
the features and then just train and use

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:57,800
and you all network let's move on I want

00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,220
to explain you know just just for this

00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,780
guy

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,889
gentleman I'll explain in your network

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,289
just for just for him over there I

00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:06,460
nobody else knows what they are now

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:10,880
but neural network is has a basis in

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:14,479
biology okay this is a neuron you should

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,900
have at least one of these maybe some of

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:21,680
you have a few less then you did

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:29,630
yesterday but it has some dendrites

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:31,729
going in a body a body and some axon

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:34,729
going out if enough electricity flows

00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:36,529
into the dendrite the body fires some

00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:37,630
electricity out through an axon that's

00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:40,490
it

00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:44,750
so it does if you stick enough of these

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:47,139
together you get a brain I can think

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:52,850
right that's it that's in your network

00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:54,879
that's awful that's a brainer to say if

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:58,430
I asked you to code this up in

00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:01,129
JavaScript you probably kind of try and

00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,449
give it a go I mean a long time so I've

00:09:01,129 --> 00:09:04,550
kind of studied there the computer

00:09:02,449 --> 00:09:05,529
science basics right now but I still

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:10,339
remember some of it

00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:12,439
I've grown node ah I'd create some edges

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,860
hi graph theory yeah I know I'm talking

00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:18,110
about get some edges going in an edge

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,310
going back out and then what your

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,959
features what are the things you're

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,459
you're pumping into would you would you

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,740
was the input some what's the output

00:09:22,459 --> 00:09:27,470
let's say this neural network is very

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:31,750
one your neural network you're going to

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:38,139
pump in the day of the year

00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:40,790
23 and maybe the temperature on that day

00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:44,930
that's the inputs then for each of the

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:47,360
edges you basically create a random

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,279
number you initialize with a random

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,740
number where math dot R and maybe that

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:56,000
got initializers minus 0.5 maybe that's

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,439
got 2.1 you multiply them together you

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,589
add them up when you pump them through

00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:02,779
an activation function again whatever

00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:05,629
that function pumps out that's

00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:08,540
electricity going back out that's how

00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:11,870
you would simulate that in code that's

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,449
it just to see a little bit more about

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:18,559
how that might work

00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:21,339
boom just this this is it some input

00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,959
features multiply them by the weights

00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:25,639
you sum them together whatever that

00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:27,829
number is you pass into the activation

00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:30,470
function and whatever that pumps out you

00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:32,899
pump out that's just in your on it's all

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:36,379
you're doing when I when I teach if some

00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:39,850
of you coming to my workshop later on at

00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:39,850
some point of workshop will just be like

00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:48,980
that's what that's what it's all about

00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:50,329
right but basically there's loads

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,639
different activation functions out there

00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:54,709
this is a very very simple one anything

00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,950
below zero is zero anything above zero

00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:59,370
is one there's loads

00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:01,940
you can use and basically you just grab

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,590
a bunch of those neurons together

00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:14,940
okay Network there's a simple

00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:16,890
feed-forward neural network and so what

00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:20,160
you do you connect them all together but

00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:23,940
remember you initialize all those edges

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,530
with random numbers right well then for

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,410
this car neural network need a training

00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:31,170
set let's say we've got a whole bunch of

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,430
images that we've already gathered we've

00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,460
already figured out where all the facial

00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:36,900
features are in this image okay this

00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,600
data sets out that they're available

00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,950
with all this stuff right we already

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,390
figured out what the facial features are

00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:46,830
of this image I mean actually we also

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:48,690
know the emotion in it as well we pump

00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:51,540
those features in maybe the features are

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:54,660
kind of the XY coordinates of each pupil

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,550
and other things we pump those in we

00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,600
multiply all across then gives us a

00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:02,430
number at the end right we we though

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:07,440
what does 3 mean that we've decided

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:11,390
actually that in this neural network 0

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,740
maybes unhappy in 10 is happy right

00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:16,410
someone has a human being has looked at

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,110
that image and they said that's 8 so we

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:22,370
know it's wrong of course it's wrong you

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:24,390
initialize a bunch of random numbers and

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,310
multiply them together it's not gonna

00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:29,850
it's not finished right it's a start in

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:32,070
office course it's wrong right but what

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:34,290
we need to do is enter just those

00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:36,630
numbers based off of how wrong it is so

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:39,870
we know because we know this data that

00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:41,640
it's off by 5 this is the magic use an

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:45,600
algorithm use a technique called back

00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:49,260
propagation ok given how wrong the

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,110
network is how do you tweak those

00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,880
numbers so next time you run it it's

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,860
more right

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,160
ok that's back propagation and that's

00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,160
what you do

00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,330
and so then it tweaks it perhaps you

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,680
keep on running it with your date and

00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:09,110
you keep on running with it until it

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,960
gets less wrong less wrong less wrong

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:15,050
less wrong and so eventually what

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,740
happens is you give an eighth image and

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,920
if we correctly predicts that it's eight

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,320
okay

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,080
that process is training a neural

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,420
network all it's doing is tweaking those

00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,360
weights so the next time you go through

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,760
it becomes better and better and better

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,650
okay that's how you could do it there

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,970
are actually well-known datasets out

00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:38,000
there that you can get the freely

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:40,640
available which have a whole bunch of

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,040
images 10,000 20,000 30,000 a hundred I

00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,350
mean which loads of images each image

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,020
has been a human being is gone through

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:50,810
and determine what emotion is and you

00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:56,029
can build and train your network in

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:59,540
order to detect emotion okay so you

00:13:56,029 --> 00:14:01,610
could do okay but a lot what's been

00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,750
happening over the last two years one of

00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,950
those lots of things happening in space

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,630
over the last years once we've really

00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,640
been happening in the last two years is

00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,950
a commoditization

00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:15,200
of these services especially it's very

00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:17,000
very commonly used models a lot of

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,270
different companies Microsoft included

00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,220
have been making them available via

00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,540
api's and that's what I use that's what

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:25,820
I use for this service I use something

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,940
called the face api which can get from

00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:34,339
Azure and it's very very very easy to

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:36,890
use you basically just post an image to

00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:38,440
that URL and it gives you some data back

00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,870
at the backend it's using something

00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:45,010
exactly like I've showed you it's been

00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:48,290
trained in a much much bigger data set

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,280
over much much much longer at a time but

00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,560
it gives you a whole bunch of

00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:55,060
information for each image in the face

00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:58,790
image in the for each face in the image

00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,440
bla it gives you a face rectangle the

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,420
face attributes with emotion gets a

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,810
whole lot more as well just strips all

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,970
out

00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:07,490
anger contempt disgust fear happiness

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:11,330
teacher sadness and surprise between

00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:13,870
zero and one do you see the odd beard we

00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,870
have we got bed

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,930
yes yeah you cannot be hunter person

00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,950
happy really sorry about that it's

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,450
actually impossible

00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:27,160
I've tried I can only be 99% happy

00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,060
that's basically I used in the moji fire

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,740
right

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:34,090
that's how I built it that's how I

00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:37,150
detected in motion inside there just to

00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:39,580
summarize your networks just incredibly

00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:42,100
powerful that incredibly powerful but

00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,350
actually conceptually they're really

00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,140
simple to understand I explained you a

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,450
really basic one in about five five ten

00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:52,390
minutes something like that right okay

00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:54,460
basic the other kind of lesson learned

00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,810
here might be when I do teach my

00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,650
workshops to get people ask me questions

00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:58,660
afterwards

00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:00,820
so this taught them how to do training

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,100
for neural network from scratch then

00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:06,090
they asked me I want to build this and

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:08,830
I'm like oh there's 18 API is available

00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:10,540
will you do that right so first off also

00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:12,640
especially these days check to see

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:16,750
there's an API that already gives you

00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:22,450
the answer that you're looking for next

00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:23,740
demo okay and I'm fine so I run

00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:25,330
workshops on machine learning with

00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:28,180
JavaScript in one of the workshops in

00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:31,090
London a guy called Oliver Turner then

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:34,180
built this demo and their center back

00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:36,550
seam proud moment when your workshop on

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:40,300
your students build something sends it

00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:45,730
back and this is what it does basically

00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:48,340
if you do yeah it's doing a search for

00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:50,320
unsplash for puppies getting that image

00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,690
back there then the percentage in the

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,850
bottom left are it trying to figure out

00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:57,130
what's inside the image you can see here

00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:58,150
it's detectable here's like it fountain

00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:05,079
mmm

00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:06,880
puppies ten percent a terrier bad you

00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,780
search unsplash for I'm fine again

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,880
saying this image and it says

00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:12,640
seventy-eight percent t-shirt not bad

00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:16,180
okay not bad so the important lesson

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,449
here is that the only API request is

00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:21,010
being made here is to get image the

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:23,500
actual detection of what's inside the

00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:26,060
image is all done in javascript in the

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,220
browser okay we heard

00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:33,260
I know I know we've heard of tensorflow

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:35,420
already in this in this were these

00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:38,330
things called conferences in this

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:42,760
conference yeah I arrived last night

00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:47,390
from London and think about well I think

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:49,610
yeah tensorflow is a tent tensorflow

00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:52,190
since low is a technology which is open

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:56,570
just like Google for five years ago a

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:58,340
number and it allows you to run what a

00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,260
tensor is there's actually a

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,390
multi-dimensional array that's all

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,610
attempts that means a high dimensional

00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:07,340
array so you can do kind of matrix

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:10,820
calculations across whole bunch of

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:13,310
servers GPUs scale it out massively

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:16,820
right Brits built-in see it's really

00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:20,560
hardcore yeah but that's basically where

00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:24,200
it's all about but start of last year

00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,010
the creative tempo a yes we all like

00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,830
that here don't we

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:30,140
a little dot J s whenever they add that

00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:36,460
to things we get really excited it's

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:37,670
like butter you know plain jacket potato

00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,910
butter

00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:43,190
it's nice right that's what Jay s was

00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,170
launched now it just a month or two ago

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,270
icon with the last tense for some it may

00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:50,090
reach 1.0 so house actually reached a

00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:51,680
stay at maturity now today I know we

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,450
hope we've gone through this before but

00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:58,190
this is all you need to do in order to

00:18:53,450 --> 00:19:06,770
use 10 so jess is well if you mean you

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:08,210
use this one but that's but the

00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,400
important thing here is that's all you

00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,930
need in order to start playing around

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,060
with machine learning jobs this is it

00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:17,000
when I first thought Enzo J's I thought

00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:19,820
it was like node bindings and you had to

00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,010
install tensorflow not to use it no it's

00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,980
actually really tense we rerun from the

00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,930
ground up in JavaScript there's like a

00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,430
subset of what's available in the proper

00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:31,150
turn slope it has enough to do some pre

00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,150
some pretty cool stuff

00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,840
and you can do a whole bunch of things

00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,280
that you can do what I just described to

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,559
you earlier on which is a trainer model

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,269
the whole thing with the newer

00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:43,909
and then the weight and then the

00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:45,830
backpropagation all that tuning stuff

00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:50,179
you can do that intense flow Jess you

00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:53,779
can write oh you can load pre train

00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:55,549
models doing pre train models if you go

00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:57,289
to ten so jess website you actually find

00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:59,840
now there's like the big it's growing

00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:01,700
there's a hot there's a set of pre train

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,049
models very easy preacher and models you

00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,360
can just grab from their website and

00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:06,919
start using you can also there's also

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,570
now scripts available where you can take

00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:12,980
a model chained up using tensorflow

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:15,559
proper and then convert those models for

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,539
use in pencil for chair so you can start

00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:19,039
using them but essentially as long as

00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:22,700
good as adjacent file available you can

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,860
load it up from within the browser and

00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,980
that's kind of what all of the use so

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:31,840
use something called mobile net which is

00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:35,240
just a very optimized neural network

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,399
that can detect one of a thousand things

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,440
only a thousand things that's why it

00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:41,929
wasn't very good there's only a thousand

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,509
things that can detect in the world but

00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:47,960
it's mobile so it's been optimized for

00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:50,720
size so it can be small to use on a

00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:54,529
mobile but that's it only like four

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:56,470
lines of code I say it's crazy four

00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:59,360
lines of code in JavaScript to do that

00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:01,159
right I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna get

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:06,789
this wrong statistically but I think it

00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:09,159
was 2008 was it we still couldn't detect

00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:12,529
whether an image was a cat or a dog

00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:14,330
right using whatever servers that we

00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:19,759
could now in JavaScript we can do this a

00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:21,499
bit crazy but it's mobile net right so

00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,330
it's it's not very good you saw it

00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:24,980
wasn't very very good it wasn't that

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,970
good right it's useful for a lot of

00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,450
other things it's useful something

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:32,629
called transfer learning it's useful for

00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:34,009
some use cases but not to really know

00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:36,289
what's in an image like if your life

00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:37,249
depended on it you wouldn't use mobile

00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:38,869
net right

00:21:37,249 --> 00:21:41,960
you want to use somebody's been trained

00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:44,360
up on a much larger data set with much

00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,240
more features and these things are kind

00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,399
of gigabytes terabytes big and not not

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,690
big enough to download on your computer

00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:52,690
but they're available via

00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,289
I'm gonna pretend to me said api's you

00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:01,070
said api's right yeah API is correct I

00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:05,030
mean we've got another one called

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:07,730
computer vision I knew you can you can

00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:10,159
detect like an insane amount of

00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:12,140
information if you give an image one of

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,120
the really scary things it does it

00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:17,090
shocks me it still scares me actually is

00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:21,289
it you can give an image and they can

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:24,409
give you a human readable description of

00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:28,130
what's in the image as if a human being

00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:31,100
wrote it right my friend Sara Rosen have

00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,390
made a cool demo with this she thought

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:35,390
wouldn't it be cool if you could use

00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:37,250
that to describe the alt text the alt

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,679
tag in images because we all do that

00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:42,080
right we're all supposed to add alt tags

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,780
for images right we're all doing it so

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,980
this is completely unnecessary I know

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:50,840
but if you did want to use it you could

00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:52,700
try out it's a code pen so you can you

00:22:50,840 --> 00:23:01,600
can put in an image and the text at the

00:22:52,700 --> 00:23:04,090
top let me know this is TV show no wow

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,150
you're in for a treat

00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:10,400
just halt and catch fire yeah it's an

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:13,370
amazing TV show it talks to talks about

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,409
start something kind of 1985 and talks

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,659
about computing back in those days and

00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:20,570
she's one of the stars in the show is

00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:21,559
Mackenzie Davies this is a when you give

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,330
her this image this is the this is the

00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:25,940
the caption it gives it was a Mackenzie

00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:32,240
Davies and all standing in front of a

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:34,880
building right pretty pretty good for

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,220
service but you know she released on

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,370
Twitter and the twitter is full of

00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:43,909
really helpful people you know all were

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:46,820
very supportive we kindly tell you when

00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:49,159
something some work right and I saw some

00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:54,220
people said so they said oh this doesn't

00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:58,309
work so a star-filled sky takes days for

00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:59,539
actually don't know maybe the Asian I

00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:02,510
don't know what they were characters but

00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:06,440
what it is it's not accurate that's true

00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:15,259
no the next one I think is uh

00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:20,080
be true could be true no I mean you

00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:24,919
don't know dude let's go be dead cats

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:28,190
stuffed on a bed really good ones

00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,240
I really like the next one because cuz

00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:35,710
we're half right

00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:39,440
we're half right on the next one yeah

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:48,649
that's good that's 50% that's past mark

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:50,480
where I come from so just to summarize

00:24:48,649 --> 00:24:52,129
and that's probably one takeaway to take

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,200
from this just tensorflow Jess doesn't

00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:55,730
have any dependencies they're gonna play

00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,200
around machine learning each one's do

00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:59,330
quickly you're suffocating the browser

00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,659
confusing node well actually I take that

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,700
back

00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:04,039
tend to flow chess in though does have

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,330
dependencies but then slow Jess in the

00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:07,610
browser you can just stop playing around

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,950
with it with nothing mobile there's a

00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:10,940
really simple way to analyze images and

00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,379
it's usually something if you come to

00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,759
the workshop later on is how we start

00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:17,299
off always gonna start off with mobile

00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:19,519
net but if you really wanna do some kind

00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:21,830
of really deep image analysis you want

00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,379
to use an API or you want to spend a

00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:29,899
couple hundred thousand dollars training

00:25:24,379 --> 00:25:33,789
one up or something like that right time

00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:36,980
for the last one okay

00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:40,610
it's called image to image you find this

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:43,480
on the air Jess rocks website let's just

00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:43,480
take a look at actually

00:25:50,750 --> 00:26:00,060
this is running in the browser okay

00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:05,250
you would outline of a cat and it draws

00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:08,310
the rest of the cats go by a guy called

00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:15,240
the Zaid he's still at university I

00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:18,150
wasn't doing stuff University yeah

00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:22,250
amazing work right how does it work

00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:24,330
he's an algorithm called pics to pics

00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:26,250
there was an example of something call

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:31,020
again

00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:32,910
a generative adversarial neural network

00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:36,720
and what they how they work is it's to

00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:40,620
neural networks that are competing with

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:44,730
each other okay so first off you have a

00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:47,160
generator okay and you have another one

00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:52,350
called a discriminator the generators

00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:54,150
job is given some inputs whatever input

00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:57,300
that is in this case it's and outlines

00:26:54,150 --> 00:27:01,320
of images of outlines of cats given that

00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:09,570
input its job it's a generate an image

00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:11,310
of a cat that's this job right and

00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:14,190
that's what you do you you get in a

00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:16,440
whole set of import outline images you

00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,670
get a generator to generate outputs it's

00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,420
not going to do a really good job right

00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:22,800
now cuz it's all math dot random right

00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,810
it's not it's all gonna be noise to

00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,210
begin with but whatever you take all

00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:30,180
those images and you combine them with

00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:32,490
pictures of real cats you jumble all

00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:36,210
together and you pass it into the scrim

00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:39,570
into the discriminators job is to figure

00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:43,740
out if an image is of a real cat or of a

00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:46,380
generated cat remember the discriminator

00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:48,660
has also been initialized with math dot

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:52,140
random so it's not going to do a very

00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:54,570
good job as well is it right probably

00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,810
you might get it wrong the first time

00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:59,070
around you might think the real cat is a

00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,360
fake cat

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:05,520
but then what do you do when it went a

00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:08,490
neural network is wrong we train I'll

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,530
take it train it we do that

00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:13,820
backpropagation thing we tweak it we

00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:20,490
tune it we tuned until it gets better

00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:21,780
okay but if it got it right it detected

00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:25,140
it right that means it generators not

00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:29,730
doing a very good job the generator is

00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:31,290
wrong we tuned the generator and that's

00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,660
what's going on as a generator gets

00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:35,070
better the discriminating s better as a

00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,590
generator gets better discriminate and

00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:41,430
the fighting versus each other that's

00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:43,110
what they're doing until eventually the

00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,540
generator is doing such a good job

00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:47,730
generating cat images the discriminator

00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:51,690
can't figure out what's real and what's

00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:53,010
what's fake anymore right and then you

00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,620
know you're done you know trainings

00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,360
finished and what we do is you throw

00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,950
away the discriminator we don't need

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,500
that anymore we just need a generator

00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:05,280
and you can export that if you're

00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,960
careful you can export it into a small

00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:09,060
enough size you can load up in the

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,070
browser and that's what they did and

00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:14,240
then you can give it your own outlines

00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:18,960
and they can generate images of cats

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:22,590
okay that's a gang but you don't just

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,180
have to use it with cats works with

00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,110
anything right if you train it with the

00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:34,220
right data set

00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:39,270
oh this so your left is the input and

00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:45,320
the right is the output okay but this

00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:45,320
isn't pix to pics this bit of it

00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:59,940
this doesn't work in JavaScript yet but

00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:05,360
maybe not so far away um how about this

00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,360
example one input multiple outputs

00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:18,210
remember it doesn't it doesn't just have

00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,920
to take out lines as inputs you can give

00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:22,740
again whatever you want as an input

00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,780
whatever you want right in this case you

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,540
can give it what's called a segmented

00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,280
image which is just an outline d the

00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:32,580
different colors kind of give you a clue

00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,830
as a the 3d nature of the image and the

00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:38,580
depth of the image and you can do

00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:41,430
something like this okay she's not

00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:50,190
dancing I wish I could get a real-life

00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:55,190
one of one of these for me yeah how

00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:58,440
about this one there's a segmented

00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:59,850
Street image top-left these two are just

00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,820
different algorithms and that's the

00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:07,850
width of it one there again all right

00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,850
it's generated completely generated

00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:18,680
but you don't have to even give it even

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:24,730
an image you don't even have to give an

00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:26,930
image you can just give a text as input

00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:28,010
okay remember it's just whatever text

00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:30,080
you give it's going to generate

00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:32,090
something so you give it some text as

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,060
input and you also generated generate an

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:39,260
image that's what you doing so these are

00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:41,180
two examples here so in the top one the

00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:43,160
input text is this flower has long thin

00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:46,280
yellow petals and a lot of yellow

00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:49,010
anthers in the center stage one is after

00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,200
six hundred iterations Stage two is

00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:53,000
after twelve hundred iterations you can

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,580
see well this one's not very good but

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,280
the rest are pretty good right and this

00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:01,190
is another one using birds so this bird

00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:06,620
is white black and brown in color with a

00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:08,780
brown beak again stage one is uh 600 not

00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,970
the best but stage two is very good I

00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:21,550
think it's one here it's not very good

00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:24,550
maybe so that's it just to summarize

00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,550
yeah

00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:32,960
ganz learn to generate new images okay

00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:34,520
they they generate they generate things

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,840
that's what's so exciting about them to

00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:40,870
cover the creative side of machine

00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,550
learning right they generate things

00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,990
discriminators that's why we use mostly

00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:47,540
used machine learning you just to tell

00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:50,090
us what something is or isn't right but

00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:56,270
generators can generate create that's

00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:58,490
why so exciting about oh but they take a

00:32:56,270 --> 00:33:02,630
lot of computer train a lot more than a

00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:05,720
normal Network but the generator can be

00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:09,110
exported and run in the browser I think

00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,300
I'm over time I think if you want to

00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:14,300
learn a little bit more about Ted's flow

00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,190
Jess I am considering writing a book so

00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:19,010
you take a screenshot of this if I get a

00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:20,760
hundred signups I think I'm about ninety

00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:23,130
right now such the tenth

00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:27,870
I will start a Kickstarter or something

00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:29,070
to decieve see fun writing it if you

00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:30,330
want to learn a little bit more about

00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:33,450
machine learning especially want to use

00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:35,190
some api's I have a module if you go

00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:36,330
there it's a tutorial step by step will

00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:38,430
shows you how to build something that

00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,680
emoji fire I have a slack box you're

00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:43,470
gonna learn more kind of simple API

00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:44,920
route and go that way and thank you for

00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:49,289
mystery time thank you

00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,289
