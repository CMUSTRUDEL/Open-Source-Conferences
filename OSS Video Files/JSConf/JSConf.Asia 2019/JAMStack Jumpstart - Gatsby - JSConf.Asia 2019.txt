	Speaker: Shawn Wang @swyx

There is a lot of developer and investment interest in JAMStack technologies, from the serverless movement to new authentication models to continuous atomic deployment to the static site generator renaissance. But with so many new terms and options, it is hard for people to figure out where to start.
This workshop will teach developers to set up a simple but state of the art Gatsby stack, which lets people create blazing fast sites and apps with React and GraphQL, backed up by a continuous deployment and serverless platform complete with authentication and CMS. It has never been easier to get a great Lighthouse score, or to deploy complex, secure webapps for free.

Requirements:
Attendees should have git, Node.js and npm installed, and be proficient with JavaScript and React (including routing with @reach/router or react-router). 
Install the Gatsby CLI's ahead of time: npm install -g gatsby-cli
You do not need to know GraphQL, but you can get a head start by reading https://graphql.org/learn/ and going through the Fundamentals section of https://www.howtographql.com/.
