Title: Music and Art with ML by Monica Dinculescu | JSConf.Asia 2019

Description: 
	People make things. You make things. Most of the time you make Very Serious Things™️ that help your bosses sell more shoes or saxophones or those tiny coffee packets. And that’s good, because you gotta eat and stuff. But something else has gotta eat, too: your brain. Music is creation, art is creation, code is creation. I think it’s important to goof around with code sometimes, or make things that let other people goof around with code. And sometimes, that becomes the Very Serious Thing™️. Magenta.js is one of these things; let's talk about it!

Monica works on Magenta, in Google Brain, where she makes generative music and art with Machine Learning. In the past she's worked on Polymer, web components, and Chrome, and has probably at least once broken the Internet for you. She is unreasonably excited about emoji, wary of web fonts, and will become your best friend if you bring her cheese. On second thought, she may be a mouse.

[Music]

00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,100
while I having a clapping mood can we

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,900
give a round of applause for the

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,550
organizers in the MC MCS because they

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,410
were not supposed to be doing that and

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:32,130
they were amazing and it's the end of

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:33,390
the day so super Hardy one thank you so

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,800
I'm so very excited about this talk and

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,360
how the schedule worked out because we

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,980
started with her arts in the morning and

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,040
we're gonna end with our night so it's

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,450
sort of like bookcase took the we booked

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,910
he's JavaScript with art and I think

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,500
that's really exciting I'm Monica

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,410
I'm not Waldorf on Twitter in internet

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,329
places that is my cat I do like cats I'm

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,309
an engineer at Google on a team called

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,170
magenta in Google brain so I work with a

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,190
whole bunch of researchers with machine

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,960
learning and I'm gonna tell you a little

00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,629
bit about that in a little bit because

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,449
first I'm gonna talk to you about my

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,220
favorite topping in the world myself if

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,330
you've ever heard about me it's probably

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,340
because I made something really dumb and

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,260
I put it on the internet and you played

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,210
with it because that's what I really

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,610
like doing I really like building silly

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,500
things and I kept calling them silly for

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,990
the blast like three or four years and I

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,150
realized it's not entirely clear what I

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,040
mean by silly because - you silly means

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,110
something else probably it might mean

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,420
that the thing that I make aren't

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,890
serious or aren't important I don't know

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,780
or I don't care about them and that's

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,820
not true everything that I make is like

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,229
my little darling I put a lot of time in

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,180
them sometimes it take me like six

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,460
months I love all of them whenever I put

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,659
them out there it stresses me out like

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,950
every good artist gives me anxiety

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,920
because you're gonna look at it and

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,259
judge it but silliness to me implies

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,600
that you can take it light heartedly you

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,100
could call it art but I don't art is the

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,689
word that I struggle with because I feel

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,909
like a society we sort of ruined the

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,020
word art when we refer to something as

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:56,430
art we have to judge it

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,930
everybody's been taught to like a look

00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,040
at a painting and be like I couldn't

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,649
make that in my living room

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,450
is it really art and then you don't

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,399
enjoy it you like put on your judging

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,159
hat and you start hating on it and I

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:07,390
don't

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,729
want to be on the receiving end of that

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,290
and in particular I just want you to

00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,880
have fun with them so this is why I call

00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,519
them silly they're not art they're just

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,890
silly things that he can interact with

00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:20,050
these are the kind of things that I make

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,910
this is called MIDI 32,000 and it

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,160
literally build cities out of rock and

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,840
roll if you think about a MIDI file

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,959
which is this abstract representation

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,670
for music MIDI files have different

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,590
instruments which you can think about

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,290
them as like rows of buildings like in

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,300
different places in your city and at

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,730
every point in time you play a note on

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,319
one of these instruments and the notes

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,120
are represented by pitches so at a point

00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,560
in time you basically have a pitch which

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,780
is like the height of the building and

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,489
its length it's a duration so this is

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,069
how MIDI cities actually look like

00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:52,630
cities MIDI cities got MIDI music

00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:54,790
actually looks like cities and of course

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:58,260
you can play them and if the sound gods

00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:03,780
work with us it should sound like this

00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,780
[Music]

00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:08,700
the great thing about this is that once

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,470
you understand that's what MIDI is like

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,209
you can start playing around with this

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,069
file you can throw away some of the rows

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:15,810
of the buildings you can increase the

00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:20,599
density or decrease it between these

00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,599
buildings and that makes a new song

00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:30,430
[Music]

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:40,440
it's not a good song but that's fine not

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,880
all the music that we make is good to

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,040
look at a lot of radio stations out

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,440
there and we make a lot of garbage why

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,510
not make garbage with JavaScript why why

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,830
is that stopping us and I really like

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,210
this project it's my favorite thing that

00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,880
I've ever made because it's not just

00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,710
visual it's a really weird and possibly

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,380
useless music instrument that you can

00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:01,110
play with and I like that it's silly

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,480
it's like the definition of my life um

00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,130
the thing about making things I make

00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,750
them because I like it but I make them

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,880
because making things is objectively

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,070
good there's a whole bunch of like

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,290
science research that shows that making

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:15,030
art actually helps you decrease your

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,250
cortisol levels it actually decreases

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,020
your stress and your anxiety if you

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,540
doodle while learning concepts you form

00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,100
like different connections in the brain

00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,540
and you learn things differently and it

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,060
helps you like reason through problems

00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,230
making things is objectively good so I

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,730
make these things because it's

00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,280
objectively good for me it's how I have

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,020
fun but in particular I make them so

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,460
that you can also make silly things with

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,130
me the things that I built aren't like

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,510
static art that you go and look at with

00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,010
your eyeballs I make things where you

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,170
can click on them and you can make music

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,120
with them that demo that I showed you is

00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,410
I'm glitch you can upload your own MIDI

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,460
files you can play with them you can

00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,040
download them you can put them on

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,990
soundcloud and call it your new album do

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,100
whatever you want with them and these

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,230
are the kind of things that I like I

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,820
want to be able to in some way help you

00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,650
with your creative process whether you

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,540
think you have won or not and sort of

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,880
extended and made it make a delightful

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,530
experience out of it and that's what

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,850
I've started calling generative delight

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:07,380
I used to call a generative art but

00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,910
that's a term that already exists and

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:10,260
it's well defined and I kept like

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,900
 around with the definition so I

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:14,910
stopped doing that and to me generative

00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,560
delight is this idea that I put a bunch

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:18,030
of code out there and then you put a

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,340
little bit of your creative process in

00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:22,500
it and then I throw in like a randomness

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,780
in the output and what we get out of it

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,180
is something that hopefully is you know

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,580
generated and also delightful generative

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,080
delight the first thing that I did are

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,760
on this topic I've been like working in

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,740
this area for it and I say working very

00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,740
very broadly because everything I make

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,690
is ridiculous but

00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,490
for three or four years and it's like

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,569
been getting better and worse at times

00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,330
the first thing that I ever made was

00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:45,500
emoji late which is a great and fun and

00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,539
useless app where you upload an image

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,900
and it gets pixelated and it replaces

00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:52,639
every pixel with an emoji excellent why

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,460
wouldn't you want that and I really like

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,889
it because obviously emoji but it's not

00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,740
exactly a successful project for that

00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:02,539
generally D'Lite idea because your

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,460
creative expression isn't really in

00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:06,289
there like sure you pick what image

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,940
you're uploading but you can't really

00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:09,349
control what emoji comes out of it it's

00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,000
not something that I built in its like

00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:12,979
picks the emoji that's closest to the

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,240
color of that pixel if you're having a

00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:16,460
bad day and you don't want to see any

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,620
like people in it tough luck it module

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,870
eight doesn't care the other part that I

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:24,050
really did not like about this is that

00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,550
that random delight isn't in there once

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,560
you look at this screen and I told you

00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,090
what emoji lead does you know exactly

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,979
well not exactly but like you have a

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,289
very good idea if you upload an image of

00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:35,060
a cat what that emoji lated cat is gonna

00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:36,080
look like you're gonna pixelate it in

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,659
your mind and you're gonna put a bunch

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,759
of like emoji of that color that do like

00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:43,789
that randomness isn't really there it's

00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,020
like fairly deterministic so in order to

00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:47,330
fix this because I was sort of in like

00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:50,180
this slump of not making the things that

00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,560
I wanted to do I introduced rules and if

00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,780
you talk to any artists out there rules

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,490
are like crucial to anybody producing

00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:57,050
anything because if the world is

00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,370
literally your oyster you're not gonna

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,219
be able to produce something that's very

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,280
honed in and very specific and I find

00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:05,990
the same thing happens in in any regular

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,669
in any like programming if you don't

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,069
have any rules the problem is really

00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:11,750
complicated you can like pick anything

00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:13,819
on like the server and the database and

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,289
your friend like a front-end framework

00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:16,759
and your whatever you want in the

00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:18,199
language and typescript in JavaScript

00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,080
and if you have to make all of these

00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:23,210
choices then you have less time to think

00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,680
about well what should your application

00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,020
do what is the experience you're trying

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,370
to communicate so the rules that I

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,590
introduced for basically that everything

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,819
that I made had to have emoji in it the

00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,800
thing that it was gonna do is just

00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:35,780
display emoji somehow to the user and

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,880
then once I figured that one out the

00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,110
thing that I had to focus on was well

00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,300
what are we gonna do with this emoji

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:43,580
what is this creative expression that I

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,960
have to do with emoji now that I work on

00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,909
a team that makes music pretty much

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,830
everything that I build touches mini

00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:50,449
files because that's the kind of thing

00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,580
that that doesn't kind of rule that I

00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:54,740
introduced right now so the next thing

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,900
that I built in this project was called

00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,240
emoji garden which generates a random

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,009
Garden of emoji things you can control

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,259
are the size of the garden and the

00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:06,110
density of snacks and visitors things

00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:08,960
you can't control anything else

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:12,080
this ended up being a surprisingly

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,659
wildly popular project for it like the

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,969
three hours that it took to make top

00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:18,439
highlight of my life Susan care the icon

00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:20,300
designer tweeted about it and then I

00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:22,249
died a little bit and I just went home

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,020
and celebrated Monica Lewinsky also

00:08:22,249 --> 00:08:27,499
tweeted about it so weird parts of my

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,689
world coming together but ironically

00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:32,630
this was also a failed project for me

00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:35,209
because it again did not have this

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:36,469
creative expression of yours in it you

00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:38,539
don't get to control anything you

00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:40,399
basically like roll the dice and it

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,990
generates the garden for you maybe

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,669
carrots killed your family and you would

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,380
prefer no carrots in your garden tough

00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:49,160
luck would you garden really doesn't

00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:50,180
care so this was a bit of a bummer cuz I

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,470
was like well I made something really

00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:54,949
fun but I didn't make the thing that I

00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:57,440
wanted to do again but it turned out to

00:08:54,949 --> 00:09:00,230
be an extremely successful generative

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,370
delight project because of the platform

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:05,029
that I built it on

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,800
I built it on glitch which is a platform

00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:08,810
that basically encourages collaboration

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,850
and remixes if you haven't seen it

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:14,690
before this is it it's basically a

00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:16,970
really fun and awesome code editor in

00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:19,160
your browser it lets you like watch the

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,329
output whatever but in particular it

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,779
tries to like build this community

00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:26,029
around projects and it encourages remix

00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,410
think of people's projects so people so

00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:29,120
I tend to ride my projects in a way

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,010
where people can look at the code really

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,069
easily and like change it if they want

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:35,720
to and to miri mixing is the premise of

00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:37,519
generative art you take something and

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,860
you regenerate it in a way that's like

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,209
makes sense to you so what what are not

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,649
happening with moji garden is that

00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:44,839
people took it and they started making

00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:47,209
their own garde gardens with it they

00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,889
remixed it into Hedgehog Gardens where

00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:52,519
only hedgehogs and no other animals were

00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:54,589
invited into really scary deserts that

00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:57,769
had scorpions and spiders and like a lot

00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:59,689
of fires because that was a snack they

00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:01,010
made into a sky because San Francisco

00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:02,240
has a lot of clouds and sometimes you

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,760
want to see a whole bunch of Suns in the

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,690
sky

00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,790
and they made that they also made void

00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,339
escapes which is my favorite I don't

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:15,329
know what it means and I love it

00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:17,040
it's like absolutely goth it's the gothy

00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:19,260
a-- sting i've seen done with javascript

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,050
sometimes you get like ominous eyeballs

00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:25,620
and labels that say that the end is near

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,449
and clocks and i love it like if I could

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,550
just have this projected in my house all

00:10:27,449 --> 00:10:33,180
the time I would it's brilliant

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,680
Audrey made this fantastic so the

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,839
surprise here in this project wasn't

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,110
what I made which wasn't generative

00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,910
delight it was glitch the platform made

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,130
a generative because the thing about art

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:46,350
or really anything is that we don't make

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:48,029
it into a void we live in this weird

00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,620
online world where everything is online

00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:50,190
happening all the time everywhere at

00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,410
once

00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,500
and the code that we use the devices

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,240
that we distributed on the way the way

00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,070
we put it out there all of these shape

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,370
the end result of what you're making and

00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:03,810
in here glitch shaped my project and it

00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,490
was wonderful and it wouldn't have been

00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:08,339
a successful project if glitch didn't

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,829
exist this isn't a weird thing like if

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:12,930
you think about like an oil painter if

00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:14,910
you take away his oil they're their oil

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:16,589
paints and you give them like thumbtacks

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,060
they're still going to produce art it's

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:19,649
just going to be very different that

00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,819
they were going that the thing that

00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:22,579
we're going to produce with oil

00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:26,819
paintings the same is gonna happen if

00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:28,680
you know I give you only a row of pixels

00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,029
and you have to produce art with it you

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,250
you will do it it's just gonna look

00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,139
different because everything that we

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:37,069
rely on is important for creativity and

00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:40,019
this is absolutely true of code as well

00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:42,329
the reason why emoji garden was so easy

00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,310
to remix is because of specific code

00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:46,130
decisions that I made and I'm gonna tell

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:48,930
you a little bit about this in a second

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:50,730
because if you want to build visual

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,050
things you should use visual libraries

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,519
and things that help you with it think

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,550
of something like processing.js it's a

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,860
library that's literally built for you

00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,120
know visual things so if you want to

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,800
build something visual processing will

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,850
help you with it if you want to build

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,459
something visually probably not gonna

00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:08,790
reach for C++ unless you're you like

00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:10,620
pain and memory leaks that's not to say

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,689
that you can't produce art with C++ you

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,240
absolutely can like there is wonderful

00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:16,980
WebGL like WebGL got Open GL

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,660
shaders and stuff in games and you know

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,029
every video game in my opinion is art

00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,069
it's just going to be harder because all

00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:25,470
of this time that you have to spend you

00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:26,670
know looking for pointers checking to

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,529
see if you've shot yourself in the foot

00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,120
when you're managing your memory and all

00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:32,550
of that stuff that's less time that you

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,050
have to be creative and to paint things

00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,310
on the screen which was the thing that

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:38,399
you originally wanted to do you wanted

00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:40,260
to like give the user some pixels so

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,180
emoji garden uses this library called

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,630
tracer ejs and tracer jeaious is built

00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:48,449
by kate compton for procedure art and

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:49,529
it's a super simple library that i want

00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:50,819
to show you how it works because without

00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:51,449
it emoji garden wouldn't have been

00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:54,329
possible

00:12:51,449 --> 00:12:57,390
so in tracery jsut basically define your

00:12:54,329 --> 00:12:59,010
world as a grid of available tokens so

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,260
here i think i picked em for either

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:03,480
Monica or a model I don't remember it

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,010
was like late at night before visitor

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,810
and as for snacks and this is what

00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,000
basically every garden looks like and I

00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:13,050
just randomize where these go I like

00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,550
Rolla dice so I tell tracery that this

00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,620
is my pattern and then I also tell it

00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:19,050
what values you can put in so I give it

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,689
like a set of tokens the model can be

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,189
cactuses and empty spaces the visitors

00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:25,829
can be like a mouse and a de life a

00:13:23,189 --> 00:13:27,630
little hot Hedgehog and then you paste

00:13:25,829 --> 00:13:29,069
you give these two things at tracery and

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,680
then tracery basically goes token for

00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:33,389
token and picks a random value from the

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,180
world that's all it does until it fills

00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:37,920
the entire grid this isn't hard like I

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,019
could have written this for loop I'm

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,610
competent at writing for loops I could

00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:43,350
have done this it's like for loops and

00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:47,010
like JavaScript random numbers which

00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:49,470
while weird are not that hard but I did

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:51,630
and I used a library that was made to

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,550
help me with this because that means

00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,529
that if somebody wanted to remix this

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,300
project they didn't have to know or read

00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:59,040
my for loops and like weird functions

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,779
that I declared all they had to do was

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,790
change the values of these tokens in the

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:05,100
world just change those like that world

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,810
object and everything else would get

00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,939
regenerated after they want like how

00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:10,339
they won and and this is why a lot of

00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:12,480
people that weren't even programmers

00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:13,889
managed to like take emoji guardant and

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,480
make their own gardens out of it and it

00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:18,480
was really great and that's what made a

00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,100
you know delightful to think about

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,199
tracer is that it's a serious libraries

00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,809
built by a serious person for serious

00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:28,270
things people use it to generate levels

00:14:24,809 --> 00:14:29,770
and video games or poems or stories or

00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,230
anything that you want people also use

00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:34,810
it to make a grid of ominous eyeballs

00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,610
and doomsday clocks and I think that's a

00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:38,950
really important thing because I think

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,930
about art is that you don't have to get

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:42,370
it somebody out there is going to get it

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:44,710
and it's fine if you don't get it

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't get Roy Lichtenstein that

00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,180
doesn't stop the MoMA from putting

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,540
pictures like his paintings in in their

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,730
museum so if we agree that making making

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,170
things is objectively good then we

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,150
should also agree that helping people

00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,260
make these things is also objective

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,940
really good and in particular it's

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,590
important so when I came to this

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,420
conclusion I was like oh this is

00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,650
what I this is what I want to work like

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,400
this is what I want to get paid for

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:11,410
helping people build sillier artsy

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,970
creative things and that's how I ended

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,430
up working on magenta which is the team

00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,470
that I work on now so budget is a team

00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,810
of researchers in a couple of Engineers

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:21,070
and a friend and engineering me and the

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:22,540
researchers are super smart and

00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,740
brilliant and do machine learning

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,300
research where they create these like

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,120
brilliant models that are able to

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,260
generate music and then I come in and I

00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,850
try to make a little JavaScript

00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,230
delightful interaction with it so that

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:34,690
other people take these models and

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:36,310
actually do useful things with them so

00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,470
the role of these team this team is to

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,990
explore the role of machine learning in

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,670
the creative process not replace the

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,740
creative process but sort of interact

00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:48,070
with it and see how we can help artists

00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,720
musicians and creators use machine

00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,150
learning to like make awesome with

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,800
it because for better for worse machine

00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,690
learning is like the hot new right

00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,090
now is a word that's being thrown around

00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:00,700
everywhere from like selling you better

00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:02,950
ads to selling me shoes on Instagram to

00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,800
cancer cells to self-driving cars to

00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:08,380
anything you want so why shouldn't it

00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,850
help us with music and art why is that a

00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:13,090
lesser area that we shouldn't be

00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,260
focusing on so before we even like to

00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,780
talk about music and art I want to give

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,100
you like the two-second introduction to

00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,000
machine learning because if you haven't

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,320
heard of it I don't want you to like

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,060
feel bad because machine learning is

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,130
really not that special it's like a

00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:26,440
glorified function we know functions

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,000
we've been writing algorithms and

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,480
functions for like all of our

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,920
professional life a classic algorithm or

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,330
function is to double a number this

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,800
one's an easy one you put in a number

00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,660
you double it and that's what our

00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,480
function looks like for any X we can

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,930
double it we can have more complicated

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,760
function

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,339
our algorithms like what would be the

00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,040
function to get from here to the closest

00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:49,839
kaya toast place there was like

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,310
algorithms for this like bellman-ford or

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,410
like better ones cuz bellman-ford is

00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:56,950
from like 30 years ago and it probably

00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:59,740
doesn't actually work with maps but we

00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:02,680
have this we can do this is not super

00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:05,439
hard but we have like functions that we

00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,699
don't really know how to write like how

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,010
would you write a function to decide if

00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:10,750
something's a dog or a cat so if I put

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,819
in a dog it says dog and if I put in a

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,339
cat it says cat and it does so reliably

00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:17,050
so if I put in a fancier kind of cat it

00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,120
still knows that it's a cat and if I put

00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:22,480
like a sausage dog it tells me it's a

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,260
dog and not a sausage but I don't know

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,480
how to write that

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:27,579
like what is a cat is like an

00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,710
existentialist crisis in my life because

00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,870
I live with a cat like what is a cat is

00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:36,100
it a lump of fur that just sits there

00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:37,300
and judges can I write that in binary no

00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,580
can I write that in JavaScript

00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,350
absolutely no you can start thinking

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,540
about heuristics like what makes a dog

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:46,210
maybe if it has like media like beady

00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,190
black eyes and like a snout but no

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,600
whiskers that's a dog but if it has

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,250
whiskers it's a cat but there's dogs

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,200
that have whiskers and there's cats that

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:57,429
look like dogs and there's blueberry

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,110
muffins that look like dogs so that is

00:17:57,429 --> 00:18:01,380
just not gonna fly right that's not a

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:03,460
function that we know how to write

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,140
there's if you google this you're gonna

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:09,550
get like tons of like dogs that look

00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:11,890
like foods because these are that's what

00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,030
we do if we write functions so that's

00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,380
what machine learning comes into play

00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,240
where she learning is just a different

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,130
way of writing these functions so that

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,710
it figures out what that function is by

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:23,170
just feeding it examples I don't need to

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:25,270
know what makes a dog dog I just need to

00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,130
give it enough examples of a dog so that

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,870
if it sees any dog it goes yep that's a

00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:31,540
dog because that's what we really do as

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,360
humans we've seen a lot of dogs in the

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,429
world that's how we know what a dog is

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,780
so the way we train these models and

00:18:36,429 --> 00:18:39,760
what I mean by model I mean this

00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,410
function whenever you hear a machine

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,760
learning person be like I use the model

00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,190
to predict they just mean what is the

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,230
output of the function so to train this

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:50,110
model we basically feed it by hand

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:52,150
labeled examples so we know this is a

00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:53,650
dog and we know this is a cat so we fit

00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,450
it feet on a picture of a dog where we

00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,160
know what the answer is

00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,260
but we don't tell it we're tricking the

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,550
model because we're cruel like that it's

00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,770
like those people who are pushing those

00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:03,300
robots like the you know the robots that

00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:04,560
look like dogs and they're like putting

00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:07,020
all these videos of like look at this

00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,020
dog falling over and getting up they're

00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,340
the first to die in the robot apocalypse

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,290
not us we are nice we're feeding at

00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,190
pictures of dogs so we put in this

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,110
picture of a dog and we're like hey

00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,370
model what is it and the model doesn't

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,990
know at this point so he goes is it a

00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:20,760
cat and you're like oh that's silly this

00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,410
is a dog and then you give it a picture

00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,940
of a cat and the model goes I don't know

00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,590
is this a cat here's like very good

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,050
model you're doing great that is a cat

00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,490
and then you do this a million times and

00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:32,280
I'm not kidding about this I literally

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:34,170
mean like the data sets have a million

00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,640
data points of dogs and cats and the

00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,680
model looks at it over and over and over

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,080
again until it goes listen I think I got

00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,000
it I most of the time I don't get this

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,050
wrong and I think I know it so then when

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,040
you show it a picture of a dog it goes

00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:47,220
yes it's a dog and you're like

00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,780
absolutely you did it of course this

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,010
depends on like what kind of data you're

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,860
putting and if you're only putting in

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,910
pictures of cats and golden retrievers

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,620
machine learning isn't magic this

00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,790
function isn't magic if you show it a

00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,800
picture of a beagle but you've only

00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,180
trained in golden retrievers it's not

00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,920
going to know this as a dog it's

00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,540
probably gonna flip a coin this is how

00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,400
we get racist algorithms and though in

00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,720
the world by the way it's because we

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,370
only feed at pictures of white people

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,050
and then we like ask it to categorize a

00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,700
black person and it goes monkey because

00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,260
it hasn't seen a black person because

00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,700
you're a terrible engineer and what are

00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,610
you doing with that data this makes me

00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,170
really angry so training data is really

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,750
important so this is how he trying to

00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:22,710
machine learning models see it's done

00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,120
behind the scenes it's like really

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,100
complicated but it doesn't matter

00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,690
because what we need to understand

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,110
machine learning is like how you know

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:32,220
the basics of it and how it works so

00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,630
machine learning hasn't isn't

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,890
particularly new I think like the first

00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,990
neural networks that were like in the

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,300
60s and the 70s we've had quite a long

00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:41,250
time with them but they haven't exploded

00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:44,550
to like five or ten years ago really

00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:46,200
five years ago because we used to suck a

00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:48,780
lot in machine learning our computers

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,870
were really slow we didn't have GPUs so

00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,950
we were really bad at doing matrix math

00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:54,540
machine learning is all matrix math

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,040
nowadays and in particular we didn't

00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,870
have any of these training data sets

00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,220
like the cats and the dogs that I showed

00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,070
you we didn't have a million data points

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,920
and if we did they were really pixelated

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:06,090
so we weren't really able to like

00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,380
generate really good cats or dogs

00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,090
so we

00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,440
really good at this because the methods

00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,420
got better the algorithms got better

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,160
GPUs are like powerful and we've

00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,630
sacrificed a lot of goats and firstborn

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,320
and now we have like incredibly fast

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:20,670
computers and it's great so because

00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,020
we're really good at this we are so

00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:23,610
really good at generative model so the

00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,710
model that I showed you before is called

00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:28,470
a classifier what it's really good at is

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:30,120
basically labeling data it looks at a

00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:31,740
cat and goes yes it's a cat a generative

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,050
model is something that without any

00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,300
input generates something so for example

00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:38,130
it would be able to generate cats and

00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,750
dogs that look like the cats and dogs

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:42,480
and the data set but aren't memorized

00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:45,270
the joy just like them but not exactly

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,370
the same and we've got a really good at

00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,980
these two with with a model called again

00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:53,580
a general general address all your

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,950
network which is notably really good at

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:59,820
generating faces that don't exist it's

00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:01,110
wildly creepy this this is a set of

00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,060
websites that used to exist that got

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,490
taken down because holding servers up is

00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:07,170
hard but none of these people are real

00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,420
these people don't exist in real life

00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:11,520
these people are the output of a machine

00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,740
learning algorithm that is really really

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,330
really good at generating believable

00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,040
faces and if you want to know about how

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:20,190
this works come chat with me later it's

00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,060
actually really interesting but this is

00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,620
the thing that we're really good at

00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,090
we're really good at generating cats

00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,540
that don't exist and sometimes they have

00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:29,520
like weird artifacts like the one on the

00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:32,310
unicorn side of the stage but they're

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,810
still like very believable cats we can

00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:38,700
generate rooms that don't exist oh all

00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:39,960
of these by the way are because for

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,150
better or for worse these are the

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,560
datasets that we have so like machine

00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,970
learning researchers are like well the

00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:49,050
data sets that I have are people cats

00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:51,960
and Airbnb is so let's do it but none of

00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:53,370
these rooms again exist like this is a

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,410
completely like a machine learning

00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,840
algorithm dreamed up this bedroom that

00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:01,230
now exists and is going for like

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,610
probably a billion pounds in London but

00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,130
we're not just good at like images we're

00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:07,620
also in the in recent time became really

00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:09,690
good at music so a transformer is a

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,390
different kind of model that's usually

00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,550
used for language but music is a little

00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:18,560
bit like language so now we're able to

00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:18,560
generate things that sound like this

00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:42,930
[Music]

00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:45,990
and it goes on forever because the model

00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:47,850
doesn't know how to end songs that's

00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,590
based on research by like one of my

00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,390
coworker is called Anna Huang and she's

00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,980
brilliant as she's going to solve music

00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,840
so it's really great we're able to like

00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,630
generate music but what does that mean

00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:00,270
to a musician or to an artist because I

00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:01,710
don't want somebody to generate music

00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,320
for me I want them to generate music

00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:07,440
with me I want it to be a really smart

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,730
instrument because we live in this world

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,130
were like technologies everywhere my

00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,940
kitchen faucet is literally

00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,160
voice-activated I can tell it to

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,290
dispense me a cup of water it's helpful

00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,840
sometimes not helpful most of the time

00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:21,360
but I play music in the same way that I

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,520
did 15 years ago I have a physical piano

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,930
and I sit at it and I'm still really bad

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,490
at composing and I make a lot of

00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,740
mistakes and nobody tells me how to fix

00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:31,020
these mistakes and what I want in the

00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,790
world are these better weirder more

00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:35,220
surprising more inspiring more

00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:37,140
configurable instruments and interfaces

00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,640
to make music that can help me make

00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,760
better music because that's what I want

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,120
to do interfaces like this this is a

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,550
demo made by taro using one of the

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,200
magenta models so he basically generates

00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:51,090
a whole bunch of melodies with one of

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,520
our models and then as you go up and

00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:56,280
down the key that that melody is in and

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,650
as you go left to right the melody

00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:01,290
changes so with this instrument you can

00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:17,960
make things like this

00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:22,290
[Music]

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,820
that's a good song we also had something

00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,380
like the Google Doodle that he may have

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,200
seen for box birthday like about a month

00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,080
ago where there was this little app that

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,000
lets you enter a melody and it would

00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,870
like harmonize with you and make a box

00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:39,000
sounding for voice Corral and this was a

00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,080
fun little game but we also explored

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,760
what it would look like if we're going

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,710
to build like a fuller instrument for

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,280
somebody to compose with so I built this

00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:48,750
like side app for it where you basically

00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:52,760
get to like interact with a model more

00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,760
so you get to like draw a little melody

00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,519
which you might recognize as the legal

00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:06,230
version of seven nation army and then we

00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,789
can ask the model to like fill in this

00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:10,269
melody and give us the other three

00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:10,269
voices

00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,700
but then we can also play with like

00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,470
whatever attributes the model exposes so

00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,270
temperature is a thing that and machine

00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,100
learning sort of means a randomness so

00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:32,140
if I decrease the temperature sort of

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,140
like the entropy of it it's conservative

00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:42,769
or I can crank up the temperature and

00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:44,419
make it like super random and it's going

00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,799
to put a lot of like arbitrary notes in

00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:49,280
there they don't really match and make

00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:54,630
Bach like shudder

00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:56,700
[Music]

00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,260
and at this point like everything is

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,090
configurable you can start like erasing

00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,799
some of the notes asking the model to

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:03,470
like infill a particular section maybe

00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:06,059
throw away a whole bunch of things and

00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,590
like try to play with it and compose in

00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:09,210
this app and at the end you can download

00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:11,820
the MIDI and it's your MIDI you've

00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,780
composed a new melody with it and these

00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:15,330
are the kind of things that we want to

00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,850
build we can also build weird interfaces

00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:20,490
where we figured out there's a model one

00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:23,280
of our nerve residents built where you

00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,750
summarize 88 keys on a piano to eight so

00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,860
rather than playing the whole piano you

00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:38,460
can play eight of them

00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:38,460
[Music]

00:27:40,019 --> 00:27:43,929
and you're really prolific and great and

00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:45,969
you might be like well that's silly what

00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:48,489
applications do you have of this but the

00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:50,049
Flaming Lips use this at Google i/o for

00:27:48,489 --> 00:27:51,909
their concert but rather than playing

00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:54,279
eight buttons they played fruit we

00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:56,049
connected those eight buttons to a Miki

00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:58,409
Miki and then as they were playing the

00:27:56,049 --> 00:28:00,999
fruit the model would like make the next

00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:03,729
correct node and like it was a really

00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:05,799
fun interactive thing we've also built a

00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:08,080
set of Ableton plugins because it turns

00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:09,219
out music musicians live in Ableton so

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,450
we were like well what it would look

00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:12,129
like if you put these machine learning

00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,379
models in Ableton would that be useful

00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:16,450
and you can go read about them because

00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:19,419
I'm already gonna be five minutes over

00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,499
time and we can do this with art - we

00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:22,599
don't just do it with music

00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:26,080
we're just most of us are musicians less

00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:27,879
artists nobody cares about me we have

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,559
models that have looked at people

00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:31,389
sketching things so they're really good

00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:33,339
at drawing cats like a million people

00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:35,200
draw cats so I build this silly thing

00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:37,179
where you start drawing a cat and then

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,559
the model continues it for you and then

00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:42,190
you can draw a whole bunch of different

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:44,649
animals like a crab or a truck that's

00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:49,059
gonna be off-screen it has wheels

00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:51,070
thank you swear or a whale and this

00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:52,690
isn't art I understand this is an art

00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,700
when I said that I have a problem with

00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,679
the word art I understand fully that you

00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,239
should judge this this is not art but it

00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,129
doesn't mean he can't be first of all

00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:01,929
kids love the out of this and

00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:03,789
second of all if you spend time like

00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:05,049
putting a model that also understands

00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,940
painting and stuff like that you can

00:29:05,049 --> 00:29:09,009
start making believable things with this

00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,200
the things that we make and on the

00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:12,849
magenta team isn't like products that we

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,409
make money out of we make models and

00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:16,599
then experiences so that people can use

00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:18,999
them and you can make money out of it

00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:20,379
and the thing about all of the demos

00:29:18,999 --> 00:29:22,119
that I showed you literally all of them

00:29:20,379 --> 00:29:23,589
is that they're all done in JavaScript

00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:25,629
we have a library it's open source it's

00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:28,330
called magenta Jas and it's built on top

00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:29,559
of tensorflow J's in such a way that you

00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,700
can use all of this machine learning

00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,200
without having to know what machine

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,419
learning is the models are pre-trained

00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,950
the api's are super simple so that you

00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:38,909
can take them and just make whatever

00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:41,679
your heart desires and it's really easy

00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:43,989
that spinners the incredible spinners

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,650
the way those random melodies were

00:29:43,989 --> 00:29:46,540
generated

00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:48,820
is with this model called music VA

00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:51,130
that's good at generating fairly robotic

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,690
sounding music let's be very honest so

00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,280
you create a model and then you ask it

00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,870
to give you a sample and this gives you

00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,309
back a sequence which is a lot like MIDI

00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,230
is just like an object it looks like

00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:01,450
MIDI and then you can create a player

00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,220
which wraps tone jeaious because making

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,750
web audio and the browser in 2019 is

00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,880
actually still horrifyingly hard and you

00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,410
should never do that so the player does

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,520
all of that heavy lifting for you and

00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,020
then you'd give it the sequence and you

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,850
go players start and then you can hear

00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:15,280
it in a synthesizer or a piano or

00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:16,330
whatever you want and I'm not like

00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,620
pulling your leg here it's literally

00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:22,210
like four lines of code to generate

00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:23,559
infinitely sounding melodies maybe you

00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,720
want to put that into the Bach chorale

00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:27,220
you can take the sequence that again the

00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,720
robots generated for you

00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,520
you can create the other model called

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,380
coconut which is the one that does the

00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,760
Bach infilling and then you can ask it

00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,679
to infilled that sequence and it gives

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,540
you back a four voice sequence or a

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,010
chorale and then you can again pass that

00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:42,250
to the player and go play or play me

00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:44,500
this and this is exactly how you you you

00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,809
generate all of those Corral's in the

00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,059
demo that I showed you the piano genie

00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:50,860
with a fort live with the eight buttons

00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:52,330
super similar you create the model you

00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,830
ask you you tell you that you've pressed

00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,000
a button and like how random you want

00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:57,070
the output to be and it gives you the

00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,440
next note over and over and over again

00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:02,080
as you're playing it and the reason why

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,580
we work on this library is because we

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,590
really believe that code should never

00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:08,410
hold back art if that API looks

00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:10,150
surprisingly easy it's not a random it's

00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,620
a deliberate decision because when we're

00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,120
a meeting with musicians it turns out

00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,070
musicians don't really know how to

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,470
install Python and Python dependencies

00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:20,260
and get our Python code that would take

00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,760
like 17 command-line parameters to work

00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,040
and then we'll give you like a MIDI file

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,090
in your temp directory you just don't

00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,010
really know how to do this they used

00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:29,440
Ableton and we want people to build

00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,520
tools for musicians because that's the

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,679
people that we want to interact with

00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,330
artists and creators not just like

00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:37,030
engineers who really want to write

00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,820
snakes on their computer snakes is what

00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:40,990
I call Python feel free to take that one

00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:43,480
spiders is what I call JavaScript your

00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,740
future take that one too and this makes

00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:46,929
sense if you think of your favorite

00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:49,300
painter or like artist the guy's one of

00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:51,190
mine did God didn't make his own pastels

00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,140
he bought them from Cinelli which was a

00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:55,090
man who spent his entire life making

00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,410
chalk pastels he couldn't draw worth

00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,150
 and they got couldn't make his own

00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:59,760
pastels

00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:01,200
yo-yo ma doesn't build his own cellos he

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,770
like buys them from people who made them

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,720
in the 1600s the artists don't shouldn't

00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:08,430
make the tools to make the art they're

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,620
there to make the art itself

00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:12,180
because at the end of the day the medium

00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,890
influences how the message is perceived

00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:17,430
this is a quote by Marshall McLuhan who

00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:19,170
is a Canadian go Canada but it's trying

00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:21,059
to tell you that like models don't exist

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,890
in a void they exist in like this

00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:24,750
artistic environment that we live in and

00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,550
how we deliver these models to people

00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,559
and what you do with the models is the

00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:31,230
thing that messes that matters that is

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,090
the medium so I want to show you I'm

00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:36,660
going to end with like these examples of

00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:39,240
a couple of art installations remember

00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,740
the creepy generated images of people

00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:43,590
that don't exist that we're really good

00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,850
at Mario Clingerman has an art

00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:47,130
installation has several art

00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:49,410
installations actually that uses that

00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:51,510
algorithm to generate infinitely many

00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:54,360
portraits so as you come into this room

00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:56,160
these paintings of people just get

00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,929
generated for ever and ever and you can

00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,450
look at them the thing about this

00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:01,800
installation is that it wasn't possible

00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:03,570
five years ago it wouldn't have been

00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,550
possible without these machine learning

00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:08,190
algorithm the algorithms that we have

00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:11,100
today a painter is not able to generate

00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:12,870
infinitely many portraits we can count

00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:16,350
to infinity it's like a lot it takes a

00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:18,059
bunch of time so this is a way that we

00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,980
can use machine learning in art and

00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:22,380
still maintain that integrity of art

00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,420
this is one of my favorite things that

00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:26,280
I've ever seen in my life it's an art

00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,440
installation called peeping skulls by

00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,780
Robbie Barrett and Ronon Burroughs same

00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,429
name different people Robbie Barrett is

00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,350
an artist it is a lot of art with

00:33:32,429 --> 00:33:36,660
artificial intelligence and Ronon

00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:38,970
Barrett is an oil painter so they got

00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,960
together and based on running Barrett's

00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:41,910
painting style

00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,950
Robbie trained a model to generate

00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:45,600
skulls that look like Ronon would have

00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:49,140
painted them and they actually exhibited

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:52,440
this as an installation next to physical

00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:55,170
paintings of these skulls in a museum

00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:57,000
and what happens in this installation is

00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:58,380
that he walk up to it and then you look

00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,179
and it tells you what's about to happen

00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,460
you're going to get generated a random

00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:05,340
skull that looks like a run and Barrett

00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,960
oil painting this is this one and you

00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,500
get to look at it for five to ten

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,500
seconds

00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,360
and then it disappears forever and it's

00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,010
been marked in the algorithm machine

00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:17,169
learning algorithm so that I can never

00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:18,760
get generated again if the out of the

00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:20,350
machine learning algorithm tries to

00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,970
generate this again if the model does it

00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:24,040
it's going to try to generate another

00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:26,560
one this was your skull and your skull

00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,270
alone and in this weird Instagram world

00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,100
where you post like our entire lives two

00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:32,650
stories this is like an amazing

00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,210
commentary about this intimacy of this

00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:35,950
art experiments where we can all

00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,510
experiment like we can all live this

00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:38,620
experiment but never share what we

00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:41,409
actually saw and I think this is

00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:44,080
fantastic there's this great quote from

00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:46,390
Brian Eno that says that what you now

00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:48,190
find weird ugly uncomfortable and nasty

00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,850
about a new medium will surely become

00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,560
its signature

00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:52,240
the distorted guitar sound is the sound

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,550
of something too loud for the medium

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,560
supposed to carry it everything that you

00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:59,320
love in the world right now has at one

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:02,110
point been judged and looked down by

00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,600
people probably white men from weird

00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:06,130
music - Impressionism - cubism -

00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,920
assembling your own Swedish chairs in

00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:11,560
your living room and making art with AI

00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:13,780
and math and algorithms isn't new and

00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,160
maybe feels uncomfortable now but that

00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,750
doesn't mean we shouldn't encourage it

00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,940
to grow because I think it's got great

00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:21,220
opportunities and I think this means

00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,560
that a lot of us should start making

00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,710
really serious things so that you know

00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,810
somewhere out there somebody can make a

00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,400
random painting of a skull that exists

00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,180
for five seconds and then it disappears

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,750
forever

00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,750
