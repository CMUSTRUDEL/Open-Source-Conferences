Title: Getting Closure on React Hooks by Shawn Wang | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-24
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	The design of React Hooks requires a good understanding of closures in JavaScript. In this talk, we’ll reintroduce closures by building a tiny clone of React! This will serve two purposes – to demonstrate the effective use of closures, and to show how you can build a Hooks clone in just 29 lines of readable JS. Finally, we arrive at how you get Custom Hooks and the Rules of Hooks out of this incredible mental model!

00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,740
hi everyone

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,380
my name is Sean and I'm here to talk

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,420
about hooks what's really great is

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,880
inconvenient is that half the room

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,830
already knows hooks and users react so I

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,630
don't have to introduce it very much my

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,940
name is Sean I go by Swick's on Twitter

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,219
I work at Nikola Phi is a developer

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,920
experience engineer I I moonlight as a

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,140
moderator on the reax subreddit there's

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,790
120,000 of us talking about react and

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,149
getting jobs and getting started and

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:47,460
react if you want to join in hire people

00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:49,140
please join us and my other big thing is

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,850
that I learned in public so anything

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,860
that I learned I try to do talks and

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,949
blog posts and share stuff and this is

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,719
one of those so I'm gonna start this

00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:59,219
talk by talking about Rene Magritte he's

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,570
one of these painters you might

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,920
recognize the painting in the background

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,870
that's one of his more famous ones

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,820
that's the man in the bowler hat and he

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,380
does several variations of this this

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,720
one's probably you've seen this as well

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,909
and they're all surrealist like they

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,530
look they look really good he has skills

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:15,810
but he just paint something that's not

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,479
exactly real and it's meant to make you

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,909
slightly disturbed slightly like out of

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,020
out of kilter this one's also I really

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,189
like this because it's like that it's

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,740
just like a floating rock that's

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,020
probably the inspiration for Pandora and

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,150
and this one I also like it's just kind

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,619
of like there's like human intimacy but

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,470
they're not really seeing each other you

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,420
can't see them he has a thing against

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,119
painting faces this one's about I think

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,369
in the impermanence of life like things

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,520
remain and the the man just goes away

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:48,000
anyway the most famous one is probably

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,829
this one I'm not good at French so but

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,780
it just says this is not a pipe it's a

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,460
picture of a pipe is not a pipe so it's

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,229
a it's a it's an interesting useful

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,030
model for people to discuss it's meant

00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:58,740
to make you slightly off-kilter but well

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,479
I think I think it's actually useful

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,290
right like you can you can point to this

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,130
and everyone knows what you're talking

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:08,009
about as a pipe and this is the the

00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,720
frame that I want to set this talk with

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,450
like this is not a pipe but it is a

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,200
useful discussion of a pipe

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,849
how does

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,860
I have to and I'm updated it for the

00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:18,959
Millennials so this is a little bit more

00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,420
updated in terms of a meme that meme was

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,040
like a hundred years old this is bit

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:27,269
more recent and this is the more recent

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,730
one I always yeah I'm very good with

00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:31,140
means so so how does that have to do

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,459
with ReactOS I'm gonna assume that

00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,519
everyone's seen the talks and see the

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,720
see the video as in see the docs

00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:40,410
obviously go go check it out if you have

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,030
it and mainly hooks were meant to

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,180
replace on the problems with classes and

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,950
in particular binding that this that's

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,510
not the only issue and that's not the

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,480
primary issue but that is one of the

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,980
issues but but we happen to have

00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,560
exchanged the problem with that with

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,599
with with closures there you start to

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,250
run into stale closures all the time and

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,349
having to refresh your memory on what

00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,030
closures are so I was I was running

00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,610
today as well as well as adopting hooks

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,829
and so I looked for a startled look for

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:09,329
definitions obviously you turn the mdn a

00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:10,860
closure is a combination of a function

00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:13,049
in mexico environment with a function

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,709
was declared very clear right and blah

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:18,840
blah blah like i look at all these

00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:20,970
comments and honestly the the most clear

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,250
one was actually w3schools it's a

00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,260
closure makes it possible for a function

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,880
to have private variables that's the

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:31,260
only time I've ever found w3schools

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:35,160
useful but thank you anyway

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,600
so so then I have this exercise of like

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,850
why not write hooks from scratch and

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,230
practice closures as well because if it

00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,660
can have private variables I kind of

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,389
stateful functions so this is the part

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:49,560
where we start live coding and we have

00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:51,900
time okay so what do I mean by stateful

00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,549
functions let's just have a variable on

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,660
the global scope I hope this is big

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:56,549
enough for everyone

00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:58,139
variable on a global scope and I'm gonna

00:03:56,549 --> 00:04:03,180
constantly I only have a function called

00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:06,359
add if I can spell under intense

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,620
scrutiny in pledge then pressure food

00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:14,970
plus one it's going to return foo and

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:16,650
now every time I call it it's gonna

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,510
increment by one right it's a stateful

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:20,280
function in the sense that as every time

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,470
I call it there's some internal state

00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,570
going on that's that's that's being

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,229
mutated and and and you can see the

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,030
result of that the problem of this is is

00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:31,009
thus the the fou variable is on the

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,960
global scope so any intermediate script

00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:35,240
can just mess of it right like I can

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,880
just say like food 999 and that screws

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,650
up my my expectations of what's supposed

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,380
to happen if I make if I'm writing a

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,180
library that's not a good it's not

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,340
that's not very secure so I need to

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,080
contain I need to protect this variable

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,120
somehow and move it off the global scope

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,430
and how do I do that I move that inside

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,229
the scope of the of the function right

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:58,130
and so now JavaScript just refuses to

00:04:54,229 --> 00:05:00,050
run it just doesn't let you modify food

00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,630
that's great but I give up

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,520
the statefulness I gave I just call it

00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:07,099
every single time in it and it just has

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,680
the same has the same value so how do i

00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:11,690
how do I fix this I can't exactly fix

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,530
this with this API what I can do is

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:17,419
return a function inside of the function

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,870
and do the exact same thing inside there

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:22,490
I'm just a switch this to get add

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,490
function higher-order function I guess

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:28,400
and I'm gonna call get add in there and

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,169
now it still works again I have a state

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,510
I have my stateful function back and I

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:34,220
cannot touch foo inside and internally

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,690
right so those are the requirements that

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,949
we want we want stateful functions and

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:38,330
we want them to be protected we on that

00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,210
state to be protected

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,430
the last JavaScript refresher so this is

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,680
a closure right I add the add function

00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,080
is this anonymous function in here and

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,180
it closes over this full variable that's

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,669
inside of the get add function no one

00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,880
else can access it but and can access it

00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:57,199
every time is executed that's closure so

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,310
the last thing I'm gonna remind you and

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,099
then we will actually start to clone

00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,500
react is that if I don't want this ugly

00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:05,900
get add thing it's kind of ugly I can

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,960
just delete this replace get add with a

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:10,550
parenthesis and I'll just paste it in

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,530
there and it does exactly the same thing

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,720
so this is the module pattern it's also

00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,550
called be Fe the immediately invoking

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,220
function expression a lot of you are

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,560
seen if you look at bundler output

00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,419
alright let's clone react so first thing

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,820
when I clone is the used state variable

00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:32,180
you state hook it takes an initial value

00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:34,639
and in its vowel I'm gonna call it and

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,039
what does it return it returns a state

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,970
and it's set state I'm going to refer a

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,280
lot by the way to the

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,080
that the docs like if people knew if

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,470
people knew to hugs definitely check out

00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,180
the docs first before watching this talk

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,620
so how do you how do you define state

00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,240
and set state how do you implement that

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,860
we're just gonna have some internal

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,480
variable that's just called the internal

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,060
value and we're just gonna initialize it

00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,250
to in it Val we're gonna have state and

00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:02,220
it's just a sign that - Val for now this

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,420
is wrong but we just get something

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,640
showing on the screen and then we'll

00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:09,960
modify from there set state takes a new

00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:14,190
value and it sets that new value to the

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:16,830
internal Val okay good so now we have

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:21,480
hooks in node let's use it count set

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:24,420
count so this is D structuring or ad

00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,340
structuring and and all that so again

00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,040
these are all standard JavaScript

00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,720
patterns that are pretty handy when

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,600
doing this and then now we're gonna

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,910
console dot log count we're going to set

00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,860
counts to two and then we're gonna

00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,960
console out count again so what I expect

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,900
is to log out one and two

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:45,090
unfortunately I log out one and one over

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,470
here and that means that I'm not really

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,930
it's not really working

00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,980
unfortunately it actually is that set

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,810
count is working

00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,760
it's modifying internal value but the

00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,250
problem is when ID structure this counts

00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,810
is assigned the value of one and it is

00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,340
one here and it is one here that's what

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,440
we're logging out one so we need

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,260
someplace to just repoed the internal

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,030
state again one easy it's very cheap way

00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,980
to do it is to turn the state into a

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:11,640
getter function and now I can just call

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:13,080
get I just call the function and now I

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,919
have my state full function back again

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,450
so one into and and and this is kind of

00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,770
hooks in note if you need hooks in node

00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,410
that's that's all the implementation

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,450
it's eight lines but we want to do more

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,890
than that the in reacts you don't call a

00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,630
getter function you just used the

00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,250
variable and it's live every time and

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,169
it's just fresh and it's the correct

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:33,120
value don't you don't call it a weird

00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:35,250
getter function so we want to model that

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,510
but it involves a pretty large refactor

00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,530
I'm gonna walk you through it you

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:39,120
already know everything that you need to

00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,409
know so I'm gonna zoom a little bit all

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,990
right so the first thing we want to do

00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,750
is put our hook inside of a reactive

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:48,000
module I'm gonna cut this I'm going to

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,430
introduce a react module it's going to

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
be a function that I immediately invoke

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,460
right

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,700
I'm gonna paste my hook in there and I'm

00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,800
gonna return an object that has a u

00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,840
state property so now the only thing

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,790
I've changed is in my usage I can call

00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,370
react use state and it does exactly the

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:08,610
same thing everyone with me alright okay

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:11,310
cool so so I've done I put I created my

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,050
react module and I've sort of wrapped up

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,740
my functionality I can do that to my

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,420
hook as well

00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:20,030
what wraps are on a hook a component

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:23,220
right so I can declare a component and

00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:25,440
and that's just a regular function and

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,900
put the hook in there normally I'd be

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,770
rendering to the Dom but in this case I

00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,110
don't have a door might just have the

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:34,440
console so I'm just going to return an

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,260
object and simulate that we'll get to

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,600
the other stuff in a second so render

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:42,960
I'm gonna have consult log counts and

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,280
then click this is just for simulating I

00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,210
don't have a button so we're just gonna

00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:50,910
roll with this it's the best you got and

00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:53,760
I'm just gonna put in an object yeah

00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:55,410
forget the object okay so so the last

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,720
thing that we need to do is we need to

00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,280
teach we have react and we have the

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,960
component we need we need to we need to

00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,110
teach react how to render the component

00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:08,070
so that's right the render function it

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:10,560
takes a component and a component is

00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:16,410
just a function right so let's just call

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:18,360
it and then the when you call it you get

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,040
an object that has a render and it click

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,260
right so let's just called the render

00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,670
all right let's actually just put log

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,110
something out on the screen and then

00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,300
we'll just return it so that we can do

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,580
other stuff with the component and I'm

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,890
gonna expose that inside of my react

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,360
module over here so we're at 16 lines

00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,220
not too bad

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,900
and now I can replace all this logging

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:42,839
stuff and do something like react render

00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,610
component we should see something show

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,790
up on the screen up that's not exactly

00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:49,350
what I want but whatever and I can

00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,720
because there's there's a return value

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,000
over here I can take this and I can

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,820
start accessing stuff on the object

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,710
right like the click function that I

00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:02,010
wrote so I can just say click and I can

00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:03,680
render it again react I'll click is not

00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:06,199
a function oh it's

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,999
okay cool it's a little bit like TDD

00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,930
instant feedback in this rebel thing is

00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:11,029
really nice

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,439
okay so the only thing that's wrong with

00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:13,850
this now is I'm logging the state get er

00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,959
right that's the that's the thing that

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,699
we did just now there was like a hacky

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,550
thing let's just get rid of that let's

00:11:16,699 --> 00:11:23,689
lift the value up to the the internal

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:26,059
value up to the scope of react and we're

00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:27,649
going to get rid of the getter function

00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:29,600
we don't need it anymore and we're just

00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:31,939
gonna let the getter function close over

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,399
the internal value the the you stay

00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:37,220
close over the internal value so now it

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:43,369
just returns every single time it

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:50,059
renders so so this is the okay so this

00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:52,610
is I'm running into something that I

00:11:50,059 --> 00:12:00,730
didn't expect over here so I'm gonna try

00:11:52,610 --> 00:12:04,040
to debunk a little bit I think okay so

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:06,439
it comes yeah I think I think I said

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,809
comes oh yeah I need two plus one of

00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:10,069
course if I'm selling cars to the

00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:13,550
original accounts it's not gonna

00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:15,350
increment so yeah okay so I practice

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,480
this a lot so it's very unusual for me

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,800
to screw up like that so you can see we

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,970
have our stateful functions back right

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,800
but we've gone through a whole buncha

00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,350
ceremony but now we have a react module

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,990
we have a component right it kind of

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,790
looks like a component and and we can we

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,889
can do things to the component and it

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,740
updates in state so that's really good

00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:35,959
until you try to have multiple states

00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,949
multiple hooks so let's just have a text

00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:38,689
hook it's gonna look slightly different

00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:40,759
so that you can differentiate between

00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:42,379
the number and the text I'm gonna call

00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,050
it apple just because that's the first

00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:47,360
thing I think about I'm gonna log it out

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:48,860
as well so we're gonna log it out in our

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,100
render and I'm gonna have a new method

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm just going to call it type I'm just

00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:58,129
gonna take a word and it's gonna set

00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:01,759
text to that word okay let's get rid of

00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:03,949
this and we'll use that type function

00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,929
here and you'll see what's wrong with it

00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,689
in a second so I'm gonna set that to

00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:10,720
pear okay so so what's happening here

00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:14,089
our component is here it's got two hooks

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,799
the first click happens and and both

00:13:14,089 --> 00:13:16,970
counts and texts are both set to two and

00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:20,149
then we

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:22,430
at that type and both counts in Texas

00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:24,709
both set to pair so what's wrong with

00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,000
this this image we are trying to use to

00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:27,829
a hoax but they're they're they're just

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,509
oh they're just using the same store in

00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:30,980
the memory right because we only have

00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:34,100
one variable and it's constantly

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,540
overwriting that single variable so the

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,370
the mental image of hooks that you have

00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:39,250
now should grow a little bit and you

00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,529
should think of hooks as a rays of

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,629
effects so let's just use an array and

00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:46,160
we'll stand to know which hook we're

00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:48,579
currently operating on we also need an

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,800
index so I'm gonna have an index of zero

00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:53,209
so so now now we're now it's pretty

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,970
clear we're gonna replace all the

00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:58,189
internal values with just hooks and in

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:01,639
the current index so now nothing has

00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:03,439
changed because we're still not oh it's

00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,269
not incrementing the index so I'm gonna

00:14:03,439 --> 00:14:07,310
have a rule there at the end of the at

00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:08,449
the end of a hook after we're done we

00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,339
should just always increment the index

00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:11,629
so that the next hook can take and can

00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:14,389
take place so now we have an

00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:16,339
independently updating counts and text

00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:18,649
is not changing that's good but over

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,209
here we still have this weird bug and

00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,220
that's because I just keep incrementing

00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,899
index plus one plus one plus one plus

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,449
one I need to reset it back to zero so

00:14:23,899 --> 00:14:28,309
that every single time a rerender it's

00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,769
gonna start and go through all these

00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:31,939
hooks from scratch because it's

00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:34,670
referring to their internal hook storage

00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:37,610
so yeah let's just set it to zero and

00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:39,500
now I'm gonna break everything and this

00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,079
is because of a very subtle bug again

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:44,029
set state is called asynchronously set

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,670
state is called after a render right and

00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:49,129
and by that time hope the the indexes

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,629
actually set back to zero so this this

00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:52,730
index being a live value that's a

00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:55,639
problem for us the way to fix that

00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,069
problem is to freeze it so let's have an

00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:00,379
internal index and we'll just freeze it

00:14:57,069 --> 00:15:03,290
and we'll that set state closed over

00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:06,410
second NewsAsia closure close over that

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,899
internal frozen index value okay so now

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,329
we have a component we are rendering it

00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:14,240
we have a count of one we're clicking

00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:16,430
the account updates to to the text

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,319
doesn't change then we type pair and

00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,180
then count doesn't change and tax

00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:22,279
changes so we have independently moving

00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,889
states right and that's something that's

00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:26,569
a new paradigm in the hooks model as

00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:28,279
well that you every component used to

00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:29,809
have one object for state and everything

00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,499
you're just forced to put every all you

00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:31,879
stay on today

00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:33,649
checked now you have independently

00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:37,009
moving states and you can be a bit more

00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:38,809
precise with that alright so and you can

00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:40,639
already start to see some of the issues

00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:42,529
we've hooked some of the rules of hooks

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,509
so these are when the people introduce

00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:46,699
hooks I think one of the biggest

00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:48,319
problems with folks that people had was

00:15:46,699 --> 00:15:49,579
that you you can you have to call them

00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:52,099
unconditionally you couldn't put them

00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:54,109
inside an if or a loop or some sort of

00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:55,969
dynamic value so I just want you to

00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:59,089
imagine what happens to this if I do

00:15:55,969 --> 00:16:01,789
like math dot random more than five

00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:05,269
point five right so this gets this gets

00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:07,009
called half of the time what is the hook

00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:09,139
index value of this this is this should

00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:10,729
be one the okay next value but sometimes

00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:13,999
it's zero because this doesn't execute

00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:16,099
and so the the the state values get get

00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:17,689
off right so you're just not allowed to

00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:19,729
do that and that's what we have linters

00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:23,379
that's why you understand the rules

00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:26,389
looks just a fundamental basis okay so

00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:28,069
we're not done I'm not happy we only

00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:30,439
have the state hook we also have the

00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:32,059
effect hook the best way to model this

00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:34,639
is to just use it and then we'll

00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:38,299
backfill what that what that is so a use

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:42,859
effects hook takes a call back or just

00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:44,599
say console.log yes calm and then it

00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:46,609
also takes an optional dependency array

00:16:44,599 --> 00:16:49,159
I'm just gonna use an empty array for

00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:50,629
now all right so so we have that API

00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,909
let's just let's go and implement it

00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:55,669
right so this is our module again so

00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:58,279
function use effects callback and

00:16:55,669 --> 00:17:00,289
dependency array okay so this is the

00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:02,439
hardest part of the talk bear with me

00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:06,049
but I have I know what I'm doing so

00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:08,000
we're good so so we want to have this

00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:09,679
variable we'll just have like like

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,899
whether it has changed or not and just

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,759
set it to true so by default we're just

00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:16,699
going to keep rerender ring and if if

00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,589
the dependencies have changed we're

00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,750
gonna call the callback right that makes

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,129
sense if the dependencies have changed

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,329
we're gonna call the callback so the

00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:27,409
hard part is to detect change over here

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,119
in order to detect change we need to

00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:30,470
basically diff the old dependencies and

00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,029
a new dependencies that means we need to

00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,220
store and keep around the dependencies

00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:37,879
somewhere where's the good place for

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,019
that turns out it's the hooks array so

00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:41,419
we're going to store it inside of the

00:17:39,019 --> 00:17:43,090
hooks array and we'll draw it out at the

00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:47,450
start of our effect

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:49,550
the old dependencies so hooks index okay

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,930
sometimes this is undefined though so so

00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:54,200
that's why we need to guard it with an

00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:56,230
if oh and by the way always increment

00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,550
the index at the end of talk okay so

00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,830
sometimes it's undefined so what we're

00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:02,810
gonna do is replace this and just go if

00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,300
the old dependencies do exist that means

00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,490
we have an old array and a new array

00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,930
this is the hardest part in the entire

00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,940
code so bear with me so we're gonna

00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,920
modify has changed to look at dependency

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,470
array we want to have we want to look at

00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,800
some of them we want to do a ray dot

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:20,450
some and that's just a lesser known

00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,250
array prototype method we want to look

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,890
at the dependency and that index and we

00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:28,400
want to compare that dependency to that

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,410
index we're gonna use object dot is so a

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,030
lot of people like I don't know it

00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:34,430
internal is react to use this object is

00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:37,940
internally because not a number triple

00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:41,690
equals not a number is false object dot

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:44,300
is not a number and not a number it's

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,670
true so that's just a slightly better

00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,160
option so people went with that so we're

00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:52,220
just going to say object that is

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,570
dependency and the old dependencies the

00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,470
corresponding index of that old

00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:58,790
dependency I think that's it oh and then

00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:03,380
we need to expose it in our reactor

00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:05,930
module ba-boom so what do you have now

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:07,760
we have a component with a use effect of

00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,880
an empty array it start it only runs

00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,000
once at the start and never again in in

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,220
any of the updates if I put in counts

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,600
here then it depends on that counts and

00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,330
it updates when the count changes from

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:24,260
one to two it runs if I change it to

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:26,450
text from when the text updates from

00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:29,690
Apple to pair it runs and when I delete

00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:31,790
it it also runs every single time so

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,710
that's the spec of use effect and it

00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:37,640
wasn't that hard right to implement all

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:39,530
this so this is normally where this is

00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,120
as far as I plan to go I was like okay

00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,610
you've kind of proved out the hooks

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,950
model but I'm very been ambitious person

00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,810
and I was like this kind of looks like

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,520
react but is not really react everyone

00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:52,400
kind of knows that so what can I do to

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:54,149
put this on the Dom which is a really

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,369
stupid question to ask

00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:58,199
we're live coding talk but we're gonna

00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:59,759
do it we're gonna this looks like node

00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:01,229
but actually we have not been coding in

00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,209
node at all it's just been the console

00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:04,649
and I have it I have a browser

00:20:03,209 --> 00:20:06,989
implementation here thanks to code

00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:09,659
sandbox so let's do it

00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:12,719
actually that was probably a bad idea I

00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:16,769
have some I have some pre-prepared CSS

00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:19,259
I'm gonna import that it's not showing

00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:22,919
the autofill an immediate background

00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:24,929
very nice CSS effects for demos and then

00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:28,379
I also have some utilities that I

00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:32,389
imported so I have a create element

00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:35,789
object that I have from my utils folder

00:20:32,389 --> 00:20:38,249
and create what create element does is

00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:40,259
is what JSX compiles to by babel right

00:20:38,249 --> 00:20:42,959
hopefully everyone knows that i'm gonna

00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:45,269
expose it inside of my inside of my

00:20:42,959 --> 00:20:48,599
react module and now I can use JSX

00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:51,749
inside of my component so I'm gonna say

00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:54,479
Dave hello well let's get something to

00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:56,669
show up on the screen unfortunately

00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:58,139
we're not done oh sorry let me just

00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:00,239
comment it out unfortunately we're not

00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:02,729
done we also need a render function that

00:21:00,239 --> 00:21:06,539
actually renders to a Dom element so

00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:08,609
let's just import render okay the render

00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:10,259
API that I have written is slightly

00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:12,809
different because it memorizes the hooks

00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:15,089
so I'm just gonna delete the render

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:17,519
function that we wrote and I'm gonna

00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:18,869
expose the render function it's a high

00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,829
order function it just takes the hooks

00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:24,269
and it in and it has an E and it outputs

00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:26,099
a render function that we can actually

00:21:24,269 --> 00:21:28,499
use like you wouldn't use a normal

00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:36,869
render function so let's just go like

00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:38,849
that very nice so we have JSX this is

00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:40,679
JSX and it only works because we act our

00:21:38,849 --> 00:21:41,399
create element in the Babel JSX plugin

00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,939
okay

00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:46,949
let's keep going so so what do we do

00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:49,859
let's actually prove out that everything

00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:55,229
works and and this is a full reax clone

00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:59,479
it's not but trust me so let's have a

00:21:55,229 --> 00:22:01,589
button i took the opportunity to alright

00:21:59,479 --> 00:22:04,229
you'll see what happens I'm gonna write

00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:06,749
a standard event handler it's gonna set

00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:07,980
counts to count plus 1 I it was the

00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:09,390
first time I ever forgot

00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,480
plus one and obviously it's on stage

00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:14,850
very stressful and it just says click me

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,400
for example and then it's gonna have the

00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:19,440
current count yeah everyone should be

00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,610
very familiar with this I don't have hot

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,730
reloading figure it out so you're gonna

00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,910
see me manually refresh a few times so

00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,710
yeah

00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:28,740
button showed up I have nicely some nice

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:31,799
CSS because I cheated but if I click it

00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:34,020
it doesn't work why mmm

00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:36,059
because when remember when we were doing

00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,700
this we were manually rerender every

00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:39,510
time right there reactions this concept

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,280
of a work loop

00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:43,169
it always loops around to check if

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,450
there's work to be done so we need to

00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:48,270
simulate this work loop by manually

00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,980
doing it and also screw it I can write a

00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,340
work loop that's not too hard right it's

00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,559
only you know we've got like 10 minutes

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:57,270
so let's write a work loop and the work

00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,620
loop is simply I'm gonna set the index

00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,600
to zero because every time you render

00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,950
you have to set the index to zero we're

00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,470
gonna call the render function again

00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,290
pass in their hooks argument and then

00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,919
we're gonna call the set timeout with

00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:10,350
the work loop

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:13,440
I'm gonna set a loop of 300 milliseconds

00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:16,440
in reality it's it's of course I will

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,320
call back so it's much faster but this

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:24,390
is what you get this is what works for

00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:27,480
this demo so we have clicking we just

00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:29,190
live code at this the last point I want

00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,919
to make I think in this entire thing is

00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,809
I have custom hooks notice that we did

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,730
not write any any custom hooks code

00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:38,250
right nothing here was specific to

00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:42,630
custom hooks but if I paste this

00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:45,929
pre-prepared custom hook that's I have a

00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:48,960
used dogs hook it it has it has a state

00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:52,350
it has an a which has an array it

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,320
fetches an API based on the counts that

00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:57,720
like feed in count is 1 2 3 4 5 and it

00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,450
gives back a number of pictures a number

00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:02,700
of URLs of dog images and it just

00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:05,429
returns that image so I can use this

00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,870
custom hook again I didn't I didn't I

00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:10,590
didn't do any I didn't do any custom

00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:13,110
hook specific code right I can use dogs

00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:18,060
it once accounts so I pass in the count

00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:22,620
from there and I can render that into

00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:25,050
map item bog-standard stuff completely

00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:26,580
and not accessible by the way but I'm

00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:29,700
the only one accessing this code anyway

00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:32,820
so it works fine you should have an alt

00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,170
tag so so let me yeah all right

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:36,630
again I haven't figured out hot

00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:45,480
reloading so but this is a fully working

00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:47,970
app so thank you thank you so then I'm

00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,830
like okay so the punchline what is the

00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,260
punch line this is the punch line I'm

00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:54,740
just gonna paste it in and I'm going to

00:24:52,260 --> 00:25:00,030
remind you of what we're talking about

00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:02,700
this is not react this is not react I

00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:05,130
have a fully dynamic app yeah I have the

00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,950
full API I have JSX I have custom hooks

00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,750
I have the render I've cloned everything

00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:13,170
that you usually use this is not react

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:23,190
why I cloned this in 40 lines of code if

00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:25,230
you magnify it if it's in a tweet if

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,880
you're if you're wondering about the the

00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,740
you tools folder by the way the you

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,230
tools folder is only a hundred and

00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:32,760
twenty lines and it's mostly helper

00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,190
functions like create text element and

00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:40,920
all that that JSX needs so this is

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:42,360
normal what is react so that's a that's

00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,310
my that's where I'm gonna leave you that

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,800
I have homework for you I want you to go

00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:49,200
home and write react from scratch I want

00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,610
you to practice I want to eat we need to

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,470
practice closures I want you to get good

00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,780
at like understanding the mental model

00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:57,660
and understand what you use react for

00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:00,240
you don't use react for this API API is

00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,090
really good right we can copy it view or

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,620
you will copy it like spell copy n but

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:06,630
what do you use react for what is what

00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,030
is the hundreds of thousands of lines of

00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:12,270
code what is that for I have my answer

00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:14,250
I'm gonna tweet all this out later but I

00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:17,100
want you to have that curiosity don't

00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:19,350
just stop at the surface and that's my

00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:22,390
talk you can see the full source at

00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:24,450
Strix that i go slash talks thank you

00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,450
