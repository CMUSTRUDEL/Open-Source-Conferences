Title: Pair Programming & Test Driven Development done right - JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-07-05
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Palo IT - Kevin Aubry & Lin Oon Kean

So you’ve heard about Pair Programming, but how much do you really know about it? Few are aware of the complexities involved, resulting in a waste of money, siloed knowledge and even internal scuffles!
With PALO IT’s 'Pair Programming Done Right', you will learn how to navigate this potentially chaotic practice. Join Kevin Aubry to discover how you can Pair Program the Agile way. To supplement your learning experience, you’ll also learn how to leverage on Test Driven Development to create even higher quality software in a fraction of time.
In this session, attendees can look forward to:
- A deep understanding of Pair Programming and Test Driven Development
- Better software through faster feedback
- Improved development speeds
- Purpose-driven formulation of solutions
- Higher job satisfaction and team morale
- And more…

Requirements:
Bring a laptop. Have a recent Node.js, code editor and web browser installed. You'll need a Github account.

Having the first-hand experience using various programming languages to design and implement software applications, complemented by his advisory position, Kevin has proven to be a valuable asset to numerous successful projects. Constantly keeping up with innovation and new technologies, he enjoys challenges that take him out of his comfort zone.

Kean is a pragmatic leader principled strongly by Scrum and XP practices to coach and support development team collaboration in software delivery. A firm advocate for Agile software development since 2003, Kean has been on both sides of the equation long enough to know what makes Agile software development successful: Human collaboration and Agile engineering skills.

had a very good lunch and welcome to a

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,230
workshop today about test-driven develop

00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:18,539
month and pepper gramming so make odor

00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:19,199
okay so here's the Wi-Fi code we're

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,289
gonna need it

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,510
so please connect to this one and if you

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,439
haven't given your github user name

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,760
please do so now at the desk over there

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,890
we needed to add you to a github

don't want picture taken from you that's

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,240
pretty much it for logistics so let's

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,880
start so welcome as I said about TBI

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,420
program until a so this gonna be

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,450
incorrect it trajectory workshop so for

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,430
beginners so I hope there is not all of

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,920
you are not all experimental II to that

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,380
if not if yes maybe you'll learn some

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,390
new things

00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:36,600
so today agenda so we're gonna start

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,710
with our check-in then we can I give

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,979
introduction to test-driven development

00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:46,470
we can introduce to you a report - ball

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:48,899
you're going to see why later on then

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,759
set up your machine to be able to do the

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,509
exercise and I'm gonna do a quick demo

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,070
of test-driven development then it's

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,740
going to be your turn to do the exercise

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,710
so we're gonna maybe forty forty-five

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,189
minutes of exercise with EDD then a

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:07,580
small debrief altogether and then we can

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:10,229
have a small break about ten minutes

00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,690
after the break we're gonna do the same

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,820
with programming

00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:17,810
first introduction then a small demo and

00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,480
then you're gonna do the exercise for

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:23,320
about one hour then I can debrief and

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,140
we're gonna conclude with some resources

00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:30,380
today with me so my name is Kevin take

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:34,640
me that Paolo i t I can so agile coach

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:37,010
at Paolo IT a mall full stack developer

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,370
engineer madaba DevOps and cloud

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:43,730
engineer and Nathan or a full stack

00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:45,800
engineer and where is Anil at the

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,610
reception desk full stack engineer as

00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,020
well at Paolo IT so party I don't know

00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,660
how many of you heard about this company

00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:56,870
we are consulting company international

00:02:53,660 --> 00:03:00,140
with the development we have ui/ux

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,510
agile and DevOps and cloud we about

00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:05,330
11:15 Singapore so if you don't know us

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:07,340
just google it party that SG calm or

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:12,530
that combat SG and you find us and you

00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:18,580
can learn more about us chicken so I

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:18,580
invite Ken for a chicken do Mike

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,460
[Music]

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:31,500
we don't write any conferences where we

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,050
knew sister company vegan what we did is

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,989
to get a sense of their experience with

00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:40,290
unity and your experience with learning

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:45,080
so we can go to this website work that

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,080
what men do not use the policy

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,550
which is

00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:52,749
[Music]

00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:27,480
[Music]

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,480
stop so let's see we have a power

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,319
I know buddy

00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:41,810
okay I think yes stabilized

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,070
[Music]

00:04:54,070 --> 00:05:03,370
such as a way to pick up to measure this

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,370
one we were proceeding from the

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:11,530
that's okay time to pick up a specimen

00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:16,390
that 24 percent of a gun

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:19,020
less than a year good for you and when

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:22,990
exactly do a check in the morning and

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:27,810
for a 6 percent and this

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,810
and for those six percent of

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:39,979
you change your life let's go one second

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:39,979
question help so what has been

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,280
Oh orange

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,770
after that

00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:20,110
as I guess stabilized so that's before

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,110
and as much a very much

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,560
there are specialists all those who

00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,979
deviate

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:36,550
I hope I'm innocent

00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:40,740
why exactly did it and I can live with

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:44,420
it okay the studied and

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:48,330
the three persons who passed by before

00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:51,710
that I don't know about you my

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,710
experience when you

00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,429
[Music]

00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:16,669
thank you can sew test-driven

00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:20,210
development what it is so it comes from

00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:23,330
extreme programming which comes from

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,250
agile so some of you know scrum I bet so

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,400
extreme programming is a different

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:30,979
branch of it so can our from the book

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,160
extreme programming applied wrote this

00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:36,880
code writing test first keeps entropy

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,099
from destroying your code we write tests

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,550
then we write just enough code to get a

00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:45,830
test pass no more that is the best way

00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,380
to keep your code clean so what this

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:52,130
means is the idea is really to write a

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:54,169
small test small as possible and then to

00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:57,949
write just enough code to make it pass

00:07:54,169 --> 00:08:00,380
and so on and so on and this avoid your

00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:05,960
code to become a mess and this gives you

00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:09,770
a good structure in your code so as I

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,990
said this is the gospel of TDD but came

00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:15,470
back came back another author of extreme

00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:18,800
programming so write a little test that

00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:20,930
does not pass compiling not compiling is

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,560
not passing as well so that's completely

00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:28,010
fine we call this the red states so the

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,130
red states very important then we have

00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:34,130
to make the test passed as quickly as

00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:36,260
possible even if you have to write messy

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:39,380
code or committing sin we just start to

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:43,400
make it pass that's it this is the green

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:45,920
stage after that once it's passed and

00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,140
green we eliminate the duplication and

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,950
we rewrite the code to make it nice and

00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,589
clean this is called the refactoring and

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:57,130
then we repeat this steps over and over

00:08:54,589 --> 00:09:01,850
until we arrive to a sex fast

00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:05,060
satisfactory results again if you're

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:09,709
forget was TDD is remember this red

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:13,220
green refactor code make it run red and

00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:14,950
green so writing a test at fail making

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,260
it pass it runs

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,020
and then making it right so we refactor

00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,610
the test the test end the code to make

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:25,900
it clean and nice for the developer to

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:28,540
look at it some people have asked me

00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:31,090
okay what is refactoring there is a lot

00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,610
of answer to that so I invite you to

00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:36,250
look at this website here it gives a lot

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,410
of example of what refactoring a lot of

00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:41,260
example it is very good with scenarios

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,810
and when to do what just some examples

00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,300
so very obvious that most of you do it

00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:49,330
already is just putting a name on it so

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:52,060
you can extract the function you can

00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:55,030
extract a variable introducing an

00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,700
explaining variable you can rename a

00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:00,910
variable for example you can introduce a

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:04,210
parameter object or replacing loop with

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:07,420
pipeline so those are just five five

00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:09,540
examples amongst hundred or thousand of

00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,540
them

00:10:11,729 --> 00:10:17,220
now I'm gonna give the mic to madaba

00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:21,520
over there so you can just look on this

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:27,539
side vallabha or good

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,539
[Music]

00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:36,029
[Music]

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,240
and

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:48,370
[Music]

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,810
for us to monitor of US Congress in

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,810
their test results

00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,330
[Music]

00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,360
[Music]

00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:26,900
[Music]

00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:30,010
Oh

00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,010
[Music]

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:46,230
[Music]

00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,279
Thank You Adama so the idea of the

00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,889
dashboard is industry standards mode of

00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:58,459
the clients or company they ask for 80%

00:11:54,889 --> 00:12:00,410
or above of code coverage the idea here

00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:02,750
is to show that TDD is quite easy to

00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,339
reach that numbers if we do the opposite

00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,920
meaning we write your code and then at

00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:08,300
the end or I need to write my test it's

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,670
going to be very difficult to have clean

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,990
tests and to reach those 80% or you're

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,000
not going to write the test that needs

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:15,440
to be written so this is just a

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,810
dashboard to see ok it's very easy to

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,149
integrate in Jenkins and to show your

00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:25,360
coworker colleagues or even management

00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:25,360
ok my code coverage is Android or 80%

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:34,699
okay now I'm going to do a demo of what

00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:36,350
I just explained before so I hope that

00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:40,040
some of you know that fizzbuzz exercise

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:42,350
who knows it we have three four five

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:46,579
okay so this is a very famous exercise

00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:48,529
that in interview been asked a lot so it

00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:52,850
looks very simple I'm gonna show how to

00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:56,839
resolve it in TDD way so if the input is

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:59,389
a multiple of three you return fees if

00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,939
the input is a multiple of five you

00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:05,240
return buzz if he's dropped three and

00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:07,250
five you return fizzbuzz otherwise you

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:11,019
just return the number that was given as

00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:11,019
input quite simple right

00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,759
so

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:25,100
oh let me take a chair I'm gonna zoom in

00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,100
no worries

00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,240
so this is the code you're gonna check

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,949
out later for the exerciser so you can

00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,279
see the package the reason is quite

00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:41,670
simple we just have B ball for

00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:44,339
transpiling we have just for the code

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:47,040
for the test and that's pretty much it

00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:51,300
that's all we need you have a folder

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:55,259
with example that contain the basic

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,910
function and its corresponding test is

00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,620
just for you to get the syntax because

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,440
some people are struggling just to get

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,149
the syntax of just whatsoever so we can

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,899
just copy and paste from there as a as a

00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:14,180
guideline so coming back to the fizzbuzz

00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:19,339
exercise I'm going to first create

00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:19,339
fizzbuzz directory

00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:29,740
and inside this one I'm going to create

00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:34,210
two file so one for fees bills DOJ's

00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:38,740
is going to contain my function and one

00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:40,900
for my tests so by convention I'm going

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,170
to name it exactly the same the test the

00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,170
GS

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:59,279
so on the right side here you will have

00:14:52,529 --> 00:15:03,680
my code so let me zoom in can you nobody

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,680
read is it big enough at the back

00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:17,240
so my function is bars take the input as

00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:20,779
arguments

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,980
I'm gonna export

00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:36,280
and that should be it and then I'm gonna

00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:40,720
write my test so I'm just going to copy

00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,650
and paste from the example to go a bit

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,350
faster

00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:46,760
[Music]

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:49,050
up here

00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:52,620
[Music]

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:59,190
input so this is the name I choose to

00:15:52,620 --> 00:16:01,700
give to my input so fizzbuzz that's

00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,700
pretty much it

00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,790
look sorry

00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:20,029
okay let me move that to the left okay

00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:23,529
difficult to go that big okay so I'm

00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:30,140
gonna describe my taste treat so

00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:34,850
fizzbuzz testing sheet and I'm thank you

00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:37,110
I'm gonna start by so

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,130
[Music]

00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,640
sorry

00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,640
just

00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:51,319
look my bad yeah there's something wrong

00:16:47,329 --> 00:16:57,919
there oh sorry yes

00:16:51,319 --> 00:17:06,079
sorry bending too much Java lately okay

00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:11,919
so it should should written one when one

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,919
given a simple so I expect

00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:20,110
given one to be one so this is the

00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:24,870
simplest step I can think about at the

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:24,870
moment so if I run it

00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:35,460
we can see it's failing so now I'm in

00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,410
the red state now the next step is to

00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:44,480
make it run so making green as fast as

00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:44,480
possible so I'm gonna do written one

00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,600
I'm gonna make a green as fast as

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,940
possible is green now I'm in the

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,570
refactor so refactor I think for now

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,799
it's okay

00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:58,480
I don't need to refactor there is not

00:17:53,799 --> 00:18:00,159
much code now next one next test so what

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:05,830
is the next test that will fail my code

00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:09,429
so show written to when to given so

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:12,880
input to to be to okay

00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:15,549
I'll run again and of course you'll be

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,480
red you fail so now again I'm the red

00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:20,169
state so now to make it past as fast as

00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,060
possible

00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:30,220
if too

00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:30,220
return - sorry it's an integer

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,210
[Music]

00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:40,429
my pass so I'm fine I'm going to

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:44,960
refactor now no I think I'm good so far

00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:47,899
so let's continue so now next one that

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:52,480
we fail if I continue this way so now

00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:52,480
three three shall return fees

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:05,320
again I'm running my tests it should

00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:15,220
tell which it does and again

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:19,720
if input three return fees with upper

00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:22,560
case hopefully in pass so I mean the

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,450
green state so now I can refactor a bit

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:31,720
okay I prefer to have those brackets

00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:34,320
with nicer and here I can over else with

00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,320
some brackets

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,809
and though I like my refactoring I run

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,980
my test to ensure that it still pass

00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:47,250
okay I didn't break anything with my

00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:51,690
refactor now what's the next test that

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:59,750
will fail my code so sure return for

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:59,750
well forgiven so input for to be for

00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:06,470
I run my tests and again I'm in the red

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:12,320
state I hope you are doing all of the

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:16,360
noon I'm gonna go 200 like that so now I

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:21,970
mean the red state so again to make it

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,970
fast so what for

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:32,129
return for

00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:34,049
and now we pass okay now I can save a

00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:36,409
tenancy whenever I have a number except

00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:39,929
three to return this number as a string

00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:42,059
so I can see there's a repetition so it

00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:45,659
makes sense now for me to rewrite my

00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:53,190
code in a better way so if it's not

00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:54,809
three basically I need to return the

00:20:53,190 --> 00:21:00,600
input of the string I'm gonna do it this

00:20:54,809 --> 00:21:03,139
way and this I can remove and this I

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,139
will remove

00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:10,530
now I'm gonna run my test again and it's

00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,540
raining so my refactoring didn't break

00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:15,570
anything

00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:20,760
now the next test that will fail my code

00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:22,680
will be 5 so 5 and return buzz remember

00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,780
if it's multiple of 5 I need to return

00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,370
buzz

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:36,559
so when input is 5

00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:36,559
I expect buzz so again if input 5

00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,950
returned but with appliqués

00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:52,900
he passes can i refactor something now

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:56,710
yes maybe I would like the else here

00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:59,530
make it nicer and maybe a test I can

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,720
refactor a bit better I would say now I

00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,220
can sell at the tenancy before when I

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,230
give a number I should give this number

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:08,910
as a string as output so I would like to

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,910
refactor as Fritton

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:24,070
the input number when not multiple of

00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:32,550
three and five given so I have two here

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:32,550
I have four as well

00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:39,910
so now I can delete this one and I can

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:42,970
delete this one and now verse to ensure

00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:45,400
that everything pass so I said before

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,740
refactoring is not only on the code side

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,930
it has to be on the test side otherwise

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:51,670
you get a mess very easy code is

00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:55,540
important but test is as much as

00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:58,330
important as the code now next one that

00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:05,080
can think of to make it my code fail

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:12,030
will be 6 so 6 need to written fees

00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:12,030
multiple of 3 so input work

00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,929
sofie's

00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:31,210
now I'm gonna make runs you should fail

00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:31,210
and here so he put three or input

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,150
equal 6

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,960
so now I can see I have like if that

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,390
tend to be lengthy that we start

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,720
increasing so I decided to refactor now

00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:54,799
I can see like so a multiple of three so

00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:56,090
if my input modulo 3 equal equal zero

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,399
because it makes sense for me now to

00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:04,970
refactor this pot who live test that

00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:08,179
tells me to do it I written fees ensure

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:12,220
that I didn't break anything ok till

00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:12,220
pass now I continue

00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:20,440
so next one that can fail them so

00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:23,020
written multiple of 3 so 9 no it will

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:31,630
not fail so be the next 110 multiple of

00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:33,730
5 so input 10 show written buzz again

00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:37,930
I'm a kid run so I'm gonna be in the red

00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:40,660
state now I'm gonna be in the green

00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:47,760
state but making it past as fast as

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:47,760
possible so or input equal 10

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:56,160
and I'm in the green state again same I

00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:58,860
can see I met the man she is going to

00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:04,680
add more condition in the if closed

00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:07,620
so I'm going to refactor that so 5 equal

00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:11,390
equal zero so to ensure that whatever

00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,390
it's a multiple of five are written buzz

00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:20,179
I'm gonna read it again and here I'm in

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:24,140
the green state so can i retract us

00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:26,780
something maybe my test I can see here

00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:30,160
the 6 3 5 10

00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:33,850
so here social written fears when

00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,850
multiple of 3 given

00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:45,680
in same year so between birds when

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,680
multiple of five given

00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:56,080
now I can delete those and I will run to

00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:59,570
make it sure I didn't break anything

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,650
okay still green know what's the next

00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:05,570
test I can write to make it fail

00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:10,090
remember the multiple of 3 & 5 she

00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:13,549
written fizzbuzz so it's written

00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:18,350
fizzbuzz when multiple of when I would

00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:20,840
say when 15 given so when I give 15 I

00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:26,750
need to run fizzbuzz to return feasible

00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:36,010
sorry I run and I should be in the red

00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:36,010
state now again if input equal equal 15

00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:41,169
return fizzbuzz

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,960
okay lies green now can refactor again

00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:53,620
now use the else because I find nicer

00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,600
that's all I can do at the moment

00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,169
solvent again and I didn't break

00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:08,360
anything

00:26:57,169 --> 00:27:12,480
now next test that can fail 13 so

00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:15,630
fizzbuzz went that they given so 30

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:22,049
should be fizzbuzz can run my test again

00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:30,450
and i'm in the red state I'm going to

00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:32,690
dust or input 30 written fizzbuzz I'm in

00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:35,130
the red-green state now I can refactor

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:37,200
so again I can see a tendency of

00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:41,419
repeating is still gonna increase the

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:46,490
more tests I add so I'm gonna do that so

00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:46,490
15 equal equals zero or written fizzbuzz

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,430
okay pass now I'm still not satisfied

00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:57,300
because the the statement says is

00:27:53,430 --> 00:28:07,890
multiple of 3 & 5 so I prefer to do it

00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:09,720
this way with my hand here because like

00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,160
that when the developer read the code he

00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,900
can say ok multiple of three and

00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,440
multiple of five so it's clear as well

00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,440
to understand

00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:24,120
it still pass now again I'm going to

00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:26,040
refactor my code my test so I'm going to

00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,820
group these two together for multiple of

00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,820
three and five

00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:41,850
so shut up is buzzed when multiple of

00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:48,450
three and five given I'm going to run my

00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:52,980
tests and everything is green now if I

00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:57,779
continue I cannot think about any test

00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:59,399
that will fail my my code so I decide

00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:01,169
that I don't have in fact not to do I

00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:03,929
could do a bit more I can extract viable

00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:05,970
I can do a name viable I can create sub

00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:07,379
functions but I think for the purpose of

00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,389
the demo now I think I'm good enough I'm

00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:12,899
happy with that so I can push and commit

00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:19,049
my code now if you look at the result of

00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:20,850
the test here then i zoom in no other

00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:25,619
way if everybody can see that it's a bit

00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:27,480
small right so just to explain what I

00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:29,789
mean by just by reading the test you can

00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,159
tell what the code is doing if you just

00:29:29,789 --> 00:29:34,740
read that you can you can you know what

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,480
the code is doing so show return the

00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,789
input number what not multiple of three

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,619
and five year on sheraton feels when

00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:43,139
multiple of three given show written

00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:44,879
bursts when multiple of I given sheraton

00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:47,639
fizzbuzz when multiple of three and five

00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:49,049
given so just by reading this do you

00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:51,539
know what this is doing without reading

00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:54,149
the code and this can be understood by

00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:56,190
everybody not only developers so this is

00:29:54,149 --> 00:30:01,159
a big advantage of 3d and writing proper

00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:05,400
tests as well okay I'm good for the demo

00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:09,100
so let's go back to the flight

00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:11,260
so how is this useful so he helps to

00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:14,650
understand the problem statement and I

00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:17,770
say that rather than coding directly the

00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:19,420
whole problem it you have to break it

00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:21,970
down to very small pieces

00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:24,490
it looks steadiest at the beginning but

00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,950
once you get used to it it brings a lot

00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:30,550
of advantages and m to resolve more

00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:33,640
complex problem easier it gives a better

00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:36,550
design because every line of code you

00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,710
write is because a test tell you to

00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:42,760
write it and not because you want to

00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:44,350
wait for any kind of reason it helps of

00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,470
course define the current state of the

00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:49,390
system behavior and it gives you a full

00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,340
suite of tests to ensure system sanity

00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:53,380
meaning by having this I have like

00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,780
hundred percent of like coverage so I

00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,570
ensure that my my code is tested so

00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:03,520
nothing will break it and I got

00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:05,650
regression test as well with that ok now

00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,390
I don't know if you have any questions

00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:12,010
so far about the demo something that was

00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:15,040
not here otherwise you move on to you

00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:18,880
pad so now it's your turn

00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:21,280
ask you to close the following report so

00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,830
we added you on the github so you should

00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:28,180
have access to this one if you have any

00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:31,180
issue with that let us know so as a

00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:33,700
reminder there is a mural with ABBA any

00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,310
turn Anil Kien and myself that can help

00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:39,900
you with that so once you check out the

00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:45,790
repo please create your own branch with

00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:49,570
the following naming so TDD slash your

00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:51,820
name or user name or you decide then you

00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:56,710
can open the code in your favorite IDE

00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:59,550
and run just npm install to have just

00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:03,220
and everything configure on your machine

00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:07,360
once this is done I give you maybe say

00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:11,340
2-3 minutes should be enough then a

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,340
lecture to continue

00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:20,059
[Music]

00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,769
[Music]

00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:38,109
not sure

00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,710
[Music]

00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:52,740
I know that now as Pakistan whether the

00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:55,020
bus it could be shy

00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,770
so I urge you not to be trying to just

00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:01,390
stop whistle and feel miserable country

00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:04,390
and the other thing is why we are doing

00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:07,000
this in our workshops we also realize

00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:10,330
that participants when they tried is not

00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,130
they are not really moving in the slit

00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:14,740
in each time to my diploma a test just

00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:17,020
one test passing and the done now the

00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,750
goal of this time is for you to try out

00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:23,350
the steps activity if you skip our steps

00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:26,300
and not ask a question and just get

00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:28,550
I'm done I think when we see the point

00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,170
of the workshop so it's okay to struggle

00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:33,250
is okay to struggle

00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:33,250
it's okay ask questions

00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:00,179
[Music]

00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,369
[Music]

00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,319
[Music]

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,720
who still more time to do the those tats

00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:46,770
who is not finished yet

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,980
raise your hand okay one two minutes

00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,980
okay

00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:36,289
but good yeah okay so I continue so just

00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:39,470
some guidelines for the exercise try to

00:35:36,289 --> 00:35:40,700
push every I would say five ten minutes

00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,309
that we can see the result on a

00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,720
dashboard directly we have a bell over

00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:46,400
there so I'm just gonna ring a bell as a

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,559
reminder because sometimes when you lock

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,339
into your code you don't think about it

00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:55,009
so the bells for pushing your code we

00:35:52,339 --> 00:35:58,009
have two comments for you so NPM run

00:35:55,009 --> 00:36:01,339
tests to run the test in the terminal

00:35:58,009 --> 00:36:03,799
the console and NPM run coverage will

00:36:01,339 --> 00:36:06,019
run the test coverage in you in your

00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:08,239
console so you see a nice table with a

00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:13,729
line branch and all the coverage

00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:17,660
possible there okay so just before we

00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:20,749
start the exercise reminder so TVD red

00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:23,059
green refactor if you look at a cycle

00:36:20,749 --> 00:36:25,940
during the demo is very fast so each

00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:27,710
cycle is maybe one to two minutes so I

00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,539
don't write code during 10 minutes then

00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,130
write a test during five minutes so

00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:32,839
should be very fast so short try to

00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:35,420
break to break it down to very small

00:36:32,839 --> 00:36:37,640
step so this is the point of DVD and

00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:40,190
this is what's difficult okay

00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:45,609
as Ken said it's okay to struggle we

00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:50,839
here to help so this is the exercise

00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:53,479
forget about the timing so the inputs in

00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:56,719
this case sentence so she sells

00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:59,749
seashells by the seashore it can be any

00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:04,999
sentence not not only this one the

00:36:59,749 --> 00:37:06,920
output is an object or you decide what

00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:10,599
you want or string we let you decide

00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:13,759
that will count the words it's case

00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:17,059
insensitive so in this case every word

00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:19,190
appears once except see that at least

00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:21,680
two times and one with the upper case

00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:25,849
but Alice case insensitive we count it

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:28,279
as two as I say this is an example every

00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:32,660
sentence should be through you should be

00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:35,769
working don't take it to account weird

00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:38,059
characters like come out or like

00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:40,279
estimation mark question mark on things

00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:45,380
just space and characters

00:37:40,279 --> 00:37:47,390
okay any questions for that so good luck

00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:53,469
and we're going around and just raise

00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:53,469
your hand if you stuck sorry

00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,849
this one

00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:06,420
and that means we had an empire

00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:08,600
position okay

00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:11,420
[Music]

00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:15,710
I don't even know them every five minute

00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:17,150
yes I do know so just a venting so

00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,880
lettuce telling me that some of you

00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,890
didn't accept the invitation from the

00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,420
github so maybe check your email and you

00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:25,540
have to accept it to be added to the

00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,540
group

00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:45,099
doing the exercise right end up doing is

00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:47,280
but now we're going around and twelve

00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:47,280
them

00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:13,970
hope you discussed well of all the

00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:16,340
feedbacks now if I can ask one

00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:19,010
representative of each table can just

00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,600
share with the others about your

00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:22,940
discussion and if you have any question

00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:26,410
just please ask us and we try to answer

00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:30,710
them can we have a mic raise the mic

00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:33,470
where is the microphone sorry Oh

00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:35,650
so who wants to start please don't be

00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,650
shy

00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:12,150
[Music]

00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,150
okay

00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:43,339
okay so if a small was breaking down the

00:40:41,749 --> 00:40:47,029
problem in small part that you are the

00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:48,769
difficulties right okay yeah to address

00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:51,049
this is I would say the most difficult

00:40:48,769 --> 00:40:52,669
in TDD is to be able to see the problem

00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:56,029
and breaking down in very incremental

00:40:52,669 --> 00:40:58,819
small step so that's all the magic I was

00:40:56,029 --> 00:41:04,149
in TDD what takes time to get so it's

00:40:58,819 --> 00:41:04,149
all about practice yeah next one

00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,710
shame

00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:39,270
yes yeah okay so that's a tricky

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,339
question I would say but it's some kind

00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:42,780
of rule let's say that every time you

00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:44,490
have like a condition that repeat three

00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,500
times or you can see three tests that

00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:47,849
fulfill the same condition then is the

00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,890
right time to group them together and

00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:52,050
have some logic so that's one of the

00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:53,670
rule now sometimes you can get you can

00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:55,950
take a bit shortcuts I would say if you

00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:57,869
hit logic and okay that's obvious

00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:59,130
then you can take shortcuts but those

00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:03,200
like I would say that the rules you can

00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:03,200
follow you work on

00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,690
next one

00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:32,290
who is that

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,570
ha

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,440
we

00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,220
Oh

00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,680
well

00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:20,140
okay yeah that depends on how you

00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:23,230
approach it is about the small step you

00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:25,180
can take and the code you only write the

00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:26,980
code when the test tells you to write it

00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:28,869
basically there's no other choice and

00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:31,210
what doesn't make sense if you have to

00:43:28,869 --> 00:43:32,560
refactor everything that's fine

00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:34,810
but as long as you have the two previous

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:40,050
tests that say okay that was the state

00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:40,050
and it has to be like that so it up yes

00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:59,530
what

00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:02,680
that might hurt by Oh

00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:04,150
for example about quality could just

00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,910
check whether that is something that is

00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:09,030
missing and that might have sought it

00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,030
out

00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:14,320
they're gonna demo later on programming

00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,060
out to resolve this in TDD so maybe you

00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:19,380
helped you saw what a step they're

00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:19,380
taking yeah

00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:42,789
[Music]

00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:36,930
okay so a flood today is very basic I

00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,190
would say with just small functions in a

00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,500
real world when you have prediction

00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:42,420
system it's way more complex but the

00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:44,790
idea is still to break break down to a

00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,080
very small function that are testable no

00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:49,470
matter why is this function called an

00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,640
API the HTTP or any other protocol then

00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:52,920
you can mock this part

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,830
the idea is to isolate to function and

00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:58,980
to simulate what's around you function

00:45:55,830 --> 00:46:00,690
so then the idea is still valid for TDD

00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,090
as long as you mock and you simulate

00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:06,920
what's around the new functions should

00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:06,920
still be tested in the TDY 3d way

00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:19,569
you join you mock if you do with actual

00:46:17,259 --> 00:46:21,249
data you have to connect the HTTP and

00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:23,619
everything this for me is more like

00:46:21,249 --> 00:47:26,440
integration test so you can still test

00:46:23,619 --> 00:47:33,369
after a while but the idea of opposite

00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:38,380
option is using personally I'm not a fan

00:47:33,369 --> 00:47:40,829
of using mocking the second approach but

00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:40,829
sometimes

00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:44,890
[Music]

00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:49,900
it is supposed to have we do think

00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:52,119
unicycle second-class if whatever was

00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:55,169
used to achieve this means and your

00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,169
tests are running past

00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:43,289
No okay remember

00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:53,390
confidence when you write so usually

00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,390
before

00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:56,790
and then

00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,190
yourself

00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,770
[Music]

00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:17,050
[Music]

00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:39,359
[Music]

00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:41,280
okay so now we don't the TDD part so I

00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:43,230
suggest we do a small break about ten

00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,140
minutes and then we're going to start

00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:48,180
with the pepra gramming part of the

00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:51,869
workshop so don't forget there's some

00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:53,700
snacks over there drinks so see you in

00:49:51,869 --> 00:49:58,170
about ten minutes so what time is it now

00:49:53,700 --> 00:50:01,470
it's 36 so at 45 see what modified we

00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:05,300
start so the second part of this

00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:08,790
workshop is about pair programming and

00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:13,460
just do a quick sound check the last day

00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:13,460
butter can you hear me you can okay

00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:22,010
before I even dive into this topic let

00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:25,280
me just say one thing to those who have

00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:26,750
voted the pathway say I've done it and I

00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,990
hate it all right

00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:30,500
this session is not to convince you you

00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:34,550
love it

00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:37,040
Barada is really to ask you questions

00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:39,890
about have you considered certain

00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:42,740
aspects of pair programming when you are

00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:44,270
doing it were those things present maybe

00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:47,390
because those things are not present

00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:49,520
that's why it makes you uncomfortable

00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:52,190
maybe it's because of those so try to

00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,109
consider put that into a part of our

00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:56,230
things that you want to think about me

00:50:54,109 --> 00:50:59,030
all right

00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:01,010
okay well start we've came back as you

00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:02,570
guys probably know when it comes to a

00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:05,710
pair programming when it comes to

00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:09,140
test-driven development these are all

00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:12,070
extreme programming the alcohol extreme

00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:14,810
programming and so there's another quote

00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:17,510
he said this thing if code reviews are

00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:21,980
good if code reviews are good we review

00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:26,270
code all the time and that the thinking

00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:28,460
behind that is this if if certain things

00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:32,680
are good why are we not doing it all the

00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:36,170
time one example is if testing is good

00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:37,550
why are we not testing all the time that

00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:39,950
is why introduced test-driven

00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:41,300
development tests all the time so now

00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:41,780
when we come to the topic of pair

00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,600
programming

00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:46,730
if code review is good why are we not

00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:50,359
reviewing all the time and as where is

00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:52,040
practice comes from now I don't know how

00:51:50,359 --> 00:51:54,500
many of you guys everyday when you wake

00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,560
up you go to work you wrote you look

00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:59,240
forward to review other people's code

00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:01,730
you look forward to approve a pull

00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:07,490
request how many of you guys enjoy doing

00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:09,940
them okay very nice for the rest of us

00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:12,890
mortals we probably don't like and

00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:14,900
sometimes the problem is this somebody

00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:17,900
write some code you have no clues or

00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:20,810
contacts and you just got a pull request

00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:22,430
you look at a code and the best you can

00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:25,600
do at that point in time is what you do

00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:27,680
syntax check how much value is that and

00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:29,000
if you're in a hurry you check the

00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:32,360
syntax nothing seems to be

00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:36,380
serious all those now cases I handed so

00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:38,660
just accept that but a favorite pair

00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,760
programming is it allows you to do code

00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:43,280
review on the fly and I will explain it

00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:45,200
a bit more later now this is what pay

00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,860
programming is and what pair programming

00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,880
is not I hope this doesn't clarify for

00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:52,120
you guys

00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,470
I noticed quite heavy of misconception

00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:55,130
let's start with the left side the white

00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:57,710
one

00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:59,890
first of all pair programming is not

00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:03,050
paying two persons to do a same thing

00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:04,940
when a manager or where someone outside

00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:08,330
we look at two programmer city together

00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:10,490
do something you may assume that they

00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:13,070
are doing that but in reality when it

00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:16,250
comes to programming the fact that you

00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:17,120
type right is actually not what you do

00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:19,250
most of the time

00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:20,990
it's thinking through logic trying to

00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:24,170
figure things out that is why you do

00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:25,970
most of the time so pair programming is

00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:29,480
not paying to person sitting or keyboard

00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:31,040
just typing is not it's about on the

00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,740
right side it's like investing in better

00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:36,740
software quality and design I do notice

00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:38,390
even earlier on when we do a TDD some of

00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:39,910
you guys already are collaborating

00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:42,830
talking to each other already

00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:44,690
now when you face such a simple problem

00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:45,470
in this workshop and you're able to

00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:47,750
collaborate

00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:50,750
what more when it comes to writing

00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:54,350
production code why shouldn't we call a

00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:56,330
bit in that manner second some people

00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:58,070
would think pair programming is only

00:53:56,330 --> 00:54:00,530
good for training in other words Oh a

00:53:58,070 --> 00:54:03,500
newbie just join our company let's pair

00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:05,240
and most a newbie can fly leave him

00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:08,890
leave him and let him do on its own

00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:10,820
stuff but pack away is also about

00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:13,280
complementing each other's strengths and

00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:15,710
with and knowledge right today you may

00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,440
be working on this part of system the

00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:20,390
other person another part then the next

00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,800
day when both of you comes together you

00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,450
have knowledge about your entire system

00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,370
even more because two persons are

00:54:23,450 --> 00:54:28,970
working together you complement each

00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:31,100
other some people thinks that pay

00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:33,790
programming works well only for a small

00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,790
number of people

00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:38,910
that may be something that instinctively

00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:41,069
we may think so especially those who of

00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:42,630
us who haven't paid before you may think

00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:45,539
that well I don't like to someone to be

00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:47,130
looking over my shoulder but those who

00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:49,049
have tried pepero gramming surprisingly

00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:51,299
works well for majority of people i'm

00:54:49,049 --> 00:54:56,299
not saying for everyone for majority

00:54:51,299 --> 00:54:58,799
I've seen some cases where it's just

00:54:56,299 --> 00:55:01,799
it's just not possible to pay program

00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:03,930
well if that person okay but it works

00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:07,170
well for majority I hope today over here

00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:09,150
is the majority part pair programming is

00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:11,490
just it's not just code and syntax

00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:13,440
review by the partner so you have two

00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:15,420
person sitting one person typing the

00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,309
stuff the other person and the left just

00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:20,579
look at all the syntax and correcting

00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:23,099
order syntax if you did pair programming

00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:26,430
in the past and that is what you do just

00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:28,200
do syntax check I am calling that

00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:30,660
suffering in silence because it's very

00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,430
boring just it dance in distract but

00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:34,920
rather pair programming is a context

00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:37,140
which review and collaborative design

00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,760
activity which also means that when

00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:42,359
someone chose to write code in a certain

00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:44,339
way since you are around you have the

00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:47,299
context on why that things being done

00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:49,319
that way and if you feel otherwise

00:55:47,299 --> 00:55:51,329
immediately you are able to comment

00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:52,829
because you have a context and like way

00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:54,059
do a pull request you just review so

00:55:52,829 --> 00:55:57,210
much thought you may not have order

00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:59,250
context so this is why program is also

00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:02,460
quite effective in a sense gives you a

00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,819
context rich review the last two things

00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:08,520
is you have to pay for everything

00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:10,349
some people feel that wow my team is

00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,940
doing pair programming I don't like it

00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:14,520
because the moment I stepped in office I

00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:18,240
must be pairing someone else until the

00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:20,940
moment I leave the office or even cases

00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:22,619
like I just want to try our serve the

00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:24,779
dates on the play of so the technology

00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:28,710
what you mean I must hire someone to do

00:56:24,779 --> 00:56:30,690
that no usually the recommendation is

00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:33,150
minimally should parent production code

00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:34,710
in other words the code that you write

00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:37,140
they will end up being in production

00:56:34,710 --> 00:56:40,529
systems you should at least minimally

00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:43,079
parent that and the last thing is no

00:56:40,529 --> 00:56:44,849
more individual time it's similar to

00:56:43,079 --> 00:56:47,099
what I've just said the moment instead

00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:49,829
of office you must start pairing ready

00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:52,349
even when I check my emails repair reply

00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:54,390
to other people I must pay as it it

00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:56,999
doesn't mean that you can consider this

00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:59,910
thing called call pairing hours your

00:56:56,999 --> 00:57:02,190
team can agree to say that when we do

00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:04,229
pairing a production code we can start

00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:06,720
pairing from let's say 10:00 a.m. to

00:57:04,229 --> 00:57:09,690
12:00 then take a lunch break that may

00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,249
be tree to 5:00 the rest of our time you

00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:11,729
can do the rest of things that you need

00:57:11,249 --> 00:57:14,609
to do

00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:16,859
okay I'm pressure none of us here have

00:57:14,609 --> 00:57:18,420
this luxury of outgoing the office and

00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:19,559
just start coding right there's always

00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:22,319
meat things and all these other things

00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:24,089
but if you have a core paring hours you

00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:25,410
could focus on writing a code the

00:57:24,089 --> 00:57:29,390
restaurant IMing and do the other things

00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:32,390
that's required of you okay

00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:35,369
terminology it is important to clarify

00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:38,940
the terminology because going forward

00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:41,369
I'm gonna keep using this was what is a

00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:43,759
driver a driver in pair programming is a

00:57:41,369 --> 00:57:45,720
person who's typing on a keyboard or

00:57:43,759 --> 00:57:48,569
holding on to the mouse that is the

00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:51,390
driver okay you're the one who typed the

00:57:48,569 --> 00:57:53,880
person sitting next to you in the past

00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:55,950
is top partner that's a partner it's

00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:57,180
nothing wrong to call partner but I've

00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:59,910
also noticed that the terminology

00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:01,819
Navigator comes out in play and never

00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:03,930
again if someone sits next to you and

00:58:01,819 --> 00:58:06,479
paraview yet at the same time try to

00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:08,940
think about what are the scenarios that

00:58:06,479 --> 00:58:11,069
you may need to cover you handle in your

00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,390
code okay so the partner or the

00:58:11,069 --> 00:58:15,269
Navigator works with your driver

00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:21,029
together I'll be using these terms

00:58:15,269 --> 00:58:22,170
interchangeably as we go along right so

00:58:21,029 --> 00:58:25,619
this one we're gonna do a pair

00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:27,029
programming demo in fact I'm actually

00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:29,009
quite happy that most of you are still

00:58:27,029 --> 00:58:30,839
around because some people say pay go

00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:32,609
away I don't wanna leave already by

00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:36,719
listening area try it out okay

00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:40,079
for a demo before I demoed that I need

00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:42,779
you to find someone to pair with because

00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,749
you're going to try there as well first

00:58:42,779 --> 00:58:46,979
introduce your name and what is your

00:58:45,749 --> 00:58:48,960
favorite programming language

00:58:46,979 --> 00:58:51,920
find a partner first all right I'll give

00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:55,400
you one minute sure we have to find okay

00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,400
start looking for

00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:09,640
for those who don't have a partner

00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:13,570
we have people who is ready to pay

00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:16,170
review our naydon our new movie won't be

00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:16,170
available yet

00:59:23,829 --> 00:59:34,160
okay now the next thing is the next

00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:36,609
thing is between the two of you decide

00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:39,470
who's left top will be used

00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:42,170
okay decide whose laptop will be used

00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:45,609
because you've been using one laptop as

00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:45,609
a payer is only one laptop

00:59:52,270 --> 01:00:00,200
okay we're gonna move on now right the

00:59:58,070 --> 01:00:02,750
reason why I asked you guys to pay up

01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:05,090
now is because later on when you

01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:07,190
actually do the pairing to write a

01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:09,920
program you have to watch out for this

01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:15,859
thing and this my guide Hitchhiker's

01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:16,820
Guide on how not to pay program not to

01:00:15,859 --> 01:00:19,280
pay program okay

01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:22,940
and in order to demonstrate this I

01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:26,510
invite my oscar-winning actors Armel and

01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:29,720
Kevin what Egger do is they would show

01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:33,500
you a scenario you have to observe the

01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:36,980
scenario after that you tell me which

01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:39,369
one from 1 to 5 which one of it that

01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:41,570
they are doing okay what is the

01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:44,990
dysfunction that they are showing all

01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:47,950
that clear so I'm going to ask them to

01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,950
start press alright

01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,000
right

01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:25,420
okay stop all right which one is it

01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:28,450
second one quiet Quincy and disengage

01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:31,410
then which one is the quiet Quincy and

01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:31,410
which were disengage then

01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,300
huh

01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:47,860
yeah

01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:49,930
you mean Elmo is quiet okay yeah what's

01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:52,810
happening is Kevin wasn't talking very

01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:55,120
much when he caught and a moody try to

01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:56,170
engage but in the end he gave up that's

01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,440
why I pulled out his hand when I saw

01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,440
something

01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:04,000
okay before I even comment on that let's

01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:06,390
go on to the second scenario okay okay

01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,390
guys ready

01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:11,340
[Music]

01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:31,599
okay stop which one is it

01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:41,950
sorry so I see hugging

01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:43,820
huh five hasty Henson no that's not one

01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:47,780
right just wrong

01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:49,400
and is it right yeah right just won't

01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:50,720
this will be the kind of person when

01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:55,670
you're caught you always think you're

01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:58,670
the only one who knows the answer it can

01:02:55,670 --> 01:03:00,290
happen but in fair programming you have

01:02:58,670 --> 01:03:02,089
to be open to listen to other

01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:04,010
suggestions and that's from a

01:03:02,089 --> 01:03:04,490
perspective of the driver the person who

01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:06,830
types

01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:09,320
now sometimes is a person the navigator

01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:11,089
who thinks or the partner who thinks he

01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:13,220
or she is the right one no you're doing

01:03:11,089 --> 01:03:15,650
this wrong oh this is wrong right pay

01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:17,630
program is a collaborative work so both

01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:21,940
sides needs to learn to collaborate in

01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:21,940
that sense okay ready with the scenario

01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:34,489
[Music]

01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:55,020
okay stop what is this what is for Dirty

01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:55,020
Harry is it right okay not a signal I

01:03:55,470 --> 01:04:02,740
think in terms of our own way our

01:03:59,890 --> 01:04:06,000
tidiness or how clean that impacts paper

01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:08,500
wearing a lot I used to pair with

01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,240
ex-colleague in the past before you

01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,250
start sparing you always take an alcohol

01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,260
wipe to wipe the keyboard and to what

01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:16,570
the mouse then only we start pairing I

01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:18,790
was laughing at him and say why are you

01:04:16,570 --> 01:04:20,110
doing all these things we are clean then

01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:23,770
you tries to prove the media is not

01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:26,470
clean how by taking a keyboard flipping

01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:28,470
it upside down petting and all the

01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:33,010
crumbs that Fossum keyboard comes out

01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:35,110
now and sometimes the theory can occur

01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:36,550
where you eat oily food right now paper

01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:38,710
or gaming the same you can eat football

01:04:36,550 --> 01:04:40,390
someone call right there were hands oily

01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:42,760
you start to grab keyboards are typing

01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:44,620
they'll give back their partner this guy

01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:48,330
thinks hygiene we have to watch our for

01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:48,330
right ok next one

01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:54,350
yeah

01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:12,750
okay stop so that's a bit Oh acting but

01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:17,200
okay what is it why is it three or five

01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:21,460
this actually which eyes it honking

01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:23,230
Henry yeah when we get in we have this

01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:25,570
thing called the fluorite as developers

01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:26,860
we get into the flow and some time we're

01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:29,920
going to a flow we just don't people

01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:31,720
this stuff what would be helpful in that

01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,580
case is to have a certain comment

01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:35,350
understand it before you start so that

01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,690
if you're in a you know in a flow let

01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:38,970
your partner to do it or if you feel not

01:05:37,690 --> 01:05:43,060
covered at least talk about it

01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:43,840
beforehand all right one last one last

01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:48,000
thing

01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:48,000
no no prize for guessing there

01:05:57,610 --> 01:06:04,040
[Music]

01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:04,040
okay stop

01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:10,290
that is hasty Henson yeah now there's

01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:11,670
one thing is in psychology in

01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:14,520
programming psychology is you need to

01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:16,890
understand the person who is typing will

01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:19,530
not always be the fastest to spot things

01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:21,750
the person who's watching usually spot

01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:24,150
things faster for example if you are

01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:27,570
typing and you try to click on a menu

01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:31,320
file open let's say let's say let's take

01:06:27,570 --> 01:06:33,270
the example your pair will catch where

01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:35,670
the menu is faster than you do sometimes

01:06:33,270 --> 01:06:38,400
you just go see that's just psychology

01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:40,110
it goes with this thing if you write a

01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,690
code you open your bracket close the

01:06:40,110 --> 01:06:45,000
bracket and you miss it usually your

01:06:42,690 --> 01:06:47,280
pair will spot faster now when it comes

01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,770
to pairing you have to be patient let

01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,330
the driver take his or her time to

01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:54,420
finish what is finished until you

01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:56,550
realize he or she really forgot then you

01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:58,290
went to make a note of that obvious

01:06:56,550 --> 01:07:00,750
driver is struggling why the code

01:06:58,290 --> 01:07:02,370
doesn't compile and you know there is

01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:05,280
because of syntax error then you can

01:07:02,370 --> 01:07:09,600
point it out okay so these are the five

01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:12,230
dysfunctions on how not to program yep

01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,230
thanks guys

01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:25,660
well deserves a clap so from from that

01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:28,540
end I like to move now into how then

01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:30,100
should I approach my programming this is

01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:32,440
what I would use golden rule the

01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:34,180
programming is simply this do unto

01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:35,950
others what you want em to do unto you

01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:38,470
like treat others like how you want to

01:07:35,950 --> 01:07:41,680
treat you and it's not a very difficult

01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:43,780
skill some people call it kindergarten

01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:49,360
skills since young we are taught to do

01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:52,150
that so some suggestions this is an

01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:54,490
incomplete guy okay this is an

01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:57,240
incomplete guy because he doesn't your

01:07:54,490 --> 01:08:00,160
you may have your own ways first one is

01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:03,010
use we when expressing something that

01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:06,940
may not be favorable you may be coding

01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:09,370
and you find your pair is coding towards

01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:12,310
the wrong direction when it's going to a

01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:14,740
road direction you don't start to say

01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:16,960
something like hey that's a stupid way

01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:20,620
of going you're going a wrong way rather

01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:23,170
than let's say I think we are going the

01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:25,690
wrong way that brings in the team spirit

01:08:23,170 --> 01:08:30,040
this is just a simple freezing but it

01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:32,440
does help second point use I when

01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:34,569
they're going that's tough for you your

01:08:32,440 --> 01:08:37,210
pair maybe typing something and you

01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:40,660
couldn't follow so what you would want

01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:42,220
to do is say I'm sorry I cannot follow

01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:46,630
what you're doing can you explain to me

01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:48,310
the third one is the Navigator

01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:51,279
can offer the drive and a driver is

01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:54,759
stuck or when unable to express an idea

01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:57,069
verbally so you may be pairing a partner

01:08:54,759 --> 01:08:58,960
and it's type he or she is typing half

01:08:57,069 --> 01:09:01,359
way true realize he or she stopped but

01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,190
you have an idea why not offer to take

01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:05,020
all the keyboard and just say let me

01:09:03,190 --> 01:09:07,540
show you what I have in mind or you

01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,839
might have check are you stuck can I

01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:09,759
help

01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:12,460
so just take away start typing that's

01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:16,690
how you swap pass sorry swap the rows

01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:18,940
within the pack really quickly okay now

01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:20,589
point four is driver's consider

01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:24,730
vocalising your thoughts whenever

01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:26,309
possible religious now there's one point

01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:29,940
where Kevin is showing is this type

01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:32,009
is not saying anything I don't know how

01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:33,949
many of us you have the gift of the

01:09:32,009 --> 01:09:37,109
ability to read minds

01:09:33,949 --> 01:09:40,079
no now because of that we don't have

01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:42,539
that gift we need to help our pair to

01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:44,549
know where we are going so if you try to

01:09:42,539 --> 01:09:47,869
think about vocalizing what you're doing

01:09:44,549 --> 01:09:50,190
or what you're thinking for men

01:09:47,869 --> 01:09:52,859
typically can get a bit difficult

01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:54,710
because we cannot not eat us it takes

01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:58,050
time to train yourself to do that I

01:09:54,710 --> 01:10:00,030
remember if you if you read the book

01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:02,969
pragmatic programmer anyone who read

01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:04,980
their before pragmatic programmer okay

01:10:02,969 --> 01:10:07,980
yeah so there's this part where they

01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:09,480
talk about rubber ducking rubber duckie

01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:11,639
is a technique where if you're stuck

01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:13,710
imagine you are writing your coat and

01:10:11,639 --> 01:10:15,480
you're speaking to a rubber duck just

01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:17,190
vocalize what you're doing that

01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:19,530
sometimes help you to get unstuck and

01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:23,389
when you're vocalizing with your pen

01:10:19,530 --> 01:10:26,550
that can be helpful as well right so

01:10:23,389 --> 01:10:30,150
later on when you try the pair

01:10:26,550 --> 01:10:32,010
programming try this consider vocalizing

01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:35,460
a toast and see how it feels if you're

01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:37,670
not used to that point number five give

01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:39,869
permissions explicitly and upfront

01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:41,969
especially a pairing or someone new I

01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:44,670
know this among us there are some of us

01:10:41,969 --> 01:10:46,530
are people who know each other so that

01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:48,570
can be easy but if you're a parent

01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:49,590
someone new that person may not know how

01:10:48,570 --> 01:10:52,739
you work and you don't know how the

01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:54,750
person work you can consider telling

01:10:52,739 --> 01:10:56,210
upfront what you're comfortable with

01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:59,699
what you're not comfortable with I

01:10:56,210 --> 01:11:03,389
remember when I first had I was telling

01:10:59,699 --> 01:11:05,699
my partner stop me if I'm too fast well

01:11:03,389 --> 01:11:07,289
I was full of ego I thought I could type

01:11:05,699 --> 01:11:09,030
very fast that my partner cannot follow

01:11:07,289 --> 01:11:12,059
but most of the time you told me you're

01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:13,349
too slow okay fair enough but it's

01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:15,449
things like this that's helpful you know

01:11:13,349 --> 01:11:17,670
at least you know you give your partner

01:11:15,449 --> 01:11:19,650
permission if you see me being stuck can

01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:21,960
you just jump in feel free to just jump

01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:25,199
in that will set up a good context for

01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:26,460
you to start pepper running point number

01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,960
six navigators

01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:30,780
watch your drivers back by tracking

01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:32,820
reminding things now this really used to

01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:34,920
especially we do test-driven development

01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:37,619
your partner is thinking about test case

01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,920
writing a code and when you may realize

01:11:37,619 --> 01:11:42,050
what about this edge

01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,300
case that you need to handle now instead

01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:45,920
of disturbing the driver at the point in

01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,810
time to say so so I've something to

01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:50,840
discuss with you and your driveways in

01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:53,360
the flow you just jot down that that

01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:54,290
path that the thing you need if you feel

01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,929
that needs to be addressed

01:11:54,290 --> 01:11:59,270
and when the driveways reach a logical

01:11:56,929 --> 01:12:01,670
point just stop the driver I think we

01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:03,650
need to handle this special scenario

01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:05,360
that's that's one sort of things that I

01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:08,690
find it very helpful in a past when i

01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:11,449
pair with someone else points I will

01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:15,050
never get us be patient and this we this

01:12:11,449 --> 01:12:16,670
comes to hasty Hansen right that the

01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:20,480
person is typing mean always be the

01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:23,719
fastest the next one is lose the ego and

01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:25,160
put on humility this especially true if

01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:26,810
you are not used to pay programming or

01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:30,260
your parents someone you're not familiar

01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:32,210
with all of us fear that we are being

01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:34,520
judged right well this person looking

01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:35,030
through my shoulder I wonder if I'm good

01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:37,280
enough

01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:40,280
we always fear that but if you always

01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:42,920
have that thinking in mind it's gonna be

01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:44,810
very hard to pack you have to learn to

01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:47,360
let let go of your ego and put on

01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:51,199
humility all of us make mistakes so it's

01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:53,080
okay to make mistakes last two things

01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:54,530
first take care of your person I gene

01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:57,320
Dirty Harry

01:12:54,530 --> 01:12:59,060
so not gonna comment more and point

01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:04,100
number ten is soft pass often and

01:12:59,060 --> 01:13:06,110
logical stopping point one of the reason

01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:10,280
why we do pair programming is because of

01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:12,260
knowledge spreading you wanna module we

01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:15,199
pair someone else that person will also

01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:19,070
get the knowledge how many of you guys

01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:22,400
should do scrum okay ready to scrum I

01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:25,130
assume your screen length is about two

01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:26,810
weeks three weeks four weeks okay the

01:13:25,130 --> 01:13:30,800
four is the maximum idea if more then

01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:33,020
you're not doing scrum if you pair

01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:36,260
together and you work through the entire

01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:38,960
sprint you kind of lose the benefit of

01:13:36,260 --> 01:13:41,870
pepra gramming because you're not

01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:43,280
sharing knowledge enough within a spin

01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:46,160
you're creating a silo

01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:48,160
within the pair for sprint so make have

01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:51,739
the program I usually want to speak pass

01:13:48,160 --> 01:13:53,930
within the spring itself okay it's

01:13:51,739 --> 01:13:56,120
better if you there are options for the

01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:59,060
you can split at the point after you do

01:13:56,120 --> 01:14:02,000
a check-in you spear someone else or you

01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:04,790
can finish a story for example then you

01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,140
stop pass I think this is one of the

01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:07,280
most common problem people like to pair

01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:09,620
each other so much that you don't know

01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:14,750
so you must you must accurately that

01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:16,220
stopping now when it comes to to possess

01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:19,400
it in together when you look at a person

01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:21,470
you've just decided to pair with how do

01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:23,270
you do the pairing early on I was just

01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:25,280
talking about attitudes and behaviors

01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:26,420
now the mechanics there are generally

01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,730
three options I know there are

01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:32,720
variations but just highlight three the

01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:34,580
process time boss time box means when

01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:36,350
two persons come together one person

01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:39,890
would be writing the tests and writing a

01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:43,580
code for X amount of minutes when a time

01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:45,200
finish you swap the role so that the the

01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:47,240
partner now becomes a one who drives

01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:49,970
whereas the other one will just be the

01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:53,120
partner that's time box it's up to you

01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:54,770
to figure what works for you in terms of

01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,160
time box some people try the Pomodoro

01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:57,560
Technique

01:14:55,160 --> 01:15:00,680
there are variations to that the second

01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:03,200
way is called fluid fluid is when two

01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:04,760
persons work together you can just swap

01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:06,080
at any point in time phrase out if

01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,060
you're stuck the other person just take

01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:09,530
over and continue or if you feel that

01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:11,000
you have better ideas just take over and

01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:14,470
continue just keep swapping there's no

01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:17,180
definite time to solve but it's fluid

01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:19,250
third one is a ping pong technique where

01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:21,620
one person will write a test case then

01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:23,420
you pass over to your partner to write

01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:25,610
the code that means your partner becomes

01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:27,830
a driver now to the code to pass a test

01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:30,080
case and this works well if you do TDD

01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:31,670
you write a test then your partner

01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:35,150
either code the make sure it passed

01:15:31,670 --> 01:15:37,370
before you solve the rule later on our

01:15:35,150 --> 01:15:39,470
demo review our demo for you the ping

01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:41,900
pong method when I pair with a mu and

01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:43,790
the last one is really richest of the

01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:45,260
above you can always change and if

01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:46,520
between different partners some would

01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:51,830
prefer different things

01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:55,340
try yourself what works so when I'm

01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:58,760
sitting with a moon later to avoid this

01:15:55,340 --> 01:16:00,110
demo as a spectator sport I want you to

01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:02,330
notice something because there are some

01:16:00,110 --> 01:16:05,060
things that you know interaction that

01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:06,410
you need to pick up and we're doing the

01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:08,540
brief of the read what is it

01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:13,360
come okay so what do you notice or pick

01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:15,890
up from this demo right so I want to

01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,980
know not this one so I'm just going to

01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:21,100
do a demo now I invite ammu come sit

01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:21,100
with me

01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:29,070
a different

01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:51,880
you say hello to me

01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:11,140
okay I'm just gonna adjust the mic a bit

01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:20,960
okay nice can you hear me can you at

01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:22,070
least see our face if not then we may

01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,230
need to turn on the lights

01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:27,250
they can't see the screen they can see

01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:27,250
the screen okay

01:17:29,619 --> 01:17:37,869
good alright so can you see this

01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:40,599
yes it's okay couple into space we are

01:17:37,869 --> 01:17:43,060
going to use ping pong for the pairing

01:17:40,599 --> 01:17:46,330
session yeah I suggest that are you okay

01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:48,540
yes any time if you feel if you want to

01:17:46,330 --> 01:17:51,010
take over the machine feel freedom yeah

01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:53,349
so let me just give you a debrief

01:17:51,010 --> 01:17:56,320
yesterday Kevin ourself we are pairing

01:17:53,349 --> 01:17:59,050
on this what counting exercise so we are

01:17:56,320 --> 01:18:01,090
writing tests and I got some test cases

01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:03,460
passing for the simplest case for

01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:05,199
example a single word but then six

01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:07,150
o'clock came and we just decided go home

01:18:05,199 --> 01:18:10,060
so I just want to pick it up from here

01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:12,849
today and since you're available yeah

01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:15,699
homie that's to me okay so these are

01:18:12,849 --> 01:18:20,020
doing ping pong I thought I saw like

01:18:15,699 --> 01:18:21,489
that okay so can I interrupt you yeah

01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:23,080
what is the current state of the test

01:18:21,489 --> 01:18:25,210
cases that we have are they all passing

01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:26,739
yeah I never thought of that

01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:32,110
yeah let's see if we understable ground

01:18:26,739 --> 01:18:33,960
so there's this run a test oh okay so

01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:37,110
one or test is failing

01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:39,639
so we see some implementation probably

01:18:37,110 --> 01:18:42,190
yeah so there's a case way I have two

01:18:39,639 --> 01:18:45,130
sentences repeated twice what I'm

01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:47,980
supposed to get to yeah this way I fail

01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:50,080
the test case yesterday we went home

01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:54,520
are you come for the try now or you want

01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:57,610
me right yeah

01:18:54,520 --> 01:19:02,280
okay so we're basically missing the

01:18:57,610 --> 01:19:04,810
scenario where we need to have towards a

01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:07,000
possible solution that I can think of is

01:19:04,810 --> 01:19:09,880
I would like to since we're doing it

01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:11,680
until anyway yeah maybe I can implement

01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:15,940
this fake it till you make it so I

01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:20,560
probably select I will check the

01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:24,220
sentence okay to be equal to word word

01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:26,670
okay and if that is the case shall

01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:26,670
return

01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:36,760
the frequency for what does that make

01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:36,760
sense be honest if the task is pass

01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:45,880
yeah okay that's nice sure interest at

01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:49,000
that that's guess so now that we have

01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:50,980
this two words working I'm thinking of

01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:53,440
introducing a different one that should

01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:56,500
help us to take a case way I expected

01:19:53,440 --> 01:20:00,820
result come on and more than one would

01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:01,400
count okay let me show you what happen

01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:03,340
Mike yeah

01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:06,050
[Music]

01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:12,170
so what I was thinking of is just to

01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:14,690
sentence with with different word and a

01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:19,610
word repeated twice okay in that case is

01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:25,400
to return a count of three and count of

01:20:19,610 --> 01:20:27,700
one for the non repeat that would is

01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:27,700
okay

01:20:29,189 --> 01:20:32,139
okay

01:20:30,489 --> 01:20:36,789
yeah wait for you to write the sentence

01:20:32,139 --> 01:20:40,559
maybe yeah okay so let me just add one

01:20:36,789 --> 01:20:43,629
more maybe called another word okay

01:20:40,559 --> 01:20:45,039
can I think we would probably be

01:20:43,629 --> 01:20:49,739
expecting the count of 2 instead of

01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:49,739
Coventry ah yeah yeah all right

01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:58,220
that looks more reasonable so in the so

01:20:55,100 --> 01:21:02,990
in case of this expectation I would want

01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:03,170
to have another and one does that look

01:21:02,990 --> 01:21:08,920
good

01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:08,920
yeah it sounds good so let's run a test

01:21:09,809 --> 01:21:15,289
and we run all the tests first make sure

01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:15,289
we are still okay with that

01:21:17,719 --> 01:21:23,360
nice alright is it failing based on what

01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:26,920
I expect yes defecting towards but we

01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:26,920
only have a single one yep

01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:38,090
okay I think so now what we need to

01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:41,960
check is that because we have different

01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:44,510
words I could fake it but solution is

01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:46,130
kind of obvious in its way so I would

01:21:44,510 --> 01:21:49,610
rather want to break down a sentence

01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:51,770
into different words okay and send out

01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:55,540
the frequencies from there so look look

01:21:51,770 --> 01:21:59,090
through the gray of words that I receive

01:21:55,540 --> 01:22:01,490
frequency but I think it would be got

01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:03,770
some sort of refactoring so actually I'm

01:22:01,490 --> 01:22:06,350
not comfortable running this test yet

01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:09,820
could i uncomment this they're growing

01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:09,820
change and come back - yeah

01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:18,090
so I'll comment this out and what I'm

01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:18,090
trying to do here is

01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:24,450
I find out what I have in my sentence

01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:31,060
you would under spin yourself that's

01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:31,060
right yes

01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:40,250
so sentence all right

01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:52,240
so I'll split it with the space yeah

01:22:48,110 --> 01:22:52,240
so I have the words and then

01:22:56,360 --> 01:23:00,610
I'll go through each one yep

01:23:03,489 --> 01:23:10,360
and now I want to check whether

01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:13,070
this word is present inside

01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:17,360
no it should be accumulator some saucer

01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:19,960
collector right yeah we need something

01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,960
to collect

01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:28,840
does it not check does that mean yes

01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:32,110
what does what accumulator make sense or

01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:35,340
would you prefer something else yeah I

01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:35,340
make sense immediately

01:23:36,219 --> 01:23:41,230
so we this accumulator will basically

01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:42,969
store the frequency of each defeat an

01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:45,390
award yeah so now what I'm trying to

01:23:42,969 --> 01:23:45,390
check is

01:23:50,119 --> 01:23:53,119
if

01:23:54,950 --> 01:23:59,330
the world is already present is to be

01:23:58,490 --> 01:24:02,900
presently lying

01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:04,310
sorry he's on line five the keys

01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:08,680
he shouldn't be sentence right it should

01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:08,680
be accumulated right

01:24:12,150 --> 01:24:16,460
so if I find that I've checked yeah

01:24:18,170 --> 01:24:21,490
what I wanted two ways

01:24:22,230 --> 01:24:30,750
incremental frequency for that specific

01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:37,680
object there so simulator word Espace

01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:37,680
okay if not I wish to initialize it

01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:44,890
is that correct I don't think is correct

01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:47,760
by you can write a test case and see how

01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:47,760
it works yeah

01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:57,350
aporia sales yeah because this is to be

01:24:56,690 --> 01:25:01,390
a function

01:24:57,350 --> 01:25:01,390
I see right

01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:09,890
so what should be

01:25:11,110 --> 01:25:16,580
let me rename it yeah software so it's

01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:20,270
clear us because we are looking at keys

01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:22,020
or that's always key yep so I expect the

01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:25,020
word to be going

01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:25,020
okay

01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:40,950
all right test bus okay so let's add a

01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:43,320
comment our your the refactor first

01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:46,200
because I felt that code just now

01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:47,880
especially line 14 sentence but what I

01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:51,960
don't do me all right it could be the

01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:55,260
cause of acrossing that's returns

01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:57,449
America we tend accumulate right so

01:25:55,260 --> 01:26:00,710
that's fine

01:25:57,449 --> 01:26:00,710
result that we have

01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:12,030
oh all right it fails yeah I think

01:26:08,860 --> 01:26:12,030
America's acting

01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:20,570
sorry what is room so let me show you so

01:26:17,659 --> 01:26:23,739
I'm thinking of this and wonder is

01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:23,739
because of the plus pass

01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,260
let's try this

01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:50,330
No failed again I think what we're

01:26:44,110 --> 01:26:53,640
expecting is there's probably an issue

01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:55,140
there is although we have actually

01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:58,770
should not be 0 right

01:26:55,140 --> 01:27:01,440
oh yeah it should be 1 right it should

01:26:58,770 --> 01:27:03,449
be 1 because when the object doesn't

01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:05,310
isn't present but you already Ike riding

01:27:03,449 --> 01:27:07,080
through it so I think the blood splash

01:27:05,310 --> 01:27:10,070
should be fine to be honest let's do

01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:10,070
that understand processor

01:27:13,510 --> 01:27:16,650
open busses

01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:24,380
whooping all right yep

01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:26,650
that's a comment our corner yeah let's

01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:26,650
write it

01:27:29,099 --> 01:27:40,190
Oh puss is it a reasonable sentence

01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:40,190
looks like it

01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:45,360
okay yeah all right dude it's time to

01:27:43,650 --> 01:27:49,050
check in it looks like we have reach a

01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:51,240
logical point yeah sure I think I'm good

01:27:49,050 --> 01:27:55,440
with it I wouldn't want to refactor this

01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:58,380
at this point I'm okay

01:27:55,440 --> 01:28:00,990
who do you think in we need to have

01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:03,630
another test case or is that sufficient

01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:06,150
coverage for now I think it's fine for

01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:18,360
now okay yeah okay

01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:24,770
thank you let's take a break okay so

01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:24,770
what do you guys all serve what happened

01:28:26,770 --> 01:28:32,170
or slippery did the quarry so boring

01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:35,850
they slept okay sorry let me change the

01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:35,850
mic because this is too much feedback

01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:53,449
well while I change and making you guys

01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:53,449
start thinking

01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:05,019
what what do you notice about my

01:29:03,189 --> 01:29:07,289
interaction if a bow or his interaction

01:29:05,019 --> 01:29:07,289
with me

01:29:20,150 --> 01:29:25,900
they were very committed

01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:27,880
yeah okay I'm gonna ask me a lot of

01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:31,719
questions like shall we do this

01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:33,340
are you okay to do this so that is his

01:29:31,719 --> 01:29:35,290
style when I pair someone else it could

01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:37,719
be different but yes that does a useful

01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:40,350
thing to to us immerse just check what

01:29:37,719 --> 01:29:40,350
else you know this

01:29:46,409 --> 01:29:53,139
I'm psychedlic I could get you straight

01:29:51,550 --> 01:29:55,739
away

01:29:53,139 --> 01:29:55,739
make sure

01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:02,520
yeah that is a good point because

01:30:00,690 --> 01:30:04,290
sometimes we jump too fast to so much

01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:05,850
mistake because the person especially

01:30:04,290 --> 01:30:08,520
the the driver you

01:30:05,850 --> 01:30:09,840
he or she may realize it by him or

01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:15,200
herself later

01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:17,940
so don't know jump so fast what is this

01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:20,010
agreement that we started with we come

01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:26,100
together what was the agreement that we

01:30:20,010 --> 01:30:27,570
we talked about yeah so so we agree on

01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:32,670
how we are going to approach the firing

01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:37,100
session okay anything else your other

01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:39,870
race that I miss in our pairing no good

01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:41,700
yeah so we actually check with each

01:30:39,870 --> 01:30:43,800
other and whether we are done with the

01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:46,200
test and this is the advantage of

01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:48,930
pairing as compared to doing TDD alone

01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:51,180
we do TDD you don't know whether is time

01:30:48,930 --> 01:30:54,060
to stop or not but when you a pair with

01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:55,380
you both of you feels that you is a good

01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:57,150
time to pretend that's that's a really

01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:59,820
good feedback to get it's a good

01:30:57,150 --> 01:31:02,340
feedback to know when to stop and he

01:30:59,820 --> 01:31:05,540
also asked me about the renaming of a

01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:09,390
variable should it be an accumulator

01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:11,280
when repair sorry where we want alone

01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:12,660
sometimes we come up with some variables

01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:15,960
that we think it's clear to the whole

01:31:12,660 --> 01:31:18,270
world sometimes it's not having a pair

01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:20,790
with you to check that if it's clear for

01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:22,020
two persons chances are you be clear for

01:31:20,790 --> 01:31:23,610
some other people as well

01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:26,880
these are all the advantages that comes

01:31:23,610 --> 01:31:30,420
as you work together on that okay so

01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:32,070
this uh that's about a debrief for the

01:31:30,420 --> 01:31:34,640
demo unless you have any other questions

01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:34,640
that you wanna raise

01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:05,469
is efficient it saves time eventually

01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:11,690
yeah so pay programa is not silver

01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:14,239
bullet neither is TDD it doesn't mean

01:32:11,690 --> 01:32:16,699
when someone pair you get super results

01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:18,199
but if two persons pay you probably get

01:32:16,699 --> 01:32:20,360
better result than one person working

01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:22,730
alone that's what we are saying now both

01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:24,560
of us are total newbies to JavaScript we

01:32:22,730 --> 01:32:27,050
don't know much about it probably the

01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:29,719
quality of output would not be as well

01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:32,300
as as good as it can be but that's okay

01:32:29,719 --> 01:32:34,340
because at least is better than one of

01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:36,440
us working alone like for example he may

01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:38,570
be struggling with putting the function

01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:40,340
into the fine he may be doing so many

01:32:38,570 --> 01:32:41,929
things that that takes up time just to

01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:44,060
find out whereas I can provide the

01:32:41,929 --> 01:32:48,080
information say this is a part way with

01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:50,150
me so okay now we are coming back to the

01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:55,100
paper by exercise I hope you have your

01:32:50,150 --> 01:32:57,260
parody and the first thing I need you to

01:32:55,100 --> 01:32:59,000
do you can use the same code that you

01:32:57,260 --> 01:33:01,219
used earlier for DVD or you can pull

01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,780
from the same codebase again except for

01:33:01,219 --> 01:33:05,179
this time round you do not need to check

01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:09,290
in your code right you do not you push

01:33:05,179 --> 01:33:11,690
your code with your pen first decide

01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:14,780
which approach you wanna do ping-pong

01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:16,820
time box of fluent approach beside that

01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:19,639
then secondly after that you'll be

01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:21,469
working on an exercise make sure you use

01:33:19,639 --> 01:33:23,840
the TDD approach for that and what

01:33:21,469 --> 01:33:28,790
exercises this is called 99 bottles of

01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:30,800
beer who knows this song all right you

01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:32,610
guys can sing because I don't know a

01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:35,310
thing

01:33:32,610 --> 01:33:37,440
the way we are going to do is exercises

01:33:35,310 --> 01:33:41,040
unite you need to write a program and

01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:45,230
this program when run is going to output

01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:50,010
this lyrics these are actually SL lyrics

01:33:45,230 --> 01:33:52,530
the song starts with the top is says 99

01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:56,780
bottles of beer on the wall 99 bottles

01:33:52,530 --> 01:34:00,660
of beer take one down pass it around 98

01:33:56,780 --> 01:34:04,470
bottles of beer on the wall and as and

01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:07,110
the lyrics continue by reducing by one

01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:09,990
okay one bottle of beer reduce second

01:34:07,110 --> 01:34:13,260
wise 98 when you see all the three

01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:18,270
points here that dot it simply means it

01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:22,410
decrements from 98 97 96 so and so forth

01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:25,140
until two bottles of beer alright and do

01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:26,580
two bottles of beer and when it comes to

01:34:25,140 --> 01:34:29,880
two bottles of beer you have to notice

01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:32,760
something start to change the word

01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:37,050
bottle is singular now as compared to

01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:40,530
everything the before it plural and when

01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:43,650
it comes to one bottle of beer now this

01:34:40,530 --> 01:34:47,490
word becomes singular the the one on top

01:34:43,650 --> 01:34:50,040
is puro and this change and this pot

01:34:47,490 --> 01:34:53,640
change as well of course you have the

01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:56,490
last one which is no more which changes

01:34:53,640 --> 01:35:02,130
to no more this whole sentence change

01:34:56,490 --> 01:35:03,600
and this becomes plural game clear your

01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:06,030
mission should you choose to accept it

01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:08,580
is to write a code that dumps all these

01:35:06,030 --> 01:35:11,670
texts out you can choose a hard code all

01:35:08,580 --> 01:35:13,110
the way from 99 to no more but I don't

01:35:11,670 --> 01:35:16,320
think your pay will allow you to do that

01:35:13,110 --> 01:35:19,290
alright so let's do the pair pairing

01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:23,880
right now try to do pairing and also try

01:35:19,290 --> 01:35:26,460
to do TDD stuff of this I'll give you 15

01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:28,620
minutes to do that I'll do a time check

01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:30,199
review later okay there's no need to

01:35:28,620 --> 01:35:36,679
push your foot into

01:35:30,199 --> 01:35:42,769
get anymore 15 minutes let's let's stop

01:35:36,679 --> 01:35:44,539
here okay let's stop here question how

01:35:42,769 --> 01:35:48,320
many of you guys are relieved that the

01:35:44,539 --> 01:35:52,789
pairing session is over okay laughing

01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:56,809
means your reliever what one comment

01:35:52,789 --> 01:35:59,300
before we do that debrief I notice the

01:35:56,809 --> 01:36:01,519
way you guys do pairing some of you guys

01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:07,099
who have neck pain tomorrow or spine

01:36:01,519 --> 01:36:09,320
pain tomorrow because you're in an

01:36:07,099 --> 01:36:10,969
awkward position in fact I think

01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:13,039
sometimes a driver doesn't know it the

01:36:10,969 --> 01:36:15,229
drivers are so comfortable but I never

01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:18,679
get this just trying to find a way to

01:36:15,229 --> 01:36:20,749
see and for some of you guys the drivers

01:36:18,679 --> 01:36:24,229
who are so kind where you share your

01:36:20,749 --> 01:36:27,260
laptop the Navigator can see right but a

01:36:24,229 --> 01:36:29,269
driver is on what position so this is

01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:30,499
one of the things that we need to take

01:36:29,269 --> 01:36:34,249
note about when we do pair programming

01:36:30,499 --> 01:36:36,229
is the setup of your of your of your

01:36:34,249 --> 01:36:38,809
laptop or your tables and all those

01:36:36,229 --> 01:36:40,669
things sometimes you don't like it

01:36:38,809 --> 01:36:42,469
because it just makes it awkward now

01:36:40,669 --> 01:36:44,359
there are some plugins for editors where

01:36:42,469 --> 01:36:46,280
you can have two laptops connected

01:36:44,359 --> 01:36:48,109
together you can see the code so you can

01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:49,999
sit comfortably in front of your laptop

01:36:48,109 --> 01:36:52,099
while the other person may make changes

01:36:49,999 --> 01:36:54,070
he has see reflected I think visual

01:36:52,099 --> 01:36:56,149
studio we just video code has it

01:36:54,070 --> 01:36:58,729
IntelliJ should have it as well

01:36:56,149 --> 01:37:01,849
the other option is to have your laptop

01:36:58,729 --> 01:37:03,829
plug into a common monitor then you have

01:37:01,849 --> 01:37:06,469
plugged in an external keyboard to the

01:37:03,829 --> 01:37:08,449
laptop so both persons you have two sets

01:37:06,469 --> 01:37:10,609
of keyboard two sets of mouse but a

01:37:08,449 --> 01:37:12,260
common monitor so these are things you

01:37:10,609 --> 01:37:14,359
need to think about when you do pairing

01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:17,300
it's good to see you guys at least try

01:37:14,359 --> 01:37:20,179
it out but I don't think is sustainable

01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:22,459
as per what it is after maybe one two

01:37:20,179 --> 01:37:24,530
hours you you'll be so tired now the

01:37:22,459 --> 01:37:29,959
other question I have is actually I'm

01:37:24,530 --> 01:37:32,329
getting a debrief now mentally wise do

01:37:29,959 --> 01:37:35,510
you find it taxing do you find me more

01:37:32,329 --> 01:37:37,189
tiring as compared to doing alone how

01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:39,409
many you guys feel is more tiring when

01:37:37,189 --> 01:37:45,780
you do pairing

01:37:39,409 --> 01:37:47,940
okay who finds it less hiring okay Isis

01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:50,579
just to be clear is a binary option

01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:53,369
hiring or less tiring for those of you

01:37:50,579 --> 01:37:55,020
and I don't know why is that but it's

01:37:53,369 --> 01:37:57,150
true pair programming can be tiring

01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:58,880
that's why when you do pairing it's

01:37:57,150 --> 01:38:01,469
always good to take a break

01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:05,429
it's better but I remember the first I

01:38:01,469 --> 01:38:07,440
do pairing it was about a whole six

01:38:05,429 --> 01:38:08,190
hours straight when I first joined a

01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:10,230
company I do it

01:38:08,190 --> 01:38:14,159
I was totally tired at the end of the

01:38:10,230 --> 01:38:15,599
day all right now it's your turn to tell

01:38:14,159 --> 01:38:18,539
me what are the some of the challenges

01:38:15,599 --> 01:38:20,070
that you face we'll try doing pairing

01:38:18,539 --> 01:38:22,099
just now a platform on things I

01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:24,869
dimension okay

01:38:22,099 --> 01:38:27,570
kevin has a mic so maybe you can just

01:38:24,869 --> 01:38:29,960
share what are your challenges just just

01:38:27,570 --> 01:38:29,960
raise it

01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:56,710
okay true what I did was actually

01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:58,750
creating a bit of hype up for you

01:38:56,710 --> 01:39:00,670
because you're not at a logical point

01:38:58,750 --> 01:39:02,440
with your speed pair so you have to

01:39:00,670 --> 01:39:04,030
rethink the context and you're actually

01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:05,410
working on a same thing accepted in a

01:39:04,030 --> 01:39:07,390
different way that's why I was

01:39:05,410 --> 01:39:09,250
suggesting look for a logical point to

01:39:07,390 --> 01:39:11,290
speed pair and not do what I do just

01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:13,929
know there is a way I do it because one

01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:15,400
to create a bit of chaos second is for

01:39:13,929 --> 01:39:17,100
you guys to feel how does it feel like

01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:21,630
when you were someone else

01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:21,630
okay what other feedback do you have

01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:33,130
let's say

01:39:46,890 --> 01:39:49,890
safe

01:39:57,989 --> 01:40:01,139
you know

01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:17,380
thank you very much so and that is a

01:40:15,370 --> 01:40:20,320
very common thing in fact once I paired

01:40:17,380 --> 01:40:27,130
with a guy whose keyboard has no no no

01:40:20,320 --> 01:40:29,230
markings it's all black so what you said

01:40:27,130 --> 01:40:30,940
is true because I think it's developers

01:40:29,230 --> 01:40:32,920
when we coat alone we have our own

01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:37,630
customized way of doing it we like a

01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:39,610
certain editors in fact one one thing

01:40:37,630 --> 01:40:42,400
other thing is we like to cut our own

01:40:39,610 --> 01:40:45,520
way brackets where you started a new

01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:48,490
line or not the spacing all these things

01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:51,070
that come in the picture now pair

01:40:48,490 --> 01:40:54,880
programming in extreme programming

01:40:51,070 --> 01:40:56,920
context it's a team effort is a team

01:40:54,880 --> 01:41:00,400
thing which also means that instead of

01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:01,900
just between two developers agreeing in

01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:04,210
fact your whole team needs to agree what

01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:06,190
is your coding standard what is your

01:41:04,210 --> 01:41:10,720
editor they're gonna use how we supposed

01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:13,240
to be set up this I list the minimal

01:41:10,720 --> 01:41:14,830
things that you you need to have in

01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:17,310
order to be comfortable the other way is

01:41:14,830 --> 01:41:20,110
I've seen if I'm a curator some plugins

01:41:17,310 --> 01:41:22,270
where both your machines can connect

01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:25,180
together but you can keep your own

01:41:22,270 --> 01:41:27,150
customized way of your editor

01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:30,100
so whatever the other guy change right

01:41:27,150 --> 01:41:32,110
using the laptop you will be able see

01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:33,850
yet you're not constrained by that I

01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:38,070
haven't tried myself by seeing it I

01:41:33,850 --> 01:41:38,070
think it's not a bad idea to try that

01:41:39,910 --> 01:41:44,450
yeah okay sure what else what else do

01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:47,620
you guys have to feedback for that on

01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:47,620
your Perry experience

01:41:48,989 --> 01:41:53,849
how do you feel when you had to switch

01:41:51,459 --> 01:41:53,849
pair

01:41:56,230 --> 01:42:02,810
of course if your pair is a good pair

01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:04,130
you be happier or uses para but how do

01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:07,360
you feel when you have someone totally

01:42:04,130 --> 01:42:07,360
new coming

01:42:11,070 --> 01:42:22,780
no reaction okay okay I'm gonna skip

01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:25,380
that their male-female pairing how do

01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:25,380
you guys feel

01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:33,820
it's okay these are things these are

01:42:30,790 --> 01:42:36,010
real real scenarios you will face so

01:42:33,820 --> 01:42:39,870
let's talk about it how does it feel

01:42:36,010 --> 01:42:39,870
do you do fear is the issue a non-issue

01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:47,429
looking at you guys I can see the

01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:48,850
females and Museum what do you guys see

01:42:47,429 --> 01:42:53,070
no issue

01:42:48,850 --> 01:42:53,070
okay that that they were

01:42:55,359 --> 01:43:00,489
okay that nough table okay in front of

01:42:58,959 --> 01:43:02,679
everybody see no issue Allah inside

01:43:00,489 --> 01:43:04,989
Allah Allah I'm kidding

01:43:02,679 --> 01:43:07,149
there's a rare common common question

01:43:04,989 --> 01:43:09,699
well how did how should we pave is a

01:43:07,149 --> 01:43:11,229
different gender but it's not just

01:43:09,699 --> 01:43:12,699
within this room as know you should

01:43:11,229 --> 01:43:15,969
there's a book called pair programming

01:43:12,699 --> 01:43:17,619
illuminated Laurie Williams generally to

01:43:15,969 --> 01:43:19,239
other studies of studying people doing

01:43:17,619 --> 01:43:21,489
programming right is really not an issue

01:43:19,239 --> 01:43:25,089
the only thing you wanna be careful of

01:43:21,489 --> 01:43:27,249
is the space between two persons some

01:43:25,089 --> 01:43:28,989
are more comfortable together some may

01:43:27,249 --> 01:43:30,879
not be that comfortable just be aware of

01:43:28,989 --> 01:43:31,479
that I think happens between guys as

01:43:30,879 --> 01:43:33,849
well right

01:43:31,479 --> 01:43:37,030
sometimes brush another guys hanging a

01:43:33,849 --> 01:43:38,739
few it happens okay just be aware of

01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:41,320
this guy takes what if two hands touch

01:43:38,739 --> 01:43:43,599
it at the same time sometimes go

01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:46,050
electracy some that don't have long but

01:43:43,599 --> 01:43:49,389
these are things we have to be aware of

01:43:46,050 --> 01:43:51,789
maybe one more thing anything else any

01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:54,329
other feedback for those who try

01:43:51,789 --> 01:43:58,119
different methods of pairing of swapping

01:43:54,329 --> 01:44:00,639
time based fluid and at the you guys are

01:43:58,119 --> 01:44:03,809
doing time based and ping-pong how do

01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:03,809
you feel about different methods

01:44:08,710 --> 01:44:12,090
time-base one more really fun

01:44:17,749 --> 01:44:25,309
yeah okay

01:44:21,999 --> 01:44:26,119
question do you think you can what do

01:44:25,309 --> 01:44:28,340
you think that matter will be

01:44:26,119 --> 01:44:30,139
sustainable over time let's say you do

01:44:28,340 --> 01:44:34,909
this for eight hours the whole day by

01:44:30,139 --> 01:44:36,409
stopping No okay so you may want to be

01:44:34,909 --> 01:44:38,059
aware of the things they try it may not

01:44:36,409 --> 01:44:41,449
be sustainable just switch to some other

01:44:38,059 --> 01:44:42,099
way how long do you choose between your

01:44:41,449 --> 01:44:49,789
song

01:44:42,099 --> 01:44:51,739
two minutes Wow okay you know this thing

01:44:49,789 --> 01:44:54,829
about pair programming very early on

01:44:51,739 --> 01:45:01,400
when XV started usually people would

01:44:54,829 --> 01:45:04,519
swap around maybe ten minutes this more

01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:07,729
extremely extremely yeah okay fair

01:45:04,519 --> 01:45:09,909
enough if it was for you I I think it's

01:45:07,729 --> 01:45:09,909
fine

01:45:10,940 --> 01:45:16,530
so this really brief so at this point I

01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:21,090
think we have 15 minutes left it's time

01:45:16,530 --> 01:45:23,580
to close thank you for participating a

01:45:21,090 --> 01:45:26,640
time question I hope you guys enjoy in

01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:28,440
fact I know this the level of the bus

01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:31,170
level between the first time when you do

01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:32,880
TDD as compared to the second time the

01:45:31,170 --> 01:45:33,800
second time seems to be more life more

01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:35,880
interesting

01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:37,740
for those who didn't like pair

01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:39,000
programming I hope today at least would

01:45:37,740 --> 01:45:41,250
give you some idea on how to make it

01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:46,530
better to make it more in job experience

01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:49,500
for you just to recap so you spent

01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:51,840
almost three and a half hours in this

01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:53,550
session but if we don't know what's the

01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:55,260
benefit why we're doing it I think we

01:45:53,550 --> 01:45:57,390
kind of missed the point so I'd like to

01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:59,490
come back here to talk about what's the

01:45:57,390 --> 01:46:03,200
benefit of doing test-driven development

01:45:59,490 --> 01:46:06,210
and pair programming at the same time

01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:08,310
these are just four points the first one

01:46:06,210 --> 01:46:12,810
is increased software designing quality

01:46:08,310 --> 01:46:14,280
and the reason if you do TDD it helps

01:46:12,810 --> 01:46:17,040
you to think through your software that

01:46:14,280 --> 01:46:19,320
the code you're writing of course it's

01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:21,180
very crystal quality because your test

01:46:19,320 --> 01:46:24,270
covers your code to make sure it works

01:46:21,180 --> 01:46:27,720
and the consequences of that is you have

01:46:24,270 --> 01:46:30,300
lower defects second point you have good

01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:33,960
knowledge spread when it comes to pair

01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:35,850
programming since most people swap you

01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:37,710
have a good knowledge about assistances

01:46:35,850 --> 01:46:39,420
being built now what about test-driven

01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:42,770
development how does that help us with

01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:42,770
good knowledge spread

01:46:46,350 --> 01:46:54,460
you're waiting for answer now the way

01:46:51,370 --> 01:46:57,040
good knowledge meant is the test Kevin

01:46:54,460 --> 01:46:58,330
Raye said earlier you look at a test you

01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,770
know what is it doing

01:46:58,330 --> 01:47:01,360
you know how the core is supposed to

01:46:59,770 --> 01:47:03,520
behave that helps us spread the

01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:05,680
knowledge as well if your code base but

01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:07,780
no test is hard to gather knowledge

01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:08,980
because all the logic is you have to

01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:09,870
spend a lot of time trying to figure

01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:12,190
that out

01:47:09,870 --> 01:47:14,470
now because as a good knowledge spread

01:47:12,190 --> 01:47:17,470
you reduce single person dependency

01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:19,600
problems the kind of problem where you

01:47:17,470 --> 01:47:21,220
work with a team you work alone and you

01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:23,140
undergo for two weeks holiday in an

01:47:21,220 --> 01:47:24,550
island and your team expects you to be

01:47:23,140 --> 01:47:27,640
on call because they may call you and

01:47:24,550 --> 01:47:30,430
ask you what the code is doing having

01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:31,810
doing TDD of a programming it's okay for

01:47:30,430 --> 01:47:34,300
someone not to be around because someone

01:47:31,810 --> 01:47:36,870
else would know what has been done okay

01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:39,340
so that is reducing a person dependency

01:47:36,870 --> 01:47:43,660
the third one is it increases

01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:45,520
productivity overall TDD generally will

01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:48,190
increase productivity pairing it takes

01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:51,100
some time until both paths you get into

01:47:48,190 --> 01:47:52,960
a flow into a state you may find

01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:55,270
sometimes find paths argue hoardings

01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:57,070
takes forever and never get resolved

01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:58,570
they think this person thinks this

01:47:57,070 --> 01:48:00,940
design is good the other person thinks

01:47:58,570 --> 01:48:02,430
his design is good so how do you resolve

01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:04,900
goes no problem

01:48:02,430 --> 01:48:07,180
one way is usually bring it to the team

01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:08,650
and discuss with your team what you're

01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:12,280
thinking of and it's actually a useful

01:48:08,650 --> 01:48:13,780
way to try to resolve issues now because

01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:16,870
it increases productivity that team

01:48:13,780 --> 01:48:19,540
would move faster and the last point is

01:48:16,870 --> 01:48:23,020
it builds courage in teams what do I

01:48:19,540 --> 01:48:25,450
mean by that if you change a piece of

01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:28,020
code that doesn't have tests you'll be

01:48:25,450 --> 01:48:29,980
scared if you're not scared I salute you

01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:31,540
personally I'll be scared because I do

01:48:29,980 --> 01:48:33,370
not know if I bring anything or not

01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:35,590
but if I know this piece of code has a

01:48:33,370 --> 01:48:39,340
test coverage by adding functionality

01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:44,020
and the test doesn't fail it gives me

01:48:39,340 --> 01:48:46,060
courage so that's how TDD helps the

01:48:44,020 --> 01:48:48,940
other thing about building courage when

01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:51,130
it comes to pair programming is a case

01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:54,310
where if you need to face a problem

01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:55,780
alone as compared to having someone to

01:48:54,310 --> 01:48:57,500
face it together with you

01:48:55,780 --> 01:48:59,570
that should help you

01:48:57,500 --> 01:49:03,920
in having more courage to face it I

01:48:59,570 --> 01:49:06,620
remember there are many years back I was

01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:08,750
pairing someone checking the code six

01:49:06,620 --> 01:49:11,210
o'clock went home so happy mean I got a

01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:12,710
car got production issue so this shows a

01:49:11,210 --> 01:49:15,380
TDD imperio vendors are solve all your

01:49:12,710 --> 01:49:17,630
problems but affect that at the midnight

01:49:15,380 --> 01:49:20,210
12 12 a.m. I have to go back to office I

01:49:17,630 --> 01:49:21,650
know my pair would go with me and we

01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:23,990
stand you for him that actually

01:49:21,650 --> 01:49:26,090
increases my courage in facing a

01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:28,490
midnight issue to be worse off that and

01:49:26,090 --> 01:49:31,610
because it builds courage in teams it

01:49:28,490 --> 01:49:33,050
helps to improve the team morale you you

01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:35,930
finally feel that you're looking as a

01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:40,130
team again go forward together all right

01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:42,830
these are a few points that I personally

01:49:40,130 --> 01:49:46,370
have felt after doing TDD and doing pair

01:49:42,830 --> 01:49:49,070
programming any thing that you want to

01:49:46,370 --> 01:49:51,020
clarify based on this points anything

01:49:49,070 --> 01:49:54,430
you're welcome back to be on on your few

01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:54,430
that maybe wouldn't work

01:49:55,049 --> 01:50:06,959
No yep tricky because the courage can be

01:50:03,829 --> 01:50:10,289
policy because you have to trust that

01:50:06,959 --> 01:50:16,339
this test it was be written was school

01:50:10,289 --> 01:50:18,899
and we need has the functionality so I

01:50:16,339 --> 01:50:22,019
think you should check the tests before

01:50:18,899 --> 01:50:24,719
you have the courage to say okay I can

01:50:22,019 --> 01:50:25,140
add functionalities metals and so on and

01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:27,550
so

01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:32,150
[Music]

01:50:27,550 --> 01:50:36,770
yes I think Kevin Nealon mentioned one

01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:39,320
thing is you can write a test that has

01:50:36,770 --> 01:50:41,450
100% code coverage that doesn't test

01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:43,120
anything I don't know if you guys have

01:50:41,450 --> 01:50:47,270
seen it before if you don't believe just

01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:49,910
write a unit test write a code but don't

01:50:47,270 --> 01:50:53,420
assert anything your unit test you still

01:50:49,910 --> 01:50:56,450
get her percent coverage that's not EDD

01:50:53,420 --> 01:50:58,160
first of all and yes so in terms of

01:50:56,450 --> 01:50:59,690
whether you think the color work or not

01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:01,700
here it depends on how well you know the

01:50:59,690 --> 01:51:03,980
people around you maybe a Perry the

01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:05,720
person before or what time that should

01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:10,820
improve in terms of how you feel about

01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:12,290
the quality that's being done okay is

01:51:10,820 --> 01:51:14,800
there anything you wanna add on this

01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:14,800

01:51:26,550 --> 01:51:38,910
reflected them maybe this one here is

01:51:31,740 --> 01:51:41,180
that she might sit so you have to get

01:51:38,910 --> 01:51:41,180
