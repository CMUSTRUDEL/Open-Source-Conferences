hello everybody let's get started right

00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:08,970
now so we are from here maps we are a

00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:11,370
mapping and location services company my

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,110
name is Dylan Babs I'm from Seattle and

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,089
I work in our developer relations group

00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:19,140
and I'm here with two of my colleagues

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:20,910
from Berlin over here we have Ignacio he

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,430
is the engineering manager for HAARP GL

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:28,560
and then over here we have Nino who is

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:31,230
also an engineer for HAARP GL so a

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,730
little bit about our company I like to

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,340
say we're a full-stack mapping company

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:37,739
so we do everything from collecting data

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,629
we have people all over the world in

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,770
local offices driving our own cars kind

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,290
of like what you see for Street View

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,110
cars collecting data that is then

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,809
compiled into our global map which she

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,100
didn't consume in many different ways

00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:52,020
one of them being HAARP GL which we'll

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,520
talk about later today but you could

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,280
also see our Maps in places like

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,800
navigation systems so in North America

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,480
and Europe four out of five cars will

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,090
have our Maps in their navigation

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,140
systems and we're collecting a ton of

00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,610
data nearly 28 terabytes daily and in

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,409
our cars that are collecting lidar we're

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,250
doing 700,000 points of data per second

00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:17,189
and we're not just doing standard

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,930
mapping we also have some HD maps so

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,259
that could be maps for autonomous

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:24,060
vehicles and we've so far covered

00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:26,189
600,000 kilometers for autonomous

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,080
driving maps so really all different

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,420
sorts of mapping but today we'll be

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,960
talking about our new JavaScript product

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,880
which is called HAARP GL it's a 3d map

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,409
web renderer so this is going to be a

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,079
library they could put on your web sites

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:45,570
display some really rich and custom 3d

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,770
maps so harp CL has a couple key

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,840
concepts

00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,180
three that we wanted to build it on the

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,399
first is modern web tech so we built it

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,590
on WebGL for really fast and performant

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,390
rendering so it's works with all modern

00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,530
browsers

00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:02,369
sometimes the exception of Internet

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,710
Explorer the second principle we wanted

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,990
to build on was open source we really

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,190
value community contributions and it's

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,390
really nice to have the community in

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,520
mind when actually building this product

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,430
so during the workshop today if you have

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,010
any

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,140
ideas or bug reports and such we highly

00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:19,150
encourage you to create either a pull

00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,439
request or an issue on github that way

00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,530
we could really take your feedback into

00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:25,420
consideration for the next release then

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,849
finally third principle we wanted to

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:31,299
build harp chiel on was the flexibility

00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:33,700
and interoperability so by this we mean

00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:36,489
two things one is that you could choose

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:37,569
any data source that you want to put

00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:39,849
into harp GL

00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:41,680
like I said before we create our own

00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:44,019
data sources that you could use but

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,980
you're not limited to just using us in

00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:47,379
fact you could use some of our

00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:50,079
competitor data sources like map box

00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:51,459
ESRI TomTom you're free to really mix

00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:53,620
and match harp GL with whatever you want

00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:56,139
because it's open source you're able to

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,200
do that and the second is not just data

00:02:56,139 --> 00:03:00,939
source but also data type will be

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,799
providing vector tiles which is a way to

00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:04,420
consume the map data but really you

00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:06,819
could put on any type of data source or

00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,159
type that you want in there since it's

00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:16,120
built upon 3j s you could put any type

00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:18,579
of 3d object in there as well and so we

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,959
made harp GL for a couple of reasons the

00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:22,150
first is we have a product out there

00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,370
called open location platform this is

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,829
something if you're like EMW Daimler and

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,510
you're creating data pipelines of your

00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:30,609
cars around the world ingestion sensor

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,709
data since your data is basically the

00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:34,120
data that a car is collecting as it

00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:34,659
drives maybe like the width from the

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,449
road

00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,889
how far can see and such this is a

00:03:37,449 --> 00:03:41,109
pipeline you could create to actually

00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:42,729
collect that data and view it online and

00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:45,519
then so you actually need a lot of 3d

00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:47,250
use cases for this type of stuff the

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,909
second use case was High Definition Maps

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,459
when I mentioned earlier in the

00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:52,720
presentation this is really important

00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:54,729
because you need visualization of

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,959
different Z levels like say for example

00:03:54,729 --> 00:04:00,190
this bridge right here excuse me you

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,049
need to actually be able to distinguish

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,609
what is below and what above so 3d

00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,750
visualization can provide some very

00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:08,859
powerful debugging tools for this and

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,299
then finally we have a new product

00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:12,340
coming out called here navigation on

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:15,400
demand which is really a modern take on

00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,530
these navigation systems and cars using

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,539
modern technology before a lot of it was

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:21,070
native os's that you put inside the

00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:22,750
vehicle but now we're trying to

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,940
experiment with maybe web views and such

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,139
so since harp CL is a web product you're

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,729
able to do that

00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:29,949
it's a really flexible technical

00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:34,509
architecture when it comes to in vehicle

00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:36,310
infotainment and navigation systems so

00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:38,560
today we'll be doing a workshop you'll

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,259
be learning how to implement a bunch of

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,319
different 3d web mapping situations and

00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:46,509
different features so let's go ahead and

00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,289
enter this link into your browser and

00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:53,530
that will take you to a github workshop

00:04:49,289 --> 00:05:08,349
so that's bitly slash Jas comp

00:04:53,530 --> 00:05:11,139
- harp so this repo we have is called

00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:13,210
Deb rail workshops and we have a

00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:15,490
director in here called harp GL which

00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,400
links you directly to it we also have a

00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,870
bunch of other of our developer API

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,550
workshops in here as well

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,930
so if you enjoyed this product and you

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,939
want to learn more about some of our

00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:32,440
other company's offerings feel free to

00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:35,229
browse around in here so some prereqs

00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:37,150
for this workshop you just need a laptop

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:40,870
with a modern web browser which I'm sure

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:44,110
you all have in that node and NPM or

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,400
yarn installed so in this workshop we

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,539
also have a few different resources

00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,770
listed here we have the github repo

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:55,210
which you could find all the open source

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:59,500
code for our we have a link to the

00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,669
documentation which has all the

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,860
information on the different classes

00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:09,580
objects and methods and then we have the

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,409
live examples which is right over here

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,990
these are pretty helpful because you

00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:15,639
click around use some different features

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,770
you can implement like the globe right

00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,659
here but then you could also click view

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,240
source over here on the bottom right and

00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:26,500
I'll take you directly to the code

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:30,000
needed to run that example so did anyone

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,000
have trouble reaching the workshop link

00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:34,790
oops produces you should show that

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,889
no they Qasim

00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:52,039
great so feel free to read ahead in the

00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,389
workshop for the next like 10 minutes or

00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:56,270
so I'm gonna be explaining some key

00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:57,800
concepts but if I'm going too slow and

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:03,469
you want to be faster you're welcome to

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:05,900
just read through the workshop so in

00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:07,789
harp the high level object is called a

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,009
map view this is gonna be the object

00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:13,129
that are gonna be modifying and adding

00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:15,169
things to inside your map so say for

00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:17,659
example you want to initialize a new map

00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:19,370
you could just do harp equals new harp

00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:21,650
dot map view you could pass it the

00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,000
canvas that's going to be the HTML

00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,770
element on your page that you want to

00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,449
put the map in then you could also

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,620
assign a theme we have a couple

00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:29,780
different themes available which you

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,699
could use for example like normal day

00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:33,379
light and dark and you could also create

00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:35,479
your custom themes which we'll be doing

00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:37,279
later on in the workshop and then you

00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:40,569
could also choose a projection which

00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:43,120
we'll talk about a little bit more later

00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:45,949
so there's a very popular type of

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,599
geographic data formats for the web it's

00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:51,110
called geo JSON have any of you guys

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,000
heard of geo JSON before it's pretty

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,000
easy to work with mostly because it's

00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,400
just JSON so nice for web development

00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,860
and heart GL uses many different types

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,029
of geo JSON but there's two examples I'd

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,190
like to point out here just to get you

00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:06,500
guys familiar with a type a point in a

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,629
line so if we take a look at the

00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,580
structure of geo JSON you have the type

00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:13,370
which is mostly always going to be a

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,139
feature and then you have geometry this

00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,750
is where you classify which type of

00:08:15,139 --> 00:08:19,250
geometry will be it could be a point it

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,409
could be a line it could be a polygon or

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:23,900
Multi polygon and then you could put the

00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:25,610
coordinates and then there's also an

00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,839
object in here called properties and

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,449
this is where you could really assign

00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,159
any type of other properties you want to

00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:33,529
it for example we could say the name of

00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:35,839
it really anything you want to put in

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:37,579
there and then a line is pretty much the

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,649
same thing the only difference is the

00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:42,169
type now says line string in here and

00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:44,000
then coordinates is now no longer just

00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:47,959
one array it's an array with arrays of

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,730
coordinates inside of it so you'll be

00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:51,610
using geo JSON later on in this workshop

00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:53,959
to actually put data on to the map and

00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:56,180
geo JSON is nice because it's pretty

00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:58,550
widely supported so a lot of websites

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,880
for open data will have geo JSON you get

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,880
download

00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:06,329
and then another key concept we have is

00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:08,910
our styling syntax and also styling

00:09:06,329 --> 00:09:10,740
sheets because harp GL is a vector

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,240
render that means we're calling the data

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,550
from a server and then we're rendering

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,980
on the client we need to actually bind

00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,600
style rules to it so say for example

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,670
you're looking at a map a lot of time

00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,829
roads are yellow the waters blue that's

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,930
because there's style rules defined for

00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:27,570
each type of property so say for example

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:30,149
here we're saying when the geometry type

00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,860
is a point we want to use the technique

00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:34,050
of circles so we want to draw circles

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,889
and then we want to make it this color I

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:40,500
have no idea what the 70d color is but

00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:43,079
you could really assign any CSS value in

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,850
here you like and then size could also

00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:46,709
be meters points or whatever you could

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,079
also clarify the metric in the unit for

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:50,730
this and then say for example for a

00:09:49,079 --> 00:09:52,290
polygon pretty much the same thing we're

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,940
just saying when geometry type equals

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,120
polygons we want to apply these styling

00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,410
rules I don't have an example of it in

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,810
here as well but you'd also style the

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,149
same properties you saw back here in the

00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,560
point so say we want to say when we see

00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:07,019
the dinner gap Islands we want to make

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,300
it yellow we would do when geometry I'm

00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,860
sorry when property equals name and

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:16,860
Dinnigan islands we would apply the

00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:18,029
certain style there so with maps many

00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,250
you are probably familiar with the

00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:22,529
Mercator projection also known as the

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:23,940
flat earth that's here on the left it's

00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:27,120
a pretty standard map you see on web

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,350
maps it's pretty common and I think

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,649
people are used to it so we'd like to

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,000
see it but technically Mercator

00:10:31,649 --> 00:10:35,130
projections aren't too accurate because

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,110
the top and the bottom are slightly

00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:39,600
stretched out because you're projecting

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,420
a sphere into a rectangle so to show you

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,800
a cool example of this there is a fun

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,329
little web site called the true size

00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,279
that I like to show everyone and play

00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:48,720
around with we can see we're taking the

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,720
United States in the normal position

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,550
right here and if we drag it up to

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,769
Greenland we actually see that it gets

00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:59,040
distorted I'm Ehren sorry I moved around

00:10:55,769 --> 00:11:00,660
and grown much more so for example

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,980
Greenland isn't actually that size it's

00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:05,160
definitely much smaller if you drag it

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,500
around here so this is why we've also

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,540
included a globe projection because it's

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,590
technically a more accurate view of the

00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:14,270
world the world is a spear so

00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:18,500
it's nice to be able to represent it as

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:20,150
a sphere in our Maps so you'll have the

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,430
option of doing two different types of

00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,410
objections the Mercator and globe with

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:29,750
harp GL and you try them both out in the

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:31,640
workshop and then for data sources I

00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,730
already mentioned vector tiles this is

00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,960
when the data is being delivered from

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,840
the server and you're running on the

00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:42,500
client it's really an optimized version

00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,210
of Geo JSON but then you also have

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,650
static to your JSON say if you just want

00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,660
to make a normal fetch request or a

00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,130
network request to a static geo JSON

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,020
file you have in your local directory or

00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:53,690
another site you could put that on to

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,790
your map as well but we also support

00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,790
raster tiles so this is a great example

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,820
of doing satellite imagery a raster tile

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,290
is basically just a smaller image and

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:06,680
then for those of you familiar with 3j s

00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:09,620
or other 3d objects you could also put

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,270
3d objects onto the map and then since

00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:13,790
it's open source you were able to extend

00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:19,400
harped GL however you want to add any

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:21,950
type of data source you would like then

00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,900
in terms of consuming the API we have

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,640
two different ways one is a pretty

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,130
modern version with modules that you

00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,800
install via NPM in the arm but we also

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,720
have a simple scripting API that you

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,600
could add and be a script tag on your

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,670
HTML this is sometimes easier and we'll

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,470
be using a simple bundle in the workshop

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,990
just because it'll get you started

00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,130
easier if you're doing the modules those

00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,900
were great because you could work on

00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,700
with typescript and you really import

00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,230
which ones you want at the time but

00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,310
sometimes a little frustrating just to

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,510
get started with it because you have to

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,180
fight with web pack to get the right

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:59,000
configuration and such so today we'll be

00:12:53,180 --> 00:13:00,710
doing the scripting API awesome so those

00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,210
are the key concepts for Harpe GL

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,730
hopefully that background information

00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:06,290
will help you out during the workshop so

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,740
the first thing we want to do is head on

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:14,000
over to our developer portal we have a

00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:17,510
link in the workshop we scroll down past

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,610
the key concepts it will be developer

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:24,200
here comm slash events / J's comp aja 19

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,810
so in order to use harp seal you'll need

00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,150
to sign up

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:30,940
on this site and this will give you

00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:33,400
access to data and the reason we have a

00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,990
special URL right here it just helps

00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,210
with our tracking purposes and make sure

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,460
you get to the right key so you can use

00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,740
it with HAARP CL so we'll give everyone

00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:45,960
three to five minutes to go and sign up

00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:48,580
online it's pretty simple click on it

00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,440
click get started for free no credit

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,580
card or anything is required you only

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,280
just put in your name your country or

00:13:51,580 --> 00:14:06,700
email and a password so go ahead and

00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:08,500
click this right here and yeah once you

00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,420
sign up feel free to take a look around

00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:15,120
our developer portal and see some of the

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:18,250
other map services we have we offer

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,500
250,000 transactions a month for free

00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,540
which is pretty generous when comparing

00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:26,860
it against our competitors in the free

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:28,390
tier so 250,000 transactions is enough

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,080
to keep a small start-up floating

00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:31,080
monthly

00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:59,020
and feel free to raise your hand if you

00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:02,280
have any questions we'll be happy to

00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:02,280
come around and help

00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:55,220
all right awesome how many of you have

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:57,489
signed up cool give it maybe just one

00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,489
more minute

00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,450
great so once you've signed up we have

00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:37,029
one more small step to do to get

00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:39,310
credentials if you go back to github

00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:42,279
repository right below the navigate to

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,480
developer gear comm link you'll see text

00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:44,440
that says once you've created a

00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,959
developer account

00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,480
navigate to the here XYZ token manager

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,040
so here XYZ is another one of our here

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,200
products that's actually serving us the

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,240
data so this is where we'll get our

00:16:53,200 --> 00:17:05,290
token so I'll go ahead and click on this

00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:08,290
link and I'll see this little modal here

00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,360
and I'll sign in with the developer

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:12,540
account I just created about a minute

00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,540
ago

00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,900
and then once I've logged into the token

00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:38,600
manager I could either generate a new

00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,010
token which I'm sure I will be the case

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,250
for you guys since you're a first-time

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:46,480
user or I can manage the tokens but I'll

00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:56,150
I'll generate a new token I'm gonna say

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:58,310
token for harp GL workshop I click

00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:09,050
generate now I need to actually select

00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:12,950
some rights and then we have a new token

00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:14,450
up here generated so I'd keep this

00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,640
window open because you'll be copying

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:19,280
and pasting this token later on into

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:22,520
your code or save it to a notepad or

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,430
something like that um is anyone having

00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:28,720
issues with the token manager or any

00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,720
confusion on how to get there

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,280
alright awesome let's go ahead and start

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,980
installing harp GL so I'm in section one

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,360
of the workshop and like I mentioned

00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,420
before there's two methods of installing

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:22,120
harp GL one is linking the script bundle

00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:24,750
into your HTML or you have the option of

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,710
installing the heartbeat riyals 3 NPM I

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,810
recommend for this workshop you do the

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:32,500
single script tag just for the sake of

00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:34,810
simplicity so I'm gonna open up my

00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:40,860
terminal and I'm going to create a new

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:44,470
directory I'm gonna call it harp - map

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:52,810
and then I'm going to except she make my

00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:57,520
terminal little bit bigger is that big

00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:59,950
enough for everybody and I'm going to CD

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:04,440
into that directory where I'm going to

00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:09,790
create two files and index dot HTML and

00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:11,020
then also an index dot JSON XJS files

00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:14,320
where we will put all of our code for

00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:17,640
our GL then you can open up that

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:22,620
directory with your favorite code editor

00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,620
so I'll drag that folder into vs code

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:30,040
and then for the HTML you can go ahead

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,910
and copy and paste what we have right

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:41,590
here into our index.html and what we're

00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:44,500
doing here is send up a style so putting

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,850
a zero border margin and padding on the

00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,000
web site so we don't have any weird

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:53,110
borders or scrolling issues and then

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,140
also creating a canvas with the ID of a

00:20:53,110 --> 00:21:01,140
map so I'm setting that to 100% of the

00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:05,890
screen with the Handy 100 V H and B W

00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:09,070
and then we also are adding to script

00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:11,230
tags from unpackaged one is going to be

00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:13,540
3 J s because we have a dependency on

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:17,560
that and then also the second will be

00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:20,710
harp GL and then we also have another

00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,300
script in here called extras j s

00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:24,910
that's because there's gonna be some

00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:27,040
extra 3d loading functions that we'll

00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:31,030
need to add in later on up to put in 3d

00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:34,770
objects so for this extra file its

00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:37,000
included inside the dev'reaux workshops

00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:39,550
resources file I'm sorry resources

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,420
folder so you click in there you'll see

00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:46,630
that extras J s is right here you can

00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:50,920
open the file click raw and then just do

00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:53,610
file save page as into the heart map

00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,610
directory

00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:12,020
and then of course we're also linking to

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:20,150
our local index J s file will we be

00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:22,070
writing the harp code so now I'll go

00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:27,470
ahead and start pasting some stuff into

00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:29,600
index J s the first is we're going to be

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,659
selecting the canvas so just using the

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:35,720
Dom get element by ID just like the map

00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:38,480
and we'll be passing that into our harp

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,039
map view constructor so this just

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,390
writing canvas is an easier way of

00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:45,909
saying canvas it's the same as canvas so

00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:49,120
that might be a little bit easier and

00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:52,940
then we're also linking a theme file

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,950
that is currently hosted on unpackage so

00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,919
we have just a night a nice dark theme

00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,990
and then we have two other parameters

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,980
max visible data source tiles and tile

00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,020
cache size

00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,179
those aren't required at first but they

00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,700
help with some caching to make sure all

00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:12,919
the tiles aren't reloading when they're

00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:15,530
in the map view and the next thing we

00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:20,240
want to do is set the camera location

00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:22,190
and zoom so this takes two items in this

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,429
function the first we're going to be

00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:31,100
passing it geo-coordinates object so

00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:33,260
this is latitude 1.27 and longitude 103

00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:38,950
and this is actually the coordinates for

00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:44,030
Singapore so it's a format latitude

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:47,270
comma longitude and then also we're

00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:49,789
setting a zoom level of 16 there's a

00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:52,700
geospatial standard for zoom levels

00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:54,590
between 1 and 20 where 20 is when you're

00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,720
really zoomed in so 20 you'll be able to

00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:59,809
see the street right in front of you

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,850
while 16 is about a nice view to have

00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:04,340
like the city buildings and such visible

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:07,419
if you do zooms 1 or 2 you'll have the

00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,419
whole earth visible

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,370
next I'm going to paste some map

00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:15,900
controls he's basically helped with the

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:18,390
pointer event so you could drag around

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:22,440
the map and then also add some zoom

00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:24,660
buttons on the right hand side and then

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,930
I'm also setting a max pitch angle and

00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:30,120
then also rotation so since harp GL is a

00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:32,310
3d engine you could set the angle of

00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:34,350
what you're viewing this is between 0

00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:37,320
and 90 or a0 is looking straight down

00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:39,000
and the 90 would be my point of view so

00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,620
if you want to set the camera from say

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,630
someone walking or driving on the street

00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,560
do exactly what they say I started to

00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:49,610
exactly what they'd see we would use 90

00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:52,050
and then also set rotation this takes

00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,790
the pitch and the rotation so if you

00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:58,740
want to rotate the map this is what

00:24:53,790 --> 00:25:01,260
you'd use and then we'll also just

00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:04,170
include some code to make sure the map

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:08,790
changes sizes when you resize the window

00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:11,760
and then finally the most important part

00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:13,770
is we want to actually add some data to

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,500
our map so we're creating an object

00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:18,660
called an OMB datasource V stands for

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,880
optimized map for visualization which is

00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:24,120
basically a term were using for the data

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,060
the part of the map here's where you put

00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,860
the base URL so as you saw we just

00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:32,160
signed up for a service called here X Y

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,690
Z we see the X Y is the URL here and

00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,410
then we pass the different API format

00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:39,300
and then also the style set name and

00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,850
then finally you could take that token

00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,820
that you created in the XYZ token

00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:48,390
manager and paste that into your XYZ

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:53,490
token here so I'm gonna go ahead and go

00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:57,680
back to my token manager copy this paste

00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,680
it here

00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:06,639
and then to make sure we can see our map

00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:11,950
I'm also going to want to set up a

00:26:06,639 --> 00:26:15,639
simple local server so Python ahem

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:18,190
simple HTTP server and then your

00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:21,159
favorite port number I'm going to use

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:26,679
eight eight eight eight and then in the

00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:29,649
browser we can go to that localhost and

00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:42,940
we'll see a dark map of Singapore has

00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:51,340
appeared yeah yes of course it is bitly

00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:52,720
/ JS comp - harp and then once you have

00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:54,970
your map you could go ahead and drag it

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,399
around also change the pitch in the

00:26:54,970 --> 00:27:00,730
bearing I'm doing this with two fingers

00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:03,070
on my trackpad moving it up and down but

00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:05,139
if you have a mouse or some other sort

00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:17,999
of trackpad it's usually right click and

00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:17,999
drag any questions on this step

00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:27,730
we'll give it a few minutes make sure

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:27,730
everyone gets their map up and running

00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:34,300
do you guys maybe want to walk around

00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,300
see if there's any questions

00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:33,880
so two fingers and drag you have to yeah

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:39,100
any questions over here questions

00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,100
perfect looks like yeah oh yeah a strong

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,970
yes so to download it first I'll show

00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,720
you where to get it

00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:51,740
I mean yes to scroll to the top you'll

00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,030
see a folder in here called resources so

00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,730
just click on that and download that

00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:58,310
file so what this is is it helps with

00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,980
some 3d object loaders so some of them

00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:03,650
are extensions of the three J's library

00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:05,420
to import what we call FBX objects let's

00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,310
talk about that later on and then also

00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:10,760
is a quick little bug fix that we have

00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:12,530
for globe Patrol so we had a release

00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:18,230
that that didn't include it and we need

00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:19,940
it for this workshop alright awesome you

00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:23,110
guys having fun rotating your map and

00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,110
moving around and such

00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:34,460
yeah yeah of course yeah I'll show you

00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:37,730
guys how to view the documentation as

00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,559
well so up at the top in the resources

00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:41,990
section we have some of the links like

00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:43,970
to the repo Docs examples I'm gonna

00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:46,039
click on Doc's right here and that's

00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:48,799
going to take us to our documentation

00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:51,919
page so we have a set of modules out

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:54,250
here on the right with the simple API

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,419
these are actually all combined into one

00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,830
so it may be a little bit tricky to

00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:00,169
figure out which one you're using with a

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:03,139
simple API but for map view it's named

00:30:00,169 --> 00:30:04,909
the same we could see harp - map view on

00:30:03,139 --> 00:30:08,269
the right hand side we'll click on that

00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:10,370
and then inside this module you could

00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:13,309
see some of the classes so there is a

00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:16,100
class called map view within the module

00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:17,840
map view so this is when you'll find all

00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:21,820
the properties the getters and setters

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,820
and such for the module

00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:36,549
awesome so now that we have a map up and

00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:39,970
running let's do some modifications to

00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:40,899
map programmatically so in this section

00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:45,639
we'll be able to figure out how to

00:30:40,899 --> 00:30:47,999
change the center in the view okay yeah

00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:47,999
that's fine

00:32:46,909 --> 00:33:05,210
oh I think it I need two smaller it's

00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:06,739
harder that's a very projection

00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:15,409
I can you try that harped on spear

00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:18,999
projection yeah say that you're young oh

00:33:15,409 --> 00:33:18,999
good sorry that's a good catch

00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:06,540
nice fix that won't actually that should

00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,480
work fine without the heart because did

00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:13,740
you add the extra such a s file no okay

00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:19,110
well you just uh s-sir scroll to the top

00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:21,690
and resources and then you add the

00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:23,850
extras yeah so the issue with that is it

00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:26,070
wasn't added into our build Zoe just

00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:28,280
active that's why you don't need the

00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,280
heart

00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,860
alright are you guys ready to move on to

00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:44,390
the new section about modifying the map

00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:46,640
programmatically cool so yeah we have a

00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:48,830
method called set camera location and

00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,630
zoom which we've already used and that's

00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,460
where you could set the map to anywhere

00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,560
you want so if you want to learn how to

00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,450
set the map to your favorite city you

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,010
just need to find coordinates for it so

00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:00,410
you could just type in Seattle

00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:02,210
coordinates so really you just do your

00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:04,520
favorite City Line coordinates and then

00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:08,980
there's a nice site here called lat/long

00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,980
I could just copy and paste this and

00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:20,780
then paste it into here and we'll see

00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:23,270
that the map Center will change to

00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:26,300
whatever city or coordinates you set it

00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:31,520
to so I'm from Seattle so I put the map

00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:34,220
to here you also saw that you could

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,830
change the max pitch and then also the

00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:39,590
rotation and the pitch so it's the max

00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:43,490
pitch what it does is it sets the limit

00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:45,860
for how far you could change it so as

00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:48,110
you see 90 sometimes doesn't look the

00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:50,150
best unless you're really zoomed in if

00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:52,040
you're out here or the tiles start to

00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:54,170
cut off so if you want to limit to what

00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,930
the user can actually drag and change it

00:35:54,170 --> 00:36:00,620
to you could set the angle there usually

00:35:56,930 --> 00:36:02,080
45 is a good number to put it to so we

00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:05,510
see if we do 45

00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:11,600
we cannot go further down than 45

00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:15,650
degrees and also the rotation you could

00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:19,100
set here so we could sue maybe 120

00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:22,820
degrees and you can see that the default

00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:28,370
rotation has changed so you can set a

00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:31,730
value there between 0 and 360 now let's

00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:34,460
do something fun first of all I

00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:36,830
recommend refreshing the github page

00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:39,350
because we just found one small bug that

00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:41,540
was fixed but if you refresh everything

00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:43,690
will work fine so thanks for bearing

00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:46,119
with us on that

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:47,799
to change the projection we're currently

00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:51,369
at Mercator say if we want to try the

00:36:47,799 --> 00:36:53,349
spear projection what we'll do is in the

00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:55,150
constructor over map view for a

00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:59,559
projection we'll copy and paste this

00:36:55,150 --> 00:37:00,990
harp dot spear projection let's go up to

00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:04,660
the top

00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:08,970
severe projection and then we also need

00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:11,200
to change the controls a little bit

00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:12,400
since the globe used the different type

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,730
controls we're going to want to comment

00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,849
out all the current harp map controls

00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:22,059
code that includes also the UI elements

00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:24,250
and then also the set rotation and Max

00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:28,569
pitch angle and then we'll want to

00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:30,880
replace it with the globe controls just

00:37:28,569 --> 00:37:34,119
one thing to note for globe controls we

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,460
had to throw that in the extras file so

00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:39,130
there's no need to put a harp in front

00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:43,420
of it it's just globe controls and then

00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:46,599
pass the map and then I'm going to

00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:48,279
change the default view to zoom level 4

00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:58,750
just so we get high to see the globe a

00:37:48,279 --> 00:38:02,190
little bit better we refresh our new

00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:02,190
globe Patrol's excuse me

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:09,579
and now we have a globe view it's a

00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:13,329
little bit hard to see because we're in

00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:14,799
the dark theme but the next section

00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:18,309
we'll learn about changing theme and

00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:20,319
you'll see how to change that and it'll

00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:28,809
be a little bit more a little bit better

00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:30,789
contrast on the globe so yeah just

00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:33,390
remember to add in a new before the

00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:33,390
globe controls

00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:49,779
so we've created three themes you can

00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:53,199
include into harp GL one is the main

00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:56,319
earth colors and then we also have

00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:58,900
reduced day and nights these themes are

00:39:56,319 --> 00:40:00,400
called Berlin most because the the core

00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,199
of the development for harp GL was done

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,839
in Berlin and we made some new themes

00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:07,829
for that so in order to change the theme

00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:11,499
what you could do is pass these URLs

00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:15,549
into your map view constructor so if I

00:40:11,499 --> 00:40:17,859
want to make the theme the Berlin base I

00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:23,469
would just go ahead and paste it into

00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:26,650
theme right up here so this theme

00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:28,420
parameter also accepts relative URLs so

00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:30,430
if you have a custom theme that you

00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,829
create later on this workshop it doesn't

00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:35,709
have to be an HTTP absolutely URL it

00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:37,509
could just be theme JSON because you're

00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:40,209
referencing the file inside your local

00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:43,150
directory so go ahead and change the

00:40:40,209 --> 00:40:45,719
theme a couple times I'll now make the

00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,719
reduce day

00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:56,680
I was reduced night reduced a

00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:22,490
okay so do you guys want me to go over

00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:25,900
the globe part again would that be

00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:25,900
helpful okay I'll do that

00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:49,290
so now we're back to the normal Mercator

00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,930
flat view and we'll figure out how to do

00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:54,300
the globe so if we go back to the github

00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:56,760
page for the changing the maps

00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:59,849
projection section the first thing we'll

00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,310
want to do in the map constructor is add

00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:05,400
an option for the projection so

00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:08,700
projection is the Harpe sphere

00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:11,609
projection so I'll copy this I'll go up

00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:15,690
to the top of my index das file and I'll

00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:17,040
add what I copied in there so basically

00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:19,170
what we're setting here is the different

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,599
type of projection we want so by default

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,740
it goes to the Mercator projection which

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,599
is why if we wanted the sphere

00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:27,540
projection we have to actually specify

00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:30,780
that inside the constructor so that's

00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:33,060
the first step the next thing we'll need

00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:35,430
to do is actually get rid of the current

00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:37,310
map controls because the map controls

00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:40,020
only work with the Mercator projection

00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:41,460
so inside the code that you copy and

00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,470
paste in the very first step of getting

00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,200
the map up and running we can just go

00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:48,380
ahead and comment this out so notice I'm

00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,670
commenting out the harp top map controls

00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:52,290
basically because the pointer events for

00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:56,190
interacting with the flat map are

00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:58,500
slightly different than the globe and

00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:01,859
I'm also just removing the map controls

00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,750
UI from the side so since I deleted

00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:05,960
those I now need to add different

00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:09,300
controls for the globe which I have

00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:14,760
right here so conce controls equals new

00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:19,349
globe controls map I want to copy and

00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,670
paste this and we also made it another

00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,300
slight modification of the workshop just

00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,250
two minutes ago

00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:27,230
make sure to add new in front of globe

00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:27,230
controls yeah

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,800
yes so if some of you guys are having

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,810
issues with the importing of glow

00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,690
controls that is coming from the extras

00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:41,850
Jas file so we had to throw that in last

00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:43,440
minute due to a small bug that's also

00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:46,500
why it doesn't have the harp dot globe

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,300
controls in there as well so you could

00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,510
see if you open up extras jes glow

00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:53,610
controls is right here so if you maybe

00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:56,570
get an error cannot find glow controls

00:43:53,610 --> 00:44:03,660
make sure that you have extras jot J s

00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:05,790
imported into your HTML then once I have

00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:11,810
that band running I can refresh my page

00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:11,810
and will see the globe is working

00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,160
any questions over here I can help with

00:44:28,349 --> 00:44:32,819
yeah those are those aren't warnings or

00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:34,440
errors that's just what's printed out so

00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:36,950
no need to worry about those it's

00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,950
working fine

00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:54,480
this is barrel zoom out a lot yeah or

00:44:51,180 --> 00:45:03,059
you could go back to your code and set

00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:03,540
the zoom level to maybe four yep so you

00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:09,540
got it working

00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:15,839
nice hey how can I help

00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:18,119
hi fields are not currently supported

00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:21,480
government owns not defined so can you

00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:31,140
show me your code editor please ah and

00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:33,059
then you got extras yes oh yeah get rid

00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:42,299
of the Harpe dot map controls just got

00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:45,530
out that should fix it maybe do a hard

00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:45,530
cash reset when you refresh

00:45:54,339 --> 00:46:01,579
fields are not currently supported I

00:45:56,949 --> 00:46:05,989
think it's maybe have an error with the

00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:12,529
class inside the extra yes syntax do you

00:46:05,989 --> 00:46:14,930
have a different browser maybe but

00:46:12,529 --> 00:46:17,180
that's my guess is that a Firefox's are

00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:19,369
reading the class because it's a es2015

00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:21,499
syntax or something and there you go

00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:23,680
okay that's exactly what it was I think

00:46:21,499 --> 00:46:30,349
oh sorry about that

00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:32,420
hi square projection is not defined

00:46:30,349 --> 00:46:36,829
let's go back to your code

00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:41,299
oh it's harps fear projection so right

00:46:36,829 --> 00:46:47,359
in front of sphere projection right

00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:55,269
there type harp har P dot and then save

00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:57,259
that well and that should work perfect

00:46:55,269 --> 00:47:04,609
so you want to zoom out a lot to

00:46:57,259 --> 00:47:08,769
actually see the globe nice it's working

00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:11,660
oh you guys doing okay over here

00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:13,999
EXI game oh I'm sorry scroll to the very

00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:16,670
top of this repo okay and it's in the

00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:35,869
resources file okay yeah sorry that was

00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:37,249
a little confusing yeah that's good yeah

00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:39,140
for those of you we've already got the

00:47:37,249 --> 00:47:42,969
globe running try to maybe change the

00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:42,969
map theme and such play around with that

00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,849
and we'll resume in a minute or so

00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:24,739
hey unexpected token I'm so interesting

00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:41,369
let's take a look you're extras at Jas

00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:43,499
file this is exercise

00:48:41,369 --> 00:48:46,619
I think this oh I think what happened is

00:48:43,499 --> 00:48:53,569
you downloaded the github HTML instead

00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:59,009
of yeah you guys doing okay over here

00:48:53,569 --> 00:49:03,619
okay that should work of any questions

00:48:59,009 --> 00:49:03,619
over here I could help with perfect

00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:13,750
you guys following me everywhere I go

00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:27,170
the what the theme yeah so to change the

00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:31,429
theme well first of all we have three

00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:32,539
default themes you could use base reduce

00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:34,249
day and night

00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:36,319
so we have links to all three of those

00:49:34,249 --> 00:49:40,099
files right here if you click on them

00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:42,019
they're all JSON files and you could set

00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:44,929
the theme in the constructor so if I

00:49:42,019 --> 00:49:48,319
want to do the reduced day I could copy

00:49:44,929 --> 00:49:50,359
this link and then go into my

00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:53,599
constructor and this theme parameter

00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:56,509
right here I can copy and paste the

00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,109
absolute URL to it so I'll set it to

00:49:56,509 --> 00:50:00,319
dark

00:49:57,109 --> 00:50:01,579
I'm sorry night here I don't know yeah

00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:04,009
it is night

00:50:01,579 --> 00:50:06,319
and then I could go to my web app just

00:50:04,009 --> 00:50:10,189
refresh and you'll see that it's changed

00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:16,099
to dark so you could change the theme in

00:50:10,189 --> 00:50:18,160
the map view constructor there's also

00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:20,449
the option to set the theme

00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:22,910
programmatically later on outside the

00:50:20,449 --> 00:50:24,979
constructor and you could just copy and

00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:27,499
paste this code to do it as well it's

00:50:24,979 --> 00:50:35,179
right below the three different maps on

00:50:27,499 --> 00:50:36,799
the github page okay for this next step

00:50:35,179 --> 00:50:39,410
let's do something fun let's add a

00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:42,109
rotating camera around the map to create

00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:48,410
an effect like this where the maps

00:50:42,109 --> 00:50:49,759
rotating automatically so to do so it's

00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:52,279
pretty simple just copy and paste a

00:50:49,759 --> 00:50:56,089
couple lines of code but we'll be using

00:50:52,279 --> 00:50:58,039
is a method called map dot look at it's

00:50:56,089 --> 00:51:00,829
very similar to set camera geolocation

00:50:58,039 --> 00:51:02,179
zoom however this time you can pass it

00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:04,279
more than just the zoom level and

00:51:02,179 --> 00:51:10,660
coordinates you could also pass it the

00:51:04,279 --> 00:51:10,660
option either tilt and the rotation

00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:24,369
so I'll copy and paste this into my

00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:26,500
index J yes yes that's actually a great

00:51:24,369 --> 00:51:28,030
point so if we're gonna do the rotation

00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,740
we should actually move away from the

00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:33,820
globe so we'll go back to the map

00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:35,680
controls so to do so we're gonna get rid

00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:40,960
of this projection in the constructor

00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:42,940
and then add our map controls back to

00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:47,920
the map and get rid of the globe

00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:51,550
controls so this way we're going to go

00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:54,310
back to the flat map so make sure to go

00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:57,480
to the flat map if you want to do the

00:51:54,310 --> 00:51:57,480
animation that we're about to do

00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:14,360
so for the rotation code

00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:16,700
we're basically waiting for a map event

00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:19,580
saying that the map has rendered and

00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:21,230
that means we want to then fire off the

00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:23,480
rotation so every time it renders we're

00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:25,790
going to want to update the rotation so

00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,620
the azimuth right here and then we'll

00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:34,610
use a piece of code that just begins the

00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:36,590
animation with map begin animation so if

00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:39,890
we go back and refresh our screen will

00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:42,040
see the rotating view of Singapore I'm

00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:45,380
actually to go back and update the theme

00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:47,870
to the base style just so there's a

00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:50,230
little bit more contrast on the

00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:50,230
buildings

00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:18,830
there we go so this is a pretty fun view

00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:23,990
do you have your map set up very

00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:25,340
game-like and you don't have to set it

00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:27,530
to the Singapore coordinates you could

00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:28,940
also set the rotation to whatever city

00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:31,120
you come from or your favorite city as

00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,120
well

00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:46,570
so feel free to play around with the

00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:48,070
rotation the center and such for like

00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:54,150
five or so minutes and then we'll resume

00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:54,150
on to the next section any questions yes

00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,050
all right

00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:01,870
yeah infinite so basically if you look

00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:03,940
at the code every time the map renders

00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:06,850
which is we see multiple times per

00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:09,010
second or adding some of the angle here

00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:09,820
so as long as the map is rendering which

00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:19,630
it always will be

00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:23,020
it will continue you could so you could

00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:25,900
say maybe do like a while loop that's

00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:28,600
adding up and then oh so yeah you could

00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:30,600
use a set timeout a set interval a while

00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:48,700
loop really any other sort of like

00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:58,530
design yes okay correct I hate any I

00:55:48,700 --> 00:56:01,990
could help with over here how like why

00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:03,610
what exactly this is yes so that's a

00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:06,550
myth is basically the angle between 0

00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:08,170
and 360 mm-hmm and so we have this event

00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:10,900
here called render and that's we see

00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:12,310
firing multiple times per second and

00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:14,320
every time it's rendering we're

00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:16,210
basically adding a little bit to the

00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:17,920
angle that's why it's changing so yeah

00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:20,380
if you want to increase the basically

00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:23,350
the velocity you would just add a higher

00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:24,610
angler or something like that and then

00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:29,220
if you want to make it slower just make

00:56:24,610 --> 00:56:32,760
it like 0.1 or something like that okay

00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:37,740
oh my god that's gonna go crazy

00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:39,820
yeah because yeah because 360 right oh

00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:41,440
my god this is gonna make me say guy

00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:43,420
that just like motion sickness oh

00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,640
actually not that much yeah I guess

00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:47,770
think about I guess if it's between 0

00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:52,620
and 180 that's there things might do

00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:52,620
yeah I just wanted to go

00:56:53,609 --> 00:57:00,510
yeah I've nowhere nice I wonder why

00:56:58,180 --> 00:57:05,500
beautiful you sit there probably I can't

00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:09,039
handle it what angle did you set 179 no

00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:11,579
three not good plus yeah I don't know

00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:15,329
interesting thank you yeah no where's

00:57:11,579 --> 00:57:15,329
anything I could help with over here

00:57:54,430 --> 00:58:07,250
yes we even send it to three makes it go

00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:09,490
super fast and yeah five is way too much

00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,490
I think

00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:55,690
you guys having fun cool

01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:17,460
alright are you guys ready to move on to

01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:17,460
the next section

01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:27,780
cool so now that we've got the map set

01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:30,030
up you've learned how to rotate the

01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:32,220
camera change the theme to adult a

01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:34,890
default themes as well as set the center

01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:37,080
in the pitch and such let's do something

01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:40,080
fun which is styling the base map

01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:41,550
so since harp GL is a vector render you

01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:43,350
could really go crazy with styling the

01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:44,700
map and do any of those style rules that

01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:46,560
you want that we kind of talked about in

01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,030
the beginning like see for example I

01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:50,460
just made all the buildings green and

01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:51,780
yellow the roads purple I mean yes it's

01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,830
ugly as hell but it's kind of fun to

01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:56,130
just be able to create this type of

01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:59,220
stuff so we have a JSON editor that you

01:01:56,130 --> 01:02:00,780
could do to edit these Styles right here

01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:03,930
in the section 3 styling a base map

01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:09,420
you'll see a link to here Maps github io

01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:12,150
/ harp - map - editor you go ahead and

01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:14,010
click on this and you can think of this

01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:17,040
kind of as an interactive prototype

01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:19,470
environment for styling maps yes it is

01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:21,060
all in code technically just JSON

01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:23,040
there's not really a UI to be changing

01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:25,160
the colors but still it's nice because

01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:27,120
you could actually see the changes live

01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:29,930
in the screen to the right without

01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:31,740
having to refresh your page or anything

01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:34,230
so what we have here are all the

01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:35,940
different style rules up here we kind of

01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:39,450
have some some Global's around lights

01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:42,390
and fogs and textiles and such but down

01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:45,630
at around line 79 you actually see some

01:02:42,390 --> 01:02:47,460
of the Styles it's the same syntax we

01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:49,410
talked about in beginning so say for

01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,700
example if you want to see the peers you

01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:53,340
could actually change the color of the

01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:55,200
peers and such and this style file might

01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:57,330
be a little bit overwhelming because

01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:59,280
there's a couple thousand lines long

01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:02,370
that's because we have every single map

01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,420
element inside of here so really the

01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:05,970
main things that you might want to edit

01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:10,680
would be say like the earth background

01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:12,780
you could search for earth in here you

01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:17,000
might want to also change water so we

01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:17,000
could change the fill to maybe just

01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:23,330
yellow my goal right here is to make the

01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:26,780
ugliest map possible let's see what I

01:03:23,330 --> 01:03:29,090
could do so yellow water that's it's

01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:48,440
kind of crazy right now let's change the

01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:52,270
earth to maybe white background I cannot

01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:52,270
see any reason why earth isn't working

01:03:52,700 --> 01:04:11,290
oh that see I'm editing the text here I

01:04:00,109 --> 01:04:11,290
see I see

01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,640
I'm so sure of the island will affect

01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:30,470
maybe this is just removed remove the

01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,470
whole condition yes they are in contact

01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:50,520
yeah now these are both texts actually

01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:53,610
what is the background inflator take the

01:04:50,520 --> 01:05:01,680
in this case you need to do filmography

01:04:53,610 --> 01:05:14,869
the background what it does this land

01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:16,950
yeah there we go

01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:19,890
yeah so earth is actually just the

01:05:16,950 --> 01:05:22,140
background it's not the land land is

01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:23,430
actually called land and we actually

01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:29,400
have a different couple different types

01:05:23,430 --> 01:05:30,810
of land like urban in parkland but

01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,520
actually white does not look too good I

01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:36,480
think I'm gonna go back to the previous

01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:38,700
color but a fun one to change and

01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:42,180
customize especially in the context of

01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:43,760
the 3d engine are buildings so if you

01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:47,160
actually scroll down to the very bottom

01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:50,190
you'll see building geometry its line

01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:53,640
1800 and this is where you could start

01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:55,310
changing some of the things for

01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:58,920
buildings so we could do

01:05:55,310 --> 01:06:02,760
let's do background of blue for a

01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:05,160
building you could see now we have the

01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:12,830
blue background with the teal outline

01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:12,830
but maybe let's make this a red outline

01:06:14,569 --> 01:06:25,859
yeah this is pretty ugly so far and then

01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:27,510
you could also style roads roads are

01:06:25,859 --> 01:06:29,099
generally classified into three

01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:31,710
high-level categories of primary

01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:33,240
secondary and tertiary so if I want to

01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:40,140
do primary roads I'm gonna search for

01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:42,780
primary in here and then you could

01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:43,349
change the color what colors have I not

01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:58,440
used

01:06:43,349 --> 01:07:02,790
let's do green yep and then you can see

01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:11,400
some of the highways are now green now

01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:17,160
I'm gonna search for secondary make the

01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:19,530
secondary colors white give some

01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:22,740
contrast to that there you go

01:07:19,530 --> 01:07:28,170
and then for the third tier of roads

01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:31,980
tertiary any colors you guys want to see

01:07:28,170 --> 01:07:33,829
me add any suggestions do we have a

01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:39,410
question from the audience from Nina

01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:39,410
what color purple nice

01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:55,020
yeah so there's a lot going on with this

01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:56,870
map anyway

01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:59,340
knock yourself out with the colors there

01:07:56,870 --> 01:08:01,470
but once you're done creating this

01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:04,380
hideous tile or maybe some of you guys

01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:06,780
have created a beautiful style you could

01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:09,960
actually click this download button in

01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:13,170
the middle sidebar so I'll download that

01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:15,510
file by default it went to my downloads

01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:19,500
but what I could do is actually drag

01:08:15,510 --> 01:08:21,870
that into my folder directory so mine is

01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:24,800
called heart map I'm gonna rename it

01:08:21,870 --> 01:08:28,500
just themed JSON instead of theme space

01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:32,510
parentheses one and then I could go back

01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:35,280
to my code and then inside the theme

01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:37,320
option right here instead of doing the

01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:40,890
absolute URL to the here map theme I

01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:42,870
could just do theme dot JSON because I'm

01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:46,560
referencing the local file that I just

01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:50,310
downloaded from the heart editor and

01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:52,740
when I go to my map and I refresh you're

01:08:50,310 --> 01:09:02,450
gonna see this hideous theme in your own

01:08:52,740 --> 01:09:04,980
map so we'll fix the tilt a little bit

01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:07,620
so just to repeat that process in case

01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:09,690
anyone missed it inside the heart map

01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:12,360
editor you see this button right here

01:09:09,690 --> 01:09:14,490
it's the download the down arrow you can

01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:16,530
click on that and then it will basically

01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:18,840
download this JSON file in the left hand

01:09:16,530 --> 01:09:20,370
side and then you can put that inside

01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:22,260
your project directory and then

01:09:20,370 --> 01:09:25,010
reference it in the map view constructor

01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:25,010
just set the theme

01:09:43,819 --> 01:09:47,480
any questions over here

01:09:51,779 --> 01:10:01,059
don't with a lesson Angela steps over I

01:09:55,860 --> 01:10:05,460
mean did it sit for four to two today uh

01:10:01,059 --> 01:10:05,460
yeah did you put the dancing guy no I

01:10:06,179 --> 01:10:10,960
okay yeah if you did all the steps

01:10:08,559 --> 01:10:13,510
you've completed the workshop so he want

01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:15,659
your you're free to leave or if you have

01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:20,559
any other questions I'd be happy to help

01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:23,170
it's awesome

01:10:20,559 --> 01:10:28,719
I'm more of a good golfer golfer

01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:31,289
convicted cocaine radiation yeah and get

01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:34,570
to know open

01:10:31,289 --> 01:10:35,289
the different API session yeah well I'm

01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:37,059
glad you enjoyed it

01:10:35,289 --> 01:10:38,769
you're gonna put it into any projects

01:10:37,059 --> 01:10:41,590
you've been working on recently look

01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:43,210
market but okay awesome

01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:44,679
yeah well thanks for attending cool

01:10:43,210 --> 01:10:49,590
thanks nice to meet you what was your

01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:49,590
name no Dylan hi

01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:06,760
this time look into that the values of

01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:08,739
the Phoenicians but you can see the

01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:10,150
specification of exactly work the

01:11:08,739 --> 01:11:11,560
enticing which one you know what you

01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:24,040
wanted to do before you change the

01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:24,610
background here is gonna little more

01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:27,330
complicated

01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:27,330
yeah

01:14:09,190 --> 01:14:12,380
all right I hope you all are having fun

01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:15,100
with the map styles and knocking

01:14:12,380 --> 01:14:17,930
yourself out creating some crazy styles

01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:21,350
let's move on to the next section of

01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:22,790
adding data to the map so these maps are

01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:25,280
really fun and awesome making the colors

01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:26,930
all pretty and stuff but we could

01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:28,610
actually add some utility to them and

01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:32,330
create some data visualizations of

01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:34,070
geographic data so before we move on to

01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:35,870
the next section I'm just going to go

01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:37,880
ahead and disable this animation that we

01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:39,140
have running most of because it doesn't

01:14:37,880 --> 01:14:41,240
let you control the map if it's

01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:45,830
currently running and then I'm also

01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:48,980
going to set my zoom level just

01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:50,990
something a little bit further down so

01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:56,620
we could actually see Singapore so

01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:56,620
basically just going to reset my map hmm

01:14:56,860 --> 01:15:15,470
to the Singapore coordinates as well now

01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:18,400
it's looking a little bit better to

01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:18,400
where we had the map before

01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:27,960
so the first exercise we'll do is add

01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:30,300
some geo JSON to the map and we'll be

01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:32,010
adding static geo JSON so it's not gonna

01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:33,750
be coming from a server and it's not

01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:36,150
going to be already be tiled we will

01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:39,140
simply just be adding a geo JSON file we

01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:42,080
have locally on our machine onto the map

01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:45,540
and so inside the resources directory of

01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:49,560
this repository we have a file in here

01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:51,690
called wireless - hotspots geo JSON so

01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:54,720
what this is is a basically a list of

01:15:51,690 --> 01:15:57,390
all the public hotspots for Wi-Fi

01:15:54,720 --> 01:16:02,370
throughout Singapore and so I'll go

01:15:57,390 --> 01:16:06,030
ahead and just download this file so

01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:10,890
download and then save page as and then

01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:13,530
wireless - hotspots geo JSON by default

01:16:10,890 --> 01:16:15,300
github is putting a dot txt to the end

01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:17,700
of the file you want to go ahead and

01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:19,980
remove that so the file extension is geo

01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:26,670
JSON and I'm going to want to save that

01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:29,130
into my project directory so I could go

01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:32,360
back to my vs code editor and then

01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:35,280
actually take a look at the data in here

01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:37,500
it's geo JSON the same as what we

01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:40,740
learned earlier in this workshop of you

01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:43,710
see the properties which has some HTML

01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:47,130
in here as a string but then also near

01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:49,320
the end as we scroll past this you'll

01:16:47,130 --> 01:16:51,540
actually see the geometry in here so we

01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:53,310
see that it's type point and then we

01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:54,450
have the coordinates right here so

01:16:53,310 --> 01:17:05,940
basically giving us the information of

01:16:54,450 --> 01:17:07,920
where to put the stott on the map now

01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:11,120
I'll go back to the readme file where

01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,120
I'll copy some of the code

01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:17,790
so what would be doing here is creating

01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:20,520
a network request using the fetch

01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:23,700
function to the wireless hotspots Gio

01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:29,130
JSON file just to make sure that works

01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:32,730
let's do a console log of the data just

01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:35,730
make sure we see it over here yep so it

01:17:32,730 --> 01:17:37,170
looks like that request is successful we

01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:41,970
see all the different features in here

01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:43,500
from the file the properties and such so

01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:47,250
the first thing I want to do is create a

01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:49,020
Geo JSON data provider so you could use

01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:51,480
the function Harvey Oh JSON data

01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:54,030
provider pass it the name which will be

01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:56,820
wireless - hotspots and then you also

01:17:54,030 --> 01:18:00,810
want to pass it the variable of the data

01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:02,310
so I just named it data then once you've

01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:04,350
created the geo JSON data provider

01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:07,110
you'll want to create a geo JSON data

01:18:04,350 --> 01:18:09,480
source so with this you also pass the

01:18:07,110 --> 01:18:11,970
two parameters the data provider we just

01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:18,300
created so geo JSON data provider and

01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:20,520
then wireless hotspots so this code will

01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:26,070
technically add it to the map actually

01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:30,960
excuse me we need to do one more one

01:18:26,070 --> 01:18:34,020
more function map add data source geo

01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:36,240
JSON data source but we need to do one

01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:39,120
more thing once it's added to the map we

01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:40,890
need to apply the styles in order for

01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,450
the data to show so we could add it to

01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:44,490
the map but if there's no style is

01:18:42,450 --> 01:18:46,620
provided to the map it won't have

01:18:44,490 --> 01:18:48,960
anything to show the data it would just

01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:50,580
be blank objects on the map so what

01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,770
we're doing is passing one of these

01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:54,180
style objects these are the same style

01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:56,640
objects that are within the theme not

01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:58,710
JSON file except or just to knit with

01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,540
under JavaScript now so we're saying

01:18:58,710 --> 01:19:01,980
when geo make sure that geometry type is

01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:04,470
a point we're gonna want to use the

01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:07,770
circles technique and then style it this

01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:10,380
color then once we've created that

01:19:07,770 --> 01:19:14,220
object we'll want to pass it to the geo

01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:17,880
JSON data source using the function set

01:19:14,220 --> 01:19:20,450
style set and then we will call a map

01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,450
update

01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:27,970
so once we have that pace in here we can

01:19:23,410 --> 01:19:29,620
go back to our map refresh and although

01:19:27,970 --> 01:19:31,450
we have a ton of different colors on the

01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:34,450
map right now you can see these kind of

01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:38,590
light green highlighter colors or all

01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:40,540
the goj sun points that we added so

01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:42,550
every time you see a teal sorry not teal

01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:51,940
highlighter color these are the wireless

01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:53,140
hotspots with in Singapore and say if I

01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:54,490
wanted to change the color of those

01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:56,200
hotspots

01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:59,890
I could edit it right here in my

01:19:56,200 --> 01:20:03,910
JavaScript so we can do white - this

01:19:59,890 --> 01:20:11,430
time for a little bit more contrast that

01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:15,100
definitely looks a little bit better and

01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:17,650
so if your map is not showing the data

01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:18,910
or if you're not within Singapore you

01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:20,980
should make sure to set your coordinates

01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:24,300
back to Singapore so you'll be able to

01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:24,300
actually see the data on the map

01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:07,630
how you doing over here awesome

01:21:06,370 --> 01:21:17,910
well let me know if there's something I

01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:17,910
could help with any questions over here

01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:24,400
so are you developing on an iPad yeah

01:21:22,570 --> 01:21:29,370
that's cool you have Windows running on

01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:29,370
here that's awesome

01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:49,690
time to change the what oh the tilt so

01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:52,330
you do with your mouth like that but to

01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:57,490
do with the code go back to your vs code

01:21:52,330 --> 01:22:01,180
I scroll up and you want to do a set

01:21:57,490 --> 01:22:02,650
rotation so 50 is the current set so you

01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:11,970
could do maybe just zero if you want to

01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:15,720
top down view there you go

01:22:11,970 --> 01:22:15,720
any questions over here

01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:06,010
so you guys just learned how to add

01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:07,900
static geo JSON from a file onto the map

01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:10,330
but there's also different types of data

01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:13,030
sources you could add such as tiled data

01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:14,860
sources from servers so we have another

01:25:13,030 --> 01:25:17,230
product called here XYZ which basically

01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:19,330
does tiled data sources for you which

01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:20,920
that means is when you have large data

01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:23,679
sets you want to actually divide it up

01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:25,150
into squares across the world basically

01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:27,010
what this means is you don't have to

01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:29,320
load all the data at once say if you had

01:25:27,010 --> 01:25:30,580
a 10 gigabyte file of the earth you

01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:33,280
really don't want to only want to render

01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:35,860
the file that you're seeing in the

01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:38,050
viewport so say for example if we were

01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:39,699
looking at Singapore what exercise you

01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:41,560
would do is actually query the data just

01:25:39,699 --> 01:25:43,960
for your viewport so that's basically

01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:45,250
what a tile that data source is so in

01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:48,099
this next exercise we're gonna actually

01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:50,380
want to add a tiled data source and to

01:25:48,099 --> 01:25:52,060
do so we've already set up a data source

01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:56,770
for you it's going to be global

01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:58,719
railroads all across the world and to do

01:25:56,770 --> 01:26:02,320
this you'll want to actually use another

01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:04,480
HAARP onb data source so right here in

01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:07,170
the section adding tiled geo JSON from

01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:11,070
server I want to copy and paste this

01:26:07,170 --> 01:26:11,070
global Rail road's variable

01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:20,920
and what this is is the base URL to this

01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:23,170
data set we see the unique identifier

01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:25,090
right here you don't really have to

01:26:23,170 --> 01:26:26,850
think too much about this API endpoint

01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:29,020
this is just where the data is stored

01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:31,630
however something that is important is

01:26:29,020 --> 01:26:33,250
this authentication code previously when

01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:34,870
you added the base map data when you

01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:37,300
created the map you passed your own

01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:38,680
authentication code it's important to

01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:40,570
use this saw tendon creation code

01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:41,860
provided in the code because that

01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:43,870
basically gives you access to the data

01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:46,950
set do not put your own authentication

01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:49,510
code inside of here

01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:52,420
so once I've created the omv data source

01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:54,340
I then want to add it to the map so I'll

01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:57,040
be using the same syntax that I did

01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:58,660
before for the static goj Sun basically

01:26:57,040 --> 01:27:00,700
instead of referencing a file that I've

01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:03,730
added to my site I'm now referencing

01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:06,040
this tiled data source from a server so

01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:08,080
I'll do the same function map add data

01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:10,660
source but this time I'm just doing

01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:13,360
global railroads instead of the Geo JSON

01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:14,160
data source and then I'm attaching a

01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,750
style to it

01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:18,880
this time the global railroads are lines

01:27:16,750 --> 01:27:21,040
set of points so I have when geometry

01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:23,110
type is line we're gonna want to use

01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:25,830
this technique solid line with this

01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:30,010
color and then it's always going to be

01:27:25,830 --> 01:27:32,740
one pixel wide so beforehand and you

01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:35,680
could also do options for circles or

01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:37,660
lines in meters the difference with one

01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:41,800
pixel is that the size will say constant

01:27:37,660 --> 01:27:43,450
no matter what zoom you're at next we'll

01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:46,680
attach the style set to the global

01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:49,660
railroads and then we'll update the map

01:27:46,680 --> 01:27:51,340
also because this is a global data set

01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:54,880
I'm gonna want to change my zoom level

01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:57,780
to maybe say four or five so I could see

01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,780
the entire data set

01:27:59,150 --> 01:28:14,910
and also fix this rotation here we go so

01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:18,570
it does take a little bit longer because

01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:20,940
it's a much larger service and file but

01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:23,180
you now should see red lines pop up all

01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:26,460
over the globe you see India has a lot

01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:28,770
Europe is pretty populated as well these

01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:33,120
are all the railroads in the entire

01:28:28,770 --> 01:28:35,070
world you actually see these are loading

01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:37,470
kind of square by square those are the

01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:38,940
tiles I was just mentioning so when the

01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:40,650
viewport sees that we are looking at

01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:43,460
this it's not going to load up this tile

01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:43,460
of the data set

01:28:59,569 --> 01:29:04,979
so this is actually a pretty bit pretty

01:29:02,489 --> 01:29:16,439
data visualization just lines all over

01:29:04,979 --> 01:29:17,939
the place although I don't know if the

01:29:16,439 --> 01:29:20,419
red looks too good with my teal

01:29:17,939 --> 01:29:20,419
background

01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:42,520
yeah of course yeah so we didn't go too

01:29:39,849 --> 01:29:43,960
much into detail on the XYZ part that's

01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:45,250
basically a back-end server that's

01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:47,590
taking the data when you upload it

01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:50,739
basically dividing up two tiles all over

01:29:47,590 --> 01:29:52,480
the globe and so what harp GL is doing

01:29:50,739 --> 01:29:54,960
is when you add that data source

01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:56,860
it takes basically the viewport

01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,360
coordinates that you're looking at so

01:29:56,860 --> 01:30:00,219
same Singapore and taking those

01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:02,050
coordinates and also the zoom level and

01:30:00,219 --> 01:30:04,570
it's sending a query back to the server

01:30:02,050 --> 01:30:05,800
to only ask for that data that way

01:30:04,570 --> 01:30:08,650
you're not loading everything at once

01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:09,520
but I guess it's a little bit it's

01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:11,969
different when you look at the world

01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:13,869
because we're days calling all the tiles

01:30:11,969 --> 01:30:16,179
but it's a little bit more efficient if

01:30:13,869 --> 01:30:28,239
you're just loading a smaller zoom level

01:30:16,179 --> 01:30:30,070
area yeah so that's another product it's

01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:32,500
secondly open source as well you can

01:30:30,070 --> 01:30:33,880
find that in github and such but we're

01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:35,230
just not going into too much detail

01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:36,969
we're mostly just doing the

01:30:35,230 --> 01:30:38,110
visualization side of thing but if you

01:30:36,969 --> 01:30:39,340
know a lot of geospatial data

01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:41,650
engineering that's actually a very

01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:43,829
helpful tool so I believe the API I'm

01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:47,079
sorry the endpoint is like explored

01:30:43,829 --> 01:30:48,780
xyz.com so just type in here X Y Z you

01:30:47,079 --> 01:30:51,670
get some more information on the product

01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:53,800
and they also have a like a map styling

01:30:51,670 --> 01:30:56,800
studio you can do pretty much the same

01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:58,719
things as this but all with a UI so you

01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,909
don't have to actually code it so pros

01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:02,170
and cons obviously with heart GL since

01:31:00,909 --> 01:31:04,780
you can code with it you could really

01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:06,309
get any Styles really there's no limits

01:31:04,780 --> 01:31:07,690
on what you could do whereas the UI it's

01:31:06,309 --> 01:31:09,639
a little bit more basic for non coders

01:31:07,690 --> 01:31:11,290
where there's a little bit limitations

01:31:09,639 --> 01:31:14,159
on it so it really depends on like what

01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:14,159
type of project you're doing

01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:56,930
how's it going over here everyone's

01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:56,930
excited

01:33:36,979 --> 01:33:41,280
awesome so our map is looking great by

01:33:39,479 --> 01:33:43,530
now when we put all the railroad colors

01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:47,280
and lines on here so we're not colors

01:33:43,530 --> 01:33:49,619
just lines but there's also a concept

01:33:47,280 --> 01:33:51,329
called data-driven styling which you

01:33:49,619 --> 01:33:53,849
basically style the data based on

01:33:51,329 --> 01:33:55,619
different properties so right now all

01:33:53,849 --> 01:33:56,789
the lines are just one color because

01:33:55,619 --> 01:33:59,039
they're all the different railroads in

01:33:56,789 --> 01:34:00,449
here but say if we wanted to see the

01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:03,179
different railroads that are not active

01:34:00,449 --> 01:34:04,739
or that are currently shut down what we

01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:06,589
could do is take the property from the

01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:09,119
Geo JSON and the tiles that says

01:34:06,589 --> 01:34:10,679
railroads are not active or their

01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:13,409
clothes and such and apply different

01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:15,269
colors to those that way we'd get a mix

01:34:13,409 --> 01:34:17,189
of maybe red lines for active railroads

01:34:15,269 --> 01:34:19,800
and then a different color for railroads

01:34:17,189 --> 01:34:21,449
that are closed savory or some sort of

01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:23,280
data analyst and we wanted to see which

01:34:21,449 --> 01:34:26,699
countries had closed railroads and stuff

01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:28,319
like that so you could apply different

01:34:26,699 --> 01:34:33,030
styling rules to the properties of the

01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:35,249
data to do so we don't have to change

01:34:33,030 --> 01:34:37,229
any of the code for adding the data

01:34:35,249 --> 01:34:48,719
source and such all we have to do is

01:34:37,229 --> 01:34:50,819
change the style rules that we apply so

01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:51,809
I'm going to go to the code block where

01:34:50,819 --> 01:34:55,319
I added a style

01:34:51,809 --> 01:35:01,039
I'm going to replace it right here just

01:34:55,319 --> 01:35:05,369
delete that with two new style objects

01:35:01,039 --> 01:35:08,399
previously we had when geometry type

01:35:05,369 --> 01:35:10,229
equals a line we apply a rule but now

01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:14,030
we're adding something else we're gonna

01:35:10,229 --> 01:35:18,989
say when geometry type is a line and

01:35:14,030 --> 01:35:21,479
property status is open so what this

01:35:18,989 --> 01:35:24,839
properties and status is is if we go

01:35:21,479 --> 01:35:29,849
back to the Geo JSON this is just an

01:35:24,839 --> 01:35:33,089
example of how it looks we see in

01:35:29,849 --> 01:35:36,599
properties there is a key and value pair

01:35:33,089 --> 01:35:40,169
that says status is open so we want to

01:35:36,599 --> 01:35:44,280
select that data and apply this color

01:35:40,169 --> 01:35:47,550
the five zero e 3 C 2 then we also have

01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:49,260
when properties are either closed or we

01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:52,380
don't know so we'll assume those are

01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:54,960
are closed we could then apply a

01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:56,550
different color we can do this d630 six

01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,000
so basically we're splitting the data

01:35:56,550 --> 01:36:05,070
into two different buckets here open or

01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:09,470
closed or possibly unknown so we could

01:36:05,070 --> 01:36:15,690
save that file go back to our web app

01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:19,710
let it load and the colors that I set is

01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:23,970
green or teal equals active and then red

01:36:19,710 --> 01:36:26,130
is closed so you could see there's some

01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:29,850
red lines that are now popping up in

01:36:26,130 --> 01:36:35,370
South America and also Africa that means

01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:36,540
that the railroads are closed so you

01:36:35,370 --> 01:36:38,460
could apply these techniques to really

01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:41,430
any dataset to differentiate between

01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:44,239
different properties say for the

01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:46,739
Singapore dataset we could have done

01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:50,580
maybe the size of the circle depending

01:36:46,739 --> 01:36:52,410
on how many devices they can handle at

01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:54,120
once and such really any sort of

01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:56,310
property in the data quantitative or

01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:58,910
qualitative you could add to the styling

01:36:56,310 --> 01:36:58,910
rules on the map

01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:08,950
unless you record this

01:40:11,469 --> 01:40:20,190
oh I probably feel good standing in

01:40:14,140 --> 01:40:20,190
front of it just the back your shirt

01:40:20,670 --> 01:40:28,350
that's fine Hey

01:40:29,249 --> 01:40:37,320
oh how to remove them yeah so you do

01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:41,159
that in your theme file so right now you

01:40:37,320 --> 01:40:43,110
are see you're calling I think you can't

01:40:41,159 --> 01:40:46,739
edit what you do is you would open that

01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:54,090
up inside the map to be editor yeah and

01:40:46,739 --> 01:40:55,679
then I mean so what I did is yeah so

01:40:54,090 --> 01:40:59,130
there's a quick little hacky you do

01:40:55,679 --> 01:41:01,860
instead of deleting all the text what

01:40:59,130 --> 01:41:03,449
you do is just download this file and it

01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:06,360
basically this has dependencies on other

01:41:03,449 --> 01:41:09,239
resource files like font files and icons

01:41:06,360 --> 01:41:12,090
so if you download that and you just

01:41:09,239 --> 01:41:13,949
added your theme the fonts or the text

01:41:12,090 --> 01:41:16,019
won't show up because the attached fonts

01:41:13,949 --> 01:41:18,949
aren't available in the same way that

01:41:16,019 --> 01:41:18,949
the URL would have them

01:41:44,610 --> 01:41:50,380
all right any questions on the data

01:41:46,989 --> 01:41:58,000
driven styles are you all ready to move

01:41:50,380 --> 01:42:02,460
it on to 3d objects yeah there we go

01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:06,670
that's the excitement I like to see cool

01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:11,560
so because harp GL is built on a popular

01:42:06,670 --> 01:42:14,110
3d web library called 3j s you're

01:42:11,560 --> 01:42:16,719
actually able to call all the api's that

01:42:14,110 --> 01:42:18,760
you would a 3j s right inside a harp as

01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:20,710
well so for a little bit more

01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:22,660
information on 3j s you could click on

01:42:20,710 --> 01:42:24,489
their site they have a lot of cool

01:42:22,660 --> 01:42:27,550
examples of things you could do with 3j

01:42:24,489 --> 01:42:30,850
s it's a fun little cattle gallery to

01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:33,219
look through but the first exercise

01:42:30,850 --> 01:42:36,250
we'll be doing is adding a simple cube

01:42:33,219 --> 01:42:38,260
to the map something just like this this

01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:39,520
isn't really a geographic object or

01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:41,679
anything like this or just simply

01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:45,160
creating a 3d cube with the three jsapi

01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:52,110
s and then adding it to the map so what

01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:52,110
I'll do is copy this go to my index J s

01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:58,000
and this is all three J s code which I'm

01:42:56,320 --> 01:43:01,000
not exactly too familiar with but we'll

01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:03,040
be creating the geometry so size 100 on

01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:05,260
all the edges and then adding some

01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:07,719
material which will simply just be a

01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:10,719
pink color and then creating the cube

01:43:07,719 --> 01:43:12,640
with the geometry and material we're

01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:14,679
also doing a property called render

01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:16,810
order this is basically the Z and X

01:43:14,679 --> 01:43:18,820
where all the objects on the map just to

01:43:16,810 --> 01:43:27,340
make sure this shows up above buildings

01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:30,489
and roads and such next will be assigned

01:43:27,340 --> 01:43:32,770
in a Geo position and then we will be

01:43:30,489 --> 01:43:37,780
adding it to the map with map map

01:43:32,770 --> 01:43:39,550
anchors adds cube so the logic I want to

01:43:37,780 --> 01:43:43,270
set up is that wherever I click on the

01:43:39,550 --> 01:43:47,040
map I want to be able to add a cube so

01:43:43,270 --> 01:43:47,040
we'll be adding an event listener

01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:54,820
I just canvas start on click

01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:56,530
so basically when the map canvas is

01:43:54,820 --> 01:43:59,800
clicked we're gonna want to create this

01:43:56,530 --> 01:44:01,420
object and add it to the map so since

01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:02,740
I'm already zoomed out I'm pretty far

01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:04,360
because I was showing the whole world

01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:06,640
and we're gonna be creating a pretty

01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:08,980
small cube before I execute this code

01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:11,620
I'm gonna want to change my zoom level

01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:13,090
to something a little bit larger so we

01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:17,800
could actually see the cube so I'm gonna

01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:20,380
go back to maybe 16 or 17 I'll go and

01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:23,860
refresh my page I'm back to Singapore

01:44:20,380 --> 01:44:26,530
and now whenever I click we'll see a

01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:29,590
cube is popping up and it's a nice 3d

01:44:26,530 --> 01:44:33,010
cube basically the event listener is

01:44:29,590 --> 01:44:35,710
saying when clicked I want to view the

01:44:33,010 --> 01:44:37,270
coordinates of the click and I'm going

01:44:35,710 --> 01:44:39,310
to assign those coordinates to the cube

01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:45,130
position and then I'm gonna add it to

01:44:39,310 --> 01:44:47,020
the map server that you could honestly

01:44:45,130 --> 01:44:48,640
create like a game of checkers here if

01:44:47,020 --> 01:45:00,910
you wanted to by assigning the different

01:44:48,640 --> 01:45:03,100
colors on alternate clicks and such or

01:45:00,910 --> 01:45:06,490
you could also make massive cubes by

01:45:03,100 --> 01:45:13,800
changing the box geometry size let's

01:45:06,490 --> 01:45:17,560
increase it by 100 times you see if we

01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:20,760
clicked on it we basically crush the

01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:20,760
entire city on accident

01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:47,610
yes we have quite the ridiculous map

01:45:45,179 --> 01:45:51,119
going on here sealed water cubes

01:45:47,610 --> 01:45:55,800
everywhere railroad showing and still

01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:57,840
wireless hotspots as well as you see you

01:45:55,800 --> 01:46:00,320
could really go crazy with these maps if

01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:00,320
you want to

01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:44,880
all right so now that we added the cube

01:48:41,630 --> 01:48:47,580
the cubes a little boring get to MIT how

01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:48,990
about we add a dancing 3d man like this

01:48:47,580 --> 01:48:53,010
that's a little bit more exciting of a

01:48:48,990 --> 01:48:54,570
3d object huh so we created the previous

01:48:53,010 --> 01:48:56,940
cube just programmatically using the

01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:59,640
three jsap eyes but this time we're

01:48:56,940 --> 01:49:04,350
going to be importing an object into our

01:48:59,640 --> 01:49:08,220
map so if we go into the resources file

01:49:04,350 --> 01:49:13,250
of this repository well want to download

01:49:08,220 --> 01:49:16,830
this dancing FBX this is a 3d object

01:49:13,250 --> 01:49:23,430
so I'll click download and then I'll go

01:49:16,830 --> 01:49:27,440
ahead and move it into my project folder

01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:34,290
and I'm going to get rid of the

01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:35,790
parentheses one so before we proceed

01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:39,690
just make sure you've downloaded this

01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:46,980
dancing FBX 3d object into your project

01:49:39,690 --> 01:49:49,880
directory and it's available inside the

01:49:46,980 --> 01:49:49,880
resources folder

01:50:03,090 --> 01:50:07,240
so in order to add this to the map I'll

01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:11,050
go ahead and copy and paste the code

01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:14,410
added there we're going to be using a 3G

01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:15,520
is what it's called an FBX loader so

01:50:14,410 --> 01:50:16,990
this is basically making a network

01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:20,410
request to get this file

01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:24,240
dancing FBX and then basically parsing

01:50:20,410 --> 01:50:24,240
it so we could use it in our 3d scene

01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:31,510
we'll be doing some optimum actions like

01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:33,070
setting the render order so that it's

01:50:31,510 --> 01:50:36,460
high up on the map and it's not behind

01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:37,960
anything then also doing it's like

01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:39,940
setting the scale to make it as large as

01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:42,100
we want and then just set in a name to

01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:45,040
it so we can name it human but you can

01:50:42,100 --> 01:50:47,170
name it whatever you want and then also

01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:49,060
we're going to set the geo position so

01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:51,040
we're just going to set it somewhere in

01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:55,180
Singapore using the HAARP geo

01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:57,310
coordinates API and then finally we will

01:50:55,180 --> 01:51:00,700
do the same thing as we did before map

01:50:57,310 --> 01:51:02,860
map anchors got add object so this will

01:51:00,700 --> 01:51:04,600
add it to the map but because we have an

01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:09,330
animated object we also need to make an

01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:09,330
animate so add a little bit more code

01:51:10,950 --> 01:51:16,930
we'll be doing the same event listener

01:51:13,330 --> 01:51:17,920
as before for the map rotation actually

01:51:16,930 --> 01:51:20,200
no it's not the same one it's it's

01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:23,080
similar though map view event name start

01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:25,120
render and then basically if the object

01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:28,330
is loaded we're gonna want to set it to

01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:33,250
animate so once we pasted this code we

01:51:28,330 --> 01:51:34,930
can go back to our map and then we

01:51:33,250 --> 01:51:38,920
should have our dancing man somewhere

01:51:34,930 --> 01:51:40,360
here he is he's over in the water so

01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:45,040
here he is he's dancing right next to

01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:48,670
the Marina Bay Sands I'm actually gonna

01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:55,290
set my max pitch to something a little

01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:55,290
bit higher 90 so we get a better angle

01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:04,210
there he is so he's having fun dancing

01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:12,280
away he loves just comp so much that

01:52:04,210 --> 01:52:14,140
he's expressing his happiness so this is

01:52:12,280 --> 01:52:17,020
just an example object that we found on

01:52:14,140 --> 01:52:18,580
the three J s site you could really do

01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:20,290
this with any three J s object that you

01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:22,660
have so if you have some other fun

01:52:20,290 --> 01:52:24,340
dancing people or really something like

01:52:22,660 --> 01:52:25,960
a spaceship taking off you could easily

01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:28,260
add this to the map using the same code

01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:28,260
as before

01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:24,440
so any questions on the dancing person

01:53:21,719 --> 01:53:24,440
like help with

01:57:13,989 --> 01:57:19,219
all right everybody so we're almost done

01:57:16,579 --> 01:57:22,369
with the workshop that was second to

01:57:19,219 --> 01:57:24,110
last final activity so you guys have all

01:57:22,369 --> 01:57:25,760
made some pretty cool maps by now you've

01:57:24,110 --> 01:57:27,710
dancing people on them you have cubes

01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:30,230
all over the place where are those

01:57:27,710 --> 01:57:33,290
hotspots real roads and probably really

01:57:30,230 --> 01:57:34,790
strange watercolor just like mine so I'm

01:57:33,290 --> 01:57:37,940
encourage you to actually share these

01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:40,489
maps with us from the workshop so since

01:57:37,940 --> 01:57:43,429
we have the simple API your files are

01:57:40,489 --> 01:57:46,130
now usually just index.html index J yes

01:57:43,429 --> 01:57:47,659
any other dancing person your theme we

01:57:46,130 --> 01:57:50,360
recommend you guys create a new github

01:57:47,659 --> 01:57:51,860
repository and set up github pages so

01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:55,579
you could actually create a URL to your

01:57:51,860 --> 01:57:59,360
project then feel free to tweet at us we

01:57:55,579 --> 01:58:03,079
are at here dev and we'll be retweeting

01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:04,309
some of our favorite maps exactly a good

01:58:03,079 --> 01:58:05,869
way to be able to show your friends and

01:58:04,309 --> 01:58:08,540
family what you did at Jas comp you'd

01:58:05,869 --> 01:58:09,980
say hey I made this awesome 3d map with

01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:12,800
some really strange colors and dancing

01:58:09,980 --> 01:58:15,309
people on top definitely a good thing to

01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:15,309
show people

01:58:27,670 --> 01:58:32,690
so do you all know how to make a github

01:58:30,050 --> 01:58:38,620
pages website or should I go through

01:58:32,690 --> 01:58:41,360
that I think I'll go ahead and do that

01:58:38,620 --> 01:58:43,910
so to create a github pages account you

01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:46,660
could go to github.com and then go to

01:58:43,910 --> 01:58:52,430
your in the top right see little plus

01:58:46,660 --> 01:58:57,140
click new repository I'm gonna say I'm

01:58:52,430 --> 01:58:59,770
gonna title this my awesome map and the

01:58:57,140 --> 01:59:05,660
description would be made with aid

01:58:59,770 --> 01:59:08,780
during the RPL workshop click create a

01:59:05,660 --> 01:59:12,470
repository and I'm going to go back to

01:59:08,780 --> 01:59:14,570
my command line inside the directory my

01:59:12,470 --> 01:59:19,520
project is and I'm going to create a new

01:59:14,570 --> 01:59:22,400
git repository so git init and then I'm

01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:26,870
going to add everything in here so get

01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:35,060
add dot and then get commit - M first

01:59:26,870 --> 01:59:38,320
commit of my awesome map then I want to

01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:42,860
add the remotes of this github page

01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:55,250
repository and then push everything with

01:59:42,860 --> 01:59:56,900
git push origin master so if we give it

01:59:55,250 --> 01:59:59,840
a sec we'll see that all the files have

01:59:56,900 --> 02:00:02,330
popped up in here even my DS store that

01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:03,350
shouldn't be committed and then inside

02:00:02,330 --> 02:00:06,080
the Settings tab

02:00:03,350 --> 02:00:09,050
you could go scroll down until you see

02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:12,710
github pages and then you'll set the

02:00:09,050 --> 02:00:15,170
source to master branch that will save

02:00:12,710 --> 02:00:17,239
automatically and the page will take one

02:00:15,170 --> 02:00:19,850
or two minutes to build so we'll check

02:00:17,239 --> 02:00:22,970
back then and we'll see how the websites

02:00:19,850 --> 02:00:28,239
looking but the URL will be your github

username so - Dee Babs github yo and

02:00:28,239 --> 02:00:35,929
then the name of the repository so mine

02:00:31,610 --> 02:00:47,320
is called my - awesome - map

02:00:35,929 --> 02:00:51,530
oh and it's already built and we'll see

02:00:47,320 --> 02:00:53,469
the same map we had as before say I

02:00:51,530 --> 02:01:02,210
think we're just a little bit zoomed in

02:00:53,469 --> 02:01:03,469
we have some errors there there we go

02:01:02,210 --> 02:01:05,449
the map was just wasn't loaded on the

02:01:03,469 --> 02:01:08,840
first try and now we have a shareable

02:01:05,449 --> 02:01:11,030
link to the map we just built so you go

02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:18,920

02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:24,380
had fun and learned a lot about harp gl

02:01:22,280 --> 02:01:26,050
so far you've learned how to create a

02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:27,980
new harp chill application from scratch

02:01:26,050 --> 02:01:31,340

02:01:27,980 --> 02:01:33,560
theme add data to the map as well as

02:01:31,340 --> 02:01:35,420
style that data with data-driven styling

02:01:33,560 --> 02:01:40,070
and then you've also learned how to add

02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:42,230
3d objects to the map so if you have any

02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:44,780
