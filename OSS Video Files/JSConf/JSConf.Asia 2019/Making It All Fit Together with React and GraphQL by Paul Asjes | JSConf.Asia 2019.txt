Title: Making It All Fit Together with React and GraphQL by Paul Asjes | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-24
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	Many tools and processes go into modern front-end development: from component development to design and data fetching to testing and more. How does Stripe make these all work together? Join Paul Asjes from Stripeâ€™s engineering team for a talk on how to make all these components and processes work in a way that makes the modern front-end greater than the sum of its many parts.

Paul is a developer support engineer at Stripe by day and a sleepy one at night. He helps companies get set up with Stripe in a variety of languages, but JavaScript is his favourite. He's written a book on Slack bots and likes to spend time underwater when not running around Singapore eating all the things.
