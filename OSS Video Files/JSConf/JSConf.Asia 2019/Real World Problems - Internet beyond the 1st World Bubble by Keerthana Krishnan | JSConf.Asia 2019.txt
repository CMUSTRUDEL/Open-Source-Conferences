Title: Real World Problems - Internet beyond the 1st World Bubble by Keerthana Krishnan | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-21
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	The Internet of today originated as an experiment in the West. But as it expands to accommodate a larger user base in Asia, huge gaps are created between what the consumers want and what engineers build in a digital solution.
- How can we build websites for illiterate people?
- How can we improve the performance of our websites in spite of terrible infrastructure?
- How can we come together to make the best digital experience we can for the people who have only started embracing the internet recently?
Because they will be the users of tomorrow.

Keerthana is a software engineer living in the sunny town of Cochin, India where she works as a full stack web developer. She is passionate about building the best websites she can and made her conference stage debug at Node + JS Interactive 2018.
