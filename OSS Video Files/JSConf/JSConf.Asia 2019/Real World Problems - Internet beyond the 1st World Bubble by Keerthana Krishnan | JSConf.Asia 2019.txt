Title: Real World Problems - Internet beyond the 1st World Bubble by Keerthana Krishnan | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-21
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	The Internet of today originated as an experiment in the West. But as it expands to accommodate a larger user base in Asia, huge gaps are created between what the consumers want and what engineers build in a digital solution.
- How can we build websites for illiterate people?
- How can we improve the performance of our websites in spite of terrible infrastructure?
- How can we come together to make the best digital experience we can for the people who have only started embracing the internet recently?
Because they will be the users of tomorrow.

Keerthana is a software engineer living in the sunny town of Cochin, India where she works as a full stack web developer. She is passionate about building the best websites she can and made her conference stage debug at Node + JS Interactive 2018.

00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:21,029
hi Singapore thank you so I know it's

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,130
the evening I know you guys saw that at

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,380
4:30 the bar opens and I know you guys

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,260
are like ready like one more talk later

00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:30,720
that I will have that cocktail but I

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,239
hope you find this useful and I'm pretty

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,940
sure you will if you work on the web how

00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:40,050
many people here use the web give me a

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,010
show of hands right everybody does and

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,370
that's why we're here

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,370
because no matter what JavaScript PHP

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,980
Ruby whatever you use even if you use

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,829
like cobalt oh right right you everybody

00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,230
uses Internet and I'm gonna tell you a

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,420
little bit about me and I'll tell you

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,050
about my use case which might surprise

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,960
you

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:03,000
so I work for Baker Hughes now you see

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,280
GE over there and we'll be surprised

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,510
Baker uses the oil and gas division of

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,549
GE oil and gas so that that little

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,729
gasoline that you put into your Waker

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,380
right it's extracted from the earth and

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,530
do you know what I do on a day-to-day

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,350
basis I write code to make sure that oil

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:24,659
is extracted from the earth efficiently

00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,689
now you might be terrified to think oh

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,780
 javascript controls oil extraction

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,329
don't worry it does not it only manages

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,310
the visualization of data we made sure

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:39,060
you know we have quality control come on

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:42,840
people so but my point is the web is

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,000
everywhere think of any use case any

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,189
single part of your life

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,979
the web is there and somebody has a

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:53,430
website about it somewhere right so

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:56,340
let's talk about our users where do your

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:58,290
users come from so if you use the

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,299
Internet and I'm hoping everybody here

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,000
has some part in creating the Internet

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,770
you write it or you create content on

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,840
the internet because you want people to

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:12,450
consume it right am i right yes

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,830
so if you want users to consume it where

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,710
your users come from

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,140
so I was breaking it down and these are

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:22,290
the three highest users around the world

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,660
and now we are China and I tried to find

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:27,030
statistics but none of that is valid

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,640
because of reason so I'm gonna skip that

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,590
and I'm gonna focus on India where I'm

00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,660
from where I get access to easier

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,870
statistics and I'm gonna compare that

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:38,910
with the next largest country per users

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,900
which is the USA and I'm going to show

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:46,110
you a gap right so in India we have 1300

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,680
million that's 1.3 billion people and

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,390
out of that only 45% of India is

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,920
connected to the Internet

00:02:51,390 --> 00:03:00,590
right so 45% of 1.3 billion people is

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,880
nearly 627 million users and that's

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,670
considering the people who use internet

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:09,090
right now let's say look at the USA the

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:11,790
USA has almost 85% connected oh I think

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:16,650
the mic started working only now my bad

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:18,660
and so by the initial the start of how

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:22,380
many users are there we start to see the

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,630
gap now this is just a rough draft of

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,760
how many the percentage of Internet

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,830
penetration so when we say Internet

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,989
penetration that's like how many people

00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,390
use the internet frequently enough to

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,850
make a dent on the user percentages and

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,860
you can see the the places with the

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:40,950
largest number of people when they come

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,500
to South Asia or southern Africa right

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,459
that's the places with the lowest

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,950
penetration of Internet

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,570
and let me say lower penetration the

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,870
Internet is not going away

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:54,480
that means the lower that number is the

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,030
higher is the opportunity for you and

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,400
your product to go into those markets

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,100
right so if you see that's the

00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,690
opportunity of people who are I've never

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,820
used the internet before and have an

00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:08,700
idea or an interest in using the

00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,739
Internet that's where in the future your

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,959
product will be used so how can we make

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,620
products that are targeted to those

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,720
people right and you see the higher

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,640
demographic so you see Canada at 87%

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,370
that means a lot of people have seen

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,750
what the Internet is like right if they

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,400
have any idea of the Internet and

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,320
they're happy with the tools that they

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,720
already use

00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,830
but the products they already use what

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,020
is the chance that they lose your

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,300
product unless yours is a very

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,790
well-established product right so you

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:42,920
have competition which is more available

00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:44,810
so let's look at these markets so the

00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,340
market saturation of technical products

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,140
and this is what I was talking about in

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,210
the first world and when I say the first

00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,970
world I want you to think of places like

00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,860
Silicon Valley right that's where the

00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,540
first Google came out of the first

00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,880
Facebook came out of you know that's

00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:01,670
where you think that technology started

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,890
from there right and when you come to

00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,110
India or when you come to South Asia

00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,420
right Facebook started in the Silicon

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,450
Valley and now the highest user base

00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:14,450
oopsy-daisy don't mind me

00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:17,440
the largest user base is now India so I

00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:22,460
read a very interesting statistic that

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:26,900
Facebook right now has in 2016 I believe

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:31,160
it had about 200 million users in the US

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:35,600
and India overtook it in 2016 with 400

00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,730
million and that was still only when

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,040
there was 35 percent of India

00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,800
connected to the Internet imagine what

00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,840
that number would be like if 70 percent

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,670
of India connected you know can you

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,560
imagine that amount of data that

00:05:46,670 --> 00:06:00,800
Facebook can collect because that's what

00:05:48,560 --> 00:06:03,620
Facebook is thinking about I think so my

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,750
goal is to help you think about the

00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,780
larger picture you know to find out a

00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,370
great balance in between performance

00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:12,260
accessibility and user experience the

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,020
big three when it comes to how a person

00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,420
decides to use your product now first

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:21,830
come will be performance but I'll show

00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:24,020
you how performance can actually be it

00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,610
actually can be helped with

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,470
accessibility and user experience you

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,590
don't have to compromise between the

00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,720
three so the first and the easiest

00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,550
barrier sometimes I feel is

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,580
internationalization and I'd like to

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,800
bring an example where I checked and I

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,969
can't really find that example here but

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,689
a very

00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:46,879
an example internationally this is a

00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:49,399
very common company right

00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,409
uber is dominant across the world and

00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,149
you would think that uber would care a

00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:55,759
little bit more about one of their

00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:58,279
largest consumer bases because the last

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,349
time I checked we were still there is

00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:03,110
local grown competition against uber but

00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:06,379
India is one of the largest markets for

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:10,039
uber now can you tell me if something

00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:12,099
looks wrong in this picture and I and I

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:14,449
highlighted it for your ease

00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:17,119
unfortunately my my laser pointer was

00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:18,919
not working so what I'd like to point

00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:22,099
out over here is that if you see

00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:23,779
Lithuania right and I'm not dumping on

00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:26,389
the thwe near here but I think India is

00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:28,969
slightly larger number of people and a

00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:32,749
lot more languages are supported in

00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:36,079
Lithuania than in India or in countries

00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:38,449
in in southern Africa which is not good

00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,249
you know those are large countries with

00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:42,949
a diverse population with a lot of

00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:47,149
people who don't speak English right so

00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:49,879
you want those companies who have large

00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:51,829
user groups in those areas to cater to

00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:55,009
communities in their own language

00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:57,979
imagine you're somebody who's not

00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:59,360
technically abled in your family in my

00:07:57,979 --> 00:08:02,119
case that's my grandfather

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,059
you know the first time my grandfather

00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:07,489
heard about uber he's like what is this

00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:09,919
mover why should I trust some guy to

00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:12,649
pick me up because he has never seen the

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,379
internet before you know so when when my

00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:17,239
brother went to a different city and he

00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:18,979
my grandfather wanted to go there

00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:21,169
I'm sure you've all heard of Bangalore

00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:22,999
so / is very strong in Bangalore my

00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:25,099
grandfather wanted to go visit my

00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:28,129
brother in Bangalore and my brother said

00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:30,439
it's very easy you just opened a bird

00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:33,110
and then you can you'll be dropped right

00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:34,939
in front of my apartment and what do you

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,250
know my grandfather could not figure out

00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:39,110
over in the end he just waited in the

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,089
airport for to us and my brother had to

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,849
make the trip and if you know Bangalore

00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:45,829
traffic you know he hated that truth so

00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:50,740
if we were had worked they would have

00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:53,809
got to market this is my key point so

00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,680
for non-native speakers for non-native

00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:56,839
English speaker

00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,020
because if you have a larger market or

00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,270
if you have users you know who if you

00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:05,390
can change a slight tweak in your

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,310
product can help users I don't know why

00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:09,770
it's not done so far but this is this

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:12,770
the latest statistic I took maybe three

00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:15,830
months back from the uber blog so

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:20,270
enabling native languages it is very

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:21,830
important to improve access and it's not

00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:24,230
just there are other parts of

00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,839
accessibility of course but for having

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,339
the languages is a different kind of

00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,380
accessibility that maybe you don't think

00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:32,630
about as much and when it comes to Asia

00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,000
we know there are different languages at

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,190
play and different people at play so I

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,920
feel like internationalization is just a

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,480
very easy barrier that you can cross to

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,820
make your products that much more

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:49,580
interesting for your users and this is

00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,950
just adding it if you're curious about

00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,020
how internationalization work it's very

00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:57,200
easy you can just add the language code

00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,420
and most of the time if you have those

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,770
characters in Unicode if they should

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,150
work and there might be cases where in

00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:07,160
specific where a particular language

00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,959
does not work that's outside of the

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,790
scope of my talk it's just this is just

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,830
a starting point for you if you are

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:18,110
interested in this so the next story is

00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:21,140
is where I really want to focus on going

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:23,690
beyond an iPhone or handling real world

00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,550
devices now I'm hoping this crowd will

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:27,830
be a bit different but I'm going to ask

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,570
how many people here does not have an

00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:36,260
iPhone you know your phone is not an

00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:38,390
iPhone nice nice so I did a version of

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,950
this talk in the USA and I was very

00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,140
disappointed there were maybe two hands

00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,029
because everybody else had an iPhone but

00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:48,950
moving to India you know this is not the

00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:50,810
case you know a at least the people in

00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,730
and around Asia would know that the

00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:55,310
Chinese manufacturing companies have

00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,589
pretty much a great market over here you

00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,750
know if you have a price range and in

00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:02,089
India we're kind of price conscious if

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,339
you heard about us and if you can get

00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:06,320
all the features of an iPhone one-tenth

00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:08,579
the price of an iPhone from a Chinese

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,110
company like away you're gonna get

00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,670
you are a phone and we are going to put

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,470
a sticker on top that has an Apple logo

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:17,189
in it and claim it's knife one that's

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:20,249
how we do it honestly I've seen that so

00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:24,420
many times so three little devices now

00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:27,179
this is just the phones in my family so

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:31,199
if my phone is not listed because I used

00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:34,199
my phone to take a photograph but but I

00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:36,179
own and oneplus which is again a Chinese

00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:38,999
manufactured company my mother

00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:41,369
she is a proud owner of an iPhone my

00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:44,699
grandfather could not care less like he

00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:46,889
was he was he has the second phone which

00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:48,839
is a touchscreen simply because he

00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:50,220
thought touchscreen was in but he

00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,689
figured out that he could not handle

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,899
that screen and he went back to his old

00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:56,489
phone anyway and my father again he

00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,019
could not care less about his phone so

00:11:56,489 --> 00:12:02,220
that so long as it works

00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:04,920
you know the calling bug so basically

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,079
when you when you have the such kind of

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,170
devices and more and more people are

00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:12,089
moving to a sort of standardization when

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,639
it comes to such devices you know there

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:18,389
are more people moving to an iPhone but

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,639
that the quantity of people or the

00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:25,019
market of an iPhone is still very very

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:29,189
very small in Asia so but if you've ever

00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:32,040
seen the kind of checks for the sizes of

00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:33,959
screens that comes up right mostly there

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,629
is like a standard list which has a

00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:39,929
bunch of Apple devices and maybe if

00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:42,959
you're lucky a few Nexus or Google

00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:46,799
pixels are supported but a long list of

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:50,429
other popular devices are not in the

00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:53,040
list so you can create a kind of

00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:54,869
experience on mobile but maybe it's not

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,389
supported for the device which is one of

00:12:54,869 --> 00:13:01,949
the most frequent ones and I think

00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:03,959
Xiaomi has one of the largest selling

00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:06,149
phones was the company that sells the

00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:09,779
most phones in India and I've never seen

00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:10,439
a Xiaomi aspect ratio ever in Google

00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:13,199
Chrome

00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:15,509
in Google Chrome and you check how much

00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:19,139
your screen can be adjusted so that is a

00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:21,149
big part and if you have you know if you

00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,140
are creating a product to be used in

00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:24,030
phones

00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,700
have to stress this enough you know

00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:29,550
hardware is created on equal you know

00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:32,550
forget the screen sizes you can also

00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:35,460
have really bad RAM you know you have

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:37,620
really bad expectations of what a device

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,440
can do you know how much speed in which

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:44,760
your device can load how much the size

00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,740
the width and all that is is so hardware

00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:51,030
in general if you only gonna create it

00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:53,460
for a few specific devices that again

00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,350
creates a block for your uses you know

00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,960
please don't do that please think of at

00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,370
least the top five devices in the market

00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:03,060
that you're going into which are being

00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,410
sold and just test for them okay and the

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,390
best thing that you can do is to get a

00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,310
bunch of bang up phones you know with

00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:10,770
the screen cracked I'm sure a few of you

00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:13,080
here have few screen cracked phones you

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:15,750
know check with those check and see how

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,770
well your website does in those and see

00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,750
what are the results

00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:21,540
you know performance wise and

00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:28,170
accessibility wise check with unequal

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:29,490
devices yeah so if you have seen the

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,150
previous slide you've seen what my

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:35,010
grandfather's phone looks like now my

00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,510
grandfather he owns a bunch of property

00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:39,000
because he's the head of the household

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,470
and very very recently one of his

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,450
friends told him about this website

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:48,840
called Airbnb yeah and he wanted me to

00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:52,380
load Airbnb in that second phone that

00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:54,900
was a task yeah I I thought I could do

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,450
it but I found out I couldn't sir and

00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:00,630
you would think that a company has well

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:02,670
established a unicorn like a B&B would

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,530
care a little bit more and I tried to

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,780
take a photo of that but it came up

00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,190
really bad and I did not want to scar

00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,100
your eyes with that that's why I did not

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:13,290
put that photo to it but let me tell you

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:17,250
it's just it's so surprising the way

00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:19,680
things turn out you know so if you are

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:21,450
creating a product for mobile just check

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,960
it for the mobiles that are very popular

00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:27,180
you know your your average best-selling

00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,340
Xiaomi and oppa phones should be enough

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,760
they would do the trick but go the extra

00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:35,430
mile right and

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:39,090
one more thing is I'd like to talk about

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:41,370
using JavaScript frameworks now all of

00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:44,430
us know some cool JavaScript framework

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:46,110
or the other I'm pretty sure a lot of

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,870
you know about a JavaScript framework

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,430
that I've never heard of before I've

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:52,680
recently heard is roguelike there are

00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:55,350
some JavaScript frameworks that last

00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:59,340
less than a milk product it's probably

00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,990
true so if you have a latest and the

00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,060
greatest JavaScript framework that you

00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,400
have to try out I again would like you

00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,380
to go to the same rule build your

00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,660
website in that JavaScript framework and

00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,480
then see how much time it takes to load

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,580
on a crappy phone maybe it works well on

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,520
an iPhone but please do not let the

00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:19,470
iPhone be your benchmark please run it

00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,890
on something with less than 2 GB of RAM

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:25,320
and see how well your mobile website

00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:27,840
performs on that phone because the

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,600
majority of users who use the Internet

00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,970
are coming in from mobile this is

00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:36,300
especially true if you run a website

00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:39,390
that has video in it now from my

00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,280
understanding and my research most users

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,140
who connect through mobile internet

00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,300
especially in local languages

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,330
non-english languages they try to access

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:51,810
video so if you have a video loading

00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:55,770
element try to make it as performant as

00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:58,320
possible for the lower ram mobile phones

00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:00,600
because that is where your demographic

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,640
is what would your demographic is trying

00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,949
to access that's what they want the most

00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:07,980
speed for and that is where you're

00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:09,949
letting them down solo now if you have

00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,980
great performance on mobile for video

00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:16,170
excellent and I'm at the risk of

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:17,910
violating the code of conduct I tell you

00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:20,220
a model that you should definitely be

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:22,579
following that spawn hub if you have

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,949
ever tried to use that in mobile in

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,209
Indians mobile data you would know what

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:28,290
I am talking about and some people are

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,440
laughing because I know you have tried

00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:34,560
it you know because if you have ever

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,600
used that mobile website they know who

00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:39,660
their audience is and that's a very

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,260
performant website on a really crappy 2g

00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,260
data you should

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,720
and that leads into oh no the Wi-Fi the

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:53,890
third story that I would like to tell

00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:58,630
you so if the definition of Wi-Fi in

00:17:53,890 --> 00:18:00,790
India is 10 Mbps to 30 300 Mbps that's

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:05,050
the actual so you see that this slightly

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:07,420
a bit of a variation and this I actually

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,130
I was surprised that there was three in

00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:12,570
my mind I thought book that would be one

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:16,030
but surprisingly it's three so I

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:18,460
instinctively I knew that no matter what

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:21,730
the definition for Wi-Fi was was still

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,100
pretty bad and you think about it we

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:26,470
have 1.3 billion people crammed into one

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,809
small location on the map you know so

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:31,000
definitely if you have Wi-Fi connection

00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:32,650
your family is taking it your neighbors

00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,390
are probably taking it and then the

00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:36,850
neighbors below you are also taking it

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,290
so that's the reason why it's so slow

00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:42,370
because so many people are trying to

00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:45,190
access your 13.5 Mbps connection that's

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,980
the fact now add this with the previous

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,990
point about how again the phones are

00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,780
small they don't have RAM and they can't

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,880
use your website now you realize why

00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,980
your website performance is so important

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,980
you know because that's the kind of

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,850
scenario you are in so not only is the

00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:05,650
device playing against you but

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:08,290
infrastructure in general right the

00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:10,870
amount of network poles around your

00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:13,929
location the amount of bandwidth

00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:15,880
available for your users to use because

00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:18,850
at the end of the day if your website

00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:22,030
does not load you know then it's not

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:26,740
good now I've not already included it

00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:27,850
here but I do have a very and I did not

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:31,150
include it here because I don't want

00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:35,590
Microsoft suing me but if you ever try

00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:37,660
to load LinkedIn in India in 2g you

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,220
should try it it's an experience where

00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,020
after 30 seconds you give up and you're

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,800
like I don't need a resume I don't need

00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,500
a job anymore

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:49,179
I'm not opening LinkedIn that's that's

00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:54,130
what happens so so how does your website

00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:55,809
perform in 3g 2g or in those h+ i don't

00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:58,160
know if anybody here has gotten an h+

00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:00,350
ever i get it time to time

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,299
these days less frequently thankfully

00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,640
I'm from a part of India that's blessed

00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:06,500
with more network connections but the

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,710
more you go to a rural area you're going

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:12,260
to see your s + and - geez so how does

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:16,549
your website perform in those lower

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:19,039
bandwidth so again if you use one of the

00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:21,110
major browsers there's probably a

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,850
network throttling option for you to

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,370
check this I'm sure most of you do this

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:27,500
but I advise you to do that again

00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:30,890
you know just cover your bases and make

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,799
sure that your product has a fallback so

00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,120
uber which I mentioned earlier even

00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,400
though the internationalisation is

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,950
pretty bad they have a an app called

00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,780
uber light in India and that actually

00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,480
works what they did is they took out the

00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,490
map which actually choked down most of

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,110
the data in over so you can't see the

00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:52,039
map where the little car goes around

00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:55,730
Hulu you know you have to guess whether

00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:59,690
car is divine it oh it's probably there

00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:02,450
but it works you know it actually loads

00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,760
in real time so what if the map does not

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:07,520
exist you know whoever works that's good

00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:13,429
at h+ that's pretty good

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:16,039
you know so so test your website on

00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:17,690
crappy phones with slow speeds if you if

00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:20,870
you forget everything else from this

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,909
talk this is the most important sentence

00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:25,940
for you today please test your website

00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:27,679
on really crappy phones with really slow

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,780
speeds that's the only thing you have to

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:33,350
do to make sure that your product works

00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:35,090
in Asia you know if that happens then

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:39,190
your product at least from a technical

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,190
standpoint you have covered your grounds

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:46,419
so how can I simplify my website now I

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,620
know what the problem is how do I fix it

00:21:46,419 --> 00:21:49,760
minimum number of downloads on the first

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,610
click now this is basic performance

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,309
stuff you know the amount of libraries

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:57,620
videos images all that you download in

00:21:55,309 --> 00:22:01,130
the first click that is a huge drag on

00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:04,100
what the first paint or the what user

00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:06,919
sees first so if you can minimize the

00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,110
number of downloads excellent if you

00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:11,570
know that click is coming up and you can

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:15,019
preload parts of it again excellent

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:17,479
the biggest garbage of video that comes

00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:20,509
in you know what chokes in your data the

00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:23,690
most in any website or in any

00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:26,269
application is video if you can optimize

00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,580
your video and images you know it's

00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:32,840
nothing like it it's the best way to

00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:34,909
make your product faster now if I don't

00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,619
know if somebody has covered SVG again

00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:39,200
over here but I'm pretty sure there's a

00:22:36,619 --> 00:22:41,570
great talk by una Kravitz and the last

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,729
J's conversation about SVG which I

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:46,159
suggest everybody check out because if

00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:49,039
you can use SVG's instead of your images

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:54,289
again a great part in optimizing your

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:56,749
websites and a little bit more about

00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:58,759
user experience because I feel that's

00:22:56,749 --> 00:23:01,159
one of the most important parts you know

00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:03,349
at the end of the day no matter how well

00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:05,330
built your product is you know how much

00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:07,460
the engineering team likes it if your

00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,320
user does not like your product and what

00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,320
good is it you know at the end of the

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,840
day the product comes as what the user

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,149
likes it to be know how well we build it

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,639
is based on what marketing tells us that

00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:22,279
what the users like right so let's make

00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:25,789
marketing happy with a little bit bonus

00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:28,460
point so this is something I like to add

00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:30,830
and this is something of some from my

00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,690
personal experience like I said my

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,849
grandfather was very adventurous and it

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:37,879
comes technology and this happened the

00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:40,070
first time that he opened up his gmail

00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:41,690
account now he was very worried that he

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,590
would not understand what Gmail is and

00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,570
how to navigate it

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:46,519
but thankfully the gods of Google have

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,590
decided that a lot of people don't know

00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:51,489
what Gmail is so they have a little bit

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:54,109
of a demo happening and there are a few

00:23:51,489 --> 00:23:56,179
great applications which has this kind

00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:58,820
of a demo feature and I really like it

00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:00,830
and I'd like to stress that if you're

00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:03,229
creating a product for the Asian market

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,840
you know for people who have never used

00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:08,779
the internet before the demo is a pretty

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,419
good way to go you know because if you

00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:14,809
are looking for an a group of people who

00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:18,229
have never seen the Internet right so

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:20,210
imagine this there are people who'd see

00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:22,220
the Save button we've never seen a

00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,679
floppy disk before and they and they

00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,040
identify a floppy disk as oh this is the

00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:26,960
3d

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,270
another image of a save button you know

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,100
it's pretty much the same thing for for

00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:34,310
our elders when they see the Internet

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,990
right so they have no reference point to

00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:38,120
this they've never seen anything like

00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:40,370
the internet before so when they see a

00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,080
hamburger button for the first time for

00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,910
example they don't know what to do with

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,250
it they don't know that just clicking it

00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,590
would open up the menu right so if you

00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:51,530
have a like a a small arrow pointing to

00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:54,710
it telling you hey click this it opens

00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:58,220
up the menu that's good for you users so

00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:00,590
based on what the target demographic is

00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,450
I would suggest that you at least have

00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:04,490
at least from the first load or the

00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,500
first time a user signs in you have like

00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,960
a little demo mode showing them what

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:17,090
each of the things does and that really

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:20,660
helps and it helps to explain the major

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:22,880
moving parts of and one more thing I'd

00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,520
like to add probably again a bonus point

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,500
is that there are people at least in

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,930
India where I come from there are people

00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,400
who are illiterate right so they're

00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,080
people even if you write it in their

00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:37,240
native language they're not good at

00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:41,060
reading right so if you can have icons

00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:43,010
explain sorry if you can have icons or

00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:45,680
some kind of drawings that explain what

00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:48,050
it does without having to read it now

00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,400
text is important in some cases but

00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,620
having a good eye can makes its

00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,440
difference too so I'd like to stress

00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,570
that having that a little bit of a bonus

00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,220
user experience wise showing people

00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,690
where things are done it really helps

00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:03,430
for the older generation or people who

00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,430
are just not used to technology

00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:10,640
so in summary or yes only five more

00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:12,170
minutes left so in summary what are the

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,350
things that you have to do to make your

00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:17,120
websites better for a new user group is

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,640
nationalisation of your website which

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,550
means supporting different languages

00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:24,950
maybe the major languages of any market

00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:27,610
or any demographic that you hoping to

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,960
attract optimize it for like

00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:32,360
non-standard aspect non-standard

00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,820
aspect ratios I'd like to stress upon

00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,830
that eloquently in the resid test your

00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,240
website on crappy phones with slow

00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:42,290
speeds that's

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,940
and for slow speeds have fallbacks when

00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:46,250
you have slow internet make sure your

00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:49,130
app does something instead of breaking

00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:51,800
into a small broken image you know I

00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:54,380
could and that's it

00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,150
that is me on the interwebs you can

00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:58,130
probably find me somewhere around for

00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:02,140
the next two days and I hope this has

00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:02,140
