Title: Practical NuxtJS - JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-07-05
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Aaron Gong @aaronghj

This workshop will show participants how to build applications using NuxtJS (A VueJS Framework), based on real-world experience in shipping products from scratch. In the process, we will also look at various means of building performant websites.
Within the 3 hours (remaining 0.5 hours will be for Q and A, as well as helping slower paced participants), we will cover the following:
- SPA, SSR and Static Websites, which one to use.
- Building for performance, code splitting, tree shaking, lazy-loaded resources
- Important points on NuxtJS such as architecture, configuration, SSR features & lifecycle, etc.
- Creating your first NuxtJS project and explanation on options available
- What are plugins, modules and which one to use
- Sign In Page & Crud Page
- Hands-on learning Of VueJS and NuxtJS concepts
- there will be a local backend API with authentication to test things out).
- Gotchas & Edge Cases
- Coding problems that can occur in SSR
- How to get dynamic Vuex store to work
- Deployment as SPA, SSR, Static Website
- Q&A Session

Requirements:
Bring a laptop. Please have the following software installed before attending, we will not have time to troubleshoot installation issues
- NodeJS version 10 and above, NPM
- Git
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

Aaron is a Consultant with Zenika. Ever since his first VueJS experience in an opensource project (vue-crud-x). He has decided to work exclusively with VueJS and web components to ship products. He co-organises VueJS meetups to share experiences and help others. He feels that one should know fundamentals before frameworks.

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:23,240
trading platform travel industry and yes

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:26,910
I organized a few Jess meet up and also

00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:29,880
co-organized the react.js meet up I like

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:34,140
to try other frameworks also to convince

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:38,420
myself that view GSS nice yes okay so no

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:41,489
thanks and my teaching assistant is a

00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:44,610
budget okay he's actually my colleague

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:48,870
he loves UGS also but also everyday he

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,870
works on react by day yes so he builds

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,739
web components for internal apps he

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,710
trains gives night classes in a company

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,829
I work with Seneca key we also have some

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,890
help us from the view GS meetup group

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,060
Schilling and Eugene over there yes so

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,090
if you have any help just raise your

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,189

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,299
okay so if you are stuck please please

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,299
raise your hands please

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:18,630
okay you wanna have to move on okay next

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,119
slide okay so the workshop goal we do

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,040
not have any agenda okay we just want to

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,860
meet hopefully these are your

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,740
expectations which is to speed up your

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,229
learning about next yes okay if you know

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:32,250
some view or react is good if you don't

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,409
how you can ask around

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,520
okay boss I think and most of your here

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:42,030
no view or yeah yes okay hopefully

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,899
there's some real world ready framework

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,030
and tasks that will perform here okay

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,130
yes so there's some unique content is

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,399
known in Google yep so you can write it

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,890
later

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,700
yeah so you can share this after that

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,350
it's okay it's fine

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,719
okay hopefully that's something you into

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,869
next okay pair programming or is welcome

00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,570
yeah

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:07,170
and then the materials available yeah so

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,539
later will flash it up again okay so a

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,599
quick one what is not GS so it's

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,740
basically a framework for building view

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,030
GS applique

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:21,780
if you know what this next Jas is for

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:26,190
for react Nux GS is basically the

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:29,250
similar so a framework yes so what is

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:32,220
this framework I'll explain further on

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:36,750
after that okay thank you welcome yeah

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:40,350
okay so why view GS okay so a few things

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:44,160
that that we want to just show us

00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:48,390
okay react so we have three very popular

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,760
frameworks yeah it's a built by somebody

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,990
from Facebook so it's obviously

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,780
influenced by this thing called xhp

00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:59,580
which is some XAML component framework

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,920
for PHP which I don't know exactly what

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,990
is this but you can go and look at the

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,670
Wikipedia on it yeah so problems with it

00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,930
that we found when working with react

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,700
where I found when working with react

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,130
and a few others is like for the

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,870
higher-order components when you have a

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,300
lots of it

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,520
it's like back to the object-oriented

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,140
programming where you need to debug and

00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,930
it's very difficult to find out where

00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,970
things are okay next

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:31,980
okay angularjs many breaking changes

00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:33,330
okay next yeah yeah oh yeah one more

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,250
thing the RX GS actually is very

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:39,030
fantastic thing but they use it

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:42,300
everywhere so it's not really good

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:46,230
because this is a very good tool but

00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:50,550
just too good yeah okay

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:54,150
so view GS okay what's so good about all

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:56,100
right firstly it's a it's supposed to be

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,250
faster and smaller than the other tool

00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,770
and the is the most standards-compliant

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,210
of all the tree like if you go into web

00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,240
components you see this thing called

00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:08,100
slots and all these things you when you

00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,360
go to view GS and you see the slots

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,510
things they are very very closely

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,960
related yeah you can do a lot other

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,250
things also like the CSS the transition

00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:21,930
so these things are all pretty

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:25,770
straightforward in view yes yes okay so

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:27,570
but whether you use view angular react

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:31,230
or even am

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:35,760
smell of vanilla yes you need to know

00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:38,310
about these four things single page

00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,310
application server side rendering study

00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:45,780
sites and progressive web apps okay

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,500
so anybody who does not know these

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,900
sportings

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,610
oh no right yes okay so the a

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:57,960
progressive web app is something by

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,580
Google where you actually the word

00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:03,740
progressive means you slowly slowly

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:07,710
improve on the website so you like in

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:12,420
some sort of where you can load up all

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:16,320
the assets yes all the SS and that's

00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,390
yeah that's the caching strategies yeah

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,880
yeah the manifest files to load up all

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,430
the assets the caching strategies and

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:29,100
also the intersecting the fetch so that

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:32,460
you can sort of like Bill app on the

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:36,330
phone that can work in offline mode and

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:38,610
yeah and that's what the in shortener

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:40,140
progressive web about okay so maybe I'll

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,740
just explain a bit more further on this

00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:46,200
tree so single page applications is what

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:52,530
you usually build it's a 1 HT m fo and

00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:54,540
very big JavaScript inside server-side

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:57,780
okay so this one would take a long time

00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,100
to load if it's a very big move for the

00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,940
bigger application the longer time to

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:05,160
load for server-side rendering basically

00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,640
the server is the one that pushes out

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,950
the web page so the house actually

00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:14,910
smaller when you surf and you serve them

00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:17,280
Hey okay ah yeah so just Wi-Fi password

00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,330
this year download this repo okay I'm

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,430
just getting started

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:25,560
okay so server-side rendering is is

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,860
rendering the pages bit by bit

00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:33,330
anybody use server-side rendering okay

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:34,650
good so yeah then yeah so probably

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,720
you'll be a refresher when I go through

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,430
because a server-side rendering there's

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,710
a lot of things to take care of whether

00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,249
you are rendering on a server or on the

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,659
client

00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,969
and you can get into trouble if you

00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:47,579
don't understand the thing we'll explain

00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:49,829
later can then the last one is static

00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:52,559
sites static sites are like you're all

00:06:49,829 --> 00:06:56,789
old days where you have many HTML files

00:06:52,559 --> 00:07:00,269
many JavaScript files yes okay next

00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:02,369
let's move quickly okay so it's our

00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:06,109
application framework next what max is

00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:08,689
okay so for next GS that's basically

00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:10,829
less boilerplate code to write

00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:13,860
everything's organized for you like you

00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:16,699
don't have to to write the routers out

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:21,029
for all your routes

00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:23,459
thus storage the sorry just the v8 store

00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:26,729
is so-so the abstracted it out so you

00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:29,159
just put in each file for each of the of

00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:32,819
each of the view ex-mo juice I think the

00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:36,929
Sangamon let's go to the next one okay

00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:39,869
yeah you can easily create the different

00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:43,019
type of websites that spin earliest SPSS

00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:47,489
R and static sites okay so what's the

00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:49,559
difference between SSR and the static

00:07:47,489 --> 00:07:52,249
websites which is using nuts generate to

00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:55,529
generate it so this is quite important

00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:57,569
so SS re are basically less serving up

00:07:55,529 --> 00:08:00,899
pages one by one like PHP like I

00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:02,849
explained earlier okay it has access to

00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:04,309
things like your request header info

00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:08,129
because it's going through the server

00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:10,649
yes then for next January basically they

00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:14,129
pre generate everything so you generate

00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:16,169
all the HTML files okay and then after

00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:19,589
that everything is busy you load the

00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:22,589
photo browser and you work from there so

00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:24,199
I think the best thing to do now is to

00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:30,289
show you the table of what is happening

00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:30,289
which is the best part gets screwed up

00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:34,550
as a table next right

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:42,240
your computer can see oh okay oh okay

00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:50,730
ah okay okay sorry for the technical

00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:55,360
difficulties very quick we'll fix it

00:08:50,730 --> 00:09:03,820
yeah I'll leave it there okay okay

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:11,490
next slide oh this one are you know yeah

00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:14,800
okay next slide okay okay so this is the

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:18,540
comparison for all these three okay so

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:23,320
for such engine optimization SP a is

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:27,250
poor because you see very little

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,980
information on the pitch it's all being

00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:32,530
rendered by the JavaScript okay for

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,510
server-side render it is good because

00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,130
you render the information and any push

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,860
it up and then the search engine

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,560
actually can pick up those things static

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,290
websites execute exactly the same how

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,900
about a time to first paint okay so for

00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:50,920
SPS because you have to load the bigger

00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:53,800
application again the slower it is so

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,400
but for SSR instead it's sizes up is

00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:00,100
faster definitely deployment very easy

00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,350
for single page applications just you

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,800
can serve it from the s3 or from Netley

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,630
fire or Google okay by the way if

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,790
anybody needs help to set up or anything

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,250
just raise your hands the assistants are

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:16,530
sitting behind it okay with the green

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:18,940
color kick behind the shirt okay

00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,070
deployment for SSR is a bit more

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,840
involved because you need the server to

00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,270
serve the things so if you need to scale

00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:28,380
up we need to scale up the server's but

00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:35,620
for static sites is again similar to the

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:36,610
SPS so four point seems fifth point

00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,030
dynamic routes

00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:42,310
okay so SPS and SS are basically they

00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,440
serve up the dynamic routes but on a

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:47,620
static sites because you generate the

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,000
pages so if let's say one of the pages

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,970
is not Wow

00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,149
you will get a not found error and what

00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:57,310
happens is that if we like website

00:10:55,149 --> 00:11:00,360
property guru where there's a slash and

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,680
then there's a property name and I'm

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,120
thousands of properties in Singapore you

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:07,209
cannot be generating a page for every

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:10,480
single one of them so in this case you

00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:13,360
will get a 404 for the static size

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,709
unless you generate those things but

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,000
there'll be a way to handle this and

00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:21,100
I'll show you how to do it in this

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:25,149
workshop yes then next is the DEF

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,560
complexity okay SP a and static sites

00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:28,750
because it's all happening in a browser

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,819
so you don't have to worry all the

00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,639
things that work in a browser like the

00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:35,889
windows event listener you will all be

00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,079
okay but for SSR you really need to be

00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:41,110
careful because if you render on the

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,089
server side and you call some thing that

00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:47,110
is in the browser like window dot event

00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:49,269
listener is bye-bye yeah you see the

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:52,689
error page yeah

00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:57,730
500 error it should be a fun error then

00:11:52,689 --> 00:12:02,730
uh last one a pwe okay so I both of them

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:07,930
can handle so any questions on this one

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:11,589
no questions okay so now go to why I'm

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:14,290
ever kidding static sites but you can

00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:16,750
still build in PSP a if it's a internal

00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:20,769
app the step size is not very very very

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:23,920
very big there's no server site similar

00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:26,759
to SP a but that's less complexity in

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,959
the development and also the deployment

00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:33,430
actually I'm repeating why I said just

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:35,050
now so skip about the libraries we can

00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:38,920
go back let me see anything else

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:42,430
okay next yeah this is early on he saw

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,819
now what would we build today no nuts

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:48,670
yes we'll cover as much nuts as possible

00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:50,379
we will dissect one of the modules okay

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:55,209
because there was some problem that I

00:12:50,379 --> 00:12:58,420
faced and the normal module couldn't fix

00:12:55,209 --> 00:13:00,069
it so you have to go in and see how to

00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,319
fix it

00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:02,949
we all look about these things like the

00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:06,309
Knox view

00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:09,249
layouts and a compote the other nuts

00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:11,350
views and their layouts the options and

00:13:09,249 --> 00:13:14,799
a life cycle okay explain this one in

00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,509
detail later SSR and static size issue

00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:20,829
so later on we'll go and see how the

00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:24,359
website explodes okay then we'll install

00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:29,049
simple REST API so that you can do the

00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:33,359
some API and that's where we are fixing

00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:36,639
the problem for the module yeah so

00:13:33,359 --> 00:13:40,509
before we start let's do this we

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:43,119
installed a back-end okay so have your

00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:47,259
clone the repository okay so if you have

00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:50,529
not clone a repository and follow the

00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:54,660
commands down here and once you do NP

00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:57,910
and run def port 3000 it should what

00:13:54,660 --> 00:14:00,609
so maybe the my assistants will go

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:07,569
around and help then I will take about

00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:11,040
two minutes two minutes run in it DB is

00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:11,040
to initialize the database

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:19,660
it's a back-end oh oh no no sorry

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,999
ignore the repo up there in order pull

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,339
up there yeah it's a stuff in the

00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:26,860
backend folder it's in the back and go

00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:31,179
to the backend folder do the NPM install

00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:32,709
I took out yeah it was derived from the

00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:40,499
project on top and took out all of

00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:40,499
things up there yeah okay so

00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:48,430
yes git clone yes the whole thing yes

00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,899
yeah I think that note Mon you don't

00:14:54,410 --> 00:15:04,790
have to because I've updated the package

00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:07,630
sorry you just ignore the note 1 yeah ok

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,630
anybody needs help

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:30,020
okay too fast too slow no right okay too

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:35,000
fast let me know okay too slow so let me

00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:38,980
know okay done okay anybody have been

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,980
finished okay

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:50,190
okay okay okay yes you can help your

00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:52,529
neighbors tool if they need help

00:15:50,190 --> 00:16:04,889
okay I'll just go round one last time

00:15:52,529 --> 00:16:15,389
okay good good okay Ken Oh run death run

00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:26,930
there okay you need the power is it you

00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:26,930
can use those yes yes oh yeah wait

00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:39,339
wait is it a small winner oh yeah you

00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,600
just need that one to plug in you're

00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:45,250
going you're the big one

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,350
no it's not enough power because it's my

00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:50,680
book is bigger fighting you should put

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:56,800
it there so causes somebody might this

00:16:50,680 --> 00:17:03,870
is not a good thing - yes that one down

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:15,630
there any more space okay

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:18,880
Kennedy yes is fine API / yes sorry haha

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:22,660
okay the API roots don't care yet okay

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,000
it's wrong is API slash slash of slash

00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,040
login an ape slash API slash

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,530
off slash longer but don't care about

00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,300
this is okay once you see the console

00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:36,540
listening at port 3000 you are fine okay

00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:41,020
listening at 40,000 a fine don't need to

00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:46,350
yeah and we've got test out the post

00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:50,080
I forgot the parameter sir

00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:51,340
yes this is correct yeah it will give

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,030
you back something you've just post

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:57,870
rubbish to it

00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,870
okay who's not ready

00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:08,790
okay okay I will start carry-on in about

00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:34,200
30 seconds anybody not ready oh you're

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:42,120
not ready not ready I using no I don't

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:57,960
think so Kenan why what's the error

00:18:42,120 --> 00:19:01,140
again and you see SQLite databases okay

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:05,660
okay that is definitely a problem okay

00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:11,060
give it you have him that thing okay Ken

00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:11,060
are we ready okay

00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:16,860
yes yes let's nice to see the thing

00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,300
listening and poetry thousand is fine

00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:23,550
okay don't worry about rest

00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:25,380
okay so kidonia I'll move on but the

00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:28,950
systems will help okay so not to worry

00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:31,160
okay so this bottom left is what you

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:34,460
should see this black color thing

00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:38,730
listening on port 3000 that's all and

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:42,240
later what we'll bill is this a login

00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:46,200
and logout only yeah but yeah you can

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:50,820
add more things up today okay so let's

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:56,850
get started with nuts now okay first

00:19:50,820 --> 00:20:03,690
line npx create - knocks - Jess conf

00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:06,570
that's all run the first line no oh get

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:09,450
off the back end folder sorry go one

00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:11,640
level on top and then run the command

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:14,250
actually can run in the backend food of

00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:18,420
some but it not been good yeah but

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:21,330
thanks just I exit the go one level up

00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,260
of the back end and then run create

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:30,540
knocks nuts

00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:33,900
yep okay so while it's oh so you ask you

00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:37,770
a few questions okay the important thing

00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:42,630
is server framework none because we are

00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:48,180
not gonna do any deploy any express or

00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:52,260
anything yet select Axios when it comes

00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:54,450
to option do not select any linter or

00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,940
prettier because later if you cut and

00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:58,119
paste the code you might have some

00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,359
problem if my

00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:10,059
man is not the same k Knoll internal PT

00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:13,059
adjust in at the X Yas then UI framework

00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:26,829
is beautifying and then the rest I think

00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:37,569
should be okay oh no 10 okay SQLite

00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:39,999
right okay okay but okay the note 12

00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:42,879
people right go to package.json delete

00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:47,949
the SQLite Nikesh and do a NPM install

00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:55,989
SQLite again see maybe it's not version

00:21:47,949 --> 00:21:58,659
I'm using but okay don't worry if you do

00:21:55,989 --> 00:22:01,139
not if you can install a back-end right

00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:01,139
is still fine

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:16,899
okay okay okay who's still not ready

00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:20,619
okay yes okay don't read the Sun we have

00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:25,149
another some more time okay so once you

00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:30,509
finish all the options settings the job

00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:30,509
then we just wait there okay okay

00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:44,519
piece work hold on okay okay so for

00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:56,129
those with no 12 keep your fingers

00:22:44,519 --> 00:23:01,440
crossed with the SQL is so you might you

00:22:56,129 --> 00:23:05,789
might be yes yes okay

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,859
sorry those yes those give me notice we

00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:08,279
have SQL like three problems on the back

00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:11,460
end

00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:14,460
delete the SQL like free from the

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:24,629
package.json file and do a NPM install

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:29,909
again yes yes yes okay sorry yes

00:23:24,629 --> 00:23:33,570
sorry god what is it ah yes or no to

00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:41,399
package this on delete this one and

00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:50,599
install it again yeah okay exit back can

00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:52,889
do Dan yeah okay yes let me do something

00:23:50,599 --> 00:24:00,570
okay I know some of you have not got

00:23:52,889 --> 00:24:02,929
this got this far okay yeah yeah I'll

00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,929
write it here

00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:14,710
sorry other okay this one all in small

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,710
letters

00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:43,220
okay you're here Jesse okay that's the

00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:46,460
most important part okay okay we'll give

00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:53,050
another two minutes we'll move on okay

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:54,310

00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:58,550
okay

00:24:54,310 --> 00:25:02,330
front end directory is the answer yes

00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:05,060
it's not everything is there so we are

00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:14,360
now doing the front end from scratch

00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:16,040
yes yes and okay so well the rest of you

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:22,730
are waiting those who are ready right

00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:26,270
there's this package a wipe out this

00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:28,640
does this package you can use one

00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:31,310
command you run the front and the back

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,770
end together because right now you need

00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:38,110
to go to the back end folder MPA run

00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:47,510
death front end folder MPN run death so

00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:49,880
this package concurrently okay

00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:51,500
if you don't know just go and look for

00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,810
it

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,120
once you install it you can use it to

00:25:53,810 --> 00:26:00,730
run your front and your back end

00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:00,730
together and save you a lot of time

00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:11,980
we set up again in dashdb yeah it's the

00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:14,750
center MPM run - yeah package.json

00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:17,080
everything is the packages on yeah

00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:28,490
actually the rim is - I forgot already

00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:31,310
yeah okay yeah okay one minute okay so

00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:40,100
ah I'll move on okay

00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:44,120
okay I'm moving on haha okay so what you

00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:46,460
see inside is the project structure for

00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:50,270
Knox okay

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:53,420
I think you can see ya so the my can you

00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:56,140
do a npm run death inside the front end

00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,140
directory

00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:03,429
I'll sorry instead just come beside yes

00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:11,509
confer you will have some problem

00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:14,960
Hey you will have some problem you yes

00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:17,599
because you are using pot 3000 nuts is

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,149
using port 3000 so first lesson Fornax

00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:23,649
you're gonna do is configure the pot

00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:31,820
okay so inside GS call there's a folder

00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:35,149
nax dot config dot GS open it okay and I

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:37,960
will write the property that you are

00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:44,419
keying to change the port number

00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:47,840
okay so server okay this is the property

00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:53,590
server and then actually you don't need

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:57,009
a host just port we can use 8080 or

00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:58,279
anything that you have free on your

00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:05,109
computer

00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:09,619
okay so change to this and then do the

00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:14,479
NPM run def again okay so where is jazz

00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:20,619
corn or back-end the command to run the

00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:23,619
application is the same NPM run def okay

00:28:20,619 --> 00:28:23,619
okay

00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:44,780
okay so your hot module reloading if you

00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:48,800
change let me go back okay so for those

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:52,580
who are free I will explain the project

00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:56,120
folder or next okay you just need to go

00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:59,510
to the file explorer view get to the GS

00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:02,330
con folder there are a few folders

00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:06,770
inside there the first one you see is

00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:07,900
assets so you place all the assets like

00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:10,490
pngs

00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,100
even some JavaScript files inside that

00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:14,870
your utility files what happens inside

00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:18,230
the assets folder is that the web pack

00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:20,420
will compress and whatever they do with

00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:23,090
it okay it's the first thing or CSS

00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:25,190
source or inside there the next part is

00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,230
the components this way you put the

00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:32,690
components that you build for the

00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:35,120
application okay then next is the

00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:38,420
layouts okay this is the layout where

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,730
you like for some websites your login

00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,590
page you have a certain layout you don't

00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:45,590
have a nav bar you don't have a menu

00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:48,470
after you login all the pages have a

00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:50,800
never menu and so on so you can specify

00:29:48,470 --> 00:30:10,940
different layouts for your various pages

00:29:50,800 --> 00:30:13,400
here we will touch on this okay okay so

00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,890
for the next installation and running

00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,800
even it helped dusty around here I will

00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:21,350
go on with the others

00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:24,260
okay so chaos in middleware first pages

00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:26,870
is where all your pages for your web

00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:28,970
application live so you can have your

00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:31,810
log in log out page inside their

00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:35,420
products page and then you can even have

00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:38,660
subfolders for each page like products

00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:41,120
then sub products and so on

00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:44,150
so it's a basically a treeview so how

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:47,390
many levels your URL parameters you want

00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:49,820
to go is mirrored by this page you don't

00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:51,800
need to setup any routing or anything

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:56,540
this one will actually do it for you and

00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:58,580
how to specify a dynamic route we'll go

00:30:56,540 --> 00:31:00,530
to inside K doses pages is very

00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,270
important and there's a lot of things

00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:07,160
going inside the pages where the nuts

00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:10,100
options are yes which might spin okay

00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:12,080
plugins is basically like your Axios

00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,340
when you install or like momen or

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,340
something and you want do something

00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:19,730
before that you put it inside the same

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:22,040
for the middleware static it's all your

00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:25,190
static content which will not be web

00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:29,750
packed and the store is the view X store

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:32,660
which is like reduction so on ok so this

00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:37,090
is the Knux structure every Nooksack

00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:40,430
application follows this structure yeah

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:43,280
so now we come to two things there are

00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:45,860
two things in Knox plugins and modules

00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:48,470
that's actually a big difference between

00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:50,690
them say plugins can be something like

00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:55,160
external libraries like your moments

00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:58,700
your low jet low - and beautify which is

00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:00,800
a UI is also a plugin ok so weapons is

00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,360
that there's some initialization code

00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,880
where you want to set that theme of the

00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:08,780
plug-in like for team of the beautify

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,870
you create a beauty 5 file in the

00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:16,520
plugins directory and in Knox config

00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:18,980
there's also something that that tells

00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:22,790
you there's a property called plug-ins

00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:25,160
and it has the beautify inside to tell

00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:27,320
where to search for the file inside of

00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:30,890
plugins folder I think it's better you

00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,990
look inside the the plugins folder to

00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:37,280
see if there's anything there may not be

00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:39,470
anything actually right now ok ok so

00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,000
anyway plugins is very simple it's just

00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:46,700
some external libraries that you add

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:49,370
into the view knocks yes ok the other

00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:52,130
thing is modules k modules are more

00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:56,030
involved because they are extending the

00:32:52,130 --> 00:33:00,620
core functionality of knacks GS so

00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:03,470
there's a lot of things that some quote

00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:06,950
or some operation inside this modules as

00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:08,960
tightly linked tunics GS so this

00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,490
actually is a very big topic which I

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,220
can't cover because I'm also not capable

00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:15,590
to cover because I've not build a module

00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:19,010
from scratch yet but we are going

00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:21,170
dissect the module okay so we have

00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:25,030
already in stock one of the modules

00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:33,350
which is Axios okay is already done

00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:35,450
let me look at the code okay - oh can

00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,880
you help me look at your thing to open

00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:42,350
up so I can see the code yeah because I

00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:44,240
okay can I have a look sure thanks okay

00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:49,400
okay there's nothing the block is in

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:53,090
page yeah okay so nevermind nice yes

00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:56,420
okay okay so is how you know that is

00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:58,880
already installed inside Knox GS is that

00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:00,500
you look at the Knux config file okay

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,510
that's actually a module call

00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:08,990
Axios and also for beautify inside o

00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:10,640
beautifies module now okay okay so today

00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:13,550
we'll learn about the authentication

00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:17,270
module and we'll go into it okay we have

00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:19,190
not installed that one yet okay so the

00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,940
important thing is the next config file

00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:26,400
where all the configuration takes place

00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:30,540
okay the so me don't you

00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:32,490
oh thank you thank you okay but now the

00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:33,120
screen has disappeared okay now let's

00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:44,490
move on

00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:48,860
hey wait I know what to do hi okay it's

00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:59,420
coming down again so I guess minimize

00:34:48,860 --> 00:35:05,180
this one right okay sorry

00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:05,180
okay oh thank you

00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:18,060
it's like number one okay mm okay so now

00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,360
we'll go to the first module they were

00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:30,080
gonna install if you need a reference oh

00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:30,080
gosh is so small okay

00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:40,069
here let's go to you just open up this

00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:47,510
page later because we're gonna dig into

00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:56,000
the code inside here uth next ah thank

00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:59,599
you okay so you th dot Knox object store

00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,720
up will be the game to this later so

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:08,470
we're gonna install this module now so

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:12,680
just do a npm install at Knox GS / off

00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:15,339
or you can do NPM I just a small I is

00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,339
faster

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:41,040
okay npm i okay we already installed X Y

00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,040
so there's no need to do it

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:53,170
okay then once you finish installing the

00:36:46,630 --> 00:37:00,640
end module you go to Knox dot config dot

00:36:53,170 --> 00:37:03,970
GS and ad at the ethnics GS / off to the

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,820
modules property okay so there's a

00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:10,720
modules property inside contacts config

00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:17,740
GS you just add the package name at

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:25,660
noxious English order I know it doesn't

00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:29,110
matter yeah oh okay yes if you got an

00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:31,720
error about the store being missing just

00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:34,000
create an index dot GS file inside the

00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:37,030
store folder that's all it can be a

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,430
blank file yeah I don't know why it

00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:41,680
happened before I saw you just create

00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:43,600
the file index dot J's and everything

00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,260
will work fine okay so if you get an

00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:50,020
error about a star index dot JSP file

00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:53,520
and leave it it should work after that

00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:53,520
right yes okay

00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:01,369
yeah

00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:07,119
all right good catch

00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:21,670
okay so we have only installed it we are

00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:21,670
going to start to use it soon

00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:38,620
okay let me I do not use them back for

00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:43,300
some time yes like my okay thank you

00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:46,140
okay so now that you have put that thing

00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,140
inside the ha

00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:56,140
inside the nuts doc config yes he will

00:38:52,210 --> 00:39:00,130
now configure the when I'll configure

00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:12,640
the module so let me go to the website

00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:22,110
now okay okay I think if you can't see

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:31,350

00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:42,800
suddenly oh okay nevermind do you see a

00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:50,369
readme - 1 dot MD file inside GS conf

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:55,770
read me - 1 MB file ok you scroll to

00:39:50,369 --> 00:39:58,849
data items one two three okay item tree

00:39:55,770 --> 00:40:03,720
is the one where the settings for the

00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:07,619
nuts config of the off module is there's

00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:11,150
this off property you can copy and paste

00:40:07,619 --> 00:40:11,150
it into the nuts off

00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:20,579
Wow okay lucky we didn't it's quite

00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:24,450
small you have the code editor somewhere

00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:25,740
you just do a code I don't know what we

00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,710
started yes I don't know what this is I

00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:40,079
know is this too small because I can

00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:42,150
make it larger okay yes oh okay Jesco I

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:47,760
know yeah but there's too many crap

00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:49,740
inside here okay this one okay this is

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,590
I'm scared of the timeline yes this is

00:40:49,740 --> 00:41:04,140
it Russia

00:40:52,590 --> 00:41:08,920
okay this one okay okay okay yes Wow

00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:12,660
okay it's nobody still you zoom in some

00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,660
more because behind really I can't see

00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,740
okay Samar Samar

00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:25,890
yes uh screwed ow yes they're off okay

00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:27,720
so yeah so we're gonna do the local

00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,420
strategy which is basically you sending

00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:32,040
your email and password and get a token

00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:34,530
from the back end okay

00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,970
the back end how it works okay you can

00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:38,790
figure out yourself later

00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:41,820
yes so basically there are two end

00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:44,850
points one is login which is slash off

00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:48,510
slash a slash API slash of slash login

00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:51,000
the other ones logout and then the last

00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:53,810
one which is user slash API slash off

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,590
slash me is to get the user information

00:41:53,810 --> 00:42:00,840
okay yeah so this is basically how you

00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:03,360
configure it the token required true

00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,760
token type error this is all inside the

00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:09,350
documentation for knock stuff here so

00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,350
still pretty straightforward

00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:32,670
zooming nothing yes yes all the copy and

00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:38,430
paste that you need to get things

00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:40,080
working yes yeah so because we realize

00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:42,330
that if it's the type of loan right what

00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,750
did you really you can't see anything I

00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:48,450
can't see anything

00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:53,100
okay okay

00:42:48,450 --> 00:43:03,920
everyone good yes just the off block and

00:42:53,100 --> 00:43:03,920
I'm putting in the config okay case

00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:12,799
yeah so sorry about going through this

00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:16,220
but it's gonna get a bit tougher okay

00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:22,000
next slide next slide

00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:34,869
yeah yes okay

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:37,540
oh I think you mean okay so this is just

00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:40,900
for knowledge will see inside a coat

00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:45,550
later okay you can set up the

00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:49,119
authentication Pearl Rob so inside view

00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:51,880
GS files that's the strip and inside the

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,950
strip that's the export default and here

00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,790
we see a middle way off so once you put

00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:59,849
the off thing inside this is a protector

00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:03,130
route that means um if you're not

00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:08,380
authenticated by the off module you get

00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:11,830
redirected to where you where you

00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:13,359
configure it in Knox JS conf if for now

00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:16,060
we are using the default which I think

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:18,010
you redirect back to the the slash dot

00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:21,099
slash yes

00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:24,400
Oh back my mom okay okay so that's per

00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:28,270
page you can also do it globally that

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,640
means you make every route must be

00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:33,970
authenticated and that is done in the

00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,220
next config inside a router property can

00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:39,250
you set the middle way as off so every

00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:40,690
year out will be authenticated if you

00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,369
want a particular out not to be

00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:46,359
authenticated you go to the page and

00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:50,760
then you give off force yep so this

00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:55,060
straight from the documentation yeah ah

00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,619
in a middle way okay you can actually

00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,330
put in a bracket if you have more than

00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:00,220
one middle way there could be a

00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:02,650
internationalisation middle way or some

00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:04,810
other things so if more than one you put

00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:11,349
us the thing in an array otherwise can

00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:13,420
put it in the just in a string okay guys

00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:16,170
I think a lot of you're confused on what

00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:19,350
fell recording here so the front end

00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:23,130
is natural solution it has been in here

00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:28,520
application up and running we created a

00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:31,110
new project with the MPX who in dust and

00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:39,180
wonderful believe meter we're reporting

00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:44,460
on that so just to clarify that okay

00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:48,810
thank you okay so now we'll go to the

00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:52,710
first we'll go to the store alike Creek

00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:56,430
I see a copy copy and paste it so we'll

00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:58,490
go to the default view page we are gonna

00:45:56,430 --> 00:46:02,340
replace everything that's inside there

00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:08,900
okay so if you go to number four of the

00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:13,730
readme - 1 dot MD ok you copy and paste

00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:15,870
the whole thing over replace the whole

00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:18,050
default dot view inside the layouts

00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:20,610
folder so that's the layouts folder

00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:24,920
inside that's the default dot view file

00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:24,920
wipe it out and replace it with this

00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:35,340
okay what is inside the file is a

00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:38,430
beautify text HTML text yeah beautify

00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:41,610
order beautify for the front end making

00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:44,730
it look nice okay that one I think can

00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:50,000
read more about it later I will go

00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:50,000
through the authentication part

00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,590
okay okay yeah

00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:04,260
yes so the important thing is cut and

00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:09,150
paste make sure you can run then we'll

00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:12,780
make let you understand in a while okay

00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:14,520
then my my teaching assistants or

00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:34,670
helpers can help to help you to

00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:34,670
understand okay is to 905 yeah

00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:42,720
yeah okay this a lot of coat here

00:47:40,539 --> 00:47:45,369
because you are building a menu

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:48,369
interactive the Neph bind everything

00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:49,660
case so if you have a record along right

00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:52,239
I think we would take that see how has

00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,769
to code so we are here to learn NOx so

00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:56,650
you just copy and paste don't worry can

00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:57,999
understand it later okay so now I

00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:02,650
explain to you the important things

00:47:57,999 --> 00:48:08,319
inside here okay no no no yeah and the

00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:08,950
slides okay so the first one dollar dot

00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,130
off

00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:14,200
dollar dollar state dot logged in k

00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:16,779
dollar dot off is actually the module

00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,670
the off module they're using so they

00:48:16,779 --> 00:48:21,819
have a dollar off dot whatever lots of

00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:23,829
things that relates to the the off

00:48:21,819 --> 00:48:25,660
module and this logged in is actually

00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:29,769
deflect to indicate whether the person

00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:31,479
is logged in or not okay yeah it doesn't

00:48:29,769 --> 00:48:33,670
contain the user details is just whether

00:48:31,479 --> 00:48:34,630
the person's logged in or not and okay

00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:37,089
the state right

00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:41,440
this module actually comes with a built

00:48:37,089 --> 00:48:44,680
in storage so it will store your your

00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:48,640
information you can store it inside the

00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:51,160
view X store the local state the second

00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,989
one is in a session cookie and let that

00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,210
one is in the local storage so it

00:48:52,989 --> 00:48:58,630
actually does everything for you

00:48:55,210 --> 00:49:00,339
behind the scenes so later on I think

00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:02,339
when you do the login if you

00:49:00,339 --> 00:49:04,900
successfully log in you check your

00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:09,130
debugging console you should be able see

00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:12,219
the the information inside yes okay next

00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:14,380
is dollar of dot user so this one is

00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:17,109
contains the information that we get

00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:19,749
from the API route where we get the user

00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:25,059
information that's slash API slash off

00:49:19,749 --> 00:49:28,769
slash me okay and very important inside

00:49:25,059 --> 00:49:32,940
an layout page that's this thing called

00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:32,940
the Knox tech

00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:42,500
so whatever is inside the layout is the

00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:46,250
parent and this thing is all the pages

00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:49,220
that you define inside a pitch folder

00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:53,660
whatever will appear here and which

00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:56,600
layout to use is inside a page so inside

00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:59,030
your web page the the file that's

00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:03,950
actually distinct only are only as one

00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:06,140
of the property so you specify the

00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:10,340
layout you are using for this is default

00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:17,210
and in nuts the layout for the default

00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:18,890
is called default okay yeah so it will

00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:24,860
go to the default pitch

00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:30,560
later we'll build another layout okay so

00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:35,020
any questions any questions can run can

00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:35,020
run cannot run okay cool yes

00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:37,510
ah

00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:49,369
okay okay okay okay good we have still

00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:53,280
some time okay so okay yeah

00:50:49,369 --> 00:50:57,540
imagine you have a login page with no

00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,670
nav bus and you have login picture if no

00:50:57,540 --> 00:51:03,090
net bus that's the layout after you

00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:07,130
login you have a nav bar okay so that's

00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:10,830
another layout so you create two layouts

00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:14,460
one with one without the nav bar one

00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:20,420
with the nav bar so then you create your

00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:24,300
pages which is rests inside the layout

00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:27,390
okay so let's see you have a sign-in and

00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:30,960
sign-out sign in and sign up page you

00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:33,930
want to use the empty layout so you

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,630
inside the sign-in and sign-out page

00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:39,330
there's a layout property you just

00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:44,100
specify the name of the layout file that

00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:46,530
you create and if it's the other pages

00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:48,960
those days after you login your products

00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:52,650
your users or this and you want to use

00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:56,070
the nav page ok you can specify the nav

00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:57,869
pitch inside the inside that you can

00:51:56,070 --> 00:52:01,440
specify the nav layout inside the page

00:51:57,869 --> 00:52:03,960
the key word is layout layout so inside

00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,600
the page dot view you have this thing

00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,580
called layout ah I know because you

00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,500
haven't gone to the page yet okay we'll

00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:15,440
go to the page and then maybe it's

00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:15,440
easier for for us to see all okay

00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:23,280
this woman has given birth yeah

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,320
so if anyone what you have before the

00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,800
nest and after the mast you can define

00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:30,359
your layouts so first we have my column

00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,770
down like this where the first pitch is

00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:32,849
that's just instant the password and

00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:44,210
once you log in we have a different

00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:48,510
layout we can just reuse this yeah yes

00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:51,450
yes yeah so there's some huh

00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:52,619
oh thank you okay so there's some magic

00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:55,800
going on in the nuts

00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:57,990
okay Snorri slowly we will get to learn

00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:01,349
about it okay let's go on to the next

00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:04,589
page the public page which everybody can

00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:10,410
see before logging in so next we go to

00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:13,619
item 5 on the readme - 1 MB item 5 this

00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:18,270
is quite short okay you can cut and

00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:22,500
paste the thing in to this page where

00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:25,349
you create ok so the pages folder pages

00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,599
folder you that's this file called index

00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:30,660
dot GS if it's not oh sorry index dot

00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:36,990
view if it's not that created if it's

00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:38,069
they replace the whole thing yes it

00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:39,720
should be there right I think they're

00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:41,900
just replace the whole thing inside

00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,900
there

00:53:45,000 --> 00:54:09,020
ah typo okay yes it's a no sorry it's

00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:09,020
that fine okay yes yes it's a typo yes

00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,910
okay that's good with slight so

00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,470
everything working copy and paste

00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:19,290
everything will Qingdao explain what's

00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:21,690
inside that pitch I'm sorry I can

00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:23,730
explain furthermore but maybe once I

00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:28,500
finish with whatever I need to teach I

00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:33,420
can explain more on those things so okay

00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:38,190
yeah already done npm run def okay then

00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:39,870
inside there that's the dollar of dot o

00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:43,710
should be dollar state okay and then

00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:45,030
login so this one it just the same as

00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:50,400
before it tells you where there's login

00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:54,060
or not yeah okay so this just a public

00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:58,200
page is very simple so it index kb you

00:54:54,060 --> 00:55:01,170
create a public page again okay this is

00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:05,610
where we'll do some some things inside

00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:10,280
okay so copy number six and file name is

00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:10,280
create a public dot view inside pages

00:55:15,009 --> 00:55:18,009
okay

00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:25,570
yes create a public dot view file copy

00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:27,670
and paste yes I know it's a lot of copy

00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:33,240
and paste now but it is building up for

00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:33,240
the next step Oh Oh to ten okay

00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:41,020
okay this is the peach later we will

00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:43,480
test some problems with server-side

00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:46,030
rendering yes sorry peach down to the

00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:48,760
default I guess up up up sorry up up up

00:55:46,030 --> 00:55:53,050
up up up up okay zoom in a down bounce

00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:59,470
right now oh yeah yeah okay so see down

00:55:53,050 --> 00:56:01,180
here middle way oh okay so this pitch is

00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:04,990
actually suppose to be authenticated

00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:09,490
okay but because these options I put off

00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:12,640
as false the public can actually so is

00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:14,520
actually not authenticated so if you are

00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,630
not authenticated you can still go in

00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:19,240
what else there's something very

00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:22,420
important oh yeah so this layouts right

00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:25,000
you do not see any layouts property

00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:28,770
inside here if they do not see they are

00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:31,870
using the default dot view layout okay

00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:33,700
yep so when when you see this page you

00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:36,370
will still see the I think the default

00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:41,890
patients got up the menu bus and

00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:46,180
everything yeah okay so I think okay so

00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:50,590
I said I'm the public page okay go back

00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:53,190
to the slide okay we'll go on to the

00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:53,190
next one

00:56:53,390 --> 00:57:00,470
yes okay we will go on to the private

00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:08,620
pitch which is only after you login you

00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:17,390
can go in so this one is number seven

00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:20,780
yes case we are sorry it's secure yeah

00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:25,250
you can call it secure if you name it

00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:26,840
some other name right inside the inside

00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:29,480
the layout stock page you have to also

00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:34,640
change the route to be similar to this

00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:38,030
so if it name it slash ABC you go to the

00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:39,830
layout dot default dot view file look

00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:52,910
for slash secure and change it to slash

00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:57,650
ABC yes oh sorry sorry sorry yes yes

00:57:52,910 --> 00:58:00,290
sorry sorry we've secured it okay starts

00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:04,040
go to 8 plus no because I go to 8 I'm

00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:12,320
sorry go to 8 yes go to 8 and then

00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:16,580
create this pages log in dot view yes

00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:18,770
sorry number 8 no because I changed

00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:20,120
halfway because the lock in was more

00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,780
involved yes there's a lot of things

00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:28,570
inside there

00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:30,500
oh you can do both yes ok do both Lubo

00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:36,760
what's the other ones the key all right

00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:39,170
secures it okay let's just do both okay

00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:42,670
create the login to view create secured

00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:48,980
of view copy and paste the code inside

00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:51,260
good suggestion thank you yes so anytime

00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,770
you find you need some way to improve or

00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,360
speed up

00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:58,090
I've not improved approach what

00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:58,090
processes please go ahead yes

00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:04,880
important thing is the code can work

00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:24,030
okay once you're done we need to do some

00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:26,370
things here

00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:33,450
okay wait first okay so that's this

00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:37,680
thing okay fetch user okay this is the

00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:40,560
one that fetches user information okay

00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:49,260
let me look at the okay so once you

00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:56,280
already go to next config yes and look

00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:59,880
at base URL okay

00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:05,910
you should be pointing to the localhost

00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:11,550
port 3000 on sorry basically Axios base

01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:14,090
URL that's Axios and then base URL at n

01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:14,090
ug moment

01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:39,820
hey so just make sure that this is a

01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:43,230
localhost 3000 yeah the back end okay we

01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:43,230
can move on to the next slide okay

01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:55,750
oh great we have a break okay so that's

01:00:53,800 --> 01:01:00,310
uh this thing called custom elements is

01:00:55,750 --> 01:01:01,570
a web standard for those web components

01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:04,810
one of the four pillars of web

01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:07,270
components so that's this website called

01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:11,040
custom elements everywhere calm and it

01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:14,760
tells you which is the weather they are

01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:17,680
compared how compared well it is okay

01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:19,090
view and angular is still there you can

01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:24,330
look at all the other frameworks down

01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:29,010
there okay react yes is really the worst

01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:29,010
70% it's anyone

01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:47,700
okay just to get our mind off a bit okay

01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:50,360
less detox to the mind a bit and why any

01:01:47,700 --> 01:02:14,580
questions we can take questions here

01:01:50,360 --> 01:02:16,440
no questions nobody nothing so the

01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:19,160
important thing is that whatever you

01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:27,680
copy and paste it will work and then

01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:27,680
figure it out later yeah

01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:46,930
yes sorry yeah yeah you have yes yes

01:02:50,470 --> 01:03:05,060
okay thank you

01:02:52,100 --> 01:03:06,890
you guys thank you okay sorry the timing

01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:29,030
is it oh yeah yeah yeah we started 15

01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:30,140
minutes oh okay but I didn't explain

01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:43,340
much fun of you

01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:45,020
because you want to talk about it

01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:47,710
because I'm not really about it no it's

01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,710
really like templates

01:03:52,839 --> 01:04:04,569
you okay

01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:08,239
[Applause]

01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:51,270
No

01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:25,380
okay so now we're gonna go to the fun

01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:27,569
part okay so if you look at the

01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:30,829
documentation for the authentication for

01:06:27,569 --> 01:06:33,869
next it's a very easy actually because

01:06:30,829 --> 01:06:36,390
all you need to do is call this login

01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:39,119
with thing and then you specify the

01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:42,029
strategy like local there's two local

01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:46,799
and off too so if you use oauth2 you can

01:06:42,029 --> 01:06:48,660
do a github Google whatever okay so we

01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:54,569
can do this very easily username

01:06:48,660 --> 01:07:00,059
password next slide now okay but now we

01:06:54,569 --> 01:07:00,989
hit a roadblock okay okay yes so what is

01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:04,140
my problem

01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:07,699
any guesses is ready I just log in and

01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:07,699
log out but why can I use it

01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:14,209
sorry Tory that's no wrong answer it's

01:07:11,939 --> 01:07:14,209
okay

01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:24,430
there is part of the problem that's part

01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:27,430
of the problem oh okay very good

01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:29,829
actually that is very close okay

01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:34,119
very close very close getting closer

01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:36,339
okay I know it's not that one because

01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:42,670
the one is always probably it's always

01:07:36,339 --> 01:07:45,640
forces okay yes okay uh sure okay to Fe

01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:49,089
I got a app that needs to FA Google off

01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:52,180
you know this I can't do it

01:07:49,089 --> 01:07:53,140
I checked the the stack overflows to

01:07:52,180 --> 01:07:57,279
everywhere

01:07:53,140 --> 01:08:02,019
nothing okay so time to dig into the

01:07:57,279 --> 01:08:06,009
modules okay so now we all go into the

01:08:02,019 --> 01:08:09,099
off module okay now teach you how to dig

01:08:06,009 --> 01:08:12,910
inside you go let's go to github or you

01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:15,989
can search for Knox off okay once you're

01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:19,150
there go into the package.json file

01:08:15,989 --> 01:08:28,480
because from there you can see where the

01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:33,060
module was start off okay okay very okay

01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:36,449
plus plus plus plus plus plus yes I

01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:41,020
think you have to bigger I think

01:08:36,449 --> 01:08:44,049
plus plus plus yes okay package.json

01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:47,349
there's this thing called mean property

01:08:44,049 --> 01:08:52,060
inside there inside you should see a lip

01:08:47,349 --> 01:08:54,339
slash module slash index dot JSP is the

01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:56,949
starting point of everything where you

01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:59,079
dig it's not just for off module some

01:08:56,949 --> 01:09:02,500
other package they use even in react or

01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:09,900
whatever is I think so yeah

01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:09,900
so let's go inside the package.json okay

01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:24,429
it okay we also we go into the lip

01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:26,620
module index dot JSP min a bit more okay

01:09:24,429 --> 01:09:30,909
let's look at the packages plus on top

01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:31,810
sorry the constant okay nothing here

01:09:30,909 --> 01:09:34,750
that tells me anything

01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:36,400
go down a bit more okay okay this lip

01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:38,319
root tells you where the library root is

01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:41,279
which is actually top

01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:44,679
okay now mangoes throw down some more

01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:46,870
nothing looks interesting yet

01:09:44,679 --> 01:09:49,480
okay setting default strategies we know

01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:53,969
from the documentation that's a few okay

01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:57,940
that's this copy plug-in okay ah wait

01:09:53,969 --> 01:09:59,679
okay so copy plug-in is inside the one

01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:01,540
of the inside the import where they are

01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:05,670
surrounding kingdom I will scroll down

01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:05,670
and you see validate options okay

01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:09,420
this is just yeah but it's just copying

01:10:07,659 --> 01:10:15,190
the your other options inside

01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:16,290
okay so ah okay not copy core yet you

01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:20,250
can scroll down some more

01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:22,780
okay copy plug-in ok scroll down

01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:28,230
okay okay scroll down nothing

01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:30,969
interesting okay scroll down

01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:36,010
don't worry if I forgot I have the

01:10:30,969 --> 01:10:39,250
answer somewhere resolve scheme Wow

01:10:36,010 --> 01:10:43,679
okay okay wrong okay screw up I think

01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:46,300
it's somewhere copy plug-in where is it

01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:48,520
okay wait source go down a bit it's

01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:53,670
wrong okay so there's something say here

01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:56,580
okay options go to the sly la

01:10:53,670 --> 01:11:04,420
X look I remember digging through this

01:10:56,580 --> 01:11:08,250
okay let's see okay copy plug-in yes

01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:12,400
this is a copy plug-in okay on top okay

01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:16,090
so this sauce resolve liberal it goes to

01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:18,489
this plugin GS so there's a plug-in

01:11:16,090 --> 01:11:20,350
system inside view I suspect something

01:11:18,489 --> 01:11:23,710
is going on inside

01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:27,690
so we'll proceed to the next foul

01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:30,940
which is plugin but you know the folder

01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:36,040
the route yeah okay let's go to the

01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:39,190
slide first yeah so we go to the module

01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:44,710
plug-in so now I'm our index go up and

01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:45,040
go to the module plug-in yes this is the

01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:52,800
one

01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:57,280
yes okay so this looks like something

01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:59,410
interesting CTX inject and the dollar

01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:01,780
sign off do you see that also

01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:05,260
so this doing something important and

01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:07,450
that's a new of where it creates the new

01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:09,400
instance of this off so this is quite

01:12:07,450 --> 01:12:14,710
important there must be something inside

01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:17,020
here okay let's see okay so it

01:12:14,710 --> 01:12:25,150
initialized okay there's something

01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:30,550
inside here what is in the notes okay

01:12:25,150 --> 01:12:33,640
yes so the off is obviously sorry the

01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:36,390
input of good or import of go to the

01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:38,500
import offs okay so this top line is

01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:41,020
telling me that's importing something

01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:43,330
here which is very important so I'm

01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:48,460
gonna find off GS power so go back to

01:12:43,330 --> 01:12:50,980
the module and then go to lip-lip

01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:53,640
because it's not here there's somewhere

01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:56,850
where they actually link it to the off

01:12:53,640 --> 01:13:02,710
look at the call I think's in a call

01:12:56,850 --> 01:13:06,100
okay so going through off GS now okay

01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:07,990
so exactly we see there's a the context

01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:09,730
and options that's passed in when we

01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:16,480
knew the off object let's scroll down

01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:18,900
some more okay strategy is here scroll

01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:18,900
down some more

01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:26,310
yes some oh hey strip strategy and same

01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:28,680
scheme others endings yes Lester I think

01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:31,410
because this no of Oh

01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:35,090
login with login you if it's inside the

01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:38,430
documentation so this login wave cause

01:13:35,090 --> 01:13:42,450
something inside here called login so we

01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:45,300
go into the login which is just below KN

01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:47,370
is looking for this dot strategy logged

01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:50,220
in so he's got to do is something in the

01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:51,960
strategy okay because now here can see

01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:57,590
us a rap blog in this strategy logged

01:13:51,960 --> 01:14:01,770
login okay so we go to find another foul

01:13:57,590 --> 01:14:05,580
let's go back up again so yes there's a

01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:09,830
strategy somewhere or something go no

01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:12,870
get out the folder yes

01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:14,610
okay get off call I don't think it's

01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:16,650
here nope

01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:19,560
oh just let me show you something okay

01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:21,990
story it's not GS go inside here this is

01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:27,120
where you see that the IP working with

01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:28,830
the view X store okay so they actually

01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:31,080
work with us you can stay store the

01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:33,690
authentication stuff inside the local

01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:35,700
state inside cookies and sex strategy so

01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:39,000
everything on side a you don't have to

01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:43,160
bill your own you want to add any more

01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:48,240
code okay let's find the off strategy

01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:51,360
this strategy so so schemes keep yeah it

01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:53,490
sounds like it so yes best guess ah so

01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:55,200
there's two schemes local and off to as

01:14:53,490 --> 01:14:56,850
in a documentation let's look at local

01:14:55,200 --> 01:15:05,540
see what happens

01:14:56,850 --> 01:15:08,790
local hey scroll down ah okay set token

01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:11,130
this one oh it works with xeo so this is

01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:13,620
way that she says the authentication

01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:16,620
header okay okay good the song you may

01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:19,560
need it later scroll down some more we

01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:21,540
look for the login ah login okay so if

01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,880
you didn't specify your endpoints inside

01:15:21,540 --> 01:15:27,540
a config file they will return bye-bye

01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:31,050
okay so you need to specify let's look

01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:32,970
at some more okay so login / packed okay

01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:35,850
oh okay

01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:39,060
so weapons is that login also thus

01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:42,420
effects user the problem with that the

01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:45,720
OTP is that when I do the login first

01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:49,470
I haven't cleared the OTP so I can't

01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:54,540
fetch the user so that's a problem

01:15:49,470 --> 01:15:56,250
so I need to do is I need to do a login

01:15:54,540 --> 01:16:01,670
without fetching the user once I clear

01:15:56,250 --> 01:16:08,220
the OTP then I fetch the user okay so

01:16:01,670 --> 01:16:09,840
how do we do it sorry what yes we have

01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:12,600
to do something with the functions here

01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:14,190
which is the which is the login and so

01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,560
on we can actually make use of all these

01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:20,220
functions down here K which I will show

01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:23,930
later yes let's go back to the slide

01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:23,930
then you can start working on a solution

01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:30,900
okay there are some tips though you can

01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:32,820
console.log inside the source files to

01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:34,260
see what's happening okay to learn more

01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:36,450
about the library that's one thing when

01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:42,530
you are dig in and you use finding files

01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:45,150
a lot to find things okay so basically

01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:47,670
what is important is that set token that

01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:49,740
we need to call if we are gonna do all

01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:50,970
the things for ourselves to set the

01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:53,790
authentication header

01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:56,670
there's also a set token that is inside

01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:58,530
of the GS we need to call this one

01:16:56,670 --> 01:17:01,380
little one can dig in yourself this was

01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:07,230
that setting or the local storage and so

01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:08,280
on okay so here's the I explained before

01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:11,130
for fetch user

01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:12,780
this should fail for the two FA and only

01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:15,750
after you clear the two FA then you

01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:17,430
fetch the user okay so we are gonna fix

01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:21,270
it instead of waiting for somebody to

01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:22,860
fix this problem okay so how we gonna

01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:26,460
fix okay next slide

01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:28,590
I don't previous okay so we're gonna fix

01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:30,840
it ourselves we are used existing

01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:33,660
library sauce we are not gonna do any

01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:37,040
 or whatever we just use the

01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:40,650
functions that's existing inside there

01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:42,960
which is inside the login dot view which

01:17:40,650 --> 01:17:44,329
you have very copy and paste right okay

01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:54,139
so

01:17:44,329 --> 01:17:56,570
oh I need a punch password okay so maybe

01:17:54,139 --> 01:18:02,110
we can go into the login dot view file

01:17:56,570 --> 01:18:04,579
now to see how it is actually done okay

01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:06,710
just I have copy and paste the login dot

01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:12,500
view right so this is actually the

01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:16,070
answer screen side there okay one thing

01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:20,929
to notice this one I did not put in any

01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:24,260
ot P but you can still log in and log

01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:26,630
out without the OTP pad if you want to

01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:30,469
see the whole OTP thing in action

01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:34,730
that's actually my repository actually

01:18:30,469 --> 01:18:40,190
has it yeah another repository

01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:45,790
okay so login dot view okay so I scroll

01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:50,360
down a bit yeah look in that view

01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:53,949
okay so what happens is that once the

01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:53,949
person clicks the login button

01:18:55,650 --> 01:19:05,160
oh you wanna login button there okay

01:18:58,830 --> 01:19:07,590
bite me to zoom in you can see okay so

01:19:05,160 --> 01:19:09,990
once you click the login button okay it

01:19:07,590 --> 01:19:12,480
will go to a method inside view just as

01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:17,360
this income method which will do the

01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:19,380
login okay so what happens is that I

01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:22,500
okay I actually didn't use those

01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:25,380
endpoints that specified in in the

01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:29,060
enough knocks off because I'm doing it

01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:31,500
here so you send a post to the back end

01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:36,240
okay using an email and password and

01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:38,960
then come out okay for the example the

01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:44,610
username and the password is test tes T

01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:46,350
okay okay maybe you can try later so the

01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:49,680
thing is after the thing comes back

01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:52,740
successively I set the token in the

01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:58,620
local storage and so on and I set the

01:19:52,740 --> 01:20:02,640
token in the Axios okay and then after

01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:04,890
that I get the me result of course if

01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,450
you are doing the OTP you will not be

01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:09,330
getting your me user you'll be going

01:20:06,450 --> 01:20:12,450
again to get your OTP verified before

01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:16,320
you get a user and once you get a user

01:20:12,450 --> 01:20:18,680
back you can use the off function set

01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:21,420
the off module set user to set the user

01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:26,280
so this is where you get just now the

01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:28,920
dollar dot dot dollars did not use the

01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:32,780
user information and once you're

01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:35,430
authenticated we can push you to

01:20:32,780 --> 01:20:38,430
whichever page that you want to okay

01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:40,650
which is secure pitch so if you want now

01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:44,130
you can actually test out by typing the

01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:46,710
username and password test test to go

01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:48,660
into the secure pitch and there'll be

01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:55,290
some information that is displayed in

01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:56,820
the secure pitch actually this quite

01:20:55,290 --> 01:21:05,630
fast

01:20:56,820 --> 01:21:07,560
yeah so yeah it's done already

01:21:05,630 --> 01:21:13,100
everybody good so far

01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:13,100
okay okay you okay

01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:22,650
okay so we have a why yard checking it

01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:27,060
out we have a shot shot break again Hey

01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:27,720
Oh typo changes I can change set

01:21:27,060 --> 01:21:33,120
interval

01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:34,920
okay so set interval this javascript

01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:38,220
command okay

01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:40,410
how you use it in react hawks okay when

01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:42,540
you induce effect and you need to set

01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:44,400
interval that's this whole block of code

01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:45,840
that you need to do in order to set the

01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:48,330
interval okay

01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:50,970

of you have problems later after the

01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:17,400
workshop we will help to get it working

01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:21,409
for you okay so now we come to routing

01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:21,409
in max GS

01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:34,330
okay so basically we are gonna see how

01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:39,450
the routing goes on Knox Jess okay this

01:27:34,330 --> 01:27:39,450
is going to be a Roman okay so you copy

01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:49,720
okay there's a readme file to look at

01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:53,350
read me - 2 dot MD ok so I think we will

01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:59,200
speed things up by copying all and

01:27:53,350 --> 01:28:03,480
creating all the pages ok so we create a

01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:13,630
folder on the pages called dynamic a

01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:17,590
pages / dynamic okay and then you create

01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:20,010
some files inside underscores luck dot

01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:20,010
view

01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:30,960
okay and this file you can copy and

01:28:27,639 --> 01:28:30,960
paste item number two

01:28:34,570 --> 01:28:47,010
okay then that's another one under item

01:28:39,030 --> 01:28:48,160
number four index dot view but oh wait

01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:50,950
okay

01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:53,520
they might just copy w underscores

01:28:50,950 --> 01:29:01,360
like the view first

01:28:53,520 --> 01:29:02,920
okay so should dynamic navigation hey

01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:05,140
the Sun you don't you don't need to

01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:11,110
worry yep

01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:15,060
so once you get into underscores like

01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:19,780
view dot navigation I saw it once you

01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:21,570

control-c and run the thing again we are

01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:16,880
going on dynamic routes so they should

01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:19,640
see a go to the dynamic menu item on the

01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:21,110
left and then there's some you open our

01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:25,160

okay so when you navigate right just go

01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:58,850
to / dynamic / one okay because the the

01:31:56,240 --> 01:32:00,230
/ diamond pitch is not there that's how

01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:04,820
you get a fall for error

01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:09,470
okay so go / dynamic / one okay then you

01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:13,280
can see some items ready okay so yeah

01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:20,920
slaw so when you don't have the the

01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:23,920
index page you get a 404 error okay okay

01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:23,920
okay

01:32:26,230 --> 01:32:36,950
yes yes is 404 because this is a a okay

01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:38,060
when you click on the okay when you

01:32:36,950 --> 01:32:42,980
click on the menu

01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:46,460
it goes to /a why is getting a 404 you

01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:49,340
go into the dynasty again there's this

01:32:46,460 --> 01:32:52,280
function called validate this is one of

01:32:49,340 --> 01:32:54,470
the next options so you validate your

01:32:52,280 --> 01:32:56,720
parameters so sometimes your parameters

01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:59,750
you only want integers you'd want

01:32:56,720 --> 01:33:04,150
characters then yeah so you will fall

01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:07,880
for you if you type in something yes

01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:10,250
okay so you see that there's a validate

01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:13,250
function inside the slug dog view page

01:33:10,250 --> 01:33:20,420
there's the one that validates the the

01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:23,840
parameters so if your if your indexes

01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:26,540
are alphabet and not a number they are

01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:28,460
four four yeah actually I fixed that

01:33:26,540 --> 01:33:32,810
thing but I didn't somehow it wasn't

01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:35,300
inside here okay so so much for it okay

01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:37,670
no next thing you can create after the

01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:42,170
underscores lock right you can create an

01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:46,040
index dot view and then copy and paste

01:33:42,170 --> 01:33:48,880
everything inside there and under the /

01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:48,880
dynamic folder

01:33:52,030 --> 01:34:08,560
you see that one is script number five

01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:14,950
so this is actually the parent for the

01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:16,700
for the dynamic Rob yes we can go to the

01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:31,610
next ciao

01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:35,710
oh my gosh okay okay yes so yeah okay

01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:40,700
are you coming to that yes

01:34:35,710 --> 01:34:42,740
okay so we have done the underscore slap

01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:44,860
view and you have looked at the validate

01:34:42,740 --> 01:34:47,600
function to validate the URL parameters

01:34:44,860 --> 01:34:49,570
what happens if there's no parameters

01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:52,010
will come to not so soon because of this

01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:53,930
what happens if there's no parameters

01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:57,290
you can that's why we you can create

01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:59,800
index dot view file and then show

01:34:57,290 --> 01:35:02,960
something or redirect them to some place

01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:05,090
fourth or some other place okay so

01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:11,810
that's what's the purpose of the index

01:35:05,090 --> 01:35:14,450
dot file is four okay so next thing we

01:35:11,810 --> 01:35:20,500
have this pager slash diamond then the

01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:20,500
dynamic folder we can add one more thing

01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:29,650
okay we can add one more thing / dynamic

01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:36,100
dot view okay

01:35:37,810 --> 01:35:45,890
so you have to dynamic here what's the

01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:48,170
use of this extra dynamic dot view so

01:35:45,890 --> 01:35:52,160
actually if you want to have a parent

01:35:48,170 --> 01:35:54,830
page for all your diamond dynamic routes

01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:57,620
like you wants a certain information

01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:59,990
like you have a property page you have

01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:03,620
something on the left that you one which

01:35:59,990 --> 01:36:06,020
is common to everything inside there you

01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:07,820
can put the this thing called enemy

01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:11,840
review which matches the folder name

01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:15,230
that is the parent and then inside all

01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:18,500
the slap will be rendered by this nuts

01:36:15,230 --> 01:36:20,960
child thing so your slap is could be a

01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:23,620
different property like some hitch DVD

01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:29,630
flat somewhere or some condo somewhere

01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:33,980
it's all rendered inside it's just like

01:36:29,630 --> 01:36:36,260
a layout justly oh yes but yes you will

01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:37,970
have confusing here after that yeah but

01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:39,860
you can nest it further so all the pages

01:36:37,970 --> 01:36:43,940
everything the routes you can nest and

01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:47,900
nests and nest yeah you can go dynamic

01:36:43,940 --> 01:36:50,180
dynamic sub dynamic stops up Dominic how

01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:54,350
deep you one yeah you can go but please

01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:58,730
yeah don't know it's like wrapping high

01:36:54,350 --> 01:37:02,660
other components yes okay

01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:05,480
so error handling you see that 404 page

01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:06,620
yeah this is quite important cluster

01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:09,140
there's something there are there are

01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:12,010
few ways to handle it okay so I think

01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:17,330
I'll go through this quite quickly yes

01:37:12,010 --> 01:37:19,160
okay so this 404 page the first method

01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:22,250
is but you don't need to do this cake

01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:25,940
cause it's not very good I will explain

01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:30,290
it for for dot view you create 404 page

01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:33,200
and then inside a nuts config there's

01:37:30,290 --> 01:37:35,960
some configuration that you put in to

01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:37,550
achieve redirect back there's some

01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:40,280
problem with this and there's some

01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:42,560
problem with this underscore dot view so

01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:43,730
what is this underscore that view is

01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,460
actually a wild card

01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:50,039
so what cut is your fallback page so

01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:53,429
let's say if you have a slash pages

01:37:50,039 --> 01:37:57,360
and then underscore dot view cave you

01:37:53,429 --> 01:37:58,199
type your URL slash some rubbish you

01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:04,099
send you here

01:37:58,199 --> 01:38:07,800
you send you two so it's a cache on but

01:38:04,099 --> 01:38:11,550
his is better to use the bottom one

01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:13,800
which the layouts slash error okay it's

01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:16,139
actually a pitch although it is put

01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:18,630
inside the layouts folder yeah and don't

01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:21,000
know why but they just did that okay

01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:24,360
and I think I will explain to you why so

01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:31,730
that maybe it's better to and not the

01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:33,949
code yet ok let me go to this okay so

01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:36,510
what's the difference between this tree

01:38:33,949 --> 01:38:38,309
the fall for error is a bit more

01:38:36,510 --> 01:38:40,980
involved you've got to create the view

01:38:38,309 --> 01:38:42,960
file and then you've got to type

01:38:40,980 --> 01:38:45,570
something in the next GSK that's a

01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:47,960
router property you have to do something

01:38:45,570 --> 01:38:51,889
about it

01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:54,000
the other tool they are easy it's ok

01:38:51,889 --> 01:38:56,210
when you want to navigate between the

01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,210
pages

01:38:56,570 --> 01:39:06,179
ok so via the what is it okay so let's

01:39:04,019 --> 01:39:10,800
go via browser URL so you type in blah

01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:13,139
blah blah blah slash some URL ok all of

01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:15,239
these cases will capture the error and

01:39:13,139 --> 01:39:19,650
you go to the error page and you can

01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:21,929
handle it but if it's a pushed a router

01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:23,849
push it's not from the browser where key

01:39:21,929 --> 01:39:26,610
in the root you push on the browser when

01:39:23,849 --> 01:39:27,769
you're navigating the top two will not

01:39:26,610 --> 01:39:31,079
handle it properly

01:39:27,769 --> 01:39:34,650
you go to the default next error page so

01:39:31,079 --> 01:39:37,139
only the last part it will handle the

01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:39,539
thing properly okay this is for

01:39:37,139 --> 01:39:42,989
server-side rendering how about static

01:39:39,539 --> 01:39:44,820
page when you're using not generate same

01:39:42,989 --> 01:39:47,909
thing okay same thing

01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:54,860
this one will handle the error when you

01:39:47,909 --> 01:39:54,860
push on the route and you also handle

01:39:54,949 --> 01:40:03,150
when they type in the URL manually and

01:39:59,599 --> 01:40:04,800
how they actually handle it is

01:40:03,150 --> 01:40:08,219
okay when you're serving a page from

01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:10,440
your from the host when that's the error

01:40:08,219 --> 01:40:12,929
like s3 right as an error out you can

01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:15,030
specify the HTML for that falls back to

01:40:12,929 --> 01:40:17,100
so inside here there's some

01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:18,989
configuration where you can state the

01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:21,989
place to fall back to and you'll fall

01:40:18,989 --> 01:40:25,280
back nicely to that pitch and you get to

01:40:21,989 --> 01:40:32,630
see that now

01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:36,870
yes blablablablabla okay but first

01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:41,159
before we continue if that we'll look at

01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:43,320
what Knox view is consuming right okay

01:40:41,159 --> 01:40:46,380
so okay we have the layout for a thing

01:40:43,320 --> 01:40:48,090
and we have the page so the layout

01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:50,640
Kearney you are seeing only one layout

01:40:48,090 --> 01:40:53,850
we will create another layout for the

01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:55,320
error page okay so your error page one

01:40:53,850 --> 01:40:59,580
supposed to error page the layout will

01:40:55,320 --> 01:41:05,190
look different and we can go to read me

01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:07,739
- read or MD okay we go to number okay

01:41:05,190 --> 01:41:12,949
number one and two is we ignore number

01:41:07,739 --> 01:41:17,630
three also ignore okay let's go to

01:41:12,949 --> 01:41:22,230
there's one thing called nuts error page

01:41:17,630 --> 01:41:25,489
create a foul in the layouts so later

01:41:22,230 --> 01:41:25,489
you see the difference in the layout

01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:38,620
okay layouts / mini-mall this is the

01:41:36,670 --> 01:41:40,690
name I'll call it you can call it

01:41:38,620 --> 01:41:44,530
something else if you want just remember

01:41:40,690 --> 01:41:48,010
to use this the name Lita okay layout /

01:41:44,530 --> 01:41:53,430
mini mode of view I can just copy and

01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:53,430
paste the thing to the layouts folder

01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:04,000
haha okay

01:42:14,679 --> 01:42:21,270
okay

01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:22,920
so we have created a layouts after you

01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:25,860
create layout also inside the same

01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:30,570
folder you will create the area dot view

01:42:25,860 --> 01:42:32,640
this is a very special file name inside

01:42:30,570 --> 01:42:35,610
the layouts because this where Knox will

01:42:32,640 --> 01:42:39,570
go to handle if you have a error 500

01:42:35,610 --> 01:42:41,310
error 404 yeah fine dress the server

01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:44,370
side for for the client side you will

01:42:41,310 --> 01:42:46,800
handle of course one of them they need

01:42:44,370 --> 01:42:55,580
to configure and the host they're

01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:57,930
serving the pitch the error dot view oh

01:42:55,580 --> 01:43:01,590
you can overwrite it

01:42:57,930 --> 01:43:05,640
yes I think so yeah I can override it I

01:43:01,590 --> 01:43:08,220
didn't know exist how come on you mean

01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:11,100
the next then that time uninstall it

01:43:08,220 --> 01:43:14,670
wasn't there you know okay I think they

01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:17,190
might put in that thing yeah cuz I just

01:43:14,670 --> 01:43:25,170
prepared this I think less than a month

01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:30,140
ago yeah okay so the error page once you

01:43:25,170 --> 01:43:34,940
copy and paste very important okay is

01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:37,500
item number tree when it's in a static

01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:40,550
maps when it's in a static page

01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:40,550
okay let's min

01:43:45,519 --> 01:43:49,650
it doesn't

01:43:53,159 --> 01:44:00,320
yeah yes so inside Lux config insider

01:43:57,270 --> 01:44:07,230
generate keyword you have this fall back

01:44:00,320 --> 01:44:09,420
okay if you set it to true yep

01:44:07,230 --> 01:44:13,639
you will use the for photo HTML but this

01:44:09,420 --> 01:44:18,480
one will go back to the error the error

01:44:13,639 --> 01:44:19,860
error error page yes I think I set

01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:23,400
something in the back end let me check

01:44:19,860 --> 01:44:34,429
just check here because the back end

01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:37,500
also needs to fall back where is it oh

01:44:34,429 --> 01:44:50,219
crap okay nevermind I just won't have to

01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:51,840
explain okay the sundeck okay okay so

01:44:50,219 --> 01:44:59,010
this this is important if you are doing

01:44:51,840 --> 01:45:01,889
the nuts generate later okay so we are

01:44:59,010 --> 01:45:04,380
gonna try it out after this okay so

01:45:01,889 --> 01:45:15,230
let's go back to the slide okay so once

01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:15,230
you have copied those 200 is it's okay

01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:19,320
no it's not design site because by your

01:45:18,480 --> 01:45:21,030
web host

01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:24,960
so you they'll fall back to a certain

01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:35,150
pitch like whenever you wanted response

01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:35,150
you're actually okay

01:45:39,510 --> 01:45:48,160
okay so how to test it you go into the

01:45:46,180 --> 01:45:50,050
dynamic menu again I think that's one

01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:52,570
option where sisters are not found or

01:45:50,050 --> 01:45:55,810
something click on it it should fall

01:45:52,570 --> 01:46:04,420
back to that error page does it go to

01:45:55,810 --> 01:46:07,150
that error page yes

01:46:04,420 --> 01:46:11,460
thus okay yes so your seats you should

01:46:07,150 --> 01:46:14,230
see a page not found slash using layouts

01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:17,830
/ error view that is the error view page

01:46:14,230 --> 01:46:19,840
that yeah you are doing okay so once you

01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:21,910
have a some error with your routes

01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:29,170
whether it's four four or five hundred

01:46:21,910 --> 01:46:35,740
site it will come here actually about

01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:37,180
the the static generator page we can you

01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:39,850
might have some questions later I will

01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:44,140
try and clarify on that pad okay because

01:46:39,850 --> 01:46:49,540
I have not I I will try and see how I

01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:53,320
can replicate that problem here okay so

01:46:49,540 --> 01:46:56,050
also what you can try as you type the

01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:58,990
URL you just type a rubbish URL on the

01:46:56,050 --> 01:47:01,980
web browser it should bring you to the

01:46:58,990 --> 01:47:01,980
error picture so

01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:13,679
yeah mmm nope

01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:15,840
yeah yes okay yeah

01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:18,150
so if you have to type a rubbish URL we

01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:20,369
also bring you to the error page okay so

01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:23,909
now okay

01:47:20,369 --> 01:47:26,989
this dynamic routing on a single page

01:47:23,909 --> 01:47:31,050
application it is easily handled so sssr

01:47:26,989 --> 01:47:34,020
how about static pages how do we do it

01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:35,610
because this static pages is all pre

01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:38,400
generated and if you want to generate

01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:40,349
for every dynamic route for every

01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:44,400
dynamic piece of data which may be in

01:47:40,349 --> 01:47:46,560
the database and it can change you have

01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:52,199
a problem so there are a few ways it's

01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:54,719
not perfect but can be handled okay so

01:47:52,199 --> 01:47:58,650
one of the ways that nuts actually or

01:47:54,719 --> 01:48:04,980
less zoom in zoom that they show how to

01:47:58,650 --> 01:48:08,580
do it ah nothing zoom oh okay yes so

01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:10,469
inside January inside the next config

01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:13,710
just the January properties that this

01:48:10,469 --> 01:48:15,780
wraps okay and weapons is that there's a

01:48:13,710 --> 01:48:17,730
function that's being caught you go to

01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:20,790
our API let's say for example you want

01:48:17,730 --> 01:48:23,250
to generate routes for all your users so

01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:26,369
it goes inside here and then it finds

01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:27,780
all the user IDs and then your generates

01:48:26,369 --> 01:48:30,150
so if you have 1 million users

01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:33,210
I don't know what and some of your users

01:48:30,150 --> 01:48:39,900
change or things change it's not good ok

01:48:33,210 --> 01:48:42,750
so yeah so what you can do is ok inside

01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:45,570
that custom error page there's a few

01:48:42,750 --> 01:48:48,989
things you can do you can allow the user

01:48:45,570 --> 01:48:53,639
to click a link to push to some other

01:48:48,989 --> 01:48:57,869
route that is known or you can drink the

01:48:53,639 --> 01:49:02,909
mounting of the page you can route the

01:48:57,869 --> 01:49:08,699
person to to the URL that is 404 key so

01:49:02,909 --> 01:49:15,170
why prints is that ok let's say you have

01:49:08,699 --> 01:49:18,650
a slash user slash essay Aaron

01:49:15,170 --> 01:49:20,940
okay because this pitch is not generated

01:49:18,650 --> 01:49:23,190
the static picture is not generative

01:49:20,940 --> 01:49:26,130
because it is dynamic it will go to the

01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:27,989
error page okay

01:49:26,130 --> 01:49:29,670
and what happens is that inside the

01:49:27,989 --> 01:49:34,710
error page because you can have this

01:49:29,670 --> 01:49:38,610
information you can do a push okay push

01:49:34,710 --> 01:49:43,739
to this place and if let's say I really

01:49:38,610 --> 01:49:47,280
exist inside that would be good but

01:49:43,739 --> 01:49:49,829
let's say if I do not exist so what's

01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:52,320
gonna happen here I do not exist it's

01:49:49,829 --> 01:49:53,250
gonna go back and forth back and forth

01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:57,510
error

01:49:53,250 --> 01:50:00,090
yeah so so you have to be careful how

01:49:57,510 --> 01:50:01,739
you handle this I'm still trying to find

01:50:00,090 --> 01:50:04,139
a way to see whether it can be better

01:50:01,739 --> 01:50:06,210
handle so but the two ways that's so

01:50:04,139 --> 01:50:07,289
five-figure is you add immediately

01:50:06,210 --> 01:50:13,260
pushed by make sure you know that that

01:50:07,289 --> 01:50:14,820
person is there or you click a link so

01:50:13,260 --> 01:50:16,829
maybe in between what can happen is

01:50:14,820 --> 01:50:18,599
actually before pushing you actually

01:50:16,829 --> 01:50:20,849
check the database to find out that's

01:50:18,599 --> 01:50:23,219
this person and then you push and if you

01:50:20,849 --> 01:50:26,880
don't find a person then you show the

01:50:23,219 --> 01:50:28,920
button to that say it's not found and to

01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:32,429
go somewhere else that could be one

01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:39,349
workaround okay so this is how the error

01:50:32,429 --> 01:50:44,309
handling is done okay you can proceed

01:50:39,349 --> 01:50:46,340
okay okay time for another okay this one

01:50:44,309 --> 01:50:48,770
would be a very quick break

01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:53,880
yeah I think don't trust this not anyway

01:50:48,770 --> 01:50:58,349
the top that the top three react users

01:50:53,880 --> 01:51:01,139
is actually Singapore India and Sri

01:50:58,349 --> 01:51:04,289
Lanka according to the search yeah so I

01:51:01,139 --> 01:51:07,650
pray in Japan is one of the Japan and

01:51:04,289 --> 01:51:10,530
channels on the top users so you see the

01:51:07,650 --> 01:51:13,440
blue color that's and a red colored

01:51:10,530 --> 01:51:15,420
there's a difference you know where

01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:19,239
which people use what a lot of Eastern

01:51:15,420 --> 01:51:22,060
European companies use it I think yeah

01:51:19,239 --> 01:51:24,730
yeah but one of my one of my colleagues

01:51:22,060 --> 01:51:29,680
at angularjs right and then angular on

01:51:24,730 --> 01:51:30,940
top view non-existent yeah but angular

01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:33,060
on Google right and then this Google

01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:37,080
search I don't know what they do whoo

01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:40,180
okay let's go on

01:51:37,080 --> 01:51:41,860
okay so nuts options and life cycles

01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:47,219
actually we have gone through it but I'm

01:51:41,860 --> 01:51:50,920
just gonna go to the owners shorebreak

01:51:47,219 --> 01:51:56,170
okay five minutes five minutes

01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:59,850
we have time yes five minutes you can

01:51:56,170 --> 01:51:59,850
get a grab a drink or something

01:52:00,390 --> 01:52:18,239
toilet break very handy for 34

01:52:22,969 --> 01:52:27,869
there's an X event

01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:30,540
okay

01:52:27,869 --> 01:53:10,159
that means we end it for the showers we

01:52:30,540 --> 01:53:10,159
have one are slightly less okay okay

01:53:13,080 --> 01:53:35,140
is okay is it die okay not too heavy

01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:37,420
going on yes actually but we use Knox to

01:53:35,140 --> 01:53:38,830
generate the static there's another

01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:42,610
option that I'll show you later

01:53:38,830 --> 01:53:59,590
yes it's not just knocks yes you can do

01:53:42,610 --> 01:54:01,750
static websites okay it's inside the

01:53:59,590 --> 01:54:07,620
Knox options you can she put the header

01:54:01,750 --> 01:54:10,510
or the meta tags and so on to generate

01:54:07,620 --> 01:54:12,220
yes you generate those meta text for

01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:15,100
each is different for different pitch

01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:20,640
you'll be up yes you can put the same I

01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:20,640
can put different yeah yes

01:54:21,699 --> 01:54:27,940
yeah it was a bit heavy going in the

01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:27,940
earlier panel

01:54:30,679 --> 01:54:36,860
oh okay but

01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:43,429
are you able to run it okay

01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:47,380
Oh on the machines okay but are you able

01:54:43,429 --> 01:54:47,380
to get a example running or something

01:54:47,469 --> 01:54:56,110
okay

01:54:48,650 --> 01:54:59,630
are you with her the Machine No ah yes

01:54:56,110 --> 01:55:03,380
okay so actually if the the final answer

01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:05,690
is all inside the yeah but there could

01:55:03,380 --> 01:55:08,710
be some problems are so is better to run

01:55:05,690 --> 01:55:11,710
it later and I see that it works yes

01:55:08,710 --> 01:55:11,710
okay

01:55:21,370 --> 01:56:24,560
okay oh yes yes public sites yeah

01:56:21,800 --> 01:56:26,600
the short story on Knox is previously

01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:29,090
the complainer worked is uh they're very

01:56:26,600 --> 01:56:31,100
heavy into the public site so yeah

01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:34,040
decide a static web sites was what they

01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:37,060
were looking at because the SPS can I

01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:37,060
can do sp

01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:55,030
I'm gonna go but I went

01:56:59,780 --> 01:57:08,120
okay another two minutes two minutes

01:57:19,310 --> 01:57:23,980
to the developers plan would be keep

01:57:21,260 --> 01:57:23,980
using reactor

01:57:28,090 --> 01:57:38,430
being unaccompanied with the crank use

01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:45,439
[Music]

01:57:46,540 --> 01:57:54,430
it's the charge of abuse you

01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:54,430
the network offers a lot

01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:01,640
okay

01:58:10,270 --> 01:58:13,389
[Music]

01:58:19,059 --> 01:58:23,940
oh gosh okay

01:58:44,110 --> 01:58:49,409
ah it's

01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:53,650
yes okay

01:58:58,790 --> 01:59:06,510
okay thank you everybody for joining

01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:10,020
this far we are coming to the last two

01:59:06,510 --> 01:59:13,410
stages okay I'll take a Slav question

01:59:10,020 --> 01:59:17,670
sir okay so you go to the next life

01:59:13,410 --> 01:59:20,340
cycle okay this is the nuts life cycle

01:59:17,670 --> 01:59:25,949
which includes the server site but we

01:59:20,340 --> 01:59:29,070
can ignore the server site if you know

01:59:25,949 --> 01:59:31,340
the surface ID we are doing SPS they are

01:59:29,070 --> 01:59:35,040
studying generator websites okay so

01:59:31,340 --> 01:59:39,020
first thing is the incoming requests for

01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:42,210
a pitch you get the headers whatever

01:59:39,020 --> 01:59:43,500
canucks will work on it okay the first

01:59:42,210 --> 01:59:46,739
thing it goes to is this thing called

01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:49,830
NOx server in it so what does this thing

01:59:46,739 --> 01:59:52,170
do actually okay so for react we have

01:59:49,830 --> 01:59:53,880
Redux if of you you have you act these

01:59:52,170 --> 01:59:56,219
thoughts but these thoughts exist in the

01:59:53,880 --> 01:59:59,219
browser side so I'm going to transfer

01:59:56,219 --> 02:00:01,140
order information from their food from

01:59:59,219 --> 02:00:04,650
the server to the browser this is the

02:00:01,140 --> 02:00:13,530
one right this one will do it for you

02:00:04,650 --> 02:00:17,400
okay okay so and then next after that

02:00:13,530 --> 02:00:21,120
yeah after the working on the store so

02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:26,870
you go to the middle way read the next

02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:29,400
config and then there are all the pages

02:00:26,870 --> 02:00:32,840
then it will do the validation that you

02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:36,090
see if it fails is the send you to the

02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:39,060
404 page order fine yeah now for

02:00:36,090 --> 02:00:40,560
something pitch okay and then so

02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:42,210
validate we have released scenery did

02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:47,130
this actually one of the knocks options

02:00:42,210 --> 02:00:50,670
okay after that a sync data and fetch

02:00:47,130 --> 02:00:54,570
okay so what are these two facing data

02:00:50,670 --> 02:00:58,590
basically it's like you're getting the

02:00:54,570 --> 02:01:01,530
data first in the backend before you put

02:00:58,590 --> 02:01:03,570
it in the front end if you just as this

02:01:01,530 --> 02:01:08,070
thing called data the data where you

02:01:03,570 --> 02:01:10,870
store all your yo data

02:01:08,070 --> 02:01:13,060
so it's on the browser side so this

02:01:10,870 --> 02:01:18,100
acing data it gets all the things and

02:01:13,060 --> 02:01:21,790
then it copies it onto the data yes

02:01:18,100 --> 02:01:24,880
so for fetch similarly it will do a I

02:01:21,790 --> 02:01:27,190
synchronous call fetch and then put

02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:29,230
things inside your store

02:01:27,190 --> 02:01:31,840
he was the difference between the just

02:01:29,230 --> 02:01:36,430
not a nut server in it and this one here

02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:40,300
not server in it if you do API call

02:01:36,430 --> 02:01:42,969
inside there what happens is that you

02:01:40,300 --> 02:01:44,680
take the API if if the result is small

02:01:42,969 --> 02:01:48,820
it's still ok then you render the page

02:01:44,680 --> 02:01:52,960
by the result is big you will go fetch

02:01:48,820 --> 02:01:55,180
all the data populate so you take a long

02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:59,440
time and then after that you render

02:01:55,180 --> 02:02:01,630
which is may not be so good so just be

02:01:59,440 --> 02:02:04,450
careful inside that the server side

02:02:01,630 --> 02:02:06,280
please please try not to collect all the

02:02:04,450 --> 02:02:08,610
data from the server side and then

02:02:06,280 --> 02:02:11,500
render it it's like going back to PHP

02:02:08,610 --> 02:02:12,730
nor you color everything so do it

02:02:11,500 --> 02:02:15,280
somewhere else

02:02:12,730 --> 02:02:19,540
ok do it somewhere else yeah I've seen

02:02:15,280 --> 02:02:21,550
that mistakes happen so the the website

02:02:19,540 --> 02:02:23,230
just takes a long time to load because

02:02:21,550 --> 02:02:25,719
there's a lot of data they load it on

02:02:23,230 --> 02:02:29,290
the server and it comes out ok so after

02:02:25,719 --> 02:02:31,060
that render ok and yeah so I think the

02:02:29,290 --> 02:02:33,239
big takeaway is about the loading of the

02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:33,239
data

02:02:45,280 --> 02:03:28,969
and this is again that's a yes so it's

02:03:26,179 --> 02:03:30,860
not gonna be waiting anymore and for

02:03:28,969 --> 02:03:35,239
every follow-up time this would still

02:03:30,860 --> 02:03:37,909
get paper so we can load out whatever

02:03:35,239 --> 02:03:40,820
value we see we can see in our developer

02:03:37,909 --> 02:03:43,090
console platform or Firefox and whatever

02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:45,559
we're logging out

02:03:43,090 --> 02:03:51,409
yeah to debug here it's actually quite

02:03:45,559 --> 02:03:54,260
pin pool but uh course okay yes so this

02:03:51,409 --> 02:03:56,389
is that four SS are capable SP a you can

02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:59,659
forget about this for ESPYs

02:03:56,389 --> 02:04:02,420
yeah okay for static generated websites

02:03:59,659 --> 02:04:05,440
what you do is you'll go through this

02:04:02,420 --> 02:04:08,630
thing once to generate or your HTML

02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:11,030
after that when you surf the pages is on

02:04:08,630 --> 02:04:14,659
a browser is this I already so actually

02:04:11,030 --> 02:04:16,789
this acing data this fetch missed is

02:04:14,659 --> 02:04:19,849
quite useless there you just use the

02:04:16,789 --> 02:04:24,920
mounted hope to do your course yeah if

02:04:19,849 --> 02:04:28,329
you want okay so yes so now we go to the

02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:31,730
nuts options here we have been to a

02:04:28,329 --> 02:04:34,219
Singh data once running once on the

02:04:31,730 --> 02:04:37,909
server and then every time you navigate

02:04:34,219 --> 02:04:40,909
to the pitch is gets called it's the

02:04:37,909 --> 02:04:43,699
unmounted you guys cool yes

02:04:40,909 --> 02:04:45,409
fetch same thing so AG we are doing a

02:04:43,699 --> 02:04:47,869
static pages right I think you don't

02:04:45,409 --> 02:04:51,199
need to use those by we are doing SSR

02:04:47,869 --> 02:04:52,219
yes you can use those it's just a you

02:04:51,199 --> 02:04:54,679
Newland

02:04:52,219 --> 02:04:56,599
so just be mounting splint okay so

02:04:54,679 --> 02:04:58,909
somebody asked about how about the

02:04:56,599 --> 02:05:00,710
haters or the things each different page

02:04:58,909 --> 02:05:03,769
you wanna say more different header

02:05:00,710 --> 02:05:06,949
there's this nuts option called hip so

02:05:03,769 --> 02:05:33,409
you can put all your meta texts and so

02:05:06,949 --> 02:05:36,019
on you can yes and that's one other

02:05:33,409 --> 02:05:38,539
thing you can do does this think of

02:05:36,019 --> 02:05:43,539
process is in sign next context which we

02:05:38,539 --> 02:05:47,539
also go to process server equals to true

02:05:43,539 --> 02:05:50,449
this basically tells ya on the server

02:05:47,539 --> 02:05:53,599
side so if you see this you can don't do

02:05:50,449 --> 02:05:56,269
your async fetch for very big data set

02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:58,400
and you can put you can don't run your

02:05:56,269 --> 02:06:01,719
window code inside here like event

02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:05,559
listener okay so you run it on the elves

02:06:01,719 --> 02:06:08,119
yes okay so yep

02:06:05,559 --> 02:06:09,769
this actually scream button the process

02:06:08,119 --> 02:06:12,260
server this is the most important thing

02:06:09,769 --> 02:06:13,519
process dot server or process dot client

02:06:12,260 --> 02:06:16,900
because you need to detect what is the

02:06:13,519 --> 02:06:20,360
front rendered or a back render okay

02:06:16,900 --> 02:06:22,789
layup okay so layout we've seen how to

02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:26,119
use it inside the error view there's

02:06:22,789 --> 02:06:28,729
actually a layouts property okay so this

02:06:26,119 --> 02:06:32,179
way it changes the look of the layouts

02:06:28,729 --> 02:06:36,139
to be different middle way and we use it

02:06:32,179 --> 02:06:37,789
also for authentication scroll to top so

02:06:36,139 --> 02:06:39,829
if you want to jump to the top page when

02:06:37,789 --> 02:06:42,949
you navigate this is the one it's very

02:06:39,829 --> 02:06:46,309
easy this one transition I can be

02:06:42,949 --> 02:06:49,579
between page transitions validate we've

02:06:46,309 --> 02:06:52,130
seen already validating the route watch

02:06:49,579 --> 02:06:53,809
curious on a server side so your query

02:06:52,130 --> 02:06:55,280
strings each time it's changes that you

02:06:53,809 --> 02:06:57,499
can use this to watch the career change

02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:59,539
and then do whatever you want with it so

02:06:57,499 --> 02:07:01,600
far don't know what to do with it you

02:06:59,539 --> 02:07:05,000
know

02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:07,100
all right no man waiting of it will let

02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:09,500
you know yeah but this will watch the

02:07:07,100 --> 02:07:12,260
querystring change last thing is the

02:07:09,500 --> 02:07:14,270
loading so if you navigate between the

02:07:12,260 --> 02:07:16,580
pages or so that's actually a nice white

02:07:14,270 --> 02:07:19,450
bar but you can overwrite it

02:07:16,580 --> 02:07:33,200
yeah so the loading loading loading

02:07:19,450 --> 02:07:37,130
thing when you go between the pages yeah

02:07:33,200 --> 02:07:44,830
you can watch Karif oh okay

02:07:37,130 --> 02:07:48,170
yes so we cover this next slide okay so

02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:50,450
for Knox generate static web pages the

02:07:48,170 --> 02:07:53,420
Knox server you need a Singh data fetch

02:07:50,450 --> 02:07:59,990
basically they are and actually not much

02:07:53,420 --> 02:08:02,810
use if there is no server inside Knox

02:07:59,990 --> 02:08:05,210
generate because it's all generated once

02:08:02,810 --> 02:08:07,940
and it's all push to the browser so you

02:08:05,210 --> 02:08:09,650
don't need the distinct or no ESS are I

02:08:07,940 --> 02:08:13,490
will show you what this is again there's

02:08:09,650 --> 02:08:16,490
something extra to learn you don't need

02:08:13,490 --> 02:08:18,680
to worry about SSR inside your plugins

02:08:16,490 --> 02:08:20,240
okay because your plugins you need to

02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:22,040
worry about SSR because you load your

02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:27,220
plug-in which has a window component and

02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:29,060
it renders inside the server 500 error

02:08:27,220 --> 02:08:31,520
there's this thing called server

02:08:29,060 --> 02:08:33,770
middleware okay so it's like you have

02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:37,040
Express server in this middleware this

02:08:33,770 --> 02:08:38,690
is running on the server side I frankly

02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:40,820
I don't really like to use it but you

02:08:38,690 --> 02:08:43,460
can read more is to run some server

02:08:40,820 --> 02:08:49,910
thing inside but you can actually use

02:08:43,460 --> 02:08:53,120
express itself okay so new life cycle so

02:08:49,910 --> 02:08:56,210
view lifecycle that's created where it's

02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:58,250
like component the amount then that's

02:08:56,210 --> 02:08:59,720
mounted that's a before destroy and

02:08:58,250 --> 02:09:05,170
that's update okay update is there

02:08:59,720 --> 02:09:05,170
dangerous to use so weapons is that only

02:09:05,230 --> 02:09:13,220
only the created hook is caught on the

02:09:10,790 --> 02:09:14,630
server side yes the mountain and the

02:09:13,220 --> 02:09:16,850
rest they are not

02:09:14,630 --> 02:09:21,260
so we have to be careful that's only

02:09:16,850 --> 02:09:26,780
created hook is in the server side yeah

02:09:21,260 --> 02:09:28,670
Martin has no use okay so I think we can

02:09:26,780 --> 02:09:32,060
zoom into the last line this one shows

02:09:28,670 --> 02:09:38,080
something very important which is the

02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:38,080
context this is one of the one of the

02:09:38,139 --> 02:09:43,310
objects inside next yes so your user

02:09:41,570 --> 02:09:46,010
agent where do you get your user agent

02:09:43,310 --> 02:09:48,710
from so if you have a server-side

02:09:46,010 --> 02:09:50,179
rendering and if let's say your process

02:09:48,710 --> 02:09:53,510
server is true damage rending or from

02:09:50,179 --> 02:09:56,330
the server side you can actually get it

02:09:53,510 --> 02:09:58,219
from the request headers okay but if

02:09:56,330 --> 02:10:00,260
let's say you don't have a server side

02:09:58,219 --> 02:10:05,330
it's on the front end so you get it from

02:10:00,260 --> 02:10:07,610
the navigator.useragent oh actually you

02:10:05,330 --> 02:10:09,800
can not across I was just trying to

02:10:07,610 --> 02:10:12,620
explain that inside that knocks January

02:10:09,800 --> 02:10:16,550
you only can use the Navigator flag

02:10:12,620 --> 02:10:18,260
because it's no longer yeah it's not

02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:20,989
generating but this is a good

02:10:18,260 --> 02:10:24,050
illustration on the server side in SS

02:10:20,989 --> 02:10:25,310
arting so ssi eraklyon is quite a

02:10:24,050 --> 02:10:31,400
headache but there are some advantages

02:10:25,310 --> 02:10:34,030
to it okay so we move on yes so this is

02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:41,239
a something that you should be aware of

02:10:34,030 --> 02:10:43,480
we will see some problems okay let me

02:10:41,239 --> 02:10:43,480
see

02:10:45,010 --> 02:10:54,220
clean em mine yes okay so let's go to a

02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:57,080
variable in server a maybe zoom in mean

02:10:54,220 --> 02:10:58,430
okay we need to know what is rendered in

02:10:57,080 --> 02:10:59,000
a client and what this render in the

02:10:58,430 --> 02:11:00,890
server

02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:03,350
okay sorry before that there's this

02:11:00,890 --> 02:11:04,820
thing called Knox context so there are

02:11:03,350 --> 02:11:06,890
actually a few things inside there is

02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:08,840
not too difficult you can just go to and

02:11:06,890 --> 02:11:11,360
see what is inside the client and

02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:13,100
western side server so you need to find

02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:13,820
out when a server client and know when

02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:16,340
to use it

02:11:13,820 --> 02:11:16,730
okay so sample what is available in a

02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:20,480
server

02:11:16,730 --> 02:11:21,920
the requests you know so oh you're like

02:11:20,480 --> 02:11:24,380
you're authorizing took on everything

02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:26,510
you can grab it from the header but so

02:11:24,380 --> 02:11:28,550
if you're under SP a or so on sorry you

02:11:26,510 --> 02:11:31,400
don't have it on a client you have this

02:11:28,550 --> 02:11:32,950
window Navigator local storage so we've

02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:36,530
used any of this inside the server

02:11:32,950 --> 02:11:40,570
rendering page bye-bye local storage get

02:11:36,530 --> 02:11:46,250
item inside yeah serve a pitch bye-bye

02:11:40,570 --> 02:11:48,700
okay let's go next talking about the

02:11:46,250 --> 02:11:49,910
problems but not seeing it in real life

02:11:48,700 --> 02:11:54,440
okay

02:11:49,910 --> 02:11:56,620
so the problems if the SS are yes zoom

02:11:54,440 --> 02:11:56,620
in

02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:05,100
sorry yes

02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:06,420
actually don't eat but I just won but

02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:10,500
it's okay

02:12:06,420 --> 02:12:12,180
so uncreated hook is only run in the

02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:13,920
server oh goodness

02:12:12,180 --> 02:12:18,630
it is very difficult to see able to

02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:24,480
build it yeah it's all run on both yeah

02:12:18,630 --> 02:12:26,760
sorry sorry okay so okay the top if if

02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:29,880
it's in a client okay you know it's in a

02:12:26,760 --> 02:12:33,930
claim so the elms you are in the server

02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:35,490
you can cut and paste this code and then

02:12:33,930 --> 02:12:43,080
you put this window dot add

02:12:35,490 --> 02:12:46,710
eventlistener click wait no it's it's

02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:48,600
correct because my show the error yes so

02:12:46,710 --> 02:12:51,210
if you are inside the server and you run

02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:52,050
this window dot event listener you will

02:12:51,210 --> 02:12:54,240
see the problem

02:12:52,050 --> 02:12:56,760
okay I'm only talking about it but if

02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:58,920
you put this code in you will see the

02:12:56,760 --> 02:13:01,350
problem you it doesn't have to be even

02:12:58,920 --> 02:13:03,720
this one can be any window thing you run

02:13:01,350 --> 02:13:05,790
it in the server side it will blow up

02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:09,600
okay

02:13:05,790 --> 02:13:13,710
okay next design is okay this doesn't

02:13:09,600 --> 02:13:18,240
explain it okay so next hydration

02:13:13,710 --> 02:13:19,260
failure okay so yeah the Sun you also

02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:22,470
get this error

02:13:19,260 --> 02:13:25,590
they say hydration something let's zoom

02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:29,550
into the coat okay we I hope you can see

02:13:25,590 --> 02:13:32,310
okay so we have this thing called date

02:13:29,550 --> 02:13:36,090
picker he is a date picker from the

02:13:32,310 --> 02:13:40,020
front-end side okay what happens is that

02:13:36,090 --> 02:13:43,230
okay you can scroll to the side shorter

02:13:40,020 --> 02:13:46,440
left sorry left okay so if the process

02:13:43,230 --> 02:13:48,090
in the browser then we require the date

02:13:46,440 --> 02:13:49,860
picker component because this day

02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:51,750
typical component inside there's

02:13:49,860 --> 02:13:53,910
probably some windows event listener or

02:13:51,750 --> 02:13:57,570
something so you only listen in a

02:13:53,910 --> 02:14:01,560
browser but the problem is when you

02:13:57,570 --> 02:14:03,450
render it in a server you cannot find it

02:14:01,560 --> 02:14:03,840
because this thing only coming in a

02:14:03,450 --> 02:14:06,860
browser

02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:11,490
okay so you will get the hydration

02:14:06,860 --> 02:14:17,110
failure okay we can zoom back okay

02:14:11,490 --> 02:14:19,840
okay that means means the client site

02:14:17,110 --> 02:14:21,820
when they render the whole Dom she right

02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:25,030
the thing is not found this thing it's

02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:48,130
not found so the service idea hydrogen

02:14:25,030 --> 02:14:52,570
you want to explain your baptized yes

02:14:48,130 --> 02:14:54,450
yes okay so yeah so the client-side it's

02:14:52,570 --> 02:14:57,610
not matching the service that content

02:14:54,450 --> 02:14:59,230
and then so they're called bailing

02:14:57,610 --> 02:15:02,770
hydration blah blah blah so how to fix

02:14:59,230 --> 02:15:07,000
it so you just wrap the component the

02:15:02,770 --> 02:15:08,460
day typical with this no SS are ting yes

02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:15,460
it's as simple as that

02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:16,570
other that are you yeah actually that's

02:15:15,460 --> 02:15:23,530
one more thing can do

02:15:16,570 --> 02:15:26,830
does this be v if v if v if it's a huge

02:15:23,530 --> 02:15:30,040
s in text so if V if is true you will

02:15:26,830 --> 02:15:31,960
render that component if not you want so

02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:34,600
you can do I think and do a V if na if

02:15:31,960 --> 02:15:37,200
process is browser then you render the

02:15:34,600 --> 02:15:37,200
component

02:15:39,790 --> 02:15:58,790
yes in the server side you won't have

02:15:48,920 --> 02:16:01,520
that thing yes so you come up yes and

02:15:58,790 --> 02:16:05,060
she this SSR thing there's a few more

02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:07,700
problems with it that I was working on

02:16:05,060 --> 02:16:09,830
it's not if the pitch is slow to load

02:16:07,700 --> 02:16:12,739
and then there's some things that are

02:16:09,830 --> 02:16:16,310
happening you will see some really weird

02:16:12,739 --> 02:16:18,739
things happening like you type on the

02:16:16,310 --> 02:16:23,170
input you type one input but because

02:16:18,739 --> 02:16:26,780
it's a HTML input and the CSS is not

02:16:23,170 --> 02:16:28,310
yeah HDMI input the JavaScript has not

02:16:26,780 --> 02:16:30,020
loaded yet you can type in but then

02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:32,480
suddenly after the whole JavaScript

02:16:30,020 --> 02:16:35,240
everything loaded the whole thing just

02:16:32,480 --> 02:16:37,969
wipes out in the you you the string is

02:16:35,240 --> 02:16:39,710
empty yeah there's some way to fix it

02:16:37,969 --> 02:16:41,900
but I can remember about hope you don't

02:16:39,710 --> 02:16:56,840
mean error it was something wrong that

02:16:41,900 --> 02:16:57,440
that we did yeah and yeah and one more

02:16:56,840 --> 02:16:59,780
thing

02:16:57,440 --> 02:17:02,059
you have to know which one you want to

02:16:59,780 --> 02:17:04,639
render and which I don't want to render

02:17:02,059 --> 02:17:08,450
sometimes some of the blocks right the

02:17:04,639 --> 02:17:10,670
HTML the the template blocks you really

02:17:08,450 --> 02:17:13,250
need to like be careful where you want

02:17:10,670 --> 02:17:15,980
to render the thing and then OSS are

02:17:13,250 --> 02:17:17,240
actually helps does help a lot but that

02:17:15,980 --> 02:17:20,450
means everything is still rendered on

02:17:17,240 --> 02:17:28,620
the client-side which will defeat the

02:17:20,450 --> 02:17:30,750
purpose of that yes right

02:17:28,620 --> 02:17:32,820
so the Sun I mean there's are small

02:17:30,750 --> 02:17:37,040
little things you have to be aware it's

02:17:32,820 --> 02:17:39,450
not 100% perfect but you can manage it

02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:41,910
yeah always manage it

02:17:39,450 --> 02:17:43,920
maybe there'll be another topic that can

02:17:41,910 --> 02:17:46,109
write about but so five not encountered

02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:49,530
that that problem I didn't count it

02:17:46,109 --> 02:17:53,880
about a year plus ago by yeah not the

02:17:49,530 --> 02:17:57,870
place anymore yes so hydration error

02:17:53,880 --> 02:17:58,500
kaida next one on this one is a error

02:17:57,870 --> 02:18:03,479
depth

02:17:58,500 --> 02:18:05,399
I couldn't there's no answer in Google

02:18:03,479 --> 02:18:07,080
but we managed to fix it by trial and

02:18:05,399 --> 02:18:12,870
error okay zoom in zoom in zoom in zoom

02:18:07,080 --> 02:18:16,080
in zoom in so you have a store nuts view

02:18:12,870 --> 02:18:18,300
GS door view Jess has this concept

02:18:16,080 --> 02:18:20,519
modules for just also can have a store

02:18:18,300 --> 02:18:23,309
for a user you can have a store for

02:18:20,519 --> 02:18:25,410
product canvas store for something else

02:18:23,309 --> 02:18:28,649
so you modularize it but the thing is

02:18:25,410 --> 02:18:31,139
the aesthetic you create the file inside

02:18:28,649 --> 02:18:35,820
the store for the what happens if you

02:18:31,139 --> 02:18:38,790
have a component that you want to have

02:18:35,820 --> 02:18:42,510
the component created dynamically and a

02:18:38,790 --> 02:18:45,290
store called Dominic Li okay nevermind

02:18:42,510 --> 02:18:53,219
this one that is available in a slice

02:18:45,290 --> 02:18:57,719
okay so this store register module

02:18:53,219 --> 02:19:00,300
actually is the one that you can call

02:18:57,719 --> 02:19:05,820
the register dynamic store but the

02:19:00,300 --> 02:19:09,809
problem is after registering I get the

02:19:05,820 --> 02:19:11,870
problem that the state is not found not

02:19:09,809 --> 02:19:16,530
found not found that state is not found

02:19:11,870 --> 02:19:20,670
so what happens is that I actually

02:19:16,530 --> 02:19:23,189
needed to have one more line below to

02:19:20,670 --> 02:19:27,059
initialize the state again I don't know

02:19:23,189 --> 02:19:31,109
why but this is happening so after I put

02:19:27,059 --> 02:19:34,019
this in it's fixed because if I don't

02:19:31,109 --> 02:19:36,990
have this listing below the comet set

02:19:34,019 --> 02:19:39,300
counter blah you would not what this one

02:19:36,990 --> 02:19:41,490
is inside your key I think this one we

02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:42,330
can try it's inside your code another

02:19:41,490 --> 02:20:00,390
public dot

02:19:42,330 --> 02:20:07,800
you know public view yeah okay let's go

02:20:00,390 --> 02:20:09,930
public dot view yes run in okay oh it's

02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:13,830
not here

02:20:09,930 --> 02:20:17,521
secured oh oh oh yes it is created

02:20:13,830 --> 02:20:22,250
instead of create that function okay so

02:20:17,521 --> 02:20:22,250
now you just open your console or f12

02:20:26,761 --> 02:20:34,690
okay so that's this test and test and

02:20:30,011 --> 02:20:39,450
you just comment out these two yeah just

02:20:34,690 --> 02:20:43,771
comment out these two lines and then run

02:20:39,450 --> 02:20:48,030
is just being run okay let's see okay

02:20:43,771 --> 02:20:48,030
and then let's see what happens

02:20:49,921 --> 02:21:00,070
yeah some problem already if it's some

02:20:52,841 --> 02:21:07,271
problem is good yes I know this one may

02:21:00,070 --> 02:21:10,381
not be carry fresh okay click on the

02:21:07,271 --> 02:21:13,511
test ha ha

02:21:10,381 --> 02:21:17,190
can I read okay so once you reload the

02:21:13,511 --> 02:21:21,931
page right that's a button called test

02:21:17,190 --> 02:21:24,431
you just need to click on it and then

02:21:21,931 --> 02:21:27,070
the others button on the right test and

02:21:24,431 --> 02:21:28,601
then use console you see the error okay

02:21:27,070 --> 02:21:32,910
this was the problem you cannot even

02:21:28,601 --> 02:21:32,910
increment the counter inside

02:21:35,900 --> 02:21:40,521
okay you can comment it back and then

02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:53,330
this tae-yong come in and see what

02:21:40,521 --> 02:21:55,130
happens again case so anybody getting

02:21:53,330 --> 02:22:01,510
error I hope everybody's getting our

02:21:55,130 --> 02:22:05,120
error okay yes so once you are done

02:22:01,510 --> 02:22:07,580
commented back uncommented back refresh

02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:12,021
and click again it should work properly

02:22:07,580 --> 02:22:15,200
I don't know why it happened I have no

02:22:12,021 --> 02:22:24,080
time to dig into the framework so but

02:22:15,200 --> 02:22:31,330
yeah Stalin era him yes we can go to the

02:22:24,080 --> 02:22:33,920
slave and we can okay so everybody

02:22:31,330 --> 02:22:38,061
uncommon and then try okay

02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:40,220
yours okay magnificus so you managed to

02:22:38,061 --> 02:22:42,620
get the error oh okay then come in

02:22:40,220 --> 02:22:44,990
uncommon you manage to get the errors

02:22:42,620 --> 02:22:52,690
right okay it's now uncommented and

02:22:44,990 --> 02:22:52,690
click okay ready yes okay okay can okay

02:22:54,120 --> 02:23:04,220
oh it's inside that same file there's a

02:22:59,420 --> 02:23:09,870
con click yet click equals to test

02:23:04,220 --> 02:23:13,530
equals to a double quote test yeah you

02:23:09,870 --> 02:23:16,580
say you all okay can see the problem and

02:23:13,530 --> 02:23:20,820
then I take uncomment it should be okay

02:23:16,580 --> 02:23:23,300
yes so this one yeah I do trial and

02:23:20,820 --> 02:23:27,450
error many many I think of I think

02:23:23,300 --> 02:23:29,280
recess for many hours on this yeah I

02:23:27,450 --> 02:23:35,030
refuse to accept that this thing cannot

02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:38,609
work yeah but you need to do it for a

02:23:35,030 --> 02:23:42,090
lot of things inside the state Canaan

02:23:38,609 --> 02:23:43,830
one tip is the state right don't need to

02:23:42,090 --> 02:23:45,870
put everything inside the state just

02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:47,580
important things try not to use state

02:23:45,870 --> 02:23:59,910
for everything

02:23:47,580 --> 02:24:02,670
spin pool okay okay so now we come to

02:23:59,910 --> 02:24:06,630
some interesting things but fortunately

02:24:02,670 --> 02:24:12,020
is not happening anymore he so there are

02:24:06,630 --> 02:24:12,020
some did have issues can zoom the thing

02:24:13,399 --> 02:24:19,880
okay inside the Knux code right inside

02:24:16,979 --> 02:24:25,050
some way inside a people found that this

02:24:19,880 --> 02:24:27,359
single line takes three seconds yes so

02:24:25,050 --> 02:24:30,689
you may have a lot of requests there's

02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:32,550
going to be a problem so yeah a planet

02:24:30,689 --> 02:24:35,510
it seems I think they fixed it in Knox

02:24:32,550 --> 02:24:37,740
to the other one another issue is that

02:24:35,510 --> 02:24:40,080
response read slowly after love

02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:41,729
connections or so fits in nuts too I'm

02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:45,030
not sure why but you can reach through

02:24:41,729 --> 02:24:46,710
the documentation so one thing about

02:24:45,030 --> 02:24:50,430
using frameworks is that you have to be

02:24:46,710 --> 02:24:52,920
careful also because if these soft

02:24:50,430 --> 02:24:55,370
things really happen it can be game over

02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:58,950
if you are doing something big

02:24:55,370 --> 02:25:01,320
okay our wish after day I'll show you

02:24:58,950 --> 02:25:06,800
another one another static site

02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:13,560
generator for UGS okay now

02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:15,270
okay we skip through this one yeah yeah

02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:17,640
because that crack company is gonna take

02:25:15,270 --> 02:25:20,430
another three hours okay

02:25:17,640 --> 02:25:23,510
some helpful stuff hopefully for

02:25:20,430 --> 02:25:29,609
everybody you're next

02:25:23,510 --> 02:25:31,830
okay so some performance tips so like

02:25:29,609 --> 02:25:34,279
for images you can use the intersection

02:25:31,830 --> 02:25:36,660
of the verb observers to load images

02:25:34,279 --> 02:25:38,399
okay one example is that let's say you

02:25:36,660 --> 02:25:41,790
have a country selector and you have

02:25:38,399 --> 02:25:44,160
flex if you do a select simple select

02:25:41,790 --> 02:25:46,859
you click open you have 200 countries

02:25:44,160 --> 02:25:49,710
you have 200 flex flex loaded at one

02:25:46,859 --> 02:25:53,850
time so this intersection of the variety

02:25:49,710 --> 02:25:56,310
why you can do is you click you will

02:25:53,850 --> 02:25:58,560
load like five flex which is the space

02:25:56,310 --> 02:26:00,960
of the selector as you for example and

02:25:58,560 --> 02:26:03,000
probably plus or minus five flex up and

02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:05,640
also you look on a few and as you scroll

02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:08,340
up and down you see it slowly loading so

02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:12,739
you don't do 200 requests you just do a

02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:17,970
few okay that's one thing code spitting

02:26:12,739 --> 02:26:19,770
avoid clap using plugins if possible we

02:26:17,970 --> 02:26:21,239
a discerner I need to find out why put

02:26:19,770 --> 02:26:23,819
there was the reason

02:26:21,239 --> 02:26:25,739
okay then languages that all can

02:26:23,819 --> 02:26:28,170
remember it's been lazy lot languages

02:26:25,739 --> 02:26:31,020
okay so like you have a language files

02:26:28,170 --> 02:26:33,140
inside your application so if let's see

02:26:31,020 --> 02:26:35,850
your ten languages

02:26:33,140 --> 02:26:37,620
it's not good to load all ten so

02:26:35,850 --> 02:26:41,430
previously knocks the there's an axe

02:26:37,620 --> 02:26:44,399
i18n plug-in they didn't lazy load but

02:26:41,430 --> 02:26:46,859
now you can lazy load service English

02:26:44,399 --> 02:26:48,989
you know the English first then if it's

02:26:46,859 --> 02:26:52,109
you switch to French your slide the

02:26:48,989 --> 02:26:53,790
French so use the lazy load not just for

02:26:52,109 --> 02:26:58,890
languages also for your components your

02:26:53,790 --> 02:27:01,680
view components can be lazy loaded yeah

02:26:58,890 --> 02:27:04,069
not only was required blah blah blah

02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:09,359
okay my next

02:27:04,069 --> 02:27:13,859
okay so view gs3 any breaking changes

02:27:09,359 --> 02:27:17,550
coming up extremely minimal only one

02:27:13,859 --> 02:27:19,320
thing sofas orders this loss thing so a

02:27:17,550 --> 02:27:22,940
lot of people use losses like

02:27:19,320 --> 02:27:25,650
I like one level higher on a component

02:27:22,940 --> 02:27:29,820
so you can put some child inside a

02:27:25,650 --> 02:27:32,040
parent note and then they change it to V

02:27:29,820 --> 02:27:34,700
slot okay that's all his rest

02:27:32,040 --> 02:27:37,470
it's actually very simple to do migrate

02:27:34,700 --> 02:27:39,120
and for the beautified that we are using

02:27:37,470 --> 02:27:43,260
her nice version one it's going to move

02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:45,990
to version two which is not beta our day

02:27:43,260 --> 02:27:49,021
everything once it's a more stable ok

02:27:45,990 --> 02:27:51,570
the style the origin using this thing

02:27:49,021 --> 02:27:54,860
called stylus hidden a problem if the

02:27:51,570 --> 02:27:57,271
stylus is that there's some problem some

02:27:54,860 --> 02:28:00,210
the person cannot maintain it or some

02:27:57,271 --> 02:28:02,310
reason so it's like it's not very good

02:28:00,210 --> 02:28:03,630
support so they are dropping the stylus

02:28:02,310 --> 02:28:06,060
has not been actually main theme for

02:28:03,630 --> 02:28:07,860
quite a while from y know so actually

02:28:06,060 --> 02:28:11,010
you have to be careful with us of CSS

02:28:07,860 --> 02:28:12,860
that we use when we are building

02:28:11,010 --> 02:28:15,810
something that everybody can use

02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:18,870
so actually CSS quite powerful these

02:28:15,810 --> 02:28:23,400
days so well consider just sticking to

02:28:18,870 --> 02:28:27,271
CSS there's a very big changes to the

02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:29,460
initialization process of beautify so

02:28:27,271 --> 02:28:31,140
this one I will also update so just to

02:28:29,460 --> 02:28:35,300
take note because now we only in version

02:28:31,140 --> 02:28:38,400
one yeah then next

02:28:35,300 --> 02:28:40,530
okay so consider using the static types

02:28:38,400 --> 02:28:44,610
fast loading SEO friendly easy

02:28:40,530 --> 02:28:49,260
deployment ok know about SSRS PA static

02:28:44,610 --> 02:28:52,220
sites ok and then this one crits um it's

02:28:49,260 --> 02:28:55,220
like also a static site generator

02:28:52,220 --> 02:28:55,220
Sambhaji

02:29:20,649 --> 02:29:29,289
it's also going to do it when you are

02:29:22,449 --> 02:29:56,340
big enough to generate this weight some

02:29:29,289 --> 02:29:56,340
you said yes

02:30:02,700 --> 02:30:11,430
we're in Singapore we have our I am okay

02:30:08,700 --> 02:30:14,370
so I will place the slight link inside

02:30:11,430 --> 02:30:16,800
the github repo can write because the

02:30:14,370 --> 02:30:18,710
Sun a bit yeah okay I'll put the slight

02:30:16,800 --> 02:30:21,689
links inside the github repo push again

02:30:18,710 --> 02:30:26,820
later so y'all can have to look at the

02:30:21,689 --> 02:30:30,240
slides yeah we are very sorry this

02:30:26,820 --> 02:30:45,990
screen is very small but hopefully

02:30:30,240 --> 02:30:48,320
everybody can still carry on yes thank

02:30:45,990 --> 02:30:48,320
you everybody

02:30:50,300 --> 02:30:59,760
if you have any questions you can ask us

02:30:53,870 --> 02:31:02,790
or anybody else so so yeah okay I have

02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:05,310
big thank you to Eugene and to Ashley

02:31:02,790 --> 02:31:06,900
okay they are also using view GS but non

02:31:05,310 --> 02:31:09,450
Maps because they need to use view GS

02:31:06,900 --> 02:31:14,610
well yeah so they are very good also to

02:31:09,450 --> 02:31:17,400
handle UGS questions yes okay so any

02:31:14,610 --> 02:31:20,280
time can approaches yeah flows to open I

02:31:17,400 --> 02:31:25,700
can stay here and until the next lesson

02:31:20,280 --> 02:31:25,700
