Title: Navigating the Wild Seas of Native ES Modules by Gil Tayar | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-21
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	ES Module support in Node v12 is not just a refinement of the support it has in Node v10, but is rather pointing to a direction in which Node and browser ES Modules converge into one system, a system which will enable ES modules to "just work" within the native npm ecosystem, without the need for transpilers or bundlers. This talk will examine this, and show how this will be possible in the upcoming years.

From the olden days of DOS, Gil was, is, and always will be a software developer. He has co-founded WebCollage, survived the bubble collapses, and designed cloudy projects at Wix.
His current passion is figuring out how to test software, a passion which he has turned into his main job as Senior Architect at Applitools, where he develops tests for software that tests software, which is almost one meta layer too many for him.
