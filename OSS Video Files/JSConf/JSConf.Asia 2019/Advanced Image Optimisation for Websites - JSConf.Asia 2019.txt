You will learn about different image formats, their tradeoffs, how different formats are under the hood and the how the browsers handle images. 
Based on this, we will look at different techniques to optimise images based on the device, network and the browser the user is using. 
We will be building an image optimisation pipeline which you can extend upon after the workshop. Having built such a pipeline at Dexecure, I will also talk about the challenges in building and maintaining such a reliable at such a pipeline the different gotchas to look out for in terms of performance, security, reliability and scalability.
