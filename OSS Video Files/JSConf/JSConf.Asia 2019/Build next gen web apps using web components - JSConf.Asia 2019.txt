In today`s world the front end technology is evolving really fast. New frameworks are getting launched to simplify the developers life. But with the changing technology it`s really hard to move from one framework to another or update to the newest version. 
Web components is a relatively new standard enabling front end developers to create cross frameworks compatible components. it lets you write reusable components with native browser Api with zero external dependencies. 
In this workshop we will learn to build a web app with reusable components using web components (custom elements, Shadow DOM, Html templates, Modules). We will also get acquainted with helper library lit-element and how we can integrate these components with existing frameworks.

Requirements:
Prior knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS required in order to follow along.
Please bring a laptop, preferably with NodeJS and administrator permissions to install new software. Donâ€™t forget your favourite IDE for JavaScript development.
