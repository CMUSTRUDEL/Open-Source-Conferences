Title: Web Assembly: The Future of JS and a Multi-Language Web by Kas Perch | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-24
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	80% of users are running browsers capable of running languages other than JS in their browser. It's a new change, but an important one; we're looking at a future where the web will be built not just on JS, but on C, Rust, even GoLang. Let's talk about WebAssembly; why it came about, what it's good at, and why it really doesn't spell doom for JS but instead allows you to truly enhance web experiences by augmenting JS with the ability to use modules written in other languages that can perform tasks faster or more efficiently. We'll go over what WebAssembly is, how to build a WebAssembly module, and why this may be a force that will shape not only how we think about JS, but the entire web experience.

Kas (they/their/them) is a Developer Advocate at Cloudflare by day, and a Twitch Code/Hardware streamer, IoT author, and gamer by night. They love talking about serverless architecture, Web Assembly, IoT and its implications, and a myriad of other topics. They'll also totally show you a million pics of their 2 cats if you let them.

00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:23,640
hello all right awesome so like they

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,740
said we ate webassembly and the future

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:31,019
of JavaScript and a multi-language web

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:33,809
so as I mentioned I'm Casper ch besides

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,040
being a developer avocado at CloudFlare

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,540
I am also a robotics author and addict

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,860
I've written two books on using

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,809
javascript with robotics

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,809
I also twitch stream hardware and

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:49,170
software on Sundays from node botanist

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,420
so yeah I'm also a parent of two cats

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,219
and like they're my favorite like

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,780
animals Laurel so that's ace on the left

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,579
and that's Aria on the right and they're

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,160
very angry with me because I've been

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,449
gone for like three weeks and I may be

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,210
done for like another week they're

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,250
really mad at me right now anyway yeah

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,820
that's not what you're here to here here

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,840
to here about come on what even is

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,330
webassembly

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,040
this is a five-year-old technology and

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,299
we're still answering I and the quiet

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,009
when you when you think about why it's

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,770
because no one's figured out how to use

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:21,659
it until now oh people who are very very

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,830
hard to make this more accessible but we

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,740
still need to kind of have this talk

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,049
about like what is it even because I

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,290
think it's easier to answer what it's

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:34,560
not first it's not a programming

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,570
language like you don't you ever run

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,119
LinkedIn recruiters would say like you

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:43,320
need ten years of nodejs experience like

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:45,869
in 20 in 2008 like it's it's like saying

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm a web assembly programmer like you

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,399
don't you don't program and webassembly

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,290
you don't write web assembly the second

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
is web assembly is not going to kill

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,390
JavaScript if javascript is the

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,880
cockroach of everything it's never going

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,439
to die but especially not to web

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,920
assembly because it's not meant to kill

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,719
javascript and what assembly is not

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,479
something you can just ignore because

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,430
it's gonna go away I hope to convince

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,510
you in the next you know 28 or so

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,909
minutes

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,170
if anything you should be embracing it

00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:18,170
because it's the future

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,010
so whatever sorry button

00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,920
what webassembly is it is a compilation

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,890
target for other languages to compile to

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,650
you compile other languages to

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,700
webassembly and it's a specification and

00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,730
a compiled target

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,069
it's an augmentation of the abilities of

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,280
JavaScript far from replacing JavaScript

00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:42,989
it is there to let JavaScript do what it

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,450
is good at and then do things that

00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:49,500
javascript is not good at and give back

00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:53,760
the results but most importantly it's

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,769
pretty literally magic not literally

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,510
literally but like I'll explain it a bit

00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:58,760
there's a pun involved you know it's

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,160
fine

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,019
so web assembly has a compilation target

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,090
you write code in other languages and

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,799
then compile them into web assembly rust

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,879
which is pretty much written for web

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,500
assembly C and C++ go C sharp those are

00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,209
just a few of the languages that have

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,700
web assembly available is like a pile

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,799
target there are way too many to mention

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,269
and I'm certainly forgetting a few but

00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:22,680
those are the four main ones that I can

00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:24,930
think of just right off the top of my

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,989
head especially with rust being pretty

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,430
much written to be optimized for web

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,870
assembly though it's also just a pretty

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,060
cool programming language if you ever

00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:38,040
get a chance to try it but then the

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:40,139
question you have to ask is what why why

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,299
would you write code for the web and

00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:44,609
other languages why would you do this

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,290
why would you take pictures of Laurie

00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:49,769
Voss while he's giving talks like this

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,840
and then use them in other dogs there

00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:53,819
are so many reasons you would a want to

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,870
take pictures you Laurie Voss and B have

00:03:53,819 --> 00:04:02,519
webassembly in your life this is the

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:04,290
next Ajax for the browser and like I've

00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,000
been seeing that a lot this weekend I've

00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:08,430
gotten this reaction quite a few times

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,970
like oh yeah sure cats the next Ajax

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:15,690
okay cool but I mean it I'm I'm very

00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:18,660
serious in the sense that Ajax gave huge

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,150
credibility and made client-side

00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,280
applications possible and this is an

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,690
evolution of that this is the next step

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,850
of that

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,140
and that is an adorable Pokemon gift

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,610
that I found this morning and I was like

00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,680
oh well now I gotta stick that in there

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,980
and so I had to pick the word evolution

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,940
to like stick I write slides around

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:42,420
gifts if you haven't noticed so now

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:45,090
you're like alright maybe maybe it's

00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:48,240
like eight the next Ajax but like I'm

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:51,570
not whatever percent committed this is a

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,500
drawing that I did in OneNote this

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:59,970
morning of this is what I call ancient

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,240
dot PNG so this is back when we had HTML

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,520
renderers CSS engines and we had

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,790
JavaScript and all JavaScript did was

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,730
play mp3s in the browser annoyingly when

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,890
you opened a page thanks to MySpace and

00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:17,190
back then the server had literally

00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:20,490
everything everything was over here

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,990
where did my G go anyway um so you click

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,160
a link and it would return a page and

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,780
you click a link and it would return a

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,330
page and so on and so forth

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,990
you get a browser refresh every time you

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:35,030
needed new information from the server

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:39,750
so now this is what I call then dot PNG

00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:42,260
we got Ajax which that's not the right

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,340
button that's the right button got Ajax

00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,680
request the page and then get the page

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,540
and then we make an AJAX request without

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,970
refreshing the page and we'd get back a

00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,250
result Ajax result a grx result maybe

00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,320
there'd be another page request we got a

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:57,240
lot of single page applications out of

00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,280
that as well and then the server became

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,250
a REST API that also served up the

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,790
occasional HTML CSS and J's file right

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:08,790
so this is what I call now this is what

00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:10,890
I call now because now we have and web

00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,510
assembly and I ran out of like sparkly

00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,570
colors so I have to use like this like

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:18,240
red and black super goth but it sticks

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,830
out so it works see a request the page

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,020
returned the page and then you use WebP

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:23,100
is simply to do some computation but

00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,290
you're still over here in the browser

00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,820
and use the serviceworker for your

00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,470
third-party module and you're still over

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,390
here in the browser you use some Ajax

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,190
and your servers like lawl okay I'm not

00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,900
even actually a server I'm just a server

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:38,110
list function sitting on someone else's

00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:42,879
server and then gives back your results

00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:43,389
we're heading ok now you're thinking ok

00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,919
I get it

00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:47,050
ok this is starting to make a little

00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:49,210
more sense being able to compute things

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,099
in the browser and not necessarily have

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:55,270
to do it in JavaScript it's kind of a

00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:57,250
big deal this is kind of important but

00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,370
why does this matter why why do we

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,800
really care we care because we need to

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,180
augment Jaso that's not so strong points

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,770
because I know this is something you've

00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,810
probably either heard a million times

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:09,639
and is sick of hearing or it's blasphemy

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:12,520
or whatever but there's some things that

00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,740
jeaious isn't really good at not

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,139
rewriting entire code bases to use them

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,539
on the web who wants to rewrite an

00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:21,159
entire code base of any library that's

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:24,280
like more than five years old and has

00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:27,159
unit tests yeah Eli hands me neither

00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,199
there's no good fewer calls as a server

00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:31,150
means less latency and it means faster

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,009
web applications for your users that's

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,569
always important performance is good

00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:38,680
not having go back to the server a

00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:40,330
billion million times is good so let's

00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,759
talk about augmenting JavaScript it it's

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:44,229
not so strong points I'm sure you've

00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,599
seen this at least once in your

00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:48,340
JavaScript career 0.1 plus point two is

00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:51,639
actually point three zero zero zero zero

00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:54,129
zero zero zero zero four so that's false

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,020
and so if you're running anything that

00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:59,469
relies on mathematical numerical

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:01,990
accuracy financial applications anything

00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:04,659
they with socks or bond trading Kirt

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,330
currency conversion anything really that

00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:11,500
requires games require a lot of math

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:14,949
precision it's not really a JavaScript

00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,810
strong point obviously you would need an

00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:18,039
ajax call back to a server that would

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,770
run a different language and give you

00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,779
back the actual result which then you

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:26,409
know might get converted incorrectly

00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:28,120
even though with web assembly you can do

00:08:26,409 --> 00:08:30,909
this in the browser with the correct

00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:33,219
tool for the job with rust with see with

00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:37,779
with languages that have float types

00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:39,310
that are more than 32-bit other not so

00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:42,490
strong points we've got type coercion

00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:45,220
side-effects empty string equals equals

00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:47,260
zero is true it's really hard if you're

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,610
trying I can like say did they enter a

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:52,910
number other than zero

00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:55,810
oops API overloads so it's this one is

00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:57,890
new to me actually so if you oneplus

00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,990
document.getelementbyid II value it

00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,209
concatenates but if you put number

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,430
around that it adds it even though

00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:06,230
that's not really like a number or it

00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:09,279
might not be a number it might be an an

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:13,430
and then it's 1 plus 9 which is nan

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:16,190
probably see I mean like tight coercion

00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:20,720
can be tricky and then speaking of types

00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:22,970
the mystery that is type of like that

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,660
last one it has infuriated so many

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,660
people over the years

00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:30,019
using webassembly means using the right

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,370
tool for the job if you've ever seen me

00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:32,899
speak before you might have seen me to

00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,339
have a talk about fanaticism and I

00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:37,399
talked about using the right tool for

00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:39,950
the job and webassembly is using the

00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,380
right tool for the job on the web we are

00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:44,630
no longer forced to use JavaScript for

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,630
things that it is not good at and that

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:50,950
is a big deal that is huge for the web

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,930
that is huge for browser applications

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,730
but this will kill JavaScript oh we're

00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,320
gonna have all these applications that

00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,380
are only written and web assembly and

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,640
it's gonna no just calm down calm down

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,010
it's not gonna kills us

00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,870
it makes JavaScript better by letting it

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:07,850
do what it's good at Dom manipulation

00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,160
react and other frameworks have made Dom

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,630
manipulation ridiculously fast and GIS

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,680
engines have made Dom manipulation

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,180
ridiculously fast

00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,699
I don't think web assembly is gonna beat

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,160
JavaScript and Dom manipulation anytime

00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:20,750
soon it might in the future distant

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,060
future but I don't think it's gonna do

00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:25,310
it anytime soon and it's good at

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,690
manipulating classes CSS things like

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:28,970
that it's not gonna replace CSS is

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:31,610
either certainly under play CSS so it's

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,380
a good at augmenting websites that use

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,449
JavaScript and you will still probably

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,310
use JavaScript on top of that it's just

00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:39,589
letting JavaScript kind of like take a

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:42,589
load off on things that's not so great

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:44,480
at it's like so my fiance and I but if

00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:47,329
you don't say hates doing laundry like

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,000
with a burning passion and he's bad at

00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:53,240
it like a really bad at it and I hate

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,610
doing dishes and I'm really bad at it so

00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:59,120
I do all the laundry and he does all the

00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,829
dishes everything's fine except right

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,320
now because he has to do his own laundry

00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:07,060
because I've been gone for three weeks

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,060
he only has two weeks worth of clothes

00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,370
it makes the web better by creating

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,610
better browser experiences which is

00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:19,280
exactly what Ajax did these better

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,740
browser experiences are mind-blowing

00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:25,760
when you think of the implications like

00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,560
Jeff Goldblum mind-blowing but let's

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,620
take a closer look at what I mean by

00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,080
this with a demo this demo is using Waze

00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:35,180
image magic if you haven't used image

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,360
magic before it is a command line and

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,180
see library that is extremely good at

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,770
creating and manipulating images it can

00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,610
create animated gifs

00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:48,890
don't at me about that pronunciation it

00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:51,020
can create images of its cell I can

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,960
create fractal images it's a very

00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,850
powerful library that I don't want to

00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,340
rewrite in any language much less

00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,560
JavaScript we're gonna manipulate images

00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,240
in the browser up to ten times faster

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,280
than JavaScript can and in some ways

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,590
that JavaScript just can't at least

00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,970
certainly not performing Lee and it's

00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,740
kind of show the real power of not

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,020
having to rewrite code and being able to

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:16,070
let us use the right tool for the job so

00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:18,230
let's take a look and hope it works

00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,030
because it's worked every other time so

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,630
it won't work this time you know what I

00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:26,440
mean okay get my webcam turned on say

00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:31,760
select an image and I'm gonna go down to

00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:33,790
Ken oh I always look silly in photos so

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,920
like I look silly on my terms

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,000
okay so these buttons say I'm going to

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,180
make this a little bigger so you can see

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,270
so I guess my tongue and the buttons so

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:45,590
we're gonna rotate right and below it

00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,260
you'll see it's rotated right and that

00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:49,730
was really really fast rotate left same

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,020
thing you can do that with CSS really

00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:52,700
quickly though right like this is not

00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,830
that impressive let's do a grayscale

00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:58,880
boom grayscale

00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:02,570
right no flash let's add some contrast

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,030
BAM added contrast let's remove some BAM

00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:10,400
removed contrast can't chance do that

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:13,010
that quickly nope so yeah that's my demo

00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,590
I will tweet out a link to the github

00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,130
repo this is entirely open source so you

00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:20,920
are more than wha

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:25,480
to play with it yeah so that's my demo

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:29,960
yeah thank you but what about nodejs

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,370
wait but but what about nodejs like this

00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,110
is a browser thing right like this is

00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,430
this is just this is a browser

00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,410
technology I just did all that talk

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:39,290
about the browser why am i bringing up

00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,400
nodejs because this is a note cough I'm

00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,130
in the wrong spot right that's an

00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:46,610
Ireland that's also he's gonna smoke up

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,530
of you yeah yeah why am i okay the

00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,850
reason I'm bringing it up is native heck

00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:54,380
in modules who has ever seen a C

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,270
compilation error when running npm

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,620
install' most of your hands should be

00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:00,170
going up because this has happened to a

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:04,210
lot of people native heck in modules are

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:06,710
a huge pain point in node and they are

00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:10,280
ridiculous and they make you want to

00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:11,690
yell what Bryan Cranston is yelling you

00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,480
can probably read his lips on this one

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,820
because it's like and he's saying blah

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,570
obviously he's not saying you know the

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:23,300
other word blogger native modules of

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:24,620
Japan they have to be recompiled on

00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,320
download and they have to be recompiled

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,210
for every single architecture there is

00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,190
that includes the raspberry pi that

00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,810
someone will inevitably file an issue on

00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,460
your library because it doesn't work on

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,500
the Raspberry Pi it wasn't meant to well

00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,240
it didn't well it isn't meant to and

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:41,120
then you have that argument for TOEIC

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,800
days on github they either have to

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,480
compile for your platform or leave left

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,830
platforms for support and that can be

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,360
kind of tricky again that's the same

00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,770
github argument or you could just feel

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,810
bad does it means heater because like

00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,780
I'm sorry this doesn't work on Windows

00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:56,810
who's been like I'm sorry but this

00:14:53,780 --> 00:15:01,070
doesn't work on Windows it's not a fun

00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:03,980
feeling to say that and no chip

00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:05,810
disclaimer I respect the heck out of the

00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:08,270
people who work on no chip like that

00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:11,540
they have an insert they with Sisyphean

00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:15,010
task like an insurmountable task so I

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:18,050
respect the heck out of them but

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:23,780
webassembly works on node anything

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:25,430
higher than 8.0 so this is math why why

00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:29,620
this might matter why does it matter

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:33,170
that webassembly works on node 8.0 knob

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:36,920
webassembly modules are precompiled for

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:39,770
note j s not for the architecture so

00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:43,340
they're portable to any platform that

00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:46,010
runs node so no more recompilation on

00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:49,010
download for every architecture yes for

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:51,520
reals yes I tried it you can try it too

00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:54,140
it's pretty awesome

00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,120
so this quote is from Laurie this

00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:57,590
morning

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,690
everyone wants to deprecate note chip

00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:05,030
and webassembly would allow us to do

00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:08,900
this that's huge for know jazz that is

00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:11,240
and that's the near future note 8 is at

00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,610
the end of life and anything below no 2

00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,720
8 is not being supported that doesn't

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,290
mean people don't use it I mean people

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:21,190
still use Android like 300 off of water

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,240
literally just hit me on the head sorry

00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,250
this confusing thing that's ever

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,050
happened to me there's an arrow it's

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,760
actually okay I'm just gonna not stand

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:36,590
there cuz there's water dripping up that

00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:38,930
spot okay so webassembly is even

00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,880
invading serverless for instance I work

00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,950
at CloudFlare and we have clouds where

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,510
workers which run the v8 engine so you

00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:47,990
can run webassembly on serverless which

00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:50,420
is pretty cool we have a free tier now

00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,490
for those of you not in this audience

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,570
and I mean a hypothetical those of you

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,730
like maybe those of you who are watching

00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,350
this video or a live stream whoever like

00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,820
but you don't have a free tier and I

00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,140
don't want to pay and I get that don't

00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,900
get me wrong I hate paying for things

00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,459
too if you scan this QR code you can

00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,120
reserve a sub-domain

00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:10,100
of workers not dev which it guarantees

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,449
30 workers and a hundred thousand

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,180
requests a day which is slightly more

00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:18,079
than one a second I did the math without

00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:19,699
using javascript and I will show this

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,530
again later and it is also at our booth

00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:24,140
but I will pause for a moment until I

00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:26,540
stop seeing cameras plus I'm like

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:29,960
running super super early so like I'm

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:32,090
just gonna like pause for a second yeah

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,710
for the QR code obviously not because

00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:40,400
I'm like running away anyway all right I

00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:43,130
see very few cameras out now so the

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,620
point of this talk trial of assembly I

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:47,060
like rust the more things I learned

00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,590
about rust like what I learned a new

00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:51,860
thing I keep standing in the spot with

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,300
the water the more I learn about Russ

00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,310
every new thing I learned I'm like wow I

00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,640
was really well thought out it's like

00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:59,960
this wasn't created in 13 days no more

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,430
I'm not dissing JavaScript it's one of

00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,680
the best languages ever but it was made

00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:06,440
in 13 days and rust was definitely not

00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:08,570
made in 13 days it was definitely well

00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,850
well-thought-out webassembly is the

00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,260
future of Jay s and all of its forms

00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:13,970
though that I hopefully have shown you

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,580
it's it's going to create better browser

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:19,340
experiences it's going to deprecate no

00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,480
chip don't quote me on that five years

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,730
from now when it doesn't actually do

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,020
that but it could deprecated no chip you

00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,450
can quote me on that one

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,580
and the last one is that if you are a

00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:30,260
hiring manager watching this right now I

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,790
would like you to do something very

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,990
important and that is hire someone

00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,220
different from you they might look

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,230
different from you they might believe

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,420
different things from you they might be

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,040
different they might have a gender

00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,170
identity different sexuality than you

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,390
hire them and before you tell me it's

00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:48,110
hard I'm gonna refer you to mr. LaBeouf

00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:49,600
on this just do it it's not that hard

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,880
just do it

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:58,430
there's higher someone who is different

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,820
from you somehow anyway thank you for

00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:04,160
listening

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:06,800
I Laurie I hope you're gonna run over I

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,970
tend to be succinct and that's my nice

00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,620
way of saying I tend to run early

00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,450
there's water dripping everywhere on

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,040
this stage now by the way Lou so like we

00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,360
might want to look at that we might want

00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:18,410
to spend that ten minutes looking at

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:20,150
that danced around over here so Carl

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,670
Sagan and I both think you're super

00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:26,540
awesome for watching this talk I can be

00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:28,190
found at Kas at CloudFlare comm and also

00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:32,120
at Noda botanist

00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:34,370
I don't grow plants with knowed it was a

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,930
discussion with like Rick Waldron and

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,950
some other folks from Johnny Five we

00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,990
were trying to figure out what to call

00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:42,290
people who didn't know BOTS and I was

00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:46,580
like two drinks in and I went no

00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:48,050
platanus and Rick was like no but that

00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,300
would make a great handle so that's my

00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,640
handle and then if you search meetup.com

00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,010
for server lists there's a meet-up on

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,900
Tuesday at Frazier's tower in Singapore

00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:59,090
that's where the CloudFlare offices

00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,530
and I will actually be doing a workshop

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,630
there where I will teach you how to

00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:04,040
write a worker that controls a robot and

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,010
it's the same robot that's at our booth

00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,900
there currently only I control moi but

00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,130
you can learn to control it on Tuesday

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,980
if you happen to be in the Singapore

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,050
area still and then the QR code is back

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,410
up for anybody who missed it on the last

00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,570
slide

00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:19,070
now I'm only 10 minutes early and I'm

00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:22,030
feeling much better about that so I'm

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:22,030
gonna say thank you very much

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:27,059
