Title: The Browser as a Modular, Networked Video Synthesizer by Olivia Jack | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-21
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	Most libraries and abstractions for creating graphics in Javascript are focused on 2D shapes (SVG and canvas) or simulating 3D rendering. The talk will instead explore generative graphics inspired by modular, analog video synthesizers from the 1970s, in which visuals are created by routing, transforming, and recombining multiple sources and outputs in realtime (such as cameras, videos, and application windows).
By using WebRTC to share video peer-to-peer, each browser/device can output a video stream, and receive and modify video streams from other browsers/devices. Transformations to the color, coordinates, and blending of a visual source are abstracted as separate Javascript functions which can be chained and composited to create complex visual patterns. The talk will explore technical, aesthetic, and collaborative possibilities of treating a web app as a series of interconnected and heterogeneous nodes, rather than as a specific “site” or “place”.

Olivia is an independent programmer and artist who works frequently with audiovisual installations, interactive visuals for dance performances, cartography, live-coded visuals, and experimental interfaces. She is the developer of Hydra, a browser-based platform for networked visuals that is inspired by analog modular synthesis. Originally from San Francisco, she currently lives and works in Bogotá, Colombia.

00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:22,080
hi everyone thank you for having me

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,689
my name is Olivia Jack my talk is

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,109
entitled the browser as a modular

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:31,140
networked video synthesizer hopefully by

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,559
the end of the talk it'll be clear or

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,940
more clear what I mean by that

00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:40,500
everything I'm gonna be talking about is

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:45,120
online at this website Hydra editor

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:50,270
glitch taught me and it's sort of an

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:53,460
ongoing set of research and

00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:56,100
experimentation and creation that I've

00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,390
been I've been working on for the last

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,309
year and a half and so Hydra is it's an

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,280
investigation of collaboration in the

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:08,030
creation of live visuals possibilities

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,460
of peer-to-peer technology on the web

00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:15,530
feedback loops and it's also a platform

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:19,880
for live coding visuals in in JavaScript

00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:23,729
and so one of the inspirations for this

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,700
this project is a project from 1977

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:30,020
called the satellite arts project by

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,090
Kate Galloway and Cher Shari Rabinowitz

00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,340
and in the 70s they got access to a

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,420
satellite and were able to stream video

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,369
live between two places at once and this

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,210
is in the 70s you know before the

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:47,100
internet before Skype and and they

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,119
started experimenting with this just

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,290
sort of streaming video and putting

00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:55,100
images on top of each other

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,079
mixing them together overlaying them and

00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,680
and seeing what what happened when they

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:03,750
started experimenting with this and one

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,299
of the things they talked about with

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,429
their project is this marks the first

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,220
time that the geographically dispersed

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,170
electronic image was conduct

00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,540
contextualized as a live immersive place

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,980
we're artists and others could convene

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,380
and co-create together

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:23,340
on a scale that could be as culturally

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:27,390
inclusive as desired and I want to focus

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:32,400
on the live immersive place piece of

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:34,350
this because I think all they're doing

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,900
they're sending data between two places

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,940
right and they're talking about how just

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,090
by putting these two images on top of

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,770
each other and seeing them live that

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,810
it's creating this space that's not

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,480
there and it's not there it's sort of

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:52,500
some third third space that's a

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:56,220
combination of these two spaces and I

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,739
think now with the web we talk about we

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:02,880
use this kind of metaphor of a place a

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:06,570
lot like a website it's a site it has an

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:10,440
address you go to the address you're at

00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:13,980
the website and it might just seem kind

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,720
of like nitpicky but it's also it's it's

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,709
kind of talking about a way that we're

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,630
engaging with these technologies and and

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:23,640
but what's really happening when I go to

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:25,489
a website you know my my computer is

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:29,130
sending a message to a server somewhere

00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:32,250
the server is responding with with a

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,410
message and so I'm not anywhere when I

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,340
go to a web site but but we have these

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,410
sort of ideas about how we talk about

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,510
the web and how we talk about how we

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,489
engage with the web that to me it's just

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,390
sort of interesting to be aware of them

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:51,060
and start to dissect them and especially

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:53,880
just in the 70s this was like wow what

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,430
do you mean we can see live video from

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,170
two different places at once and what

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,299
what are the possibilities of this and I

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:03,870
think sometimes when when technology

00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:07,190
just comes out is when people are often

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,780
the most experimental with it and so

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:13,880
fast forward to now there's this

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:18,440
protocol called web RTC real-time web

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:21,239
streaming that lets you to browser

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,880
protocol for streaming video audio and

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,450
data directly between clients and so

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,910
what's in one of the interesting

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:31,840
WebRTC is that although you need a

00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:35,420
signaling server to sort of set up

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,610
initial handshakes between clients once

00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:41,290
clients are connected they're basically

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:45,530
just sending video or audio or data

00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:46,880
between one another and about four or

00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,390
five years ago I started experimenting

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:55,100
with this this protocol making sort of

00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:57,800
little video chat applications and it

00:04:55,100 --> 00:05:00,790
sort of was just kind of amazed that

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:06,500
it's not that hard in JavaScript to like

00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:08,000
send video everywhere and so so I'm

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,310
still kind of interested in this

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,230
protocol and I think lately there's been

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,940
a lot of exciting developments with this

00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:17,540
such as web torrent like BitTorrent

00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,300
running on the web or Beeker browser and

00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,770
different sort of peer-to-peer

00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,840
peer-to-peer applications of this is

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,780
saying what happens if we don't

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,330
necessarily depend on a server for

00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:33,560
everything or on honest on

00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:36,290
centralization for everything and so so

00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,150
this this diagram kind of gets thrown

00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:41,450
around a lot but on the left is like a

00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:44,090
really centralized network and towards

00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,610
the middle a more decentralized network

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,780
and on the right a more distributed

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:54,170
network and one thing that WebRTC

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:58,010
enables is possibly more things like on

00:05:54,170 --> 00:06:01,400
the right but one thing that's been sort

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:04,100
of interesting to me is seeing a lot of

00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:12,200
peer-to-peer technology that often

00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:14,210
although it's use it it's it has the

00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,890
opportunity to connect people like the

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,650
diagram on the right often what happens

00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,960
is sort of replicating a centralized

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:23,750
database such as with Bitcoin or

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,420
something you're you're creating a

00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:30,140
centralized database of transactions and

00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:32,000
so everyone still sort of receives the

00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,710
same information and in some ways it's

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,550
recreating the experience of a

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:39,530
centralized database and so

00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,840
experimenting with this video streaming

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:45,470
I got interested in sort of different

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:49,000
ways of of thinking of using this kind

00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:51,289
of client-side peer-to-peer network and

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,319
so one of the things that really

00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:57,050
inspired me sending video around the

00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,800
Internet is analog video synthesizers

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:03,889
and so what's an analog video

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,370
synthesizer this is an example also from

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:10,880
the 70s it's the Sandin image processor

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:13,220
created in 1971 by Daniel Sandin and

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,729
basically each of these boxes either

00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:19,099
generates a series of electrical signals

00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:21,349
or transforms a series of electrical

00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:24,830
signals and when the when the signal

00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:27,710
gets to the screen it creates a pattern

00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:31,370
and then the order in which you connect

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:34,180
the boxes sort of creates different

00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:37,039
possibilities for modifying and changing

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:41,060
the image and so what I was interested

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,370
in is is kind of I sort of seeing

00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,740
similarities between this thing where we

00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,169
can send lots of video streams around

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:50,780
and this thing over here which is

00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,779
sending lots of signals around and the

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,610
way and the order in which which we're

00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:58,279
sending them can create different

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,050
creative possibilities and this is

00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:01,490
really I had no like specific goal in

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,449
mind but this is sort of like oh I just

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:07,699
want to play with these web protocols

00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:10,699
and and it's not in this case not really

00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:12,830
thinking of a website as a place or a

00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:15,740
site but thinking of it as a flow of

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:20,509
information in this case sort of a

00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:23,539
signal flow and so so this is sort of

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:27,620
was like an initial experiment that I

00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:30,500
did with this which is basically here I

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:33,950
have a bunch of windows connected via

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,050
web RTC in this case they're all on the

00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,300
same computer but they could easily have

00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,010
been you know one in one country one in

00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:46,040
a different country connected over the

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:48,920
web and here on the Left I'm creating an

00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,350
image and I'm sending it as a video

00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:57,079
to here and combining it with this one

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:59,329
and then I'm sending other videos here's

00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:03,230
the webcam and then combining it with

00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:05,029
what's on the bottom right and again I

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,490
would just sort of started explaining

00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:10,820
around with these things and as I didn't

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:13,070
exactly know what my goals were with it

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,500
I started live coding in the console

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:20,510
just to sort of experiment and be able

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:24,620
to live change change these these things

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:26,839
and it's sort of like it's both a visual

00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:29,060
experiment but also sort of a conceptual

00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,089
experiment of what happens if we connect

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:35,420
in these ways and how can we maybe

00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:39,290
collaborate or something so so this is

00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:42,560
an initial experiment and then it turns

00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:44,480
out it's not that practical all the time

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,450
if you're on the same computer to be

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,670
sending video streams

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:51,200
it's like takes a lot of processing

00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:55,640
power if you're if you're just on the

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,760
same computer and so this experiment led

00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:02,839
to a node module called RTC patch Bay

00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:06,589
that just for me made it easy to to send

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:10,040
these video streams and sort of reroute

00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:12,350
them and then I started making this sort

00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:17,500
of in browser editor to play with this

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,500
and I'm gonna go to right now let's see

00:10:17,949 --> 00:10:29,899
so and so this this platform is called

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,000
called Hydra that I've been working on

00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:34,130
it lets you send video streams to other

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,230
people who are connected but it also

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,899
lets you kind of play with this way of

00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:44,269
making images directly within the

00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:51,410
browser and so I'm gonna actually clear

00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:53,540
the canvas right now and so drawing from

00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:56,240
analog synthesizer world one of the

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,660
basic things that you can make in Hydra

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,550
is an oscillator but then when you just

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,910
write oscillator you don't actually see

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,790
an

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,020
and so then to connect it to actually

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:11,390
see it you have to connect it to an

00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:13,400
output and so when a and I'm doing

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:15,020
control enter to execute this code and

00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,180
so here I have an oscillator and I'm

00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:20,720
connecting it to an output and I sort of

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:23,810
use functions to correspond to this idea

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,360
of the analog modular synthesizer and

00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,950
then chaining the functions as sort of

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,050
the patch cables connecting the

00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:32,210
different pieces of of the analog

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:35,450
modular synthesizer and then the

00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:38,570
parameters here can correspond sort of

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:42,770
like turning the knobs of of the analog

00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:49,160
synthesizer where I can change change

00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:52,190
certain parameters and so here here I'm

00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,290
I'm changing the frequency of the

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:57,590
oscillator how fast it's moving and how

00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:02,420
separated the colors are and then I can

00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:06,170
add more more chained functions onto

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:09,020
this more transformations of the signal

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:13,160
suits similar to the boxes and the

00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:16,460
modular synthesizer and so I can keep

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:24,310
adding there's oscillator rotate and now

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:30,650
I could add a kaleidoscope change them

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:33,470
repeat the kaleidoscope and so one of

00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:37,760
the things also for with this that's

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:41,420
interesting to me is it's it's sort of a

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,400
lot of the ways that we make graphics on

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:47,180
the computer use also different

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,950
analogies for example canvas it's like

00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:51,920
the idea that you have a canvas and

00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:54,440
you're drawing things onto the canvas or

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,060
using Microsoft Word or something it's

00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,430
the idea that you have a document and

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:01,010
you're you're typing text onto it and

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:03,350
all of these analogies kind of create a

00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:06,110
framework for thinking about making

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:09,530
things using the computer and so instead

00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:13,400
of using either the idea of a canvas

00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:15,000
where you're drawing shapes or using a

00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,280
3d rendering thing

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,910
3G is where you have a camera and a mesh

00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:24,420
and lights and all this stuff here and

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:27,350
really interested in this idea of signal

00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:35,610
flow and using signal flow as a way to

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:41,550
to create images and all of this this

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:44,340
each function corresponds to a GLSL

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:46,290
shaders function and a shader is a

00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:49,770
program that runs on the graphics card

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:51,750
and it basically is given a coordinate

00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:56,910
and outputs a color and it's sort of

00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:59,690
most basic sense and so so I'll each

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:02,840
each of these functions either

00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:05,580
transforms a coordinate to a color

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,890
transforms the color or transforms a

00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:10,350
coordinate space and then adding them

00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,820
together kind of lets you experiment

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:16,560
with these things and of course the

00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:19,760
order that things are in matters so like

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:25,110
if I put another rotate here then gonna

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:27,120
start rotating afterwards and I can also

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:29,640
instead of using an oscillator as a

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,610
source I could use for any of them for

00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:36,739
example I could use a camera as a source

00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,739
[Music]

00:14:49,910 --> 00:15:02,390
dark but that's all of you and so I

00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:06,740
could I can also sort of apply apply

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,740
transformations to this so let's see

00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:14,460
yeah it's a little it's a little darker

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,510
I'm gonna switch to my camera so we will

00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,510
see better there we go

00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:31,850
apply transformations and so now we just

00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:34,769
sort of have one source and one output

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,629
I've shown you and I could I could

00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:39,839
execute different code to sort of switch

00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:41,579
back between the two but we thought the

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,170
whole analog synthesizer there's all

00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:47,249
these options for like patching things

00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:48,899
into each other and so so in this system

00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:51,899
in order to be able to do that I

00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:56,160
actually have four sort of virtual

00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:58,679
outputs with which with different names

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,769
and so I could send the oscillator

00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:03,269
instead of to the first screen I could

00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:07,230
send it to the second screen which in

00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:10,410
this case has a name oh one and I'm

00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:13,799
gonna simplify this a little here so so

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:17,189
here I'm sending the camera to the to

00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:21,059
the first output zero and I'm sending

00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:23,149
the oscillator to the second output and

00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:27,110
then what I could do is actually blend

00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:33,179
blend these together so I could take

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:41,610
zero and blend it with a one and send it

00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:44,129
out - OH - here and so here I'm blending

00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:47,249
the two together and if I change one of

00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:49,559
them it changes all of them again this

00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:53,779
is all running directly on the graphics

00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:58,110
card with through WebGL and shaders and

00:16:53,779 --> 00:17:00,619
and if you're familiar with Photoshop or

00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,990
video editing software there's different

00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:06,659
ways of compositing pixels together so

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:08,850
here I'm taking the difference between

00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:12,389
the colors if you think of each color as

00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:14,730
a number between zero and one RGB

00:17:12,389 --> 00:17:18,959
channels and then you can do different

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:21,059
sort of arithmetic but then another

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,329
thing that I borrowed from analog

00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:26,100
synthesizer is not just combining colors

00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:29,159
together but it's actually using the

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,860
colors of one thing to affect the

00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:35,910
coordinates of another thing and so here

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:44,520
um here it's using the oscillator to

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:46,799
sort of warp the initial image and this

00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,730
I'm all doing this sort of in separate

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:54,390
function changes but I could also do it

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:58,920
all all sort of together and so I could

00:17:54,390 --> 00:18:02,850
just here say I'm gonna take this and

00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:08,309
modulate it with an oscillator I'll just

00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:13,230
show here and I could I don't know

00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:15,900
put another oscillator on top here and

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,150
just keep keep kind of chained chaining

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,240
all these things together and it creates

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:23,669
really complicated patterns really

00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:31,260
quickly and this this is just really fun

00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:34,470
for me and then so using different Web

00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:39,150
API is also you can not just use the

00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:41,130
camera as an as an input but also lots

00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,020
of other things oh and this is one of

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,600
the things that dance and and said about

00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,520
this Sandin image processor in the

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,990
seventies is the modules are designed to

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,059
maximize the possibility of

00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:52,890
interconnection thereby maximizing the

00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:55,620
number of possible modifications of the

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,510
image so that's like when I'm thinking

00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:01,320
about the functions that are there it's

00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:03,059
how can these functions really maximize

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,460
the possibilities of the way that you

00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:07,590
can you can mix them together and so

00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,510
this is using the screen itself as an

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,880
input these are sort of experiments that

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:14,580
I've done using this this idea of the

00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,530
video synthesizer this is using my

00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,309
Twitter feed as an input using the

00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:24,179
desktop capture API you can use any

00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:28,260
window as an input this is using Google

00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:34,440
Maps as a as an input and sort of

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:37,140
experimenting with it and this is using

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,620
a live stream of an aquarium and a live

00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:44,920
stream of a Time Square and then live

00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:47,710
coding them together and and this

00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:50,800
sort of going back to the the satellite

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:53,590
arts project of just sort of combining

00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,170
two live things and what are what kind

00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:59,050
of possibilities or ideas about those

00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:11,350
two spaces or arise by putting them on

00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:15,970
top of each other and so another thing

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:18,220
that when it clear this here that is

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:22,000
really exciting for me to experiment

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:25,030
what this is is video feedback or sort

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,080
of using the output of something as the

00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:45,960
input to itself or in other words sort

00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:50,610
of recursion and so here so here here's

00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:57,850
the camera I'm actually gonna switch

00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:59,530
cameras here to the other one and so so

00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:03,480
the basics of video feedback is just

00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:05,620
pointing a camera at its own screen and

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,440
sometimes it can create really

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:10,930
complicated things but when I'm holding

00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,210
a camera here it's not very precise and

00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:16,000
so I could actually just do it sort of

00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:22,420
within the code so for example I could

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:28,060
here make a shape and then I could blend

00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:30,520
it with its own output which is oa0 in

00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,290
this case but because it's blending the

00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:37,600
same thing with the same thing it just

00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:39,580
ends up also being a triangle but if I

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,910
blend it with itself and then repeat the

00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:47,710
entire thing add a shape on top to the

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:53,920
repeated output it gets more interesting

00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:56,950
and so we get sort of a fractal which is

00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,400
a form that repeats itself a different

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,670
scale

00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:05,080
and so just using this idea of a video

00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:07,840
feedback and in pretty simple code then

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:13,120
you get something that's as complex

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:18,220
account as complex as a factor and so

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:24,400
another example is here I could go back

00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:35,440
to the camera and they're actually

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:42,820
another example oh yeah and so I could

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:44,830
blend my face with itself here we go and

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:48,760
so then I just start to get these sort

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:51,010
of trails but then if I use that

00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:54,190
modulate function again and so I

00:22:51,010 --> 00:23:02,860
actually use the colors to affect the

00:22:54,190 --> 00:23:04,860
coordinates and so each frame update I'm

00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:10,600
sort of using the colors that were there

00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:12,490
to to affect the coordinates and and

00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,410
because of feedback it ends up being

00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,330
this sort of liquid effect and it turns

00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:22,840
out this is kind of similar to how fluid

00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:26,610
dynamics or exceeds textures to to talk

00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:29,470
about pressures and velocities and so

00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:32,770
this is exciting to me because it's sort

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:34,320
of the code isn't that complicated but

00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,970
these things that are supposedly

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,520
computational really computationally

00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,650
complicated like navier's stokes fluid

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,720
dynamics and stuff maybe we could have

00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:45,400
sort of an intuitive understanding of

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:52,780
them by thinking about them in sort of a

00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:55,080
different way and so it closed in my

00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,080
slides

00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:08,180
oh yeah you could also use like a canvas

00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:11,370
as a as an input which is kind of fun

00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:15,450
and yeah I've just kept playing around

00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:18,330
with this this sort of this thing or

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:22,320
this is reaction diffusion made using

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:25,050
using feedback and this is one of the

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,910
things that dance and it said in the 70s

00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:31,980
about the idea of the feedback loop is

00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,420
put yourself in a feedback loop yes the

00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,920
reason you put yourself in a feedback

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,870
loop is so you can learn something or

00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:38,340
rather learn to do something you know

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:39,930
you do something in the results get

00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,000
processed somehow perhaps just by

00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:43,830
yourself just looking at it and you do

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,110
another thing in the results of that get

00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,480
processed and your action can constantly

00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:51,930
be tuned or corrected or refined by what

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,520
you see and so this has been interesting

00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:56,970
to me because although I've built this

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,490
software from from basically scratch

00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:02,940
like there's almost no using no

00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:05,070
libraries and stuff but I still don't

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,620
know what's gonna happen and having the

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:10,200
editor there and being able to change it

00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,600
in real time and see the results is sort

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,120
of really resonates with me both as an

00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,440
artistic process as well as a process

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:22,350
for developing code and just sort of

00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,600
investigation as well and so also one of

00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:31,890
the things they've done is made a

00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:34,560
Twitter bot where you can you can post a

00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:38,370
sketch to the Twitter ah and there's

00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:40,440
actually an anyone who's different

00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:43,080
people who've been using the editor can

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:48,300
can post something here and then if you

00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:51,360
actually click click on on it in the

00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:55,860
Twitter bot it directly opens the code

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:59,760
and so then you can edit directly edit

00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:02,160
the code here and so here I'm editing

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,850
this I got a little fast and then I can

00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:08,750
upload it again and here let's say J s

00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:14,000
conf Asia

00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:22,150
and then upload it and we'll see if it

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:22,150
shows up here but yep that goes so it

00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:31,909
and so it shows us what we just did but

00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:34,159
it also shows the sketch that it was

00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:36,289
sort of based on here and that this one

00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,150
was based on one earlier and it's

00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:40,580
thinking about like oh we're all just

00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:47,000
kind of exploring the possibilities of

00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:48,530
this the game almost out of time yeah

00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,340
but I wanted to just quickly mention

00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:54,590
this idea of live coding so I've started

00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:56,570
I live code visuals with this so

00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:59,450
sometimes in clubs or in different

00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:03,020
events with experimental music and I

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:05,809
make a write code live to make visuals

00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,890
and this is there's another people all

00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:08,390
over the world doing this using

00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:11,630
different languages and sort of

00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:13,820
experimenting with ways of programming

00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:15,950
and sort of showing the code while there

00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:19,100
while they're performing in this there's

00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:22,370
this language called tidal cycles that's

00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:25,640
for making music and as somewhat similar

00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:28,240
ideas as Hydra for making visuals in

00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,830
that although it's in in Haskell but

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,770
everything that you write in title is

00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:37,270
sort of a transformation of a pattern in

00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:41,809
time and using that you can make music

00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:44,900
so yeah we have a live coding group in

00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:47,000
Bogota there's little groups all over

00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,350
the world there's one in India and I'm

00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,010
meeting with some people in Indonesia

00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:55,039
next week insects

00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:56,519
this is last week in Bogota using title

00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:02,519
to make music

00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:04,440
Haeju to make business anyways thank you

00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:09,299
so much

00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,299
