Description: 
	Variable Fonts allow typography on the web to adapt to the flexible nature of screens, environments and devices. We can use variable fonts with pre-existing technologies to improve our font performance, design, accessibility and usability of our websites.
We can start to design our typography to adjust to various inputs, situations or events which might allow us to modify our fonts to aid in storytelling, or achieve improved readability and legibility in different situations, environments or on larger or smaller screens.
Let’s begin to explore new and exciting creative opportunities for storytelling, design and expression in ways standard fonts could never provide us. This is just the beginning of our journey to discover what we can do with variable fonts.

Mandy’s passion is CSS, HTML and JS, she has a particular interest in web typography, accessibility and modern layouts, and hopes to inspire that passion in others. With the aim to create a community of web developers who can share, mentor, learn and grow together she is a co-organiser and Director of Mixin Conf, the founder and co-organiser of Perth’s front-end developer meetup Fenders and currently works as a Development Manager at Seven West Media in Western Australia.
