00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,040
of the audience so they can pick any

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,810
consonants if they learn on a point

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,580
vowels our four thousand points so if

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,580
you have no thousand points cannot buy

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,489
power if you let on undefiled

00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,650

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,519
if you learn on not a number is fine you

00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,940
keep your money

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,040
but the ton goes to the next player

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,730
I will give you cues so you don't worry

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:04,110
about the I'm just explaining if you hit

00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:08,760
infinity or continue you spin again yeah

00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:12,510
if you hit the pari sign instant win so

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,000
instead if anybody is 2x it just means

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,459
that whatever letter is what the more

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,390
points you have at a moment again we

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,160
will explain it but let's go okay so I

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,290
gonna give you a topic now

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,720
and that topic is kind of gives you an

00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:29,400
idea of what the words our word is that

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,550
we're looking for it typically a phrase

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:37,500
or a sentence of sorts so let's see what

00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:39,660
the first one is yes 2018 so I hope

00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,770
you'll read up on the new versions of

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,240
JavaScript speaking it started with that

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,250
so the buzzer in front of you lights up

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,830
when you can spin meaning the first

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,600
press is you like kind of reach out and

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,790
the second press is to spin the faster

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,070
you press the two the faster the wheel

00:04:53,790 --> 00:05:05,640
will spin the slower you do that this

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:08,910
will give it a try not twice can have

00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:11,010
the music a little louder so now you

00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:13,050
have a hundred so you can now choose a

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:15,350
letter constantly because vowels cost

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,350
