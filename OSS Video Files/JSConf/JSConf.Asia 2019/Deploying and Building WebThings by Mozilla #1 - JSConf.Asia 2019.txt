We will demonstrate Mozilla’s WebThings Gateway, an IoT framework to protect user privacy and security, and to improve cross-brand interoperability. We will also show how to develop and build your own custom "web things" out of microcontroller boards. We will demonstrate javascript examples using the Moddable SDK, then get “hands-on” using MicroBlocks.

Requirements:
Bring your laptop to participate in microcontroller programming using MicroBlocks and come to the workshop with MicroBlocks pre-installed. You can download the installer for your operating system and follow the setup instructions.
