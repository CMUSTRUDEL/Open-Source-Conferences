We will demonstrate Mozilla’s WebThings Gateway, an IoT framework to protect user privacy and security, and to improve cross-brand interoperability. We will also show how to develop and build your own custom "web things" out of microcontroller boards. We will demonstrate javascript examples using the Moddable SDK, then get “hands-on” using MicroBlocks.

Requirements:
Bring your laptop to participate in microcontroller programming using MicroBlocks and come to the workshop with MicroBlocks pre-installed. You can download the installer for your operating system and follow the setup instructions.

workshop introduced the team

00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,320
[Music]

00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:18,279
security consultant

00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:25,240
project and then you know

00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,240
the Bonneville and newer

00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:38,370
development so first the Mozilla work

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,149
thing is a software that why they use

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,149
the same work

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,680
privacy

00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:00,629
so the devil for today

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,610
talk about the IOC and

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,740
you can visit the website I didn't want

00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,300
a lot of poor so that you can know a

00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,460
little bit more about it and you have

00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,890
the Flyers here that explain more about

00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,850
it and then we're gonna move for the

00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:17,970
microcosmic

00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,970
and motherhood

00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,880
so as part of the last mission to keep

00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,070
the web open and say they created the

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:30,939
world engage awake which is a framework

00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:34,399
and software that provides a useful

00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:40,640
open-source web things and private

00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:42,560
security you can use a lot the IOT in

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,649
the smart world can someone give us

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:50,780
examples about the smart case that they

00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:55,330
usually use within their work like a

00:01:50,780 --> 00:02:00,220
thermostats yeah other

00:01:55,330 --> 00:02:09,460
you can use it anyone is working on the

00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:11,530
IOT so here we're gonna give some

00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,230
example about the smart homes and

00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,630
especially for the LED lights the

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,790
sensors that are for monitoring the

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,100
distance sensors and that you can use

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,840
every day to make your home smarter and

00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:28,390
this is the example we're gonna give

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:30,430
today and what's different about what

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:33,820
the last Mart home is that the typical

00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:34,120
vendor has your IOT the data on an IOT

00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,600
cloud

00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,810
whereas for Mozilla for us there is no

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:46,620
data and you create your own user name

00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:46,620
and password for the canoe canoe

00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,550
okay so all you need for this you need

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,070
the Raspberry Pi which you will have

00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,350
here for us in this workshop we're not

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,540
going to ask everyone to create their

00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,660
own username and password so you will

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,780
have passwords that are here preset on

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,270
the other tables but later you can use

00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,360
your own and you can download it from

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:21,270
the website you go to IOT dot

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,970
mozilla.org and you can download and you

00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:28,050
have the micro SD card where you can use

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,900
it to create your own gateway and for

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,040
the web domain you can create your own

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,400
but now we're going to use this one

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,400
again

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,920
okay and the work things and syrup

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,730
opportu bility is with everything for

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,439
the ZigBee wave and bluetooth and then

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,510
you can also it's an open source

00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,250
community development you can go to

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,980
github and you can join the conversation

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:04,049
you can join the code and you can work

00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:05,849
with us on the mozilla iot and now a man

00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:08,730
is gonna explain about the things get

00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:12,439
away and what type of sensors we can use

00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,439
and how we can work

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:34,800
cute

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:37,169
okay so hi again I'm Mel so this is

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,960
basically what you will see after you

00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:44,699
configure your Raspberry Pi the first

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,979
picture shows the different sensors that

00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:50,610
you have configured we will we will do

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:52,770
this hands-on today there's also an

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,590
option to upload a floor plan if you

00:04:52,770 --> 00:05:00,479
have it in your home so you can see

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:04,860
which room has what sensors you can

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:07,289
create rules so when when it's 6:00 a.m.

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,849
turn the lights on or just expand turn

00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:13,409
the lights off and this little fox is an

00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:17,189
experiment so far it's a voice command

00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:19,589
so you can either type turn the lights

00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:26,009
off or you can tell him to turn the

00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:28,289
lights off and it will respond so as we

00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:32,219
said it's it's without a middleman you

00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:33,949
own your own data it's pretty cheap to

00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:36,629
set up all you need is a Raspberry Pi

00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:39,779
for the Gateway and then sensors you can

00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:43,009
either buy sensors there are plenty of

00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:46,469
add-ons for interrupts lip

00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:49,129
interoperability or you can create your

00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:49,129
own sensors

00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:01,720
okay so in order to examples of MCU

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:04,460
boards that you can buy I have them here

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:07,880
this is the circuit playground Express

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:11,900
and this is a microbe it has anyone

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:14,380
worked on this before yeah

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,380
okay

00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:24,860
so they're pretty useful for educational

00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:27,140
purposes because so this one has a LED

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,580
matrix that can be used as a screen it

00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:37,010
has a motion sensor this one has a

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:39,170
temperature sensor knio knio LEDs and

00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:43,210
they can be programmed using micro

00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,210
blocks and I'll show you how

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:54,830
so this is our microblogs work so it's

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:57,860
it's an IDE if anyone is familiar with

00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:01,939
scratch coding it's just a blocks it's

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:05,240
really simple practically anyone can

00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:09,770
learn to use it it's transformed into

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:12,409
byte code and each each MCU has its own

00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:15,379
a small virtual machine that runs on it

00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:21,909
and it can run the code that is created

00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:27,189
with micro blocks so now I'll show you

00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:27,189
the the gateway and micro blocks

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,520
okay

00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,060
that's what

00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:53,820
so we have five raspberry PI's scattered

00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:57,330
each one has a subdomain

00:07:53,820 --> 00:08:01,650
so this one is JSS to dot Mozilla that -

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:03,720
IOT both org each one has a paper next

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:07,950
to it so you can check which one it is

00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,930
so this one was created beforehand but

00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,050
if you if you bring it if you buy your

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:16,320
own Raspberry Pi you can flash the SD

00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:18,210
card with with the Gateway image that

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,420
you can download and then you create

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:26,090
your own credentials so I'll just go

00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,090
here GSS -

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,080
but sure okay

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,849
you can allow notifications because

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,469
you're the one who's going to create the

00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:41,070
notifications so there's nothing that's

00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:44,610
coming from outside so this is the menu

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:47,459
this is where your things show up these

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:51,380
are where you make the rules the floor

00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,380
plan the settings and

00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:00,410
this is the smart assistance

00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,600
okay

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:14,630
so let's add our first device so this is

00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:18,470
Mike roblox I did a small circuit here

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:19,519
it's just node MCU and the LEDs so I

00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,850
know the MCU

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,850
is

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:32,850
has anyone worked on this before yeah

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:36,000
one person okay so note MCU is a Wi-Fi

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:38,910
module so if you can turn pretty much

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
anything into an IOT enabled device

00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:44,310
because it's connects to the Wi-Fi and

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,320
it gets assigned an IP address so what

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:55,140
I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna connect

00:09:46,320 --> 00:10:01,110
this leads to to my IOT gateway mother

00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:08,760
for my hammer who knows what was that so

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:12,649
I'm gonna open an example and what I'm

00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,649
gonna do is I'm just gonna add

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,240
so it's 14

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:31,880
- so when I click connect

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:36,710
I can see the port so I connect this to

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:42,440
my USB and I can see the port that I

00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:47,750
connect to come to e so here I'm gonna

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:50,180
write the network name so the thing that

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:53,630
I'm programming should be on the same

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:56,570
network as the gateway so the Gateway is

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:59,270
connected to a Wi-Fi called Mozilla it's

00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:04,150
not the same Wi-Fi as your laptops Wi-Fi

00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:04,150
so I'm gonna write the credentials

00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:19,389
and I'm gonna start so as you see I get

00:11:15,609 --> 00:11:22,350
an IP address that's assigned to me so

00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:25,920
what I'm gonna do is go back here and

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:25,920
add a device

00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:34,950
so I will add by URL and I will write

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,950
the IP here

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,920
what's happening it's the dream

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,299
[Music]

00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,930
so don'ts don't connect them just yet

00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,370
just follow follow along with me and

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,910
then we'll have plenty of time to do

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,910
hands-on

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:28,380
[Music]

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:33,410
yeah so so I added the IP address and

00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,410
then I'm gonna call it the red LEDs

00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:50,540
so now I have the red left hopefully you

00:12:44,629 --> 00:12:57,290
can see it it's off and and I can turn

00:12:50,540 --> 00:13:01,040
it on so now I can i i'm only connecting

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:03,549
it for power so i can disconnect this

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,549
completely

00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:21,860
and it will still work so all you need

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:23,860
is just to click start on micro blocks

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:57,640
and it's permanently stored on your

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:57,640
device connects to all your recipe

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:11,810
yeah so this is but more about

00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:14,839
microbots you don't have to just use it

00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:25,779
for IOT you can use it to program as we

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:25,779
said the other MC use so this

00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,060
sure

00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,820
whatever

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:48,629
a little unit runkelman

00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,629
so I'm gonna connect

00:39:15,759 --> 00:39:21,489
cannot use this directly connected a no

00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:25,930
so so the sensors and the Gateway should

00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:27,609
be on the same subnet oh but you can but

00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,989
you can ask yeah so this one should be

00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:31,509
almost Allah because this one is a

00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:36,809
Mozilla but you can access the page from

00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:36,809
any network yeah

00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:44,090
the URL is equality

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:47,220
yes yes

00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:49,440
actually this one yeah yeah okay yeah

00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:51,680
but this one you can access it from any

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,680
network

00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,589
of the public

00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:14,819
didn't work come on I can't see anyone

00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:18,450
getting working this micro didn't LEDs

00:40:14,819 --> 00:40:20,609
like it's is there an array of LEDs like

00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:25,410
that on this device what is it

00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:29,099
the LEDs yeah mr. vice different this

00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:31,529
one yeah no it hasn't arrived like that

00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:33,509
oh no this the micro bit LEDs is

00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:35,880
different but all where are they running

00:40:33,509 --> 00:40:38,249
the lens oh yeah so if the device is a

00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,079
microbe eclair that will do this evening

00:40:38,249 --> 00:40:43,140
acts it will do this or not it will just

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,329
write up the integrated market but I

00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,249
can't see anyone getting a working yes

00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:49,799
so some of them are actually getting it

00:40:47,249 --> 00:40:55,109
working but I just want to check if the

00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:58,369
people with a driver problem yeah it

00:40:55,109 --> 00:40:58,369
didn't work didn't it

00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:08,180
yeah

00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:26,730
watch this already edit is it the same

00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:30,470
IP address yeah okay so it probably need

00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:30,470
to I did it yeah

00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:47,340
thereby URL

00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,349
there's two models of vases yes the

00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,519
larger one is the one that's working

00:41:50,349 --> 00:41:53,289
without a driver

00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:57,599
oh it's a smaller one with a flavor

00:41:53,289 --> 00:41:59,980
troubles really so that's that's strange

00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,039
yeah this is the older one have you

00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:04,809
tried giving the larger one to the

00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:08,400
people who are having trouble yeah I

00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:08,400
think so let me complete yeah

00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,880
okay

00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:24,660
sorry

00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:24,660
disconnect so yeah

00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:31,589
today I'm not doing this one how I just

00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:35,410
like theories how do we prove it but we

00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,930
known each other

00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:43,720
it's it's already uploaded so now I'm

00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:44,500
disconnected oh yeah completely

00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,170
disconnected

00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,800
it's just connected for the power and it

00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,140
still works

00:42:47,800 --> 00:43:05,230
so you can disconnect it and connect it

00:42:50,140 --> 00:43:07,390
to a power I just confirmed it yeah it's

00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:12,640
working the large one that's the larger

00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:15,040
work work okay that's good no actually

00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,580
we have more larger than small ones okay

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,700
so we can stir yeah we can switch them

00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,700
up

00:43:22,570 --> 00:43:36,940
yeah so did its work did not work it

00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:42,670
didn't work it was connected Wi-Fi

00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:47,170
connected but LEDs in turn on this one

00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:51,100
yeah yeah yeah yeah so this this one

00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:52,870
doesn't have an easy to turn on oh yeah

00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:56,260
it's working as long as you can connect

00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:58,810
it to the Wi-Fi we can so these guys are

00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:01,150
trying with the LED so when they're done

00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:04,170
I can because I only have a copy of

00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:04,170
breadboards okay

00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:09,559
sorry we'll be saying that this one

00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:15,710
doesn't have one everything so that if

00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:21,619
they try to yeah but if you want you can

00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:24,339
connect to my energy it's on let me

00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:24,339
check on which one

00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:42,559
yeah give me your my MCU yeah yeah he's

00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:45,730
gonna try so if if you go to jss to dr.

00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:45,730
Mozilla Oh

00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:02,680

so they just yeah they just disconnected

00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:36,200
it so if you want to get sure

00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,619
just give it a moment to connect

00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,820
[Music]

00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:00,809

[Music]

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,620
that's not

00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:46,130
yes I think it's not connected to the

00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:50,950
internet yet but we can we can actually

00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:50,950

00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:26,710
you put it here yeah the discipline is

00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:29,930
14 and then go to variables and take on

00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:33,700
put it instead of the green thing yeah

00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,700
okay now I'll connect

00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:40,099
okay

00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,430
yeah

what

00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:13,860
so does it takes a lot yeah

00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,340
what's

00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,920
[Music]

00:48:51,290 --> 00:48:55,370
can you try it again

00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,370
stop

00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,060
before this one yeah quickly I'm not

00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:11,619
sure why it's not working yeah well yeah

00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,619
maybe there's too many connections

00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:19,420
the only age of Isis

00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:26,290
just replug me mm-hmm

00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,990
my car down

00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,099
let's see

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,270
it's correct

00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:10,900
okay okay okay okay so let's go to the

00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,900
browser

00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:24,130
[Laughter]

00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:24,130
[Music]

00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:36,339
so this connects to your local network

00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:41,800
and they only the expressway partner or

00:50:36,339 --> 00:50:45,820
whatever the what this yeah so the

00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:48,940
Raspberry Pi is it's configured on your

00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:52,089
home network and all the sensors are

00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:54,070
also on your home network but this page

00:50:52,089 --> 00:50:58,060
you can access it from anywhere okay

00:50:54,070 --> 00:51:00,360
houses software on the resident allows

00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:03,599
it to cockatoos

00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,599
[Music]

00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:17,190
disconnect and even when you're in

00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:19,080
disconnected the code the code is

00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:22,560
already on the device so it's still

00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:27,350
worth flashing once and after so it's it

00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:27,350
still works it works

00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:38,010
I don't know what it's supposed to still

00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:41,480
work all right

00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:41,480
I'm gonna take this

00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:48,040
is this working no it doesn't you might

00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:51,300
not recognize the device you want to try

00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,300
this you could try

00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:04,989
samyama she must've understood like the

00:52:02,179 --> 00:52:04,989
blue china shop

00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:24,460
this one's working yeah yeah apparently

00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:28,280
the oldest devices working this is like

00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:31,319
the VD 0.1 okay but but

00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,319
[Music]

support lazy

00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:40,729
now the other one the one that I

00:52:37,819 --> 00:52:42,880
borrowed that's a lot so the small ones

00:52:40,729 --> 00:52:44,839
working we this guy can get it working

00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,410

00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:58,309
eighty six years old at this one the

00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,140
small one it's not working with other

00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:06,099
driver but this one's working without

00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:06,099

00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,079
one

00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:17,700
maybe it's like baby baby so so this one

00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:21,170
breaks yeah okay so disclaim yeah

00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:21,170
so this is the same good

00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:47,940
I'm indicate oh no it's it's I think

00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:51,960

I also try to be this one of this

00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:56,330
horrifying for me

00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:05,680
yeah yeah wait what yeah so maybe we're

00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:12,250
using another know them to you they

00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:16,779
small no wonder you tried no this one

00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:23,799
this one was with with Mike okay so what

00:54:16,779 --> 00:54:38,410
words I don't want to go but you can you

00:54:23,799 --> 00:54:51,789
can use in there okay can I take this is

00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:52,820
there anyone having that you're not

00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:55,939
getting an idea

00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:55,939
[Music]

00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:13,309
so this is a natural problem I think

00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:22,110
I'm here it oh this is your idea okay no

00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:25,880
you don't see anything because it

00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:28,590
doesn't have a light but you can see it

00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:32,360
can did you go to

00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:32,360
Jess oh yeah

00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:46,179
yeah which was a jazz for okay so now

00:55:39,819 --> 00:55:48,449
you go to add by URL and you write the

00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:54,459
IP address

00:55:48,449 --> 00:55:58,959
yeah you can't copy others just a second

00:55:54,459 --> 00:56:03,640
she's gonna pass this naked Amanda city

00:55:58,959 --> 00:56:10,239
in non-dollar know that she was really a

00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:12,219
mountain Chalet Kiera okay so this this

00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:13,390
is the device so you're not in actually

00:56:12,219 --> 00:56:16,209
going to see anything because it doesn't

00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:29,979
have a light but it's now connected to

00:56:16,209 --> 00:56:32,890
the this is the same yeah but I

00:56:29,979 --> 00:56:41,349
connected a light to it so you can try

00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:43,889
with this just go to get connected and

00:56:41,349 --> 00:56:43,889
go to

00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,380
okay

00:56:56,930 --> 00:57:00,249
so we need to change

00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:11,880
so this is connected to pin 14 its

00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:32,700
okay forty-three underage

00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:36,440
breadboards actually where's the second

00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:41,260
one so what you're asking is is can you

00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:41,260
put it on a private cloud instead of

00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:47,660
yeah so it's connected to then so right

00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:49,849
now no but it's connected to the

00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:52,579
Internet but it's not storing your data

00:58:49,849 --> 00:58:59,210
outside so your data is on the Raspberry

00:58:52,579 --> 00:59:03,619
Pi okay

00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:10,160
stopped can click stop stop okay so go

00:59:03,619 --> 00:59:13,670
to pins okay

00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:15,980
the third one said did you convince yeah

00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:25,609
the closest doesn't matter

00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:28,670
so drive accepted it up in here yeah

00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:34,220
above yeah okay

00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:35,910
so digital pin 14 then go to variables

00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:38,510
variable

00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:43,800
yes

00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:46,320
and drag on ya drag it over the green

00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:51,030
thing ya know I don't know what way you

00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:56,450
were first yeah yeah here yeah okay now

00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:59,530
start okay I'll connect

00:59:56,450 --> 00:59:59,530
the closest

01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:12,360
okay yeah so this is your IP you go to

01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:13,720
its you can click here to say IP address

01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:16,870
okay

01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:22,050
you can't copy it just I have to time it

01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:22,050
yeah so go to the gateway to a browser

01:00:23,779 --> 01:00:32,430
yeah this one yeah the one that you're

01:00:26,849 --> 01:00:38,670
dragging yeah that's fine yeah so this

01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:49,810
is the red left click on it off it's off

01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:57,580
right okay like a cutter head on a sweet

01:00:49,810 --> 01:01:00,120
awesome settle for Tim we thought the

01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:00,120
uncommon

01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:11,720
does does anyone have any problem

01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:28,560
does anyone have problem is everyone

01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:34,670
gone is it what's that it is anyone not

01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:34,670
done is anyone gone

01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,789
what's done

01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:47,040
[Music]

01:01:43,350 --> 01:01:48,870
yeah yeah can you just check if

01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:54,180
everyone's okay so we can start with

01:01:48,870 --> 01:02:01,110
multiple yeah yeah what's up so trying

01:01:54,180 --> 01:02:03,870
this right now this is the Wi-Fi oh but

01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:06,320
but you know you know you just need to

01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:06,320
connect this here

01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:12,969
[Music]

01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:23,820
I think it's nice there's a lot of

01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:23,820
people that are connecting to my

01:02:41,999 --> 01:02:47,599
Oh your password is wrong

01:02:56,830 --> 01:03:00,010
stop it

01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:05,800
maybe

01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:25,260
I think my intimacy

01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:39,510
it's difficult to tell whether it's now

01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:39,510
it should be fast so if it's working

01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:46,520
and here you can click and you can see

01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:54,360
this guy knows how to install the driver

01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:59,790
the works with a small one ok great so

01:03:54,360 --> 01:04:01,050
what was the secret he knows how to why

01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:03,300
why isn't it working

01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:06,090
it's the shixin so basically yeah it's

01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:08,520
the homebrew the checksum is really

01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:11,930
outdated so you can just eat it the cat

01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:15,810
fall and okay

01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:20,760
by the way can in is the transport for

01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:23,940
immersive a network because yeah yeah

01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:27,690
it's correct but I'm having a lot of

01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:31,460
devices connecting to it let's see if I

01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:31,460
can kick someone out oh yes

01:04:37,049 --> 01:04:42,940
yes

01:04:38,349 --> 01:04:44,769
oh so it's a hot spot on your mobile so

01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:48,640
that might be the problem because a lot

01:04:44,769 --> 01:04:57,150
of people's right yeah how can I kick

01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:57,150
someone out I can't kick someone out

01:04:57,859 --> 01:05:03,020
now it's gonna mess everything up

01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:24,160
I think I can disconnect the rice price

01:05:26,410 --> 01:05:45,039
okay so you have an idea when I 22 so

01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:45,039
now you know did you open the jail

01:05:51,420 --> 01:06:05,380
is everyone okay mean by the marble is

01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:06,970
like ten minutes so it's not gonna lie

01:06:05,380 --> 01:06:16,020
to me because it doesn't have a little

01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:16,020
and like yeah you can you can try this

01:06:36,929 --> 01:06:42,219
actually this is already programmed so I

01:06:40,059 --> 01:06:48,059
don't know to reprogram it harshly to go

01:06:42,219 --> 01:06:48,059
to jss to

01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:54,700
come on

01:07:04,329 --> 01:07:08,039
it's the same demo at

01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:22,210
workshop

01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:53,109
I almost let this is

01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:02,320
so what I think

01:08:41,490 --> 01:08:44,600
[Music]

01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,760
okay

01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:03,640
[Music]

01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:11,339
[Music]

01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:35,580
[Music]

01:10:30,130 --> 01:10:33,150
you want me

01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:59,040
yes

01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:33,939
[Music]

01:11:42,690 --> 01:11:45,910
[Music]

01:12:26,450 --> 01:12:29,529
[Music]

01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,540
[Music]

01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:33,579
[Music]

01:14:39,749 --> 01:14:43,400
applause - white back here

01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,729
[Music]

01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:37,909
one you know sure

01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:47,180
[Music]

01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:47,180
yep

01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:16,140
so now you kind of feel that the IOT

01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:18,930
development is mostly about like trying

01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:20,820
to figure out how to get yours you get

01:17:18,930 --> 01:17:22,980
your things working and setup and

01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:26,520
drivers installed and that's pretty much

01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:32,550
the hardest part and you saw that key

01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:35,070
with micro blocks you can just use this

01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:40,280
kind of scratch kind of interface that

01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:44,370
just pull together some some basic IOT

01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:47,610
applications connect your Wi-Fi and even

01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:51,540
use that device to serve as like a

01:17:47,610 --> 01:17:53,910
makeshift home automation device you

01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:55,800
know make it a light switch or something

01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:58,200
like that

01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:00,390
but like we are just on Asia right so

01:17:58,200 --> 01:18:02,700
it's kind of a JavaScript conference and

01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:08,700
so far you haven't really seen too much

01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:11,160
JavaScript which is like if what if you

01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:14,760
want to make more complicated things a

01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:16,560
multiple Makemake block is micro blocks

01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,850
it's really good if you want to get

01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,310
started if you can't want to get

01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:22,590
something quick out but as soon as you

01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:24,390
you know imagine a thousand lines of

01:18:22,590 --> 01:18:27,090
code how that translates into your

01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:31,110
thousand blocks it gets really out of

01:18:27,090 --> 01:18:33,510
hand and obviously like flexibility is

01:18:31,110 --> 01:18:35,430
limited by what kind of blocks you have

01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:39,020
access to and all of that

01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:42,510
so obviously you would problem what you

01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:45,060
use your your skills that you learned in

01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:47,640
other languages for programming IOT

01:18:45,060 --> 01:18:51,660
devices and there are many ways there's

01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:55,350
many ways to program microcontrollers

01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:57,180
Arduino is the most known one which you

01:18:55,350 --> 01:19:01,680
probably use something like the Arduino

01:18:57,180 --> 01:19:06,210
IDE and C++ usually to program your your

01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:08,430
your your your microcontrollers there

01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:10,620
are all other solutions there are micro

01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:12,719
pattern tiny go and all kinds of other

01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:14,850
languages that have their tiny versions

01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,890
and even JavaScript if you want to use

01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:20,360
JavaScript or microcontrollers there are

01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:20,360
lining of ways to do that

01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:27,080
Breno or jitter script all kinds of

01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:31,350
other languages there's also a language

01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:35,240
a JavaScript runtime called excess like

01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:38,640
extra small created by the moddable team

01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:40,860
that mozilla cooperates with and the

01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,390
cool thing about excess is that they

01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:47,640
actually created a JavaScript engine

01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:50,250
that is able to provide you almost

01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:53,070
perfect compatibility with the

01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:56,190
JavaScript standard that means the

01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:59,190
latest tradition like es6 and and and

01:19:56,190 --> 01:20:02,130
further async functions and all the

01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:04,110
coolest and newest bells and whistles

01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:07,170
that you can imagine you can still use

01:20:04,110 --> 01:20:08,990
them on a microcontroller and still fit

01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:13,680
your code onto your microcontroller

01:20:08,990 --> 01:20:16,710
which is pretty cool so this access

01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:18,990
engine my marble actually what they do

01:20:16,710 --> 01:20:21,330
is they actually focus on microphone

01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:23,250
shoulder devices and that means they

01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:27,420
actually provide you with a bunch of

01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:30,870
api's that may not even make sense on

01:20:27,420 --> 01:20:34,140
the web or not even doesn't really make

01:20:30,870 --> 01:20:36,330
sense on a microcontroller in the same

01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:39,680
form it makes sense on a map so when the

01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:42,690
web you use like WebGL or canvas to

01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:45,050
create graphics and animations on the

01:20:42,690 --> 01:20:47,450
dom to create you eyes on

01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:51,450
microcontrollers that have a few hundred

01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:53,190
pixels size this place or even don't

01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:57,290
have even displays in your first place

01:20:53,190 --> 01:21:00,600
or have to have low-level access and

01:20:57,290 --> 01:21:02,970
battery consume then be conscious about

01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:05,490
consuming the battery you need a

01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:07,650
different API than a fetch API or

01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:09,300
something like WebSockets so they

01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:11,310
actually provide you access to low-level

01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:13,950
Stockyards they actually provide you

01:21:11,310 --> 01:21:16,740
access to Bluetooth connectivity because

01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:19,440
some chips come with Bluetooth and they

01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:22,820
actually provide you a kind of interface

01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:27,750
for interacting with graphical displays

01:21:22,820 --> 01:21:31,770
all of this in an open source library

01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:35,370
that oops that you can use

01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:41,370
and there we go

01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:45,180
so whatever blamed the German customs

01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:46,980
the we wanted to get some more devices

01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:48,780
to use so you can actually not just play

01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:51,540
with the tiny micro controllers that we

01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:54,470
have there but also get some some

01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:57,390
connected devices as well you've seen

01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:59,730
Mel demoed how you can just use your

01:21:57,390 --> 01:22:04,620
micro controller and use a breadboard or

01:21:59,730 --> 01:22:07,320
like build attach other devices to some

01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:09,090
of the pins and use LEDs or even more

01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:11,660
complex devices that you can your

01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:15,690
sensors that you could communicate with

01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:19,020
I have a device with me and like me to

01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:21,600
see if this is enough oh there yeah so

01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:24,300
so I have this device with me so if you

01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:26,640
look at this I'm gonna just disconnect

01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:29,700
it just for a moment if you look at this

01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:31,710
device this is nothing really it's

01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:33,930
nothing not very different than the

01:22:31,710 --> 01:22:36,020
devices you have been using because it

01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:40,320
has the same microcontroller chip on it

01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:43,350
it's just like kind of plugs into like

01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:45,780
this hardware which is like just a

01:22:43,350 --> 01:22:48,600
glorified breadboard with a screen on

01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:51,990
top so this actually has like a screen

01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:57,060
built into the hardware itself to make

01:22:51,990 --> 01:23:04,590
it a bit easier to get an out-of-the-box

01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:10,370
prototyping experience so let me try yep

01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:10,370
Oh God I just messed up all the pins so

01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:29,680
that was probably a bad idea to take it

01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:29,680
off already go see

01:23:35,330 --> 01:23:39,790
oh there we go

01:23:43,730 --> 01:23:49,620
so when I plug this back and you can see

01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:51,600
that this this is a device that comes so

01:23:49,620 --> 01:23:55,740
there's a microchip the same Wi-Fi

01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:59,250
control verify connectivity also this

01:23:55,740 --> 01:24:01,680
the ESP for DQ device chip is actually

01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:03,690
Bluetooth compatible so you also get

01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:05,790
bluetooth out of the same same package

01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:08,370
and what you can see here let me see if

01:24:05,790 --> 01:24:10,590
I can show you is actually color a small

01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:12,540
colored screen cool thing about it is

01:24:10,590 --> 01:24:14,430
that it actually is a touch screen wow

01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:20,160
this is harder than I expected it to be

01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:23,610
and so if I there you oh I got it so you

01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:25,710
can actually you can actually have

01:24:23,610 --> 01:24:27,660
interactions on the screen as well and

01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:32,760
control the interactions as well as put

01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:36,000
graphics on it so it's pretty cool but

01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:40,350
how do you program it right they easy

01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:43,950
really is supposed to be a online IDE

01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:47,070
very similar to what you just saw in

01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:53,310
micro blocks let me see if I can open it

01:24:47,070 --> 01:24:57,660
up nope there we go yeah so there is a

01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:59,730
working progress online IDE it kind of

01:24:57,660 --> 01:25:02,300
sort it looks like Visual Studio code if

01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:06,510
you look at it and see Queen Mab it no

01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:09,540
but there are there is an online IDE in

01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:13,080
progress the problem in the online ID is

01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:15,000
that actually uses web usb web USB is

01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:17,340
currently only supported by Chrome and

01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,460
even by Chrome it's barely supported I

01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:22,860
couldn't get it working on my Linux

01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:25,170
machine for half a day so I kind of give

01:25:22,860 --> 01:25:29,370
it up but I still gonna show you so

01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:33,660
ideally the online IDE when it gets to a

01:25:29,370 --> 01:25:35,640
bit more stable will get you like a kind

01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:37,410
of easy startup but also this could be

01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:39,330
used if you compile it to like an

01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:42,270
electron app you can use it as like a

01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:45,300
local device but also you can just write

01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:48,060
the JavaScript and use the multiple SDK

01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:49,680
which is what I'm going to be using to

01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:52,030
flesh the device with with the

01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:55,480
JavaScript code

01:25:52,030 --> 01:25:59,770
that you want to see on the device so

01:25:55,480 --> 01:26:01,870
this is a very simple example that I put

01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:05,590
in here just so that you can kind of

01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:08,830
have a idea for how do you put code on

01:26:05,590 --> 01:26:10,900
the device it's very easy you just use

01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:14,080
the same exact JavaScript that you would

01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:16,870
be using online it has import statements

01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:18,760
it has a few built in modules that you

01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:20,770
can get some network connectivity and

01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:23,590
some API is that you would normally find

01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:26,020
on the web or no GS like a network

01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:28,210
socket or something like that that you

01:26:26,020 --> 01:26:31,300
can actually use to to make network

01:26:28,210 --> 01:26:33,160
connectivity on the device and and the

01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:34,900
rest is just plain JavaScript as you

01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:38,800
would as you would as you would use it

01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:43,620
normally so so I already shown you like

01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:48,940
the whoops no no no no where is the

01:26:43,620 --> 01:26:57,100
dilemma yeah so I make my face a bit

01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:59,410
bigger so I already shown you the like

01:26:57,100 --> 01:27:03,130
the draggable demo so I'm gonna do that

01:26:59,410 --> 01:27:10,260
I'm actually going to put some more

01:27:03,130 --> 01:27:14,050
interesting UI on here not here yeah and

01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:17,760
and I'm gonna flush this with the mini

01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:22,240
better example so if you actually go to

01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:24,640
the multiple open-source repo you will

01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:27,220
actually find it tons of examples that

01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:32,290
you know it's super easy to get started

01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:38,130
so it is flashing to do yeah it's

01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:41,280
loading you're loading loading loading

01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:44,520
if you have Wi-Fi this is gonna work

01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:48,540
eventually we might not have Wi-Fi so at

01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:53,430
that point it's not gonna work oh come

01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:58,250
on today is not a big have not a good

01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:58,250
the demo gods are not really on us

01:27:58,430 --> 01:28:07,500
oh yes because this is the better

01:28:02,420 --> 01:28:08,580
without the Wi-Fi connection this is

01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:12,950
this is better

01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:15,720
okay so compiling again yeah it's

01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:20,040
flashing their device so it's gonna

01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:22,820
restart in a moment the glare is not

01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:22,820
helping just a lot

01:28:25,979 --> 01:28:32,679
at work did it work come on

01:28:29,619 --> 01:28:35,769
not a loading okay that's alright there

01:28:32,679 --> 01:28:38,849
we go so are you you're not gonna see

01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:43,769
because I'm declare is that we have this

01:28:38,849 --> 01:28:47,519
fancy user interface for like a better

01:28:43,769 --> 01:28:51,489
kind of thing so you can have like a

01:28:47,519 --> 01:28:53,979
better display that you know you can

01:28:51,489 --> 01:28:56,739
connect you it connects to the internet

01:28:53,979 --> 01:28:58,059
pulls in the data and like shows you

01:28:56,739 --> 01:29:02,499
know if you should bring an umbrella

01:28:58,059 --> 01:29:05,979
today another interesting thing I wanted

01:29:02,499 --> 01:29:15,039
to show you is a showcase a bit more of

01:29:05,979 --> 01:29:16,929
the Wi-Fi more of the you know you can

01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:19,269
use these like small devices scattered

01:29:16,929 --> 01:29:21,729
around your home as like kind of like a

01:29:19,269 --> 01:29:26,379
home automation or home control device

01:29:21,729 --> 01:29:28,629
and it's flushing again and this is

01:29:26,379 --> 01:29:31,089
another application that is also like a

01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:34,029
few hundred lines of JavaScript only and

01:29:31,089 --> 01:29:38,079
what you're gonna see is is it actually

01:29:34,029 --> 01:29:40,119
shows and much nicer interface for your

01:29:38,079 --> 01:29:45,059
Wi-Fi connection so I'm gonna click on

01:29:40,119 --> 01:29:45,059
one of those a or not

01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:51,500
I'm gonna click on it but you're not

01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:51,679
gonna see what I'm click on oh there we

01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,780
go

01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:56,119
and you're gonna see it shows like a

01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:58,130
little like keyboard so I can input like

01:29:56,119 --> 01:30:00,260
the Wi-Fi password or something so you

01:29:58,130 --> 01:30:03,710
can build self-contained applications

01:30:00,260 --> 01:30:06,110
right into you into the UI of this

01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:11,590
device and just one more last one last

01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:17,960
more demo that to kind of wrap it all up

01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:20,690
the one you can also have applications

01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:22,940
that tie straight into them is all of

01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:24,980
that things gateway so when you have all

01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:28,130
kinds of other devices scattered in your

01:30:24,980 --> 01:30:29,960
home you have lights and whatever you

01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:32,150
can also and this is what I just

01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:37,639
mentioned which you can also build your

01:30:32,150 --> 01:30:40,940
own so oops so what you're gonna see is

01:30:37,639 --> 01:30:43,849
like a switch that you can just you know

01:30:40,940 --> 01:30:47,000
turn on and off like just like you did

01:30:43,849 --> 01:30:48,500
with other devices but instead of you

01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:50,150
know obviously you would want to do this

01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:52,489
like from a central location for your

01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:56,090
phone but maybe you want to have like

01:30:52,489 --> 01:30:58,130
like a tiny control panels you know in

01:30:56,090 --> 01:31:00,949
your house as well so people who don't

01:30:58,130 --> 01:31:03,320
have access to the Gateway directly you

01:31:00,949 --> 01:31:07,820
can expose functionality your smart home

01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:10,489
why these tiny small tablet displays the

01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:12,770
one of the biggest appeal of the ESP

01:31:10,489 --> 01:31:14,900
devices so this this chip this micro

01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:18,260
controller the powers the this this

01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:21,949
whole build up is there inexpensiveness

01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:24,500
the esp8266 the some other devices you

01:31:21,949 --> 01:31:28,460
have been using is literally a few

01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:31,099
dollars if your order is quantity and

01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:33,050
the ESP for the cue the one that has

01:31:31,099 --> 01:31:35,599
Bluetooth support and which is a bit

01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:38,780
faster and newer it's just a few more

01:31:35,599 --> 01:31:42,829
dollars this whole screen assembly is

01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:46,460
being sold for about $20 US dollars that

01:31:42,829 --> 01:31:48,440
is so you could imagine that it wouldn't

01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:50,929
bring by the bank if you wanted to

01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:53,059
scatter some of these smart controllers

01:31:50,929 --> 01:31:54,540
or devices around your home and you

01:31:53,059 --> 01:31:56,340
could

01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:58,980
you could program them whatever you

01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:00,989
would like to do again just as we had

01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:03,960
anything else in the muscle of F thanks

01:32:00,989 --> 01:32:06,960
Frank this is not you're not bound by

01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:09,720
you know the crappy software and apps

01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:12,930
that ship ships with all the devices

01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:14,520
that you have at home you can do you can

01:32:12,930 --> 01:32:17,340
make your own and you can make sure it's

01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:19,470
open-source you can use somebody else's

01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:21,180
you can customize your own experiences

01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:23,130
instead of having to you know pull your

01:32:21,180 --> 01:32:27,060
hair out trying to set up a smart camera

01:32:23,130 --> 01:32:30,150
that you just paid $200 for so yeah so

01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:33,780
just to wrap yeah you don't really want

01:32:30,150 --> 01:32:37,500
to see my face too much just to wrap

01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:39,660
this all up you can use the Mozilla

01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:42,690
gateway as the kind of like a private

01:32:39,660 --> 01:32:45,360
source for or like a private you know

01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:48,210
center of your home automation devices

01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:51,690
and you can use like all kinds of

01:32:48,210 --> 01:32:53,790
devices proprietary ones that you bought

01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:56,160
off there is a lot of add-ons so you can

01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:58,710
tie those into your smart net but also

01:32:56,160 --> 01:33:01,140
build your own devices wherever you want

01:32:58,710 --> 01:33:05,760
to do some simple like switches and and

01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:08,580
stuff that you just want to kind of you

01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:10,170
know just put together quickly or if you

01:33:08,580 --> 01:33:14,420
want to build more elaborate like

01:33:10,170 --> 01:33:19,230
control devices and sensors right into

01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:21,540
the rooms or or do the space itself you

01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:25,500
can also do that with JavaScript without

01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:30,120
having to learn or you know worry about

01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:31,620
C++ and you know memory segmentation

01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:33,960
faults and all kinds of other problems

01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:36,570
as soon as you can set up you know your

01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:38,520
computer to kind of accept the USB

01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:41,580
connection which seems to be probably

01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:45,080
the hardest part of the whole thing okay

01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:45,080
I think we are done right

01:33:46,389 --> 01:33:51,080
yeah if if you have any questions we are

01:33:49,489 --> 01:33:52,820
we are here still we're gonna be

01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:54,679
starting to set up for inferno next

01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:57,960
group but feel free to ask questions

01:33:54,679 --> 01:34:03,340
thank you for joining

01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:03,340
