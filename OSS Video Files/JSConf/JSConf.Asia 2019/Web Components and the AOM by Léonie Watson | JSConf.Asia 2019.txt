Title: Web Components and the AOM by Léonie Watson | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-21
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	We can use Web Components to create reusable solutions. With Custom Elements, the Shadow DOM, HTML Templates, the Web Speech API, and a little ARIA, we can create a progressively more advanced solution for anyone who wants to listen to content; and when the Accessibility Object Model (AOM) lands, we'll be able to do even more.

Léonie is Director of TetraLogical; a member of the W3C Advisory Board; co-Chair of the W3C Web Platform Working Group; and a member of the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Advisory Committee. Amongst other things, Léonie is co-organiser of the Inclusive Design 24 (#id24) conference; co-author of the Inclusive Design Principles; and mentor to young people interested in the fields of accessibility and inclusive design.
