Title: npm's Laurie Voss: JavaScript - Who, What, Where, Why and Next | JSConf.Asia 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-24
Playlist: JSConf.Asia 2019
Description: 
	npm has more data than anyone about who JavaScript developers are and what we’re up to. Using our unparalleled access to registry usage stats and the results of our 2019 ecosystem survey of over 33,000 developers, I break down the current state of JavaScript and where trends look like they’re headed, from frameworks through security best practices, so you can make more informed technical choices.

Laurie has been a web developer for 23 years and is passionate about making the web better and web development more accessible to everybody. He is co-founder and Chief Data Officer at npm, Inc., provider of package management and security services to the JavaScript developers of the world.

00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,779
hello everybody uh thank you so much for

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,000
inviting me and thank you for staying

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:28,619
all the way to the last talk on a

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,119
three-day conference I know that it is

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:32,040
very hard to keep the energy going all

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,790
the way to the end of a conference and

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,590
the very end of the day this has been a

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,350
great conference I want to thank the

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,059
organizers the staff the volunteers for

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,129
an amazing conference I go to a lot of

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,010
conferences and this has been absolutely

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:48,510
world-class the curation of the talks

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,379
the quality of the speakers the

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,840
organization the a/v the food please

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:59,030
let's all give them a round of applause

00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:02,129
[Applause]

00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:08,760
and before we get started we have to do

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:10,770
the pre talk speaker selfie because if

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,500
it doesn't end up on Instagram did it

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,110
even happen

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,920
all right with that important business

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,200
out of the way hello I'm Laurie I helped

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,479
co-found NPM Inc I didn't invent NPM I

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,180
just did all of the other stuff and I'm

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,520
currently chief data officer there but

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,710
what I really AM is a web developer I've

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,390
been a web developer for 23 years now

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,400
which means that I have been writing

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:40,470
HTML longer than some of you have been

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,689
alive but making the web bigger and

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,060
better and more accessible by getting

00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:48,390
more people involved that is what really

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,399
motivates me and I know that you were

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,380
all expecting a talk about the future of

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,210
JavaScript but at the last minute I

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,909
decided I would just throw the whole

00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,200
thing out and instead this talk is gonna

00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,749
be about micro front ends

00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:05,869
[Music]

00:02:01,749 --> 00:02:07,819
can you even imagine this is just a joke

00:02:05,869 --> 00:02:09,080
for like the five people who spend way

00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:11,720
too much time on Twitter and will

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,000
understand this joke what I'm really

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,660
here to talk about is JavaScript I'm

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,260
gonna talk about who we are we the

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:22,790
people who write JavaScript where we use

00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,549
JavaScript and what we're doing with it

00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:27,620
today and I'm also going to talk about

00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:30,170
why we're doing this stuff the forces

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,959
that got JavaScript and us into where we

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:34,579
are today and then finally I'm going to

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,810
talk about what comes next I'm gonna

00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:38,269
look at all of the trends that we're

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:42,319
seeing and make some guesses about where

00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:44,569
it's going the goal of this talk is to

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,930
give you a sense of where you are in the

00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:50,030
landscape of JavaScript and where your

00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,980
current tools and techniques sit in that

00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,349
landscape because too many developers

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,660
work in a sort of vacuum you don't know

00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:59,450
if the stuff that you're doing is a best

00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,220
practice or if it's a fad or if it's

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,349
this outdated technique that nobody does

00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,440
anymore too many people are like I'm

00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,970
gonna do this thing and I hope it's okay

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,670
but we know and we should be able to

00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,139
share that information with you so I

00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:16,510
hope you'll leave this talk feeling good

00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:18,500
about one thing that you're using and

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,030
realizing it's time to move away from

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,280
one other thing that you're using and

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,730
also curious and excited about learning

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,560
one new thing but before I say all of

00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:29,810
this stuff it's worth asking how we know

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,880
all of this stuff I have three main

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,069
sources first the NPM registry logs

00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,829
every time you download a package we see

00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:38,120
it happen they contain an enormous

00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:41,389
amount of information about what

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,970
JavaScript developers are up to second

00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:46,040
we went out and asked people directly

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,930
two years ago we did a survey of 16,000

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,450
JavaScript developers and last year we

00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,739
did a bigger one of 33,000 JavaScript

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,980
developers and asked you directly like

00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,359
what are you using and why and I also

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:58,010
supplemented and double-checked our

00:03:56,359 --> 00:04:00,319
numbers using the excellent state of

00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,720
JavaScript survey run by independent

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,849
members of the community incidentally

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,440
while this talk is strictly about

00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:08,870
JavaScript if you are interested in

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,519
warren CSS the same people who did the

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,639
state of javascript survey this year for

00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,910
the first time did a state of CSS survey

00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,459
and it's full of fun

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,950
Meishan about what is going on in the

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,200
world of CSS and the website is an

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,760
absolute nightmare CSS transitions

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,930
because they just threw in everything

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,580
that they could possibly do and before

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,200
we dive in a few quick disclaimers some

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,340
of what I'm presenting here is facts and

00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,230
some of what I'm presenting here is

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:36,480
opinions and I've tried to be as clear

00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:40,620
as possible about when I'm doing which

00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:43,050
one of those things sometimes people see

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,030
a graph that I present that says that a

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,250
technology that they love is getting

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:50,940
less popular and then they get mad at me

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,070
and what I'm asking you to do is I have

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,050
a bunch of really terrible opinions get

00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,910
mad about the opinions don't get mad

00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,590
about the graph the graph is just a

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,190
thing you can't get mad at it it's just

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:04,140
happening I don't have a horse in this

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,370
race other than NPM I don't contribute

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,310
to any of the projects that I'm talking

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,930
about so I'm not I'm trying to you know

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:14,610
just present the facts without any bias

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,870
here but all facts have bias secondly a

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,790
lot of what I'm talking about involves

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,560
relative popularity of technologies and

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,720
I want to make clear but just because

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,770
the technology is popular that doesn't

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,990
mean that I think it's the best

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:28,530
technology in fact I don't even know

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:30,270
what the best technology means Evan you

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,340
and his talk yesterday gave a really

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,380
great description of the sort of space

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,700
that frameworks in particular live in

00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,860
it's this sort of multi-dimensional

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,380
space where you can't even know what's

00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,820
best there is no best there's just you

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,980
know trade-offs that you make in all

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:49,919
sorts of directions so for technology

00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:51,450
popularity is useful if there are a lot

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,010
of people using your technology then

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,840
there gonna be a lot of blog posts a lot

00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:57,060
of tutorials a lot of questions answered

00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,030
on Stack Overflow there will be a lot of

00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,290
people helping find and fix bugs so if

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,410
you work with something that's very

00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,520
popular it often makes your work easier

00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,740
regardless of you know how good that

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,550
technology is by you know whatever

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,810
definition of good you want to use so

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,060
popularity is what I have data about and

00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,320
popularity is what I'm talking about but

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,250
I'm not saying that things are better

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,110
and finally I really love this stuff and

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,180
I'd have to get very excited about this

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,800
stuff and when I get excited I cursed

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,659
like a drunken sailor

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,190
and there's just nothing I intend to do

00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:33,389
about that so you're all just going to

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:35,129
have to deal so who are we

00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:37,500
JavaScript developers the answer is

00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,930
we're pretty much like all developers at

00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,340
this point when we said that when we set

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,840
out to get these questions I was like oh

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,280
well I'm expecting JavaScript developers

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,080
to be different demographically in some

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,330
way maybe we're younger maybe we work on

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,849
different stuff now it turns out that

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,250
almost everybody who is a programmer

00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:55,110
gets to do JavaScript these days and so

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,729
we look like all other programmers we

00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:59,250
have the same age distribution the same

00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:00,840
levels of education we work in every

00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,580
industry and in every country in the

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,740
world and the reason is there are just

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:08,819
so many of us there are 11 million

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,129
JavaScript developers in 2019 and those

00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:13,199
11 million developers are using more

00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:15,060
open source software than any other

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,940
language community has ever used before

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,919
the NPM registry is the largest

00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:23,159
repository of open-source software of

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,930
any kind and by any measure by number of

00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:26,460
modules by lines of code by number of

00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:28,530
users whatever measure you want to pick

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,830
it is more than twice as big as the

00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,819
next-biggest registry of course

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,710
everybody knows that javascript in

00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,120
particular has a tendency to use lots of

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,090
modules so maybe that's not a fair

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,949
comparison so does having a really big

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,740
registry translate to any other kind of

00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:44,969
activity on github javascript is the

00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,680
largest language by a number of

00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:48,419
repositories by a number of issues and

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,449
by number of lines of code and it has

00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:53,909
been for seven years in a row on Stack

00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:56,310
Overflow they did a survey of 80,000

00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:58,710
developers and JavaScript was again the

00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,779
most popular language with 68% of all

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:02,849
developers in their survey saying that

00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,020
they use it of course you're all at JS

00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,449
console you probably knew that

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,169
JavaScript was pretty popular but here

00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:09,210
is the truth

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,069
javascript is the most popular

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,719
programming language in the world today

00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:14,639
and because there are more developers in

00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:16,800
the world today than ever before it is

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,729
the most popular programming language

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,860
that has ever existed as JavaScript

00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:24,960
community continues to grow the

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,610
JavaScript community is changing the

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,069
JavaScript the one thing that we noticed

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,050
that's changed about us between our

00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:32,729
survey in 2018 and the one we did last

00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,740
year this year is that JavaScript

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,990
developers are getting more experienced

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,640
they've been writing JavaScript for

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:43,630
longer we especially noticed this with

00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,400
p.m. itself a year ago half of NPM users

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:47,080
were what we consider new they'd been

00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:51,760
using NPM for less than two years and

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:54,310
this year only 36% are round about 2014

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,290
and 2015 there was a massive spike in

00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,300
the number of NPM users it was when the

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,580
existing pool of JavaScript developers

00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,870
sort of latched on to the idea that NPM

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,880
was a thing that they should use and

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:09,160
they all showed up at once and today the

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,620
number of new NPM users and the number

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,570
of new JavaScript users is pretty much

00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,820
the same basically anybody who learns

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,860
JavaScript learns NPM at the same time

00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,350
and all of the people who had learned

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:24,100
JavaScript before NPM came along have at

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:26,380
this point pretty much all adopted it so

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,600
now we believe that about 99% of

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,070
JavaScript developers use NPM that's

00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,190
part of why we have so much information

00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:36,580
and it's part of why in this talk I use

00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,650
the terms like NPM users or respondents

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,600
or JavaScript developers as pretty much

00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:43,930
interchangeable because they pretty much

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,370
are this ever-growing pool of

00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,380
increasingly experienced JavaScript

00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:50,470
developers means that we've seen a shift

00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,300
in what people care about we knew from

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,790
analyzing last year's data when we cut

00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,670
people up by how long they've been doing

00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,260
JavaScript that more experienced

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,300
developers care more about best

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,560
practices they knew do more bundling

00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,450
they do more lending they care more

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,880
about security the care about they care

00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,560
more about everything and because all of

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,090
javascript is becoming more experienced

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:15,100
that's now true of all JavaScript

00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:16,480
developers as a whole since last year's

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,220
survey the number of people concerned

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,920
about the security of their open source

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,440
has increased in the last two years

00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,350
NPM has introduced two-factor off to

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:29,110
help protect package publishers from

00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,700
having their account stolen as well as a

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,070
security team and a bunch of automation

00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,690
behind the scenes to detect and flag

00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,670
malicious packages but malicious

00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:39,160
packages while they get a lot of press

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,990
they're not really the biggest source of

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,520
security vulnerabilities the biggest

00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,930
source of security vulnerabilities is

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,240
accidental vulnerabilities

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:47,740
vulnerabilities caused by you using a

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,630
package with a known security

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:53,020
vulnerability and not updating your

00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:53,540
dependencies so last year we introduced

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,449
the end

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,649
audit command which will find and fix

00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:59,509
security vulnerabilities in your

00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:02,240
application by upgrading to a more

00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:03,230
secure version of that package in the

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,199
last 30 days

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:08,149
we have performed more than 335 million

00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:13,069
of these audits because they happen

00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:14,329
every time you run NPM install if you

00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:15,949
think that your company should be doing

00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:18,380
more about JavaScript security and it

00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:20,360
probably should then you'll forgive me

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:23,630
if I spend a little time mentioning NPM

00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,819
Enterprise NPM Enterprise gives you your

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,550
own registry on your own domain with

00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:29,660
your own NPM website where you can see

00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,800
what you where you're devs have

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,660
published you can publish your own

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,459
packages you can search within all of

00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,680
your company's Java scripts you can see

00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:38,360
full package pages and read Me's it's

00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,040
just like having your own little NPM

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,019
universe inside of your company it

00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,000
includes single sign-on support and

00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:45,230
extra security and compliance reporting

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,329
which is the kind of stuff that big

00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,579
companies need basically if you are a

00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:51,050
big company you should probably be using

00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:52,220
it and if you are a smaller company we

00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,350
have a company we have a product called

00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:57,769
orgs which does many of the same things

00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,510
and is a lot cheaper so back to the

00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:02,230
survey data after that terrible terrible

00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,230
sales pitch

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,399
I was wearing the rainbow shirt and

00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:10,160
there's rainbow unicorns on the stage

00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:13,339
and I have been for the entire three

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,930
days I've been telling myself I'm gonna

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,610
do some of this talk while sitting on

00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:21,589
the damn unicorn so that's gonna be this

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:23,720
section so another aspect of our

00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:26,000
increasingly experienced user base is

00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,220
that people actually care about the

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,380
software licenses that they use that was

00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,480
kind of a surprise because like people

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,130
think of JavaScript developers as being

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,230
Cowboys who just like throw in

00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:39,260
there without looking at it but it turns

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,870
out that 58% of JavaScript developers

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,850
say that the software license effects

00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:47,240
their decision to use an open-source

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:48,889
package and 55% of those people say that

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,199
their company actively prevents them

00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:53,420
from using certain software licenses so

00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:55,310
overall 29 percent of people are

00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,040
prohibited from using certain licenses

00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:00,800
what license is exactly well

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,839
unsurprisingly the GPL and the a GPL are

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,399
unpopular because of the restrictions

00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,769
that a place on commercial development

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,800
but bigger than those was

00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:11,989
nice licenses basically anybody who

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,850
cares about licenses has to hire a

00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:14,449
lawyer to tell them which licenses are

00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,069
okay

00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:17,989
so if you use a license that they've

00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:19,519
never heard of they have to go back to

00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:22,160
the lawyer and pay the lawyer more money

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,649
nobody wants to do that so if you're

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,839
releasing open source software by all

00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:28,910
means include some kind of license but

00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,410
stick to one of the big popular licenses

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,809
because otherwise people will just go

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:35,149
this license is too weird I will not use

00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:37,549
it a really great example of that was

00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:40,089
Facebook tried to change the license

00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:43,489
that react is licensed under and like

00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:46,009
react a very popular Facebook very large

00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:48,079
company but even they could not get past

00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:49,790
the battery of annoyed lawyers going no

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:55,249
we do not want to have to figure this

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:56,600
out again go back to MIT and the final

00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:58,970
aspect of who we are that I want to

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,429
touch on is a consequence of how

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,860
ubiquitous JavaScript has become which

00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:06,049
is that 25% of JavaScript developers

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,779
don't consider JavaScript to be their

00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:10,699
primary language because javascript is

00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:12,049
so popular it's becoming escapable and

00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:13,279
because it's inescapable there's a mean

00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:15,679
it means that there's a lot of people

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,049
who program javascript who are doing so

00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,299
because they have to not because they

00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:25,459
want to and that is going to show up in

00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:26,720
a bunch of places in this data so what

00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:28,639
are these other languages written by

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,170
developers who don't who Brent don't

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,269
primarily write JavaScript well the top

00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,619
of the list is typescript typescript is

00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:36,799
an interesting case and I'm gonna talk

00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:38,839
more about it in a bit but there's also

00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,290
lots of Python and Java and C and C

00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,429
sharp in there and we'll see the effect

00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,860
that that's having later interestingly

00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:47,360
12% of JavaScript developers say that

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,759
javascript is the only language they

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,970
write it's just all JavaScript all the

00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:56,360
time for 12% of you but 88% of you are

00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:58,790
writing something else so now we've

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,549
covered who we are we are all over the

00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,230
world we are every age and experience we

00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:04,939
are increasingly sophisticated and we

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,489
care more about licensing and security

00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:09,379
than we used to where are we writing all

00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,860
of this javascript well the answer is

00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:15,769
every goddamn place you can imagine

00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:18,769
first and most obviously is browsers 97%

00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:20,660
of us are writing code for browsers 77%

00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:23,240
of us are also writing JavaScript for

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,220
servus so noches is obviously still a

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,379
big part of the JavaScript's community

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,800
but there are two big surprises in here

00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:32,660
and the first one is native apps 46% of

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,930
JavaScript developers are writing native

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:37,910
apps and 13% of us are doing embedded as

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,430
I'm going to dig into all of these

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,949
numbers because they're fascinating

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:45,259
first off when people write for browsers

00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:46,100
do they target the mobile web or the

00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:48,199
desktop web

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,870
well the overwhelming majority 72%

00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:52,790
target both but despite all of our talk

00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:55,120
about mobile first a vanishingly small

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,709
number of people target only mobile and

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,870
27% of us are getting away without

00:15:57,709 --> 00:16:01,970
thinking about mobile at all that is

00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,709
probably a legitimate number because

00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,329
there's lots of applications we're just

00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,310
never gonna be used on a phone like it's

00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:08,449
some internal app admin application like

00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,639
no one's ever gonna be running that on

00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:13,189
their phone

00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:14,959
but let's talk about native apps 46% of

00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:15,379
JavaScript developers are writing native

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,769
apps

00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:21,079
by a native app I mean an application

00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:23,269
that runs directly on your desktop or

00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:25,370
your phone I don't mean like you know

00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:27,230
it's not a shortcut that's you know

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,240
actually a web app it's being either

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,920
transpiled or it's running directly with

00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,139
full access to the file system like an

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,819
electron we were very careful about how

00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:36,920
we phrased this question to make sure

00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:38,720
that that was what people were answering

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,790
about this year because when we asked it

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,230
two years ago we used this ridiculously

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,819
vague language and everybody was like

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:48,740
well sometimes people look at it on

00:16:43,819 --> 00:16:52,490
mobile so it's a mobile app anyway I'm a

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,560
very bad statistician anyway where are

00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:57,290
we writing these native apps as you can

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,459
see the biggest group is mobile devs 35%

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,800
of respondents said that they are

00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:02,990
writing native mobile apps that's of all

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,659
JavaScript developers 35% are writing

00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,429
native mobile apps and 26% of

00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:08,030
respondents are writing native desktop

00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:10,669
agz

00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:13,240
apps and a big chunk are doing both so

00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:16,069
what are they using to do all this stuff

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,659
amongst the desktop developers 26% of

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:19,640
devs say that they write native desktop

00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:22,760
apps and we have a bit of a puzzle here

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,010
because most of what we think of as

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,409
being desktop application development in

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,270
JavaScript happens an electron but only

00:17:27,409 --> 00:17:31,820
21% of people say that they use

00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:33,710
electrons so there's 5% who are writing

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,380
native desktop apps but not using

00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,940
electron

00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,110
I don't know what they're using if you

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:43,020
know what they're using please tell me

00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:44,910
on the native mobile app side I measured

00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,440
the popularity of frameworks for native

00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,000
mobile apps I'm gonna explain how I

00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,370
measured this in a second but for the

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,350
moment just believe me that green line

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,330
is all native native mobile app

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,130
development as you can see it's staying

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,230
pretty much constant but what's happened

00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,700
is it's fragmented Cordova used to be

00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:03,809
the only game in town that's the yellow

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,400
line but it is its shares going down in

00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:08,490
favor of the red line which is react

00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:13,380
native now they're both equal at about

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:14,730
19 percent of JavaScript developers but

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,169
if you're using some other framework to

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,720
do native mobile app development please

00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:20,909
tell me about it the final where

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,970
question is about server side apps where

00:18:20,909 --> 00:18:25,020
are we deploying them so 77% of us are

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,030
writing server side apps and

00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,370
unsurprisingly docker and other

00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,470
container applications like kubernetes

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:34,860
are everybody's jam everybody is

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:37,230
deploying that way these days but

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,760
deployment platforms like Heroku and

00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:42,630
Neto Phi and stuff like that are

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,549
surprisingly popular and VMs are a

00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,020
surprisingly unpopular choice I don't

00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:47,309
know if I'm just old school but I sort

00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,110
of think of VMs as being like the

00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:51,840
default way that you deploy software but

00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:53,760
if they're not anymore but the real

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,700
surprise in this number in these numbers

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,650
was service server lists has left out of

00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,110
the sort of early adopter category and

00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:05,490
at 33% this is a mainstream technology

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:08,460
now so now let's talk about what we're

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,230
using to do all of this as with the who

00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,679
in the where sections this I'm going to

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:15,659
try and keep as factual as possible to

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,640
measure this stuff I use a metric called

00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:19,080
share of registry it's a very useful

00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,610
metric but it's also a somewhat

00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,010
confusing metric it was the one that I

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:27,390
was just using so I'm going to explain

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:29,370
it briefly this is a graph of weekly

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:31,620
downloads from the NPM registry at the

00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:34,350
moment we do a little under 12 billion

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:37,350
downloads every seven days and that

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:40,080
number has grown by 26 thousand percent

00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:42,840
since NPM became a company and that

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,490
presents something of a problem first it

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,169
presents something of a scaling problem

00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,669
but it also presents something of a

00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:48,250
problem if you're trying to measure the

00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:50,800
popular

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,830
of stuff because download numbers always

00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,980
go up download numbers go up for

00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,510
everything here's a graph of downloads

00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,820
of some major front-end frameworks

00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:03,250
they're all growing pretty fast in fact

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,810
everything in the registry is constantly

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,460
growing in terms of download numbers

00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:08,020
even the shittiest package in the

00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,060
registry is getting more and more

00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,770
downloads every week just because more

00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,300
and more people show up every week and

00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:16,530
are like I don't know I'll download evil

00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,530
package 1 this seems fine

00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,760
so using absolute growth of downloads is

00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,410
not a good way of measuring popularity

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,540
since Ted we're using relative

00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:27,520
popularity as a percentage of all

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:30,520
downloads and that's what we call share

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,830
of registry so here are all the same

00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,690
packages again using share of registry

00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,610
as the metric instead and suddenly

00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,230
what's going on is much clearer some

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:40,240
stuff is going up some stuff is staying

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:42,370
flat and some stuff is going down but

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,300
it's important to remember that going

00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,680
down is only in relative terms so it

00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,110
just means that you're not growing as

00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,050
fast as everything else if you stay flat

00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,910
on this graph that means that you grew

00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:57,850
26,000 percent if you're going up on

00:20:54,910 --> 00:21:00,220
this graph you grew faster than 26,000

00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:02,040
percent so if you're going up at all on

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,820
this graph then you are really growing

00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:08,350
so let's dig into these actual numbers

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:11,590
the story of front-end frameworks in

00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:15,520
2019 is very simple and it is that react

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:17,260
has conquered the web react has more

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,270
than four times as many downloads as the

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,830
next most popular framework and there

00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:23,890
has never been anything like this

00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:25,830
popular in front-end frameworks part of

00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,120
the reason for that is because react

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:30,010
isn't just a front-end framework in fact

00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,450
it's not even a front-end framework it's

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:33,520
just a component model and that

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:35,890
component model is used by web apps but

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,200
as we saw with the native apps it's also

00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,670
used in react native for mobile and it's

00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,670
used in electron for desktop

00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:44,620
applications but all this is just the

00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,050
Downloads data what about the survey

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:50,380
where we asked actual people in our

00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:52,960
survey 63% of JavaScript developers say

00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,670
that they use react but using is a vague

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,380
term but what you know do you just use

00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:59,050
it sometimes are using it you know just

00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:01,570
to try stuff out so we asked a more

00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,870
specific question 57% of people say that

00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,180
they

00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,100
right reacts themselves 6% say they use

00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,280
react written by other people but more

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,440
interestingly 15% of people say that

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,720
they don't use react but are considering

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,520
it which means that they're even at 63

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,620
percent which is already an absurd

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,250
amount of adoption there still might be

00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:23,290
room for react to continue to grow but

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,940
as you saw in that graph react growth

00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,980
kind of seems like it might be slowing

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,890
down so it's not clear what's going to

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,720
happen next to the react to dig even

00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,230
further we asked people how much they

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,960
write react inside the fifteen fifty

00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,800
seven percent of people who write react

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,230
forty-nine percent said that they

00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,179
primarily write react which means 26

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,070
percent of all NPM users are primarily

00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:47,020
writing react a quarter of the of

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,970
JavaScript developers are primarily

00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,380
writing react and if you include the

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,559
people who write at some of the time

00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:55,990
that means 47 percent nearly half of

00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:59,080
JavaScript developers are writing react

00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:01,179
some or most of the time there has never

00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,730
been a framework with that kind of

00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:06,179
adoption it is changing the way web

00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:08,950
development works

00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:10,390
moving on to some other frameworks last

00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:12,340
year I got into some trouble because I

00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:14,140
took angular version 1 and angular

00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,970
version 2 onwards and I called them both

00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:17,470
angular and I put them together and I

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,450
didn't separate them out and I was

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,900
strenuously informed that that was

00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:25,690
incorrect angular version 1 is now

00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,490
called angularjs angular version 2

00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:29,020
onwards is a completely different

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,670
framework that has nothing to do with

00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:33,790
the first version and it's called

00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:36,400
angular I think but that is a little bit

00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:38,200
confusing I feel like I was justified

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,000
and not knowing that there that there's

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,190
two things called angular and they're

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,650
not the same anyway

00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:48,250
as you can see angularjs has been in

00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:51,490
decline since 2016 and angular 2 plus

00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:53,470
has been in decline since 2017 but again

00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:56,679
it's important to keep in mind this is

00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:59,290
only in relative terms in absolute terms

00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,690
both of these frameworks have more users

00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:03,490
than they've ever had before in absolute

00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,530
terms both of these frameworks are still

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,860
growing they're just not growing as fast

00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:10,030
as everything else in the registry

00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,850
angular remains an extremely popular

00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:14,970
framework 37% of NPM users are using one

00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:17,190
or the other version of angular

00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:19,049
and 29% of NPM users say that they are

00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,940
using the current version if you

00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:23,220
extrapolate out that means there's

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:26,190
probably about 3 million people who do

00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,809
angular which is definitely nothing to

00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:31,919
sneeze at and probably means that it's

00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:33,570
not going to go anywhere so let's look

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,059
at the next two most obvious framework

00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:38,849
which is view view is the only major

00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:40,830
framework other than react which is

00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:43,289
strong showing strong positive growth

00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:45,330
and it is very very positive share of

00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:47,309
registry for view has more than doubled

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:49,460
in the last two years which means that

00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:53,070
downloads grew more than a factor of 10

00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:55,649
and our survey data backs this up 27% of

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:58,320
NPM users say that they are using view

00:24:55,649 --> 00:25:00,090
which is up from 24% last year which

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,220
means that roughly the same number of

00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:05,940
people who are using view as are using

00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:07,409
the current version of angular one thing

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,599
that I haven't talked about so far is

00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:11,369
web components and part of that is that

00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,320
web components are built into browsers

00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:14,729
so there isn't a share of registry

00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,399
they're not downloading anything from

00:25:14,729 --> 00:25:18,570
NPM to use web components but the other

00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:21,869
reason is that they just don't seem to

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:24,090
be very popular we didn't ask about them

00:25:21,869 --> 00:25:27,090
an NPM survey which was a mistake on my

00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,799
part the state of j/s survey allowed

00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,019
people to volunteer if they were using

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,659
web components but less than one percent

00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,549
of web developers did so I'm not

00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:38,970
ignoring web components but my data on

00:25:35,549 --> 00:25:40,739
them is not very good at the moment the

00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,029
people who build web components like the

00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,259
people who work for browsers and build

00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:44,700
web components they tell me that web

00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:46,470
components are much more popular than I

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:50,729
believe but of course they would say

00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:52,590
that moving from the front end to the

00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:56,340
back end there has been a real

00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:57,690
revolution previously if I was talking

00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,690
about the back end I'd have talked about

00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,919
frameworks like happy or ember and those

00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,049
things are still around and they are

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,269
showing basically flat growth in the

00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:08,159
registry which is to say 25000 percent

00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:09,629
growth you know healthy but not

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,749
spectacular by the standards of the

00:26:09,629 --> 00:26:15,080
registry but now everybody has moved to

00:26:12,749 --> 00:26:17,669
writing rich front-end apps those

00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:19,559
frameworks which are about providing

00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:21,119
static views they're just not as popular

00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:23,999
they're just not as much of a fit for

00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:26,399
what we're doing instead what's happened

00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:28,080
is that front-end framework enthusiasts

00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:29,190
have realized that for performance

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,460
reasons they need to deliver

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:34,049
pre-rendered HTML from the server and so

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,269
they called it server-side rendering or

00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:38,700
SSR and they invented a bunch of stuff

00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:42,779
to do that which is to say they invented

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,100
backends so now all of the bet all of

00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:47,220
the front-end frameworks are also

00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,750
back-end frameworks they provide

00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,100
collections of servers and routers that

00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,890
make it easy to build a full server

00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:54,750
using your favorite framework I don't

00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,190
know about you but the idea that I can

00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,750
just write a bunch of components and

00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,279
throw them into exists an existing

00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,510
framework that does all of the serving

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,419
and parsing and stuff for me that's

00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:07,309
great but it's also super familiar I'm

00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:09,600
pretty sure that is how PHP works

00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:11,850
someday soon somebody is gonna like you

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,769
know do this huge flashy launch with an

00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,690
amazing website and be like you can you

00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:17,850
can build a website by just ft peeing

00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:20,309
your react components to a server and

00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:24,870
then the circle will be completes and we

00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:26,429
will have finished reinventing PHP so

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:27,000
before I talk about these new SSR

00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:28,679
frameworks

00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,809
it's important to note that they are all

00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,860
still pretty small here for comparison

00:27:30,809 --> 00:27:37,380
is Express Express is a goddamn giant of

00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,120
a package it used to be 1.5% of registry

00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:40,500
downloads all by itself and while the

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,600
rest of the registry has sort of grown

00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,309
up around it it is still very very big

00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,110
all of the other frameworks that I'm

00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:48,889
about to talk about they are that little

00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:51,090
flat line at the bottom of this graph

00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:52,980
but when you take Express out of the

00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:55,710
picture the new picture is very

00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:58,769
interesting at the top of our list is

00:27:55,710 --> 00:28:00,389
Gatsby Gatsby uses react and it provides

00:27:58,769 --> 00:28:02,010
a whole set of tools for hooking it up

00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:04,320
to backends and providing easy

00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:06,360
deployment methods for it got to be

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,190
snuck up on us in our previous survey we

00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,139
didn't ask about Gatsby at all and this

00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,309
year's survey 8% of people said that

00:28:10,139 --> 00:28:13,950
they are using Gatsby

00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:17,460
for comparison frameworks that we used

00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:19,470
to talk about like happy and and amber

00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:22,380
they're at like 5 percent and 4 percent

00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:24,029
so Gatsby being at 8 percent means that

00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:28,019
it is a real and serious framework that

00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:30,720
is showing real growth and next comes a

00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:32,490
trio of back-end frameworks which all

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,029
have nearly the same name in a way that

00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:39,149
is not confusing or irritating at all

00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:40,909
first up is next Jess it's another react

00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:43,580
based framework

00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:46,100
and our survey respondents love next j/s

00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:49,250
about 9% of them say that they use it

00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,690
the registry downloads data gives gatsby

00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,039
the edge but it's clear that those two

00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,450
things are both very popular and pretty

00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:56,509
close together in terms of the number of

00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:58,669
users then there is Knox

00:28:56,509 --> 00:29:02,029
with au which is very much like next J s

00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:03,679
but it's for view instead 5% of devs in

00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:05,840
our survey say that they use it and it's

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,139
showing similar healthy growth and then

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,179
there's nest jeaious with an S which is

00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:16,340
apparently also very much like next to

00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:17,779
J's but it's for angular our survey

00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:20,200
didn't ask about it because I only found

00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:22,549
out about it quite recently but

00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,950
extrapolating from its download data

00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:28,970
probably about 2% of NPM users are using

00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:30,259
Ness GS so closely related to all that

00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:33,289
these front-end frameworks that are now

00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:34,490
back-end frameworks is graph QL there

00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:36,019
have been a couple of talks about graph

00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,330
QL at this conference it's a pretty fun

00:29:36,019 --> 00:29:40,519
technology it is the hot new way of

00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:43,580
building api's that power all of this

00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:45,740
stuff and as you can see graph QL score

00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,830
library and two of its most popular

00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:50,360
clients are all very very steadily

00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:51,830
climbing and share of registry and this

00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,899
climb is reflected in the survey data

00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,669
the survey data says that 22% of

00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:58,940
JavaScript developers are already using

00:29:55,669 --> 00:30:02,659
graph QL but the really interesting

00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:04,250
number is that half of NPM users 49% say

00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:05,960
they are considering using graph QL

00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:08,769
which means that 2019 is going to be a

00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,970
very big year for that technology and

00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:12,409
the final set of trend data we're going

00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:15,610
to look at is the hottest trend of all

00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:18,110
which is not writing JavaScript anymore

00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,610
remember all of those non primary

00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:21,169
JavaScript writers especially the ones

00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,659
coming from typed languages like Java

00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:26,509
and c-sharp and stuff this is how their

00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:28,580
influence is showing up the biggest part

00:30:26,509 --> 00:30:30,200
of this trend is typescript last year we

00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,820
were caught completely by surprise when

00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,149
we asked people how much if they use

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:38,179
typescript and 46% of them said yes this

00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:40,730
year 63% of them said that they are

00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:43,639
using typescript so we immediately asked

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:47,269
a bunch of a bunch more questions what

00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:49,159
does using mean so it turns out that 15%

00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:51,679
of people who say that they 15% of

00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:53,419
people are using libraries that are

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,590
written in typescript and the main

00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:56,059
culprit here is angular

00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:58,070
angular is written in typescript so all

00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:59,659
the angular users show up as typescript

00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:01,159
users but they're not really writing

00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:04,909
typescript so they're just using a thing

00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,799
that is written in typescript it's

00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:08,450
interesting that both react and ember

00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,179
have type scripts now so the only major

00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:14,299
framework that doesn't have some

00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:15,830
typescript in it is view but even if you

00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:17,330
say that you write typescript do you

00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,730
mean that you write it all the time or

00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:22,130
just to try it out within the typescript

00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:24,740
developers 52% primarily write

00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,870
typescript and another 34% write

00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:29,720
typescript some of the time which means

00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:31,309
that overall 36% of NPM users are

00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,070
writing typescript somewhere all of the

00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:36,770
time a third of javascript developers

00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:38,720
don't write JavaScript anymore that is a

00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:41,750
stunning change in the landscape in

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,919
which we're sitting incidentally one of

00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,260
the features of typescript

00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:46,880
is that it has type definition files and

00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,860
those type definition files are hosted

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,049
under the types of scope which is on NPM

00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,789
so I went looking to see exactly how

00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:54,860
much of registry traffic is the type

00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:56,990
scope and it turns out it's 2.5 percent

00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:59,630
all by itself being constantly

00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,950
downloaded by copies of vs code which

00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,450
means that we're probably going to need

00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:07,010
to have a chat with Microsoft about

00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:08,750
their bandwidth bill the other part of

00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,860
the not writing JavaScript trend is

00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,110
webassembly

00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:15,080
cast just gave a great talk about web

00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:16,610
assembly and gave a whole bunch of good

00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,370
reasons for using web assembly and its

00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:22,220
place in the ecosystem but in case you

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:23,600
somehow were asleep for that web

00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,460
assembly is a technology that lets you

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,840
take any compiled language and run it on

00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,309
the web at near native speeds and

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,289
there's two interesting things about

00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:32,330
that the first is obviously the speed

00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:34,070
but the people who write web assembly

00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:37,070
say that the much more interesting part

00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:38,899
is the second part which is that it

00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:41,149
gives you the ability to use existing

00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:44,270
code written in other languages directly

00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:45,950
on the web to me one of the most

00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,809
exciting features of web assembly is

00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:50,330
that when assembly modules are

00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:52,700
interoperable with existing NPM modules

00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,620
written in JavaScript so you can use a

00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,809
tool like wisent pack which is for rust

00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,450
or equivalent tools for other languages

00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:01,700
and you can write code in those

00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:04,190
languages publish it as a module to the

00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,289
NPM registry and then just npm install

00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:08,390
it into a JavaScript application and it

00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:10,250
will work you won't even know that it's

00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,870
not JavaScript's it'll just happen and

00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,640
the way that I know that you won't know

00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:15,770
it's JavaScript is because it already

00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,910
happened it's is already happening the

00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:21,530
call is coming from inside the house our

00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:23,480
stats say that webassembly is still very

00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:25,700
new only about 3 percent of people say

00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,280
that they use it but you know at the

00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,500
scale of NPM that means that about

00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:33,530
300,000 people are using it and we found

00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:35,480
that just 0.06 percent of packages in

00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:37,340
the registry contain wasm but that is

00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,500
about 600 packages and some of those are

00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:42,080
very interesting but the big number for

00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,820
webassembly is 54% that is how the

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,350
percentage of people who say that they

00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:50,260
are considering using webassembly

00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:53,450
webassembly is about to be very very big

00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:55,940
so now we know who we are and what we're

00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:58,460
using and those facts together can point

00:33:55,940 --> 00:34:01,010
us towards explanations as to why this

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:04,880
is where I switch from facts to analysis

00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:10,840
and by analysis I mean opinions but

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:13,880
first just a quick drink of water

00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:16,310
because I'm going real slow and talking

00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:18,290
a lot so for this next bit I need to

00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:20,390
split up the room into two teams so

00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,730
everybody on this side of the line you

00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:26,600
are team a everybody on this side of the

00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:27,340
line you are team B team a let me hear

00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:35,270
it

00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:36,500
team B team a team B fantastic I'm not

00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,330
going to use that for anything it's just

00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:42,320
to keep you awake after 30 minutes of

00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:44,000
grass the other thing that I said that I

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,130
would do is I would give a pair of NPM

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,659
socks away but I didn't have time to

00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:50,870
come up with any system for giving the

00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:53,419
socks away is Shivani here there you are

00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,950
Shivani had the bright idea of just

00:34:53,419 --> 00:34:58,600
asking me on Twitter if she could get

00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:58,600
the socks so she gets the sauce

00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:06,550
[Applause]

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,579
so the first question to answer in the Y

00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:10,990
section is why is JavaScript the most

00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:13,180
popular programming language in the

00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:14,890
world I think we can discard the idea

00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:18,550
that it is the best designed language in

00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:22,150
the world one possible answer is the NPM

00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:25,000
registry a guy called Leo meyerovich for

00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:27,280
his PhD did a study of in which he

00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,109
researched why people pick programming

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,599
languages this is a very useful study

00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:33,099
for answering this question so he was

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,900
asking you know is it features is its

00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:35,589
speed is it because they're forced to by

00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,270
their company

00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:38,920
like what is it that makes somebody pick

00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:40,720
a programming language and the number

00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,660
one reason turned out to be open source

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:45,670
modules it turns out that if there is a

00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,079
library that exists that helps you get

00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,869
the job that you're trying to get done

00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:52,030
done then you switch to the language in

00:35:49,869 --> 00:35:55,060
which that library exists and because

00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:56,530
the largest set of libraries is NPM that

00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,450
means an enormous number of people are

00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:00,160
moving to JavaScript because of all of

00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:03,730
them libraries that are existing in NPM

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:06,310
and once you start doing that a positive

00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:08,319
feedback loop kicks in more open source

00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:11,349
libraries bring more users and those

00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:13,839
users write more open source once about

00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:16,990
every 15 minutes or so somebody on

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:21,280
Twitter sends me this picture but it's

00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:23,829
not actually a bad analogy the NPM

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,869
registry has created a gravity well that

00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:27,460
pulls in developers and every time a new

00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:31,630
developer joins the JavaScript community

00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:33,400
they increase the pull and this has

00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,680
created the new type of JavaScript

00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,599
developer The Reluctant JavaScript er

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,630
this used to be a very small group but

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,849
is now possibly a quarter or more of the

00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:44,680
JavaScript community is reluctant Java

00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:45,940
Scriptures they don't write Java scripts

00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,040
because they like it they write

00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:50,260
JavaScript because they have to and that

00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,630
is bad that's bad for them because they

00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:54,040
hate it but it's also bad for Java

00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,540
scripts because people who don't like a

00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,440
language are not going to write it well

00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:01,480
and this happened before in 2009 and

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,030
2010 Ruby developers who were writing

00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,680
web apps got sucked into the exploding

00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,760
popularity of Java scripts and they

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,200
 hated it

00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,390
they told us that they hated it at the

00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,069
time in the survey data they've made

00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,960
very clear that they still hate it and

00:37:12,069 --> 00:37:16,979
don't want to be writing JavaScript

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,359
some of them wanted some of them

00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:21,359
attempted to solve this problem with

00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:23,160
CoffeeScript which introduced a ton of

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:26,130
Ruby like features into JavaScript

00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,229
CoffeeScript failed but honestly the

00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,479
Ruby folks mostly one like JavaScript

00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:32,160
these days modern JavaScript has a ton

00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:36,839
of language features that are basically

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:39,329
copied from Ruby and typescript is

00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:40,769
something like that pattern remember all

00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:41,999
of those non primary JavaScript

00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:44,670
developers who are working in typed

00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:46,529
languages like Java and c-sharp a bunch

00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,999
of people from those languages have come

00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:50,369
to the JavaScript community and found

00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:54,329
that they've missed types and typescript

00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:57,420
gives them those types backing so given

00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:58,859
the popularity of types and people using

00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,839
those type languages and also

00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:03,029
Microsoft's considerable backing to

00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:04,410
typescript I don't think the typescript

00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:08,910
is going to be the kind of failure that

00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:11,400
CoffeeScript was in our survey 17% of

00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:13,109
people who had heard of webassembly

00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,089
said that the thing that they found most

00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:16,859
interesting about web assembly was that

00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:18,630
it allowed them to write a language

00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:23,130
other than JavaScript and they preferred

00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:25,289
doing that web assembly freeze web

00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:27,359
developers and it frees web development

00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:29,400
from JavaScript and the result will be

00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,739
that a bunch of people will stop writing

00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,549
JavaScript but that is not something to

00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:35,009
be worried about

00:38:32,549 --> 00:38:39,029
first not everybody will stop just the

00:38:35,009 --> 00:38:41,099
people who hate it and second when

00:38:39,029 --> 00:38:42,960
people writing web assembly are looking

00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:45,029
for a way to share code with each other

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,609
the massive gravity well of the NPM

00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:49,529
registry will make it obvious the best

00:38:47,609 --> 00:38:52,739
place to share your web assembly modules

00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:55,559
is also the NPM registry web assembly

00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:57,630
will make JavaScript stronger by giving

00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:58,920
it access to the best libraries no

00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:03,049
matter what language they were written

00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:05,460
it that is a tremendously exciting idea

00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:07,880
the next question we're spending time on

00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,739
is what the hell is going on with react

00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,779
part of the explanation is that react

00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:14,519
isn't a full web framework it has no

00:39:12,779 --> 00:39:17,130
opinions about routing or data modules

00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:18,779
like other frameworks do so as opinions

00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:22,380
change about the best way to do routing

00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:24,059
and data people don't have to abandon

00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,650
react to be able to do that they can

00:39:24,059 --> 00:39:27,630
just switch from you know flux to

00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:32,730
reduction from Redux to whatever

00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:35,940
next it's just a component model and it

00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:38,010
creates truly reusable fully functioning

00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,480
components if you've never seen quite

00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:42,330
how well that can work here are two

00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,910
examples of react components that you

00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:47,010
can just npm install today two of the

00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:49,260
most annoying and fiddly components a

00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:52,320
color picker and a date picker and you

00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:54,600
can just npm install them that my

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,370
friends has been the dream for 20 years

00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,560
I don't want to have to implement a date

00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:02,940
picker ever again and now I don't have

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,350
to other projects provide whole

00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,590
libraries of excellent pre-built

00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:09,360
components to use react toolbox does one

00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:11,010
using Google's material design although

00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,590
it's not like an official Google project

00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,700
or anything and reach UI is an excellent

00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:17,070
start on addressing accessibility

00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,690
concerns and react by providing a

00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:21,660
library of fully accessible react

00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:24,600
components but now react can go even

00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:27,330
further as you've already heard of this

00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,430
conference react 16.8 introduced hooks

00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:31,230
hooks are a new way of handling state in

00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:33,210
react but from my perspective the most

00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,800
interesting thing about hooks is that it

00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:37,110
is very easy to add a whole bunch of

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:42,330
functionality to your application using

00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:44,490
hooks by just npm installing them an

00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:46,080
early promising demonstration of this is

00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:48,030
react use which is a library that

00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,890
provides a ton of functionality for the

00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:53,010
like you know more dark and dangerous

00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:54,930
corners of the Web API in your react app

00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:56,550
by just npm installing the functionality

00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,430
that you want to use with way less

00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:01,140
effort on your part and this suggests an

00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:03,540
enticing future where we can build web

00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:06,090
apps at a whole new level of abstraction

00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,710
all of these things together mean that

00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:09,900
we won't have to think too hard about

00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:13,500
what the server is or how it works or

00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,030
even where it is and we can put existing

00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,500
components together instead of having to

00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:19,590
build them from scratch every time we

00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,180
start a new project and each new

00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:22,860
component added to the pile of

00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:25,200
components inside of the NPM registry

00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:27,900
will make it more attractive to use

00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,160
those components again the same feedback

00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,010
loop that created the NPM registry

00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,740
itself could make react and react

00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:39,060
components an unstoppable force that

00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:39,840
changes web development forever but it's

00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,430
not guaranteed

00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,020
reiax growth seems to be

00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,480
slowing down and view is showing a lot

00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:47,250
of growth so is view the future will

00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,430
react to decline and fall like every

00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:53,520
framework ever before in the next couple

00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:54,240
of years we get to find out in the

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,609
meantime

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,160
reacts dominance on the front end has

00:41:56,609 --> 00:42:01,349
totally changed the back end as I showed

00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,480
earlier frameworks that enable

00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:04,980
server-side rendering of react apps are

00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:08,760
now more popular than traditional

00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:11,190
back-end frameworks so instead of

00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:12,780
writing code for clients and servers we

00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:15,390
just write code for clients and we get

00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:17,309
the server to figure it out we

00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:20,579
increasingly abstract away how code is

00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:22,890
deployed and just give it away entirely

00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:28,680
to serverless things or deployment

00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:30,450
services building all apps is rich

00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,619
front-end apps I'm not sure that that is

00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:33,359
a good idea I'm not sure that that's

00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:35,339
always the best kind of app that we can

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,010
build but it certainly is a popular idea

00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:40,829
and as I've been pointing out popularity

00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:43,079
has its own momentum at least one

00:42:40,829 --> 00:42:45,210
browser maker is already working on

00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:49,859
specific optimizations to the browser to

00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:51,450
make react faster and last year I made

00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:52,740
the case that react components or at

00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:54,569
least some of the core parts of them

00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:56,579
should become part of the browser so

00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:58,640
that we can make our frameworks smaller

00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:00,690
and we can make our frameworks faster

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,150
because we did that before we did that

00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:05,040
with jQuery a lot of the api's that we

00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:06,630
that were in jQuery are now just part of

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,790
the web api we think of ourselves as

00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:10,440
having stopped using jQuery but we still

00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:13,589
use jQuery every day we just don't need

00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:15,450
to download a library to do it so I

00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:17,910
stand by that I think some parts of

00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:19,440
react are so good and so popular that at

00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:22,770
this point they should probably be part

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,359
of the web so let's take all of these

00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,559
trends and analysis and opinions and

00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:27,270
weave them all together and make some

00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:29,250
guesses about the future this is where I

00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:33,839
go from slightly wrong to extremely

00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:35,970
wrong first is a future I don't have to

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,740
guess about and that is NPM tink NPM

00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,720
tink is a tremendously exciting leap

00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,720
forward in package management it's a

00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:44,460
package manager and a runtime and you

00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,990
won't have to install packages anymore

00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,130
you won't have to transpile type scripts

00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,770
you won't have to think about whether

00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:52,650
assembly you can just import stuff and

00:43:49,770 --> 00:43:54,560
tink will figure it out so let's watch

00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:56,770
that happen

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,060
will it have downloaded the whole video

00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:00,770
what you're seeing is two modules in

00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:03,290
this folder one is JavaScript and one is

00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:06,140
wasum the main file is typescript index

00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:08,540
TS we import that as 'm straight into

00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:11,180
the typescript and then we use tink SH

00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,620
to run that typescript we don't have to

00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:14,300
do any transpiling we don't have to do

00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:17,590
any loading there is no other code in

00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:20,000
this folder tink just figures it out

00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:22,490
that's amazing we don't have to do any

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,150
of that stuff anymore the ergonomics of

00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:28,220
that are wonderful dan I dream of

00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:30,080
tweeted recently about how vb6 is what

00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:31,490
got him into programming and it's a

00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,140
really great point because it's exactly

00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:36,320
where it seems like all of this stuff is

00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:39,020
going imagine a world where you can

00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,490
build a web app without needing to know

00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:44,060
all the details of how all of your

00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:46,190
components work people hate on vb6

00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:48,230
but at one point it was the world's most

00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:51,500
programming popular programming language

00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:53,510
and that's us now vb6 unlocked and

00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,430
created a generation of programmers by

00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:57,620
making programming very easy and

00:44:55,430 --> 00:45:01,730
accessible for everyone that made it

00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:03,530
very good and very popular think how

00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:05,720
many more people could get to be web

00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:07,880
developers if you could build a real and

00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:10,850
useful web app by dragging and dropping

00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,740
open-source components into it that

00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:14,150
wouldn't make your job obsolete we would

00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:15,950
still need everyone in this room to be

00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:18,650
writing components but we would need a

00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:20,090
room ten times this size to hold all of

00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:22,880
the people who would be using the

00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:24,890
components that we write it would be a

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,170
whole new level of abstraction it would

00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:29,270
create a whole new type of web developer

00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:31,820
and it would unlock a whole new sequence

00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:34,070
and a whole new class of web apps that

00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:37,640
currently it's too expensive for anyone

00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:40,760
to build that is a tremendously exciting

00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:43,280
idea and then you add to that mix web

00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:45,470
assembly which it's still very early

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,630
days right now but you could bring every

00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:49,700
useful library from every other language

00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:51,830
and put them into the JavaScript

00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,400
universe and make all of those libraries

00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:56,930
interoperable with no performance hit

00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,940
suddenly not only is it easier to build

00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:01,840
these apps in JavaScript but what you

00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:04,790
can build would be greatly expanded and

00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:06,500
the last piece of the puzzle is all of

00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:08,150
those native app developers that's

00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,730
already nearly half of

00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:13,339
take highly performant rich web apps and

00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:15,829
then run them anywhere that you like on

00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:19,569
desktops on phones on tablets on watches

00:46:15,829 --> 00:46:22,400
on VR VR headsets on your shoes

00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:24,140
JavaScript running everywhere absorbing

00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,059
all of the other languages into a single

00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:28,369
unified world of open-source components

00:46:26,059 --> 00:46:30,700
built by an ever expanding and

00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:32,809
increasingly diverse set of developers

00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:35,809
there is no guarantee that that will

00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:37,490
happen but I can imagine a world where

00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:39,619
the thing that we currently call web

00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:42,440
development just becomes the way that we

00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:44,269
build software and after 23 years of

00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,150
watching web development change and grow

00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:49,700
no time has ever been more exciting to

00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:51,950
be a web developer and you my friends

00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:57,109
and colleagues are perfectly placed to

00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:59,960
become part of that change the web is an

00:46:57,109 --> 00:47:02,750
amazing force for good and evil it is a

00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,789
toy and the tool it's a playground and

00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:07,490
it's a marketplace it is alternately

00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:09,710
amazing and terrifying and its power we

00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:11,750
can do so much good and we can do so

00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:13,759
much harm but I choose to believe that

00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:16,130
in the long run we will collectively

00:47:13,759 --> 00:47:18,559
decide to do more things that help the

00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:20,420
world than hurt it we have all made

00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:23,779
mistakes that have hurt people I know

00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:26,089
that I have but I believe that in the

00:47:23,779 --> 00:47:28,730
course of time our good decisions will

00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:31,490
outweigh our bad decisions and the web

00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:33,529
will grow forever I hope what I've

00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:35,299
shared with you today has helped you see

00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:37,279
where you are and what you can do I hope

00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:39,529
that's helped motivate you and make you

00:47:37,279 --> 00:47:40,579
curious I hope you've had a fantastic

00:47:39,529 --> 00:47:42,829
jeaious cough

00:47:40,579 --> 00:47:45,849
I certainly have and thank you all so

00:47:42,829 --> 00:47:45,849
