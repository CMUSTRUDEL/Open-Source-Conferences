Description: 
	Have you ever noticed the recent trend where no one uses ES5 anymore? AOT compilers became a trivial thing nowadays; everyone uses it but very few really understand how they work. With the knowledge that I'm gonna give you in my talk, a new exciting world of possibilities will open up for you; you will understand how popular compilers such as TypeScript and Babel work behind the scenes and you be able to build cool Babel plugins. With this knowledge you will be able to not only implement things which aren't possible to do during runtime, such as ng-anotate, but you will also be able to save some precious processing power and make your apps more efficient.

Eytan is a JavaScript artist who codes for fun. Originally comes from the land of the Promise(), but has been traveling the world to discover its deepest secrets. Despite NPM goodies being his favorite treat, he consumes vanilla JavaScript the most, because less is more. His hobbies are eating, sleeping; and open-source... He loves open-source.
