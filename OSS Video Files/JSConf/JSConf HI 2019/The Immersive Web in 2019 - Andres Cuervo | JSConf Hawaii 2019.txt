oh yeah this is my talk the immersive

00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:15,400
web in 2019 and there's a lot to the

00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,570
and also 20 and a team just started so

00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,849
it's gonna be a weird talk so the meat

00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:25,779
of this talk is actually going to be pre

00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:28,660
2019 and how we got here and I want to

00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:30,039
talk a little bit about so before I talk

00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:34,059
about the immersive web I want to talk

00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:38,699
about just the web in general so if we

00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:40,570
go very far back the web sort of started

00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:44,230
everything I'm going to talk about today

00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:46,420
is gonna involve the 3d web in the

00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:48,550
immersive web but if we think about the

00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:52,270
web as it started it was basically just

00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:56,140
built for text documents and then we got

00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,850
CSS level 1 and all of a sudden we could

00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:02,010
do fancy things like style or buttons

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:05,050
and make make you know navigation bars

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,360
and that was fun and as things have

00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,460
gotten progressively progressively more

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,009
advanced with high fidelity we've

00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,380
started to do really let's say

00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:17,979
questionable things like adding parallax

00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,720
to every single page and creating you

00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:21,490
know hiring somebody hiring an animator

00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,210
to create a flash intro for your page

00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:27,700
right like the web has always has been

00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,619
progressively sort of adding more and

00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,100
more visual fidelity as the years of

00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:34,630
Warner have worn on and if you've ever

00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,450
wanted to sort of completely break out

00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,640
of the 3d context you would need to go

00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,689
through WebGL and if you're not familiar

00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,670
with WebGL

00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:45,460
it's basically an API that operates

00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,350
through the canvas API and it sort of

00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,149
gives you a graphics context it's a

00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,030
little square or a rectangle or whatever

00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:54,579
shape you want it to be and it says okay

00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,579
you control all the pixels here and you

00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:59,229
would you most people don't program in

00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:01,630
WebGL directly they use a helper library

00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:04,119
so this is a gif of a few examples from

00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,950
a three Jas which I'll be talking a

00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,369
little bit more about for the rest of

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:12,459
this talk but yeah so if you've ever

00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:15,100
wanted to sort of get into 3d on the web

00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:17,440
it's always been very manual and you

00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,030
even with these helper libraries it sort

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,470
of feels like you're playing in a

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:22,180
different environment

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:26,710
it doesn't feel sort of native to the

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:29,530
web and that all started to change

00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:32,890
would say when Google cardboard was

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,570
first announced back in 2014 so this is

00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:38,620
the first time that WebGL had been

00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,760
hooked up to a to sort of a device so if

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,160
you have never if you've never

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,550
experienced sorry to a device that had a

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,280
gyroscope so if you've never experienced

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:51,250
Google cardboard um you would put your

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,260
you put your smartphone into landscape

00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,180
mode and it would sort of display one

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,010
screen to one your left eye and one

00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,660
other screen to your right eye and you

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:02,140
would put it inside this little like ten

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,780
eight dollar cardboard box with two

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,850
special lenses inside which are really

00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:12,250
just like shiny pieces of convex glass

00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:14,290
and you are concave glass and you would

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,900
all of a sudden move your head and be

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,400
able to see into whatever the whatever

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,280
the sort of the WebGL display was

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,680
showing you and this is really cool

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,650
because even though it wasn't sort of

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,200
like quote-unquote true VR you were you

00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,670
were able to take a web page or people

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,500
you were also able to do this through

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,850
apps but a lot of web pages were

00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,320
designed for this because it was a

00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:40,030
really novel use of the gyroscope api

00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,150
which up to this point like hadn't

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,710
really been used in web pages and it was

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,540
sort of the beginning where people were

00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,120
talking about okay actually now like

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:52,990
mobile devices or computer desktops can

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,350
actually be used for for VR specifically

00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:58,120
and VR is this this idea where you do

00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,970
you do basically this right it's like

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,910
putting on a blindfold and as we're

00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:08,620
gonna see VR is not the only sort of

00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:13,450
like way to like change your reality but

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:15,370
if we even while so back in 2014 is sort

00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,020
of when things were like I guess

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:20,170
starting to heat up for the second time

00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,580
for they are so if you wanted to the

00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,740
Google cardboard experience was really

00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:27,100
nice but all you could do was three

00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,660
degrees of freedom rotational tracking

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,220
and what that means basically is all you

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:35,470
could do is look left and in turn or

00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,900
return your head around this way

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,639
if you moved your head in at all you the

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,650
the camera the view that you were seeing

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,750
wouldn't move with you you would need a

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,360
rig like this with an HTC vive or an

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:50,300
oculus rift tied to like a very you know

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,460
like three thousand dollar computer with

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,990
a very special graphics card in order to

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,849
interpret you know all the positional

00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:58,490
movements all the hand movements and

00:04:55,849 --> 00:05:01,400
order sort of keep keep up to date the

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,949
graphics drivers that this sort of like

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,860
really intensive VR system was running

00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:11,569
and so this is still really nation days

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:14,690
for web VR but this was basically the

00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:16,639
impetus for it it was that okay cool the

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,240
web can do you know sort of like toys

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,099
stuff with moving a gyroscope using your

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,039
smartphone but we want the web to sort

00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:26,840
of as a platform be able to handle be

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,240
able to handle a sort of full scale true

00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,259
VR and be able to expand even beyond

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,430
that so there are a bunch of ways to

00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:36,620
sort of get started with the web via our

00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,750
API you can go through it directly you

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,659
can use three J s or you can use just

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:43,340
raw WebGL if you would like but I've

00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:46,099
personally always used this library

00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,680
called a frame and so this isn't gonna

00:05:46,099 --> 00:05:50,000
be a this talk isn't about a frame but

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,060
this is just a quick little demo that

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,819
sort of lets you see how accessible web

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,250
VR has gotten over the past few years so

00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:01,250
I don't know if you can read this super

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:03,229
well but this little this little tag

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,810
here says a dash spear and it's

00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:09,919
basically a custom web component that

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:11,840
the a frame library defines and you said

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,580
you can do stuff like a dash sphere and

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,560
you give it an attribute called a

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,779
position and it moves it in Xyz

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,469
coordinate space and you can even assign

00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:24,620
it a color which changes it's sort of 3d

00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:26,210
property 3d material property and you

00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,860
can do this for a bunch of different

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,139
assets and you can as long as you put

00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,449
them all in between these tags a scene

00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:35,740
you get something that looks like this

00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:38,260
so that mark up the

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,360
that you know eight seven or eight lines

00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:42,430
that on the previous slide turned into

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,870
this and it's fully interactive so this

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,690
is an example of what it looks like on a

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:48,760
desktop you can sort of drag around and

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,680
move using your arrow keys but if you

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,690
had a computer that was hooked up to a

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,720
VR headset you'd be able to press a

00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:58,510
button and it would automatically jump

00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,780
into the context if you were using a VR

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:05,010
browser of your compatible browser like

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:07,330
experimental builds of Chrome or Firefox

00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:09,340
you'd be able to press the button and it

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,080
would sort of all of a sudden be able to

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,810
interpret your controller movements and

00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:17,050
your head movements and sort of do true

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:18,850
VR and on top of this you can it also

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,740
you can also see from here it like

00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:23,170
degrades really gracefully to the

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,850
desktop if you were on a phone and you

00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:27,610
had a Google cardboard with you you

00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,660
could do Google cardboard mode but even

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,800
if you don't have the cardboard with you

00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,330
you could also just use your normal

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,040
gyroscope and sort of wave your phone

00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,230
around and it's it's basically it's like

00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,370
a really weird experience for sure like

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,500
I'm not gonna say that it's like the

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:41,620
most optimal thing but it's really cool

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,270
that sort of you have a way to reach

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,010
everyone even if they don't have access

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:51,910
to a very expensive very nice piece of

00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:54,790
VR equipment so yeah so that's sort of

00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:57,480
that that work with web VR has been

00:07:54,790 --> 00:08:00,310
progressing for the last few years and

00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,080
but people were sort of hesitant browser

00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:03,520
browser implementers were sort of

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,460
hesitant to implement the web via our

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,250
spec as it was defined because people

00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,020
had been focusing on VR specifically and

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,090
everything was sort of tied to that use

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,610
case it assumed that there was no camera

00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:18,580
input assumed that it seemed a bunch of

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,790
different things about position and so

00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,790
there there's a few problems with this

00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:27,490
one is that sort of mobile AR is now a

00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,780
thing that people know about and I'm

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,410
basically going to give all the credit

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:33,880
for this to Pokemon go because even

00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:37,720
though this wasn't the highest fidelity

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:39,970
a are people still sort of got a taste

00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:42,310
of what it meant to go to you know go

00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,930
outside of in your living room is one

00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:44,700
Pokemon on the beach is a different

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:46,290
Pokemon

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,200
and sort of there's that you know

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,600
macro-level location-based changing but

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,800
also you could see the camera input over

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,180
the game input and that was that was so

00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,190
even though there was nothing it wasn't

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,980
really used to great effect it sort of

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,830
gave people an idea that games could be

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:07,560
played spatially spatially and

00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,300
immersively using just devices that they

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,360
already have which is their smartphones

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:15,420
and then on top of this using devices

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,280
that not everyone has the hololens was

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:22,350
officially released for its first dev

00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:24,030
kit in march 2016 and the magic leap was

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,750
officially released just August of last

00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:28,710
year for its first dev kit as well and

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,710
both of these are really important

00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:33,420
because they're they're a are headsets

00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,670
so in the same way that the true VR

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:39,360
headsets we're sort of the test of

00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:41,900
whether or not we could do whether or

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:46,410
not we can do sort of the immersive web

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:49,890
for for VR these AR headsets

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:53,520
now give us a chance to see things like

00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:56,520
a frame or 3GS or just raw WebGL running

00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,290
in a completely transparent way over the

00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:01,590
real world so things are just overlaid

00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:03,690
and you can sort of see it's not like

00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,990
putting on you know the Google cardboard

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:09,120
blinders you can actually stay in the

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,950
context of your living room or you know

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,990
go out into the real world and sort of

00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:17,700
interact with it naturally but so that's

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,610
cool like it's cool that sort of we have

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,340
progressed beyond VR and that this is

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,770
sort of becoming feasible but as this

00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:29,510
post called progressive WebEx or which

00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:32,550
is on the mozilla VR blog points out

00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:34,050
this is a lot of things there's a lot of

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,270
there's a lot of new considerations here

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,370
so the post so the post is called

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:40,650
progressive web excite which is sort of

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,180
like tagging sort of leading on in the

00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,180
tradition of progressive enhancement

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:47,040
so whereas progressive enhancement you

00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,600
know a upgrades or web pages

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,030
capabilities depending on what device

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,310
you're on this sort of changes the way

00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:56,090
that the web page is displayed based on

00:10:53,310 --> 00:11:00,140
what sort of immersive

00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:02,510
our capability you can have so XR is

00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:06,290
basically just like a like meta acronym

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:09,560
for AR and VR together and in its its

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:11,780
web XR because this is all we're focused

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,520
to just on websites but instead of just

00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:15,620
having a desktop or just having a mobile

00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,330
version now you can have a mobile AR

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:19,430
version or you can have a mobile VR

00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:21,320
version or a true VR version or

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,600
eventually write like an AR headset

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,910
version and so there's a lot to keep

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,990
straight here and I think it's it's good

00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,690
it's good that we're beginning to

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:32,300
develop methodologies around how to sort

00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:35,050
of how to how to work around all of

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,630
these all of these sort of constraints

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:41,390
and out of this the web via our API

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,790
itself has been renamed to the WebEx our

00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:46,100
device API and the working group that is

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,470
working on it in the w3c is now the

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,320
immersive web working group and they're

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:54,110
actually that's the they used to be the

00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,190
immersive web interest group and the

00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,600
difference between an interest and a

00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:58,400
working group is that now their actual

00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,780
charge is to publish a spec so that's

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:06,890
really exciting

00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:08,210
and yeah so the the so that that's sort

00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:11,510
of basically how we got to where we are

00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:12,710
now right like we have that that it's

00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,360
kind of unsatisfying right it's

00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,010
basically I've said like there's a bunch

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,580
of problems and we're trying to solve

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,930
them but I think there's still some good

00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,620
solutions that we've like come up with

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:26,480
so a frame is still really viable Google

00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:28,190
has used it Google and Mozilla both have

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,590
used it for a bunch of different sort of

00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:33,140
production projects you can do fancy

00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:35,870
stuff like Network it you can recreate

00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:37,730
you know drawing applications it's

00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,160
really useful and really easy it's

00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:43,610
designed for web designers and people

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,410
who sort of only know 2d JavaScript to

00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,570
sort of get their feet wet with VR and

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,210
with WebGL so it's still really

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:51,680
accessible way which is and it's good to

00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,110
see that there's so much support around

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,380
a VR a sort of immersive web library

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,600
like this Facebook has also gotten into

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,670
the game it used to be called react VR

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,940
but now it's just react 360 and it's

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:08,630
basically just a it's basically an API

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,490
that allows react to sort of handle and

00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,550
gracefully

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:16,720
display 3d there sorry three yeah 3d and

00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:18,190
360 video and photos so it's cool to see

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,010
that people are sort of building around

00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,090
this technology and finally I think one

00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,350
of the things that's most personally

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,820
exciting to me is that there's this

00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:27,970
company called eighth wall that actually

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,750
just like launched their first thing for

00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:33,450
the the spider-man release last year

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:36,940
their whole thing is like a web AR

00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:38,170
marketing well ideally more applications

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,620
than marketing but marketing is a pretty

00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:43,570
obvious one right now but yeah they so

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,700
this is there isn't you there's no one

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:49,420
there's no AR kit or a our core here

00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:51,760
there's no sort of like on device API

00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,300
being used it's all this is completely

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:57,550
running in Safari in the browser in a

00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,490
normal standard browser so it's just

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,900
really cool to see that companies in you

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,460
know at the end of 2018 and sort of

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,180
going into 2019 are actually beginning

00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:10,150
to invest in VR and they are

00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:12,130
professionally and then there is some

00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,200
also some exciting stuff sort of

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:17,440
happening already in 2019 around the

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,890
immersive web so the very first thing is

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,760
that just two days ago on February 5th

00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:27,610
on Tuesday the first public draft

00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:30,490
working draft of the WebEx our spec was

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,190
published and so what this means is that

00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:36,700
basically now we're like on a track to

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:39,550
actually publishing a an actual web X

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,930
our spec which means it'll go to you

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,530
know the Safari that you know and love

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:47,140
and Firefox and Chrome and every other

00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:49,780
browser and Samsung browsers and opera

00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,340
etcetera etcetera right whatever browser

00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,770
decides to implement it they can

00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,270
implement it knowing that the API won't

00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,440
all of a sudden change and you know

00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,210
three months and then they'll have to

00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,940
scrap a bunch of their engineering work

00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:04,150
so it's really exciting to see the API

00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:06,310
sort of reach maturity and along with

00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:08,530
this it also means that like

00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,960
experimental implementations that have

00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:13,090
been built around the draft version of

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,540
the webex our API will hopefully get

00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:18,610
better so there are a couple projects

00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:20,650
one is from Google well there there's

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,040
there under two names but it's this

00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:24,620
they're basically the same thing

00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:28,420
fusing the Safari or the Chrome browser

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:33,199
on Android and iOS devices respectfully

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:36,130
to a 3GS session and so this really

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:39,259
gives you really really two accurate AR

00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:41,060
capabilities with just a smartphone or

00:15:39,259 --> 00:15:44,389
just an iPad as you can see in the gif

00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,430
here and that those cubes are actually

00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:48,470
rendered just using regular WebGL so

00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,329
basically as long as you use this custom

00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,000
browser you're able to sort of prototype

00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:56,470
with what the webex our API could look

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,880
like and Mozilla has a similar effort

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,370
they actually published an iOS app that

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,930
makes this process super easy so you can

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,060
just make a normal web page and as long

00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:08,360
as you visit it in this special little

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:11,990
iOS app or or custom compiled an Android

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:15,500
app you can sort of use regular WebGL or

00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:17,810
3GS and and sort of begin to play around

00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:22,670
with really experimental really sort of

00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:24,529
spatial computing concepts and then yeah

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:28,550
so that's that's that's so basically all

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:31,010
that I have for the immersive web the

00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:33,410
immersive web itself and I'm really

00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:35,500
excited for sort of to see like to have

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:41,870
seen this like years long progression

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:44,630
into 2018 and 2019 but yeah so one last

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:47,180
thing is that I've actually just sort of

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:50,980
started a consulting business and I

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:54,500
don't actually want to have clients and

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,480
so basically I I'm putting this slide

00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,589
here not for asking for work basically

00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,480
if you're interested in the immersive

00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:01,430
web if you want to learn more if you

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,280
want to talk to me this is a good way to

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:07,010
do it and have a bunch of free time now

00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:10,189
so yeah if you can either reach me here

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,720
or at these other various places on the

00:17:10,189 --> 00:17:14,620
internet yeah thank you

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,800
[Applause]

00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,150
you
