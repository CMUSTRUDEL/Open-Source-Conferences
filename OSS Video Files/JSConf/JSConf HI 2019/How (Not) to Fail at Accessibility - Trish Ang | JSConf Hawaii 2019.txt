hi everybody uh how's everybody doing

00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:15,799
pretty good cool cool

00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:18,800
so my name is Trish you can also find me

00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:22,730
at Beach on the internet and my pronouns

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,550
are she her presently I am a front-end

00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:28,160
engineer at slack where I focus on

00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:30,410
working with a team of amazing front-end

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,739
engineers building our internal design

00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,579
system and component lower library

00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:36,410
specifically building out react

00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:39,140
components that comprise a foundational

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:45,139
layer of the slack client you know and

00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:47,600
love so I've been working in the tech

00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:49,850
industry a little bit over 10 years at

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,699
this point and if there is one thing I

00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:57,819
am familiar with its failure but I'm

00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:02,120
here to tell you that that's ok

00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:04,580
everybody fails we fail and then we

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:08,840
learn and then we probably fail again in

00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:11,060
an equally spectacular way for example

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,230
just today at lunch

00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,270
I grabbed my Colby and Fried Chicken and

00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:20,240
went by the pool to sit with Johnathan

00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:22,340
to have food and and I realized but 10

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,210
minutes later my shorts are all wet

00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,890
because I sat in a pool of water which

00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:29,240
then of course like luckily went

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,100
upstairs changed my pants and then I

00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,210
realized oh I was wearing these I wasn't

00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,570
wearing these shorts because I spilled

00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:37,070
food on them yesterday that's ok I will

00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,530
learn my lesson and tomorrow I'll look

00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:43,190
if I sit down before sitting in another

00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:45,320
pool of water oh good I'm sure as

00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,970
front-end engineers yourselves you are

00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,540
all equally familiar with this feeling

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,730
of failure

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,159
everybody knows browser rendering

00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:56,030
inconsistencies often feel like you're

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,070
in the Wild West dealing with web

00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,220
compilers are kind of like a black box

00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,310
of nightmares and then there's the

00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,310
dreaded last step of any project

00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,310
accessibility

00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:14,000
so allow me to share a personal story of

00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,850
failure has anybody here you slacked

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,500
before

00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:23,450
cool cool okay so maybe a little bit

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,580
over a year ago I was getting ready to

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,740
launch my first big feature while

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,270
working at slack and I felt super

00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,770
excited I was gonna share this new tool

00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,930
with everybody here who raised their

00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,060
hands a bunch of my friends a little bit

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:39,140
of my family and it was great great

00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,150
feeling and then I got a message like

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,540
this one

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:47,630
so this reads hatred Congrats on the

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,220
launch by the way are you using options

00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,470
list because I'm not sure if you realize

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,380
but your feature is completely

00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,050
inaccessible that means I can't use it

00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:04,100
with my screen reader so sorry to rain

00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:06,080
on your parade love George oh it was

00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,800
really hard for me not to feel like a

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,840
complete failure at this point

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,360
thankfully at SLAC I'm really proud to

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,519
say that we treat accessibility bugs as

00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,970
broken functionality and product

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:22,459
blockers what and the web accessibility

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,350
bug means is that there's real humans

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:26,060
out there on the internet who cannot

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:29,120
interact with your website or your web

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:32,600
product and for slack where we have over

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,920
10 million users online daily being

00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,760
unable to communicate with your

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,320
teammates interact with content or being

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,030
blocked from your doing doing your work

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:47,320
at all is completely unacceptable

00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:50,060
but accessibility is by no means easy

00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,280
even the queen bee herself had some

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,410
issues with this earlier this year when

00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,070
she was sued over her website Beyonce

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,989
calm being inaccessible

00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:04,040
since then the Internet has come

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:05,769
together to put a petition to hire one

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,250
of my amazing and talented co-workers

00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:13,820
Mina Marcum you may have heard of her to

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,620
remedy the situation so I do hope you

00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:18,609
will all go and sign this petition so we

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:18,609
can resolve this matter quickly

00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:25,960
so I am NOT an accessibility expert but

00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,750
luckily when I received this message

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,780
from Jorge on our accessibility team it

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,550
was only after an internal lunch and all

00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,920
that he was letting me know was that I

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,470
had a lot more to learn and a little bit

00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:42,370
of work to do before I could launch this

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:44,620
to the general public since then I have

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,270
gone through a ton of training and I've

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,580
learned a lot about the complexities of

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,860
screen readers how to test for

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,050
accessibility and how to build inclusive

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,660
experiences and that's what I want to

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:57,940
share with y'all today as it turns out I

00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,530
am NOT an accessibility expert but you

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,670
don't need to be to do this kind of work

00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,440
so let's flip the script and instead of

00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,560
talking about how to fail let's talk

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,950
about how not to fail at accessibility

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,930
cool yes awesome

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,390
all right so we'll cover three main

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,590
areas today first how do you know

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:20,430
whether or not your website is

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:23,200
accessible or inaccessible to start with

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:25,330
secondly once you've identified some

00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,540
bugs how do you go about coding to fix

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,490
those bugs and then lastly how can you

00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,510
adapt your process to prevent bugs like

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:39,370
that from happening in the first place

00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:42,000
okay kicking things off with testing so

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,550
what is accessibility you mean at all

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,490
it's a very broadly scoped term but it

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,840
look luckily it is thoroughly documented

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:53,470
if you've ever had to look up the

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,450
definition of an HTML element or a CSS

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,690
property you may be familiar with the

00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,970
w3c organization not only do they have

00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,800
that handy resource but they also have

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,010
what is known as the web content

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,490
accessibility guidelines or W CAG for

00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:12,010
short so if you visit this website you

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,080
will find a very lovely text heavy

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,700
verbose document where you can learn

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,980
anything that you've ever wanted to know

00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:24,850
about accessibility some light reading

00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:27,250
if you will what they distill are what

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:29,050
feature what makes features on the web

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,230
accessible or not accessible and they

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:35,060
grade them based

00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:36,950
a double-a and triple-a at SLAC we shoot

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,270
to have double-a compliance for all of

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,850
our features that we release and

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:46,910
wherever possible triple a compliance as

00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:49,040
well cool so the spectrum of human

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,350
abilities and the tech that exists to

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,990
support them is infinitely broad and

00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,390
while I'd love to cover everything we've

00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,680
got like 20 minutes left so we're gonna

00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,320
start with the hello world of

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,540
accessibility if you will so here are

00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,980
some four areas that you can get started

00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:09,440
with testing today cool first one is

00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,660
color contrast the Teenage Mutant Ninja

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,870
Turtle talked earlier help preface this

00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:19,070
so it's awesome second up is user

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:22,880
interface zoom then keyboard interaction

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:27,890
model and lastly building in screen

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,870
reader support okay so what does color

00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,090
contrast mean we got a brief look at

00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,740
this earlier but in general we're not

00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,260
trying to analyze every single color

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,550
across your beautiful website instead

00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,410
we're trying to make sure that the

00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,540
information and interactive elements

00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:44,480
that you have are understandable and

00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,490
perceivable by all users and that

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,930
specifically is looking at things like

00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:53,060
the normal text on your website large

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,580
text on your website which is 14-point

00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:59,630
and bold and above or 18-point and above

00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:02,390
and also interactive or user interface

00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:07,630
elements such as iconography and form

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:11,240
elements there is a super handy tool

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:13,400
called the color contrast analyzer where

00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,440
you can either input your hex values or

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,690
even just use the eyedropper tool and

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,980
it'll immediately tell you at the bottom

00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,610
whether or not you're hitting those

00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:24,920
contrast standards there are also a few

00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,200
websites I think somebody mentioned one

00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,390
earlier web aim where you can input the

00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:31,690
URL of your website and it'll do a scan

00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,770
to kind of check if there are any in

00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,229
[Music]

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:39,320
areas that don't meet the guidelines it

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:41,910
should come as no surprise but using

00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:46,100
light grey text on a white background

00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:49,250
not meet accessibility standards okay

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,920
next up we have user interface zoom and

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,840
this one my coworker jokes that this is

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,280
the easiest one to test for but it's

00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,620
also the easiest one for people to

00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,960
forget the user interface zoom refers to

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,330
the browser's built-in functionality to

00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,140
zoom into your web content using either

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:09,750
Apple plus minus or control plus minus

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,400
at slack our designers provide mock-ups

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,650
at all of the levels of zoom that we

00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,990
support and the easiest way for you to

00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:18,660
go about testing this is just doing that

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,850
you can take your website hit Apple plus

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,680
plus and then spend like a week using

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,870
your website like that and try to see if

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:31,170
you notice anything where areas feel

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:32,850
funky or broken next we've got keyboard

00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,880
interaction model or keyboard

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,920
navigability this refers to navigating

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,710
your website entirely with a keyboard

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,350
only using the common patterns of tab

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:46,650
and shift tab to move backwards and

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:49,080
forwards through elements and then using

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:51,090
things like the arrow keys enter escape

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:55,680
and spacebar to interact with those

00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:58,320
elements every year in May our

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,000
accessibility team hosts a challenge for

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,640
the global accessibility awareness day

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,650
where we encourage all of the employees

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,660
at slack to take our mice and put them

00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:10,140
in the desk drawer and only use your

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,640
keyboard to navigate our products like I

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,590
tried this last year and I was really

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,600
really surprised to see what areas I was

00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,280
able to make more efficient and what

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,810
areas I got stuck because I wasn't

00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:24,180
familiar with the common patterns that

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:26,130
existed we also have a handy palette of

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:30,630
keyboard shortcuts that you can access

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:33,330
using command /and this is awesome

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:36,180
because it not only helps folks with

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:38,760
limited mobility but it also helps

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,630
enable to enable people to become power

00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:45,000
users of slack so once you've got your

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,150
keyboard navigation down the guidelines

00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,360
also require you to indicate what has

00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,950
current focus you can tell here with the

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,840
focus ring it's like the blue fuzzy

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:59,010
circle that follows around where you

00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:02,220
navigating with the tab and lastly if

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:04,800
you are navigating around and you notice

00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,490
that you can tap into an area but you

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,020
can't tab away from it

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:12,920
this is what's known as a keyboard trap

00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:20,730
and it's something that you should avoid

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:22,590
like this cat very sad sorry cool okay

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,930
so last but not least we're moving it to

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:30,060
some trickier territory and testing for

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:32,220
screen reader support luckily if you've

00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,440
already cleaned up your keyboard

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,690
interaction model you're 50 halfway

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,560
there to making sure your website is

00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:43,020
screen reader supported if you are using

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,910
a Mac there's software built-in to help

00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,350
you test this and you can access it

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,540
through the system's preference panel

00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:51,210
then the accessibility pane and then

00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,220
enable voiceover there are also free

00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:58,620
software options for PCs and other

00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:02,310
platforms like NVDA ok anybody here use

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:05,490
a screen reader before oh it's good nice

00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:07,320
very nice ok so let's let's listen to a

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,030
quick example of what it's like using a

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,650
screen reader so I want you to listen

00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,320
along here and see if you can identify

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:15,420
what is happening you are currently on

00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,080
web content to enter the what area press

00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:22,170
control option shift down arrow lay like

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:25,320
page button leg pushing love-struck cat

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,330
in the group to exit link pushing much

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:33,330
like page button link video lunar new

00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:38,370
like like toggle button you are loved

00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,380
toggle button you are currently on a

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,030
toggle button inside of a toolbar to

00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:44,220
select or deselect this checkbox press

00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:46,020
control option space to navigate items

00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,390
on this toolbar press control option and

00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:54,720
then up arrow power toggle button Wow

00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:56,640
toggle button any guessin oh nice nicely

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,040
then okay so let's look at that one more

00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,620
time with the visual cues for anybody

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,640
who didn't get that it was Facebook so

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,890
you'll notice that as you're navigating

00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,680
the keyboard or the screen reader will

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,839
announce what has current flow

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:10,759
yes it'll say what is that type of

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:13,339
element that is being focused the

00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,589
definition of it and with things like

00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:18,139
the the like where you can choose six

00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:21,949
different legs it'll update as you are

00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:23,720
interacting with that element you are

00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:25,730
currently on web content to enter the

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,649
wet area press control option shift down

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:33,019

00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:37,459
you are currently in the group to exit

00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,699

00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:48,350
button you are loved toggle button you

00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:50,209
are currently on a toggle button inside

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,670
of a toolbar to select or deselect this

00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:54,170
checkbox press control option space to

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,939
navigate items on this toolbar press

00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,410
control option and then up arrow pas

00:13:55,939 --> 00:14:03,499
toggle button Wow

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:05,959
toggle button cool okay so in addition

00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:08,749
to these basics screen readers also we

00:14:05,959 --> 00:14:10,279
use a tool known as the rotor and this

00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:11,600
is one of the most important reasons you

00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:15,350
should make sure you have clean and

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,149
semantic HTML because the rotor scans

00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:19,249
your content and that's what it uses to

00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:22,910
populate the menus here's what it looks

00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:25,279
like Chrome recipe Google search Google

00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:28,370
Chrome window hope Mr P Google search

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,470
web content links menu you are currently

00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,860
in a voiceover menu this is a list link

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:36,649
link accessibility help link XS headings

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,329
menu heading level 1 accessibility

00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:40,040
heading level heading level 1 surf

00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:42,019
heading left heading level petit level 3

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,199
heading level 3 easy homemade ok to now

00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:49,009
full recipe link easy homemade recipe

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:51,980
just cool so you can pull up that menu

00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:54,220
using the control was it control option

00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,379
you and then left and right to navigate

00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,730
between the different menu options

00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:00,980
you'll notice that it had like one two

00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,139
three and those are like h1 h2 h3 and

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,779
also that the screen reader did not know

00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:10,220
how to pronounce po k properly it said

00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:13,189
poke pretty sure cool alright nice job

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,540
everybody you're all on a roll so give

00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:19,720
your neighbor a high-five and like we'll

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,720
keep on moving oh sweet

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,499
okay so the next area here is how do we

00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:30,009
improve our code to have clean

00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:31,449
accessible experiences there are three

00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:33,999
broad level things that you want to

00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:35,799
consider here first of all as I

00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:38,769
mentioned for screen readers providing

00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:41,529
clean semantic HTML and also proper Aria

00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:43,389
labels is super important then you'll

00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:45,609
get very comfortable with programmatic

00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:48,489
focus management which everybody loves

00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:50,529
JavaScript so hopefully easy and then

00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:52,899
you can figure out how to leverage

00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:57,220
modern modern coding practices to help

00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:59,619
as well okay let's step back earlier to

00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:01,359
that call-out from George the feature

00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:03,699
that I was working on at the time was a

00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:05,589
pretty common web interface pattern so

00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:07,689
there's a box there's a list below it

00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,819
you type into the box the list below it

00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:12,759
gets filtered this is what's known as a

00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:15,879
combo box so I want you to take a look

00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:18,129
at the before and after I'm fixing

00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:23,199
before and after I fix the accessibility

00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:27,850
issue can anybody tell the difference no

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:29,559
not a trick is a trick question okay to

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,009
me they look exactly the same they both

00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:35,019
still have a box for the list below it

00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:37,089
the problem was that I when I first set

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:39,489
out to build it I approached it exactly

00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:42,549
the way that it sounds so I built the

00:16:39,489 --> 00:16:48,089
text element and then I built a list

00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:50,769
menu element and since they are like

00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:52,660
typographically similar there have

00:16:50,769 --> 00:16:54,609
closed composition on the page or like

00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,139
told pixels apart and they're contained

00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:59,489
together against like a white background

00:16:56,139 --> 00:17:02,079
box obviously they're related elements

00:16:59,489 --> 00:17:04,839
the problem there is with my initial

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,850
assumption even though to me they were

00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,549
visually distinct as separate elements

00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:11,799
to a screen reader they do not have the

00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:13,480
benefit of those visual cues so we were

00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:16,870
still treating it as two separate

00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,100
elements instead I needed to switch to a

00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:22,240
completely different underlying

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:25,120
architecture from two components to one

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,010
component so this way using the Select

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,129
even though it also has the text input

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:32,000
and an options list the screenreader can

00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:35,810
only maintain focus on one

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,890
at a time so this breeder will focus on

00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:42,200
the select and then the internal child

00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,420
components have a way of updating the

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,670
parent component to then tell the screen

00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,620
reader what is happening whether

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,660
somebody is navigating up and down in

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:54,460
the list or if they are typing into the

00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,610
box but how does that even work weird

00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,160
okay

00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:00,560
so back to that handy w3c document

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,960
they've also defined an API for

00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,060
indicating to assistive technologies

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,430
what is happening on screen this is

00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:11,300
known as Aria or accessible rich

00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:13,280
Internet applications what's happening

00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,280
behind the scenes is that this

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,740
accessibility API parses the Dom on your

00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,900
website communicates that to the screen

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:24,950
reader or whatever assistive technology

00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:28,990
is being used and then that information

00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:32,330
gets output to a human on the other side

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:34,850
so spoiler alert but just in the same

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,850
way that browsers sometimes have trouble

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,410
rendering CSS they can also sometimes

00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:43,130
have a little bit trouble understanding

00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:46,610
your Aria labels this is not a huge

00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:49,310
problem just there reminder to always be

00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:51,410
testing thoroughly across cross platform

00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:57,080
and cross browser as I'm sure that you

00:18:51,410 --> 00:19:00,200
all already do okay so it's like we've

00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,450
now learned to build an aria pattern

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,850
with each techSpec we write so that

00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:07,040
before we start coding anything we

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:11,240
should know that the component should be

00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,500
accessible from the start however as I

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,330
mentioned we're building component

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,840
libraries and since they have to support

00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:19,010
a multitude of different use cases

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,540
sometimes doesn't look as simple and

00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:24,140
inside it looks a little bit more like

00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:25,550
this just make sure that you workshop

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:29,000
these things with your peers and that

00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:30,860
you're covering all of your bases once

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,060
you get to the code level things start

00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,160
looking a little bit more like this

00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,710
where you may have a feature spread out

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,360
across a few separate components and

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,510
then you can use things like JavaScript

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:45,380
utilities to build and connect the IDs

00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:48,049
that are informing your Aria attributes

00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,090
okay once you have everything built out

00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:52,669
properly here's what a combo box should

00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:54,520
sound like when it's word filter fortune

00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:56,990
list combo box search message actions

00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,240
start the thread slack add reaction

00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,690
slack app copy leg slack delete message

00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,900

00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,740
slack start the thread slack star

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:12,590
message slack okay cool

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,210
so you all are on a roll thank you again

00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:16,850
for sticking through it we got one more

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:19,130
section to go okay

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,710
the next section I know everybody here

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:24,020
oh oh okay I know everybody here loves

00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:26,330
bugs but how do you prevent bugs from

00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,610
happening in the first place I've gone a

00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,049
few going over a few tips but let's step

00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:33,169
back to what things look like it's like

00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:35,120
a year ago when I joined there were 75

00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:38,720
front-end engineers but there was only

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,850
one accessibility expert as I mentioned

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,820
I am NOT that expert we have the famed

00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,990
Todd Kurtz who is incredibly talented

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,020
and amazing to work with

00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:49,549
but even so one engineer is not enough

00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:52,039
to support all the accessibility

00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:53,480
features we want to include so over the

00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:55,070
past year we've rolled out training

00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,950
similar to this one to ensure all

00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:59,630
front-end engineers at slack understand

00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,640
the accessibility criteria that we are

00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:04,520
shooting for and how to build and test

00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,620
for it more importantly that means that

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,210
since we all have this understanding

00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:11,150
when we're reviewing each other's code

00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:13,190
reviews and code and pull requests that

00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:16,429
we know how to test accessibility for

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:18,830
everybody else those features too we've

00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:20,840
taken it one step further and we also

00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:23,390
ensure that our designers know what

00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,830
accessibility is and isn't and they

00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,990
provide things like the keyboard

00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:32,000
interaction model for us so we can then

00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:33,559
build it out we haven't are using our

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,020
internal design system has helped

00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:37,580
formalize a lot of best practices so

00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,370
over the last year we've also conducted

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:44,720
a color audit to simplify and ensure

00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:46,700
that our smaller new set of colors meets

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,620
all of our contrast standards we've also

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,409
set up things like linters to prevent

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,520
folks from adding one-off colors this is

00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:54,890
just one of the steps that we've taken

00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,169
to help prepare for one of the most

00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,150
requested features of slack dark mode so

00:21:57,169 --> 00:22:00,740
that once it does roll out

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:05,510
we can ensure that it'll still be fully

00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:07,490
accessible so having front Enders use a

00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:11,150
centralized component library that is

00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:12,740
accessible by default is awesome we

00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,470
currently use these components and

00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,760
nearly 75% of applicable areas of our

00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,970
code base and we're trying to increase

00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:21,890
that steadily but the single most useful

00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,320
thing I've learned is that you need to

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:27,260
consider accessibility as early on in

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,150
the process as possible because it's

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:33,530
easier to add the blueberries in before

00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:36,679
you bake muffin somebody once said we

00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:38,420
also have a dedicated QA team to run

00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:40,820
throw checks before we launch a feature

00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,920
and also you to utilize a third-party

00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:47,120
service called Ultra who conduct an

00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:49,429
audit as well so even if you don't have

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,550
the benefit of a component library or

00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:54,050
design system or QA team and you're so

00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:56,870
loads of working by yourself

00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:59,420
hopefully this starter kit is enough to

00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:03,620
get you learning to become your own

00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:06,170
resident expert awesome so nice job

00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,700
everybody you've learned a ton and I

00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,230
know that you're gonna apply all these

00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,440
best practices once you're back in the

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,360
real world but I want you all to stop

00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,190
for a minute and think about how you got

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,309
to where you're sitting here today in a

00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:20,420
conference room in Hawaii

00:23:18,309 --> 00:23:22,580
maybe you first heard about this

00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:25,220
conference on Twitter and you thought it

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:28,130
sounded cool so you navigated onto their

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,630
website you really liked the lineup and

00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:33,100
the idea of learning JavaScript on a

00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:37,250
beach so of course we bought a ticket

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:40,929
then you went on to buy a cheapest plane

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:43,550
ticket possible to get yourself here and

00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:45,530
of course you asked all your friends for

00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:47,360
the best food recommendations so you

00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:50,530
knew where to go for pookay and local

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,170
moco once you were on the island a

00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:56,090
recent study in the UK found that nearly

00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:58,760
70 percent of their web sites were

00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:00,140
inaccessible so I want you to think

00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,510
about all these websites you've touched

00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,760
along the way just in one day and

00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,920
imagine that every time you want to fill

00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,080
out a form or even just browse and read

00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:12,720
content you were hit with a javascript

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,460
error I've always found it

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,650
interesting that other engineering

00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:18,539
professions have a lot more strict

00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,940
certifications that they have to undergo

00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:22,710
so think about civil engineers need to

00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,270
be tested before they can build bridges

00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:26,640
and buildings to make sure that they're

00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:28,440
safe for humans and while I do not want

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,690
this type of gatekeeping behavior in our

00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,380
industry I do want us to hold ourselves

00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:35,940
and each other more accountable to make

00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,500
sure that we are responsible with our

00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,059
code and that we are building an

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:43,530
internet that is safe for other humans

00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:45,690
to use to I hope that this is something

00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:47,429
that you remember once you're all back

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:51,030
and you have a p.m. breathing down your

00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:53,610
neck about an upcoming deadline your

00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:55,380
peers are trusting your expertise in all

00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,419
things front end and that includes

00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,330
knowing that for to have a complete web

00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:01,770
project it has to be accessible even

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:04,470
though it takes a little bit more time

00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:08,159
upfront it'll save you infinitely long

00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:09,390
in the long run it's become more and

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,780
more apparent that there are no average

00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,610
users this is a myth instead we should

00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:17,070
be designing for the extremes of human

00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,980
ability much like everything else and

00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:21,450
especially with Emily's talk earlier

00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:23,490
prioritizing inclusivity and designing

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,470
for the most marginalized groups

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,010
actually makes a better experience for

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,700
everyone

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:31,320
I there are countless examples of this

00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,210
too I'm not sure the last time you

00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,490
enjoyed a video that had closed

00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,929
captioning or if you enjoy text

00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:38,880
messaging or any voice-activated

00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:42,870
software all of these have their roots

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,940
in assistive technology so I hope you'll

00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,679
take this as a sign that you too can

00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:50,250
build for accessibility even if you're

00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:51,750
not an expert and if you want to get

00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,500
stuck along the way or if you just want

00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,750
to tell me about your favorite

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,400
accessibility bug you can find me at

00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:58,140
fish on the internet or come find me

00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,820
after the talk or if you want to come

00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:02,309
work it slack and build component

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,200
library things more than happy to hear

00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:05,610
about it thank you all for having me

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,240
thank you for the organizers for

00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:10,890
bringing us all here to cool look

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:17,239
you

00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:17,239
