as mentioned I'm Anna watt and up until

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,720
two weeks ago

00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,059
for Stanford University building

00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,560
accessible user centered websites and

00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,869
web product so we supported the

00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,029
university's over 3,000 websites

00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:24,490
we're sort of operated as an in-house

00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:26,619
Drupal webshop and I work directly with

00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:28,320
our development team back in front end

00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:31,180
of and visual and user experience

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,580
designers but I actually just started a

00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:36,460
new position just last Wednesday at a

00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,010
startup in Seattle called text EO as a

00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,199
community manager but while I was at

00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:44,110
Stanford I worked on campus for the

00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:45,880
first six months and then I decided to

00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,590
move to Seattle where I continued

00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,170
working for them remotely for the last

00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:52,210
two years and when I moved I was really

00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,250
missing that sense of community so I

00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,500
started a Stanford community of practice

00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,300
for distributed and remote workers which

00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,910
was a community that met entirely

00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:02,739
virtually to discuss this culture shift

00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,479
of the future of work and what that

00:01:02,739 --> 00:01:06,940
looked like and specifically the

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,399
challenges facing technology teams in

00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,860
higher education so first I want to

00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:14,170
start off by saying I am NOT here to

00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,549
push a remote first agenda I know that

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,680
there are some companies doing not

00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:19,479
really successfully but really I want to

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,939
help support the culture shift around

00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:24,340
what remote working really looks like

00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:26,619
and how you can work with a distributed

00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:28,990
team and working in tech you will

00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,070
inevitably end up in a situation where

00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,110
you're working with someone in a

00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,220
different physical location as you even

00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,689
if that means they're in a different

00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,090
office or even a different conference

00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:38,799
room on another floor and I encourage

00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:42,280
you not to just cancel your remote

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,680
meetings because of that so or your

00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,299
collaborative meetings that is so I have

00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,880
to tell you this talk is already going

00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:51,369
so much better than the very first talk

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,320
I ever gave at a conference I was

00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:55,060
introducing this new community of

00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,399
practice for remote workers at

00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,770
Stanford's itn conference which brings

00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:01,390
together 500 of Stanford's IT

00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,520
professionals from all across the

00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:06,520
university I flew back to Palo Alto

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,739
California on campus from Seattle and

00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,420
I'm originally from the Bay Area as I

00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:12,579
said I'll just stay with my parents in

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,040
Pacifica which is this cute little beach

00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:17,709
town about 30 minutes away without

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,849
traffic on a good day so I gave myself

00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:23,140
an hour and a half to get there and

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:25,570
believe it or not

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,210
it took me an hour and a half to get

00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:31,780
there and I was late to my first ever

00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:33,790
talk I got stuck in traffic when I

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,680
finally got to campus I parked the staff

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,230
parking lot about half a mile away from

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,750
the conference center I had to book it

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,460
across campus hoof it up a flight of

00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:45,040
stairs three stairs at a time and I go

00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:46,780
blasting through the conference doors to

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,780
see my speaking partner on stage

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:53,320
nervously laughing and introducing me so

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:56,709
I climb up on stage out of breath finish

00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:59,140
the talk humiliated but it turns out

00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:00,910
that everyone thought that we had staged

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,970
this that this was this big scripted

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,800
moment right because the irony was that

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,500
we were introducing this community of

00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,970
practice because so many people were

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
dealing with their commute time

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:15,190
specifically at Stanford they had

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,560
doubled within the last year nailed that

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,060
one

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,010
so I go busting through the door they

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:25,870
recorded it I'd show you a video but I'm

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:27,610
not going to and the reality is that in

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,610
San Francisco Bay Area and I'm sure this

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,920
is true in many other cities San

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,870
Francisco workers have quit a job due to

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,580
a grueling drive to work that's one in

00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,890
three San Francisco workers and this

00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,799
came from the 2018 study by Robert Half

00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,690
a talent firm yikes I'm sure some of you

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:45,910
can maybe even relate to this here and

00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,630
it's not just traffic that's the problem

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:51,610
there's this affordable housing crisis

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,739
happening in many major tech hubs and I

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,019
grew up in the Bay Area my entire family

00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:57,970
is still there but I personally made the

00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:59,920
decision to move so I could afford a

00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,410
home and I knew that that was a decision

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,060
was also a privilege that I had and I

00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,680
know several other people that have made

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,019
that same decision to move away from

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,989
their family in order to afford a

00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:12,519
different lifestyle and if you're having

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,110
a hard time thinking about how remote

00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,060
working might impact you or your

00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,609
employers I encourage you to check out

00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,070
this talk by Erica D Fox called new in

00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:22,930
town I saw this talk at the write speak

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,680
code conference in Portland Oregon of

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:28,960
August 2017 there's a link at the top

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,370
that we link but this talk confronts the

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,320
impact of the tech industry on

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,030
gentrification and I can't do this talk

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,230
justice so I just encourage you to watch

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,670
it after

00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,490
you know when you go back after this

00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:41,980
conference and it really talks about

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,080
that impact and specifically how remote

00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,850
working can help offset some of those

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,600
issues along with other insightful

00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:51,160
research and ideas so check that out

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,380
because the other thing is anytime you

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,410
talk about remote working the stigma is

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,120
this is what you're doing maybe I'll be

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,660
doing this in a few hours because we're

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,250
here but realistically this was not my

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,190
life this is not what it looked like to

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:11,050
work from home somehow you're on a beach

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:13,240
with Wi-Fi maybe there's a cocktail but

00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:16,330
that certainly is not the reality for

00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,550
most remote workers this is what my

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,440
office looks like I worked in my house

00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:23,470
between four walls from 9:00 to 5:00

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,560
every day that is my desk and that is my

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,990
huge cat Lambert he's part Maine so

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,030
he's just big but if you zoom in you'll

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,220
see like I'm on slack having a

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,740
discussion about gdpr compliance not

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,120
looking up flights to Mexico with

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,310
infinity pools and Wi-Fi don't work from

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,200
and mad hops to anyone that can do that

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,850
that's amazing but I just found that it

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,890
wasn't the lifestyle that I was able to

00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,690
live because I interacted with my team

00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,930
and our clients and an almost hourly

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:53,020
basis on video calls all day long this

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:54,700
was my view not the beach this is my

00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,140
team at Stanford on Halloween no one

00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,180
tweet this slide they know that I'm

00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:01,240
sharing it but they'd probably kill me

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,500
if they knew I chose this photo I didn't

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,880
know you know if I didn't know any

00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,670
better this could be any other day but

00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,290
it was Halloween you'll see my coworker

00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,450
Carol is dressed as a chicken she's

00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:13,810
actually holding a chicken and then

00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:15,970
bottom left you'll see is the conference

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,980
room of people on campus we had just as

00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,140
many people working on campus as we did

00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:22,360
working remotely and we have everything

00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,330
from developers designers project

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,670
managers writers user experience

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,650
researchers both remote and on-site on

00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,840
this picture we had a lot of fun and

00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,850
every Monday morning we'd all jump on a

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,770
call and the larger team have our

00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:39,670
stand-up talk about blockers and really

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,930
just kicked off our week so okay I told

00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,760
the conference organizers there'd be

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,890
pictures of cats so you know that's why

00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,290
they picked my talk but the truth is I

00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,990
never thought I would be a remote

00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,240
I was terrified I you know I'm an

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,160
extrovert working remotely was really

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,380
hard for me I get ideas from being

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,970
around other people so even though

00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,340
Lambert here and I can come up with

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,800
great ideas together such as napping on

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,530
my keyboard ultimately I still needed to

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,510
join remote meetings with my team and I

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:09,310
still needed to collaborate and as the

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,610
project manager people were looking to

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,870
me to lead those in a collaborative way

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,240
just like when I was on campus for the

00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,250
first six months it's just that now I'll

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,870
happen to be floating up on a giant five

00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,120
foot TV screen on the wall in the

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,680
conference room and so while you might

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,840
think it's challenging how do you run a

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,880
brainstorm meeting without that wait

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,250
board and a smell of dry erase marker

00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,860
right I actually found that it's still

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,270
very very doable remotely so today

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,300
finally here's the plan

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,980
I want to discuss what exactly is a

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,600
collaborative remote design working

00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,940
session other than setting the record

00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,770
for the most adjectives used in a talk

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,690
title and how is this different from

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,520
just another regular meeting and then

00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,990
we'll look at some tools we used and how

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,090
I put them to use for running these

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,710
working sessions entirely remotely so

00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:55,930
it's just a virtual whiteboard sticky

00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,940
notes and all and then I'll share some

00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:59,500
tips and best practices for being

00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,970
inclusive because all the tools in the

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,360
world won't help you if you're not

00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:07,510
actually including your team sound good

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,460
let's do it so what's the difference

00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,920
between another regular meeting and a

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,260
working session in a traditional meeting

00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,030
you might be updating each other right

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,760
you get in a room you talk about the

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,110
work you assign things you update and

00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,060
then you leave and then you go work on

00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,340
it so the PM there right

00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,560
we're telling adding tasks hey front end

00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,230
team you're gonna go team those

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,460
responsive breakpoints now yeah back-end

00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:35,080
team go do backend stuff and user

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,050
experience designer you're gonna

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,000
interview a user or something right and

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,470
then we'll all come back together and

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,300
talk about what we did wrong because we

00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:46,840
weren't actually working together go

00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,520
team so this isn't just about having

00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,320
better meetings with your team it's

00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,420
about changing the way you actually

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,700
spend your time together and how you get

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,320
that work done so after this you can go

00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,580
tell your team guess what no more mean

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,430
and then come thank me because they're

00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,410
gonna love it by actually switching to

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:04,870
the term working session even in the

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:06,640
calendar in might I saw a change in the

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,380
way people approached the time together

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,570
they felt less pressure to bring

00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,910
finished work to a meeting to share with

00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,500
the group and we still have daily

00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,150
stand-ups and sprint reviews for those

00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,040
of you working on agile teams and are

00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:20,770
curious so these are working sessions

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,170
outside of that so what exactly is this

00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,770
collaborative remote design working

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,110
session

00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:28,060
well it's collaborative because no one

00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,190
single person is giving a formal

00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,160
presentation like I'm doing right now

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:35,440
this is not a collaborative talk when

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,450
people are co-creating and feeling

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,640
included and their ideas are being heard

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,800
they're far more engaged and they're not

00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,830
sitting there on their laptops looking

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,810
at pictures of my cats you're working

00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,450
session should be as hands-on and

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,190
interactive as possible and it's remote

00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,810
so this is a tricky layer right what

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,340
does it mean to be remote it doesn't

00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,080
mean that everyone's working from home

00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,730
it just means that you're not physically

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,260
co-located maybe there's people in a

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,820
different office or a different

00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,710
conference room across campus this

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,990
happened at Stanford all the time it

00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,730
took 20 minutes for me although 30

00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,550
seconds flat when I sprinted onstage

00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:11,200
super late to cross campus to another

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,810
meeting so we're saving time by just

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,160
calling in remotely and the goal here is

00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,070
that you're making the content of these

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,540
meetings or these working sessions

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,460
accessible regardless of anyone's

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,650
physical location the day of the working

00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,300
session the thing about the time you

00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,520
called in to a meeting on speakerphone

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,620
or you were the person on the laptop at

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,390
the end of the table with everyone else

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,530
in the room you probably couldn't see

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,750
the whiteboard with all of their

00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:37,420
fabulous ideas you probably couldn't

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,640
hear everyone that well and when you did

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,050
try to chime in it was awkward and they

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,940
asked you to repeat yourself is if you

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:45,730
just interrupted them sound familiar

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,250
just didn't feel like you were there in

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:50,410
the room with them so when you set up

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,570
these working sessions to work remotely

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,460
you're forcing the adoption of tools and

00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,440
best practices that make this content

00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,080
actually more accessible and inclusive

00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,880
for everyone in the room even those

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,850
physically there and remote on the

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,230
screen and these are design working

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,210
sessions because they use a design

00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:09,550
thinking process which I'll cover in a

00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,150
few slides which brings the team along

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,190
the journey

00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,960
designing something together when

00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,760
there's a shared decision making along

00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,860
the way you no longer need to fill

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,560
people in on conversations or decisions

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,690
made without them oh well

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,490
the design team mate met last week

00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,590
during our design review meeting and

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,690
made some tweaks to those mock-ups after

00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:32,230
I put a note in the JIRA ticket didn't

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:34,120
you see it design is iterative right

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:35,320
things are constantly changing so when

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,180
you're making these changes and

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:39,100
decisions together no one gets left

00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,630
behind and these are working sessions

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,790
after all they're not deadline-driven

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:45,040
meetings as I mentioned before people

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,020
aren't rushing to get stuff done and it

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,880
allows the team to create shared goals

00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,940
and expectations for how they spend

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,620
their time together so we're taking a

00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,090
page from our accessibility advocates

00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,430
accessibility is huge in higher

00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:59,110
education as it should be everywhere so

00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:01,900
when you solve a problem for remote

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:04,180
employee you often solve it for everyone

00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,790
as a remote project manager I was forced

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,070
to keep up with documentation define and

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,610
redefine our processes and

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,200
over-communicate because someone

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,230
couldn't just walk up to my desk anymore

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,060
ensure their slack they can ping me but

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,740
it's just not the same and when your

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,390
remote you want to have access to that

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,440
information as quickly and efficiently

00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,970
as possible

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,010
so when you set up these working

00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,200
sessions to provide all materials to

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,820
work remotely such as creating a virtual

00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,550
whiteboard it creates a much more

00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:33,160
cohesive and well documented experience

00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,290
so raise your hand if you've ever had a

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,240
magical brainstorm whiteboard session in

00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:41,650
a conference room and you took a picture

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,210
of it and guess what I bet that picture

00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,400
is still sitting on your phone and a

00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,140
black hole or maybe you posted it on

00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,110
slack and got a thumbs up emoji

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,060
until one day google photos prompts you

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:55,390
hey do you want to archive these 22

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,860
pictures of whiteboard photos so with

00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,350
the virtual whiteboard it can be

00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,850
revisited modified updated and used

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,200
frequently throughout the project

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,600
without requiring someone to

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,490
painstakingly transcribe all of your

00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,850
wonderful notes on sticky notes on the

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,650
board so this is an example of mural a

00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:13,660
tool that we use to recreate these

00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,730
virtual whiteboards and share link and I

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,050
put a link to this whiteboard every

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,760
single one of my meeting invites

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,200
regardless if we're past the

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,490
brainstorming phase or not because we

00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,630
might come back to it right we might

00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:26,590
still want to access this information

00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:28,360
later so as I mentioned working sessions

00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:29,890
benefit from this design thinking

00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,690
process since you're bringing everyone

00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,700
along this journey of designing

00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,620
something together the source here is

00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,930
the Stanford d.school they have several

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:40,750
great resources for how to run workshops

00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,430
with this lots of play books and sort of

00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,750
worksheets and stuff to walk you through

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:45,280
how to do this but I'm going to cover

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:49,060
the quick basics because this could be

00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:51,070
its own talk so just quickly first you

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,900
want to empathize with your users you

00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,430
want to understand how they're feeling

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,860
what are their motivations gain an

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,750
empathic understanding of the problem

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,060
you're trying to solve then you're going

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,980
to define the problem or the hypothesis

00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,960
so typically you create a human centered

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,730
problem statement which is really just a

00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,630
fancy way of saying what are we doing

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:12,130
here for example how can we use

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,960
storytelling in a visual and compelling

00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:16,030
way so our readers will want to learn

00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,760
more and feel empowered to keep coming

00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,680
back to our website instead of we want

00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,140
our users to click and read our magazine

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:26,170
articles to drive up the number of page

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:28,240
views then you're going to quickly jump

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,010
into the idea phase with solutions and

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,990
designs this is brainstorm this is where

00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,570
the magic happens so you can include

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:37,000
ideas for visuals user experience how

00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:38,290
you might talk to users even ideas for

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,690
infrastructure you think you might need

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,060
to solve the problem and then jump into

00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:45,910
the prototype experimental phase this is

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:47,770
low fidelity designs wireframes whatever

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,450
you need to get a prototype together so

00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,130
you can get it in front of users as

00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,350
quickly as possible for immediate

00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:55,660
feedback which brings you to testing and

00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,680
it's okay to fail fast because you're

00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,360
going to keep going through each of

00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,450
these different stages as you learn more

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:03,280
about your users means how they're

00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:05,590
feeling how they're thinking and

00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:09,670
behaving to your designs so you can keep

00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:12,190
improving so I want to share an example

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:14,920
feature request of how we might have

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:16,780
taken a feature request into a Design

00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:20,230
Thinking working session with our team

00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,730
remotely so this example the product

00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,860
owner came to us we worked on websites

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,410
at Stanford a product owner came to us

00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,880
and said as a Content author just

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,340
someone that edits content on a website

00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,360
I want to share the latest article with

00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,459
a video or a featured image on the home

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:39,140
so that I can drive more traffic to our

00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:40,640
magazine articles okay great let's get

00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,709
in a room let's talk about it team what

00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,720
do we what do we what's the problem

00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:47,209
we're trying to solve who are the users

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,829
we're really solving this problem for so

00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:52,399
first we empathize and define the

00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:53,930
problem the end users the website

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,300
visitors or the people we're actually

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,769
designing for here so you want to get

00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,899
everyone in their room thinking about

00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:01,790
those users right away not just about

00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:03,380
the product owners business needs which

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,050
we know are important since they're the

00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,180
content authors but in our working

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,250
session we'll use these frameworks for

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,010
example so this again we're using mural

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:15,950
because we're in that brainstorm sort of

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:18,110
emphasized and defined phase on the left

00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:20,240
you see this strategize our value

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,399
proposition canvas and what that is is

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,740
it's looking at your user profile so

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,019
understanding their games their pains

00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:28,430
what are the tasks the jobs they need to

00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,589
do when they get to your website right

00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:32,990
everyone needs to do something when

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,430
they're looking at your website and on

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,019
the other side you're looking at your

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,480
products your service or your website

00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:40,820
and what are those game creators and

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,980
those pain relievers and between those

00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,199
two canvases you'll start to identify a

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,820
fit where things are fitting between

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,800
your users and what you're providing to

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,269
them and where the gaps are what are you

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,980
missing what are you not seeing and

00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:53,959
that's how you start to define what are

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,769
the problems we're really trying to

00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:56,810
solve here

00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:59,240
so a user experience designer in this

00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,920
working session with this canvas for

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,360
example in mural is getting the whole

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:04,699
team thinking about the end user

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,530
experience we have developers in the

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:09,740
room we have obviously the user

00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:11,900
experience designer everyone's talking

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,790
about this from the beginning and then

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,280
on the right is just another example of

00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:22,520
the lean UX framework that you can use

00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:25,130
to help define the problem so from there

00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,569
you're gonna get into idea mode and this

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,990
can happen in the same working session

00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:31,760
sometimes the last phase takes longer it

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,530
just depends how big the problem is and

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,870
how much you already know or what you

00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,270
don't know yet so in the idea phase we

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,130
use Google draw or envision freehand for

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,960
example to quickly sketch in low

00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,520
fidelity ideas I don't actually have the

00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,160
mock-ups for this feature request since

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,440
I no longer

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:50,010
at Stanford but this is just obviously a

00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,840
picture of a wireframe but a developers

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,850
might start sketching in some ideas for

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,590
functionality requirements as our

00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,050
designers sketching out ideas for how

00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,820
they want this to lay out on the the new

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,290
homepage we're designing maybe our

00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:04,230
developer even says oh hey I have this

00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,150
idea to use this YouTube API and while

00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,030
they're demoing this all of us in the

00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,980
room we discover oh we want to use our

00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:13,020
own image stills and the ability to

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,610
upload those instead of using the

00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,440
YouTube previews since we know that

00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,330
custom imagery is really important to

00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,980
our product owner so we you can see

00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,710
we're sort of discovering these things

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:25,860
together collaboratively much earlier or

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:28,080
not in the process then we'll jump into

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,330
our prototype phase our visual designer

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,980
these again admittedly are much higher

00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:33,750
fidelity than where they probably

00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,240
started but this is what I can share

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:39,270
with you so we're looking at mock-ups

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,820
there using sketch or envision or Sigma

00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:44,040
to collaboratively jump in and work on

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,600
these designs and we'll walk through

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,700
these technical requirements with our

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,310
developers will confirm the user flow

00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,250
with our user experience designer in the

00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:55,770
room as well and finally we'll test and

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,920
in our next working session we'll jump

00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,930
on a call in zoom to share our screens

00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,970
and watch someone test our prototype for

00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:05,280
the very first time you can use tools

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:07,140
like optimal workshop as well to send it

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,540
out to like large groups of users to

00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:11,400
collect a lot of data but the quickest

00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,170
way to just test is share someone's

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,360
screen and watch them interact with your

00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:17,730
prototype for the first time and in this

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,980
case I was the guinea pig so I was the

00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:23,220
one testing our very first prototype and

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,750
on the right there was no play button

00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,070
our designer immediately was like wait

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,560
where's the video play button this

00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:32,030
custom icon I created it's missing and

00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:35,070
as it turned out Google tag manager was

00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:37,230
preventing our custom JavaScript from

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,670
loading in the correct order and so you

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,250
know if anyone's come across that bug

00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:42,840
before that was a fun one to kind of

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:45,750
troubleshoot together but we were able

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,460
to really quickly come across some of

00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,870
these issues early on and get them

00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,340
resolved because we were sharing our

00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,990
screens and not just like peeking over

00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:55,920
each other's shoulder at the other

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,490
person's laptop so so far we've talked

00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,679
about the format of collaborate

00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,210
remote working sessions an example

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,550
feature built in the design thinking

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:05,170
process remotely so here are some other

00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:07,840
tools because I've already mentioned a

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:10,270
few and chances are you're already using

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,559
a lot of these but I think but start

00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:14,410
thinking about how you can leverage them

00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:16,750
to set up a remote working session so

00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,880
first and foremost nailed down your

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,580
video conferencing software it's super

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,010
important our team you zoom slack also

00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,080
has great of you know video capabilities

00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,510
for ad-hoc calls but we would actually

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,980
setup a dedicated zoom number that the

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,990
team would just memorize and it kind of

00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,700
served as our virtual office or just hey

00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,410
jump on a call and then people would all

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,010
meet there so you don't waste time

00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:40,809
setting one up when you need to we would

00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,820
also set up our conference rooms so that

00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:44,830
we did have whiteboards in the physical

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,150
room directly across from the camera

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,610
where the conference room screen was

00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,990
pointing and then we actually figured

00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:52,179
out it's a little creepy but you can

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,670
change the settings of the zoom host to

00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:56,679
allow far-end camera control so it's a

00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:58,330
remote user I could actually control the

00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,040
camera and like zoom into the whiteboard

00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,630
and look around which was really

00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,130
empowering as a remote person I don't

00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,630
have to interrupt someone in their idea

00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,000
because I can't see what they're doing

00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,940
so I was able to kind of feel like I was

00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,250
in the room with them also other

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:14,350
brainstorming tools mindmeister is a

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,210
good one for quick sort of mind mapping

00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:19,150
just stream of conscious getting ideas

00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:21,580
down Trello is really great another

00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,620
virtual sticky board like experience

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,630
with sorting and voting and commenting

00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:29,170
and now it connects to JIRA because that

00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:31,600
lasya nones them now so that's cool you

00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:34,960
can also use mural and optimal workshop

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,000
for user experience testing optimal

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,870
workshop has tree jack card sorting

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,970
first click analysis and surveys design

00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,950
mock-ups we were using sketching and

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,300
vision for a while but figma sort of

00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,770
taken over that real time and

00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,570
collaboration sort of Google Doc

00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:52,870
experience for designers which has been

00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,429
really great so just take advantage of

00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,809
all of the tools your team is already

00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:58,240
using but think about how you can use

00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:00,220
them and I'm a remote friendly way and

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,780
if there are others that you know of

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,450
that I haven't mentioned tweet them at

00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:07,660
me always always checking out new tools

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:09,130
and so finally as I mentioned you can

00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,330
have all the tools in the world but

00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,870
they're not going to help you if you're

00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:14,260
not actually

00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:16,120
including your remote team members so I

00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:19,809
have a few tips I want to share with you

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,550
this first one make remote working an

00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:23,559
option for everyone especially for any

00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:25,540
managers in the room this might be the

00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:26,890
hardest part so maybe find me after if

00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,380
you find that this is the biggest hurdle

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,270
on your team but I call this out to

00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,950
manager specifically because I think the

00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:35,530
culture shift has to start from the top

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,180
working from home should not be

00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,910
considered special treatment or a

00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,700
privilege and I'm not saying everyone

00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:44,860
should work from home every day but they

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:48,000
should have the option and flexibility

00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:51,010
to work from when and where they need to

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,120
only allowing full-time remote staff to

00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:54,880
work remotely creates this really

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:57,040
negative stigma around it and resentment

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,690
for those that do so if everyone on the

00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,190
team has a chance to try it and won't

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:01,630
feel like this dirty little secret that

00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:03,160
gets taken advantage of when they

00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:06,250
finally get to work from home because

00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:08,470
they have a delivery at noon but it also

00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:11,080
creates empathy for the on-site team for

00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:13,150
the remote team members oh I finally got

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,770
to work from home last Thursday I didn't

00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:18,570
realize when I hate pretzels right by

00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:21,190
the microphone that's all you can hear

00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:22,840
number two always turn on the video

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,640
camera now of all the tips I'm going to

00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,220
share I think that this one is the most

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,350
important you have to have video and

00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:31,900
everyone on the call has to do it

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,790
because video helps provide visual cues

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,800
like I'm agreeing with you or I'm

00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:38,679
confused please keep explaining that

00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,360
idea it really those facial expressions

00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:41,980
are really helpful for staying engaged

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,500
and feeling like your ideas are being

00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,179
heard and headphones are essential for

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,640
remote participants I think that goes

00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:51,429
without saying but just prevents that

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,870
sort of awkward audio gaps in feedback

00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,980
that you might get so just get a nice

00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,100
pair of headphones with the mute button

00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,570
and on the positive side one positive

00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,429
side effect of remote working I've

00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,710
learned is that it really flexes your

00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:04,450
active listening skills since you are

00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,860
more aware of when you're interrupting

00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,330
someone when you have control of your

00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,860
own mute button sometimes I need to

00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,309
remember that one when I'm in real life

00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:14,770
again with other humans not just my cat

00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:16,960
so number three have as much visibility

00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:18,429
as if you were in the office do you say

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,350
hello to your team when you walk by

00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:21,970
their desk in the morning drop a good

00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:24,110
morning message and slack to say hi to

00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,250
your remote teammates too so

00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,660
people even let us know when they

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:28,130
stepped away from their keyboards for

00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,450
lunch or when they're signing off for

00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,100
the day but it's not a hard and fast

00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,530
rule so there's no real pressure around

00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:35,420
it if you forget - we still have daily

00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,790
stand-ups and that's not just for agile

00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,530
teams so for those of you that aren't

00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,720
doing them most of you probably are but

00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,160
hosts stand-ups with your remote staff

00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,700
and on-site staff so you can kind of

00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,920
check out

00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,660
ok who's working from where today one of

00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,340
the priorities and really just kick

00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,710
start the day for your remote teammates

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,870
I know as a remote worker that's how I

00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:57,919
kind of felt like I was at work even

00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:59,750
though I was still in my own house this

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,580
is a fun one you can create a team

00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:03,710
working agreement that really sets those

00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,600
baseline expectations and understanding

00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,210
of how you're gonna do work together

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,220
remotely you can create this in a fun

00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:13,220
team bonding workshop using and design

00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,960
thinking process we came up with a fun

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,640
team name in ours called team rational

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,070
and reasonable we were working on a lot

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,440
of legacy code so that just kind of came

00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:23,750
up but you can discuss and decide things

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,809
like slack is great but when is it

00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:28,580
appropriate to use email maybe never we

00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:31,190
add conference links to every single

00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:32,840
meeting invite regardless if we know a

00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,100
remote team member is joining or not

00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,390
because you never know if someone's

00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,070
plans are gonna change and they're gonna

00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:40,190
work from home that day so just having

00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,270
that video call link already in the

00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,340
invite it just keeps things moving

00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,049
smoothly it doesn't feel like someone's

00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,690
inconveniencing you because they decided

00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:50,179
to call in another good one is if there

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:52,250
are more than 20 or 30 replies in slack

00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:54,980
thread just hop on a call and hash it

00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,299
out how do you get a hold of someone if

00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,610
something is urgent do you need their

00:25:56,299 --> 00:26:00,620
cell phone numbers and if you do have a

00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,330
company-wide policy just make sure that

00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,400
it's visible and well communicated to

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,919
your staff but I also recommend that

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,690
give your team that space to create a

00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:10,490
working culture that's unique and best

00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:14,299
for them to kind of get down into the

00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:16,460
nuances of these things so I have a

00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:20,090
recap of all of those tips available on

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:23,360
a link at bitly slash remote - tips on

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:25,040
medium which just has all of these tips

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,410
in a couple of others but the really big

00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,390
takeaways from today are remember you're

00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:31,850
collaborating you're not presenting in

00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:34,160
these working sessions be inclusive of

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:37,160
all your team members both remote and

00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,590
on-site always use video that one's a

00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,230
mess

00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,610
and this is a design thinking process so

00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:43,950
just know that in the end you're

00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:45,210
bringing all your entire team throughout

00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,540
that journey of designing something

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:51,080
together thank you and you can find me

00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,080
on the Internet

00:26:53,090 --> 00:27:00,250
