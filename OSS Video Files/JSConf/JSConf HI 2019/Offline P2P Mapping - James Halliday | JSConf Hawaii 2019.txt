all right I can actually the the Iraq

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,260
this is the first time in about thirty

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:21,900
years that Kilauea has stopped erupting

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:24,180
so alright so my talk is about offline

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,970
peer-to-peer mapping and some work that

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,899
I've been doing for I don't know four

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,439
years now

00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:33,600
geez it's been a long time so my slides

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,520
are online if you want to check them out

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,899
later I've got a lot of links at the end

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,530
so this is me I'm a member of bits co-op

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,390
we do consulting work as a worker owned

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,909
cooperative and I've been working with

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,480
this nonprofit NGO Digital democracy

00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:53,460
since 2015 or so building these

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,329
peer-to-peer mapping tools used by

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,699
indigenous communities so the groups

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,819
that I'm going to be focusing on are

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:06,930
based out of Guyana and Ecuador with

00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:08,880
Alianza Sabo in the Ecuador region of

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,090
the Amazon and also into Peru a little

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,509
bit here's a map of that just to give

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,270
you some idea so I also got the

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,540
opportunity to travel to Guyana to meet

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:27,869
some of the environmental monitoring

00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:29,549
team there and the mapping team so I'm

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:34,159
gonna start with some of the issues

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:37,920
facing the the wattage on communities

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:41,130
nations in Guyana in the South Rupununi

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,130
it's near Brazil so there's a huge

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:47,009
problem right there right now with gold

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:50,520
mining both illegal and also through

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,530
mining concessions so the environmental

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,850
monitoring team that we've been working

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:59,159
with has reported over 250 observations

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:03,020
of illegal activity or harmful activity

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,890
the mercury gets into the water supplies

00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:09,720
damage to cultural sites sacred sites

00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,340
deforestation there's a lot of problems

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,780
with this kind of extractive industry

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,340
and at here at the end over 50 percent

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,890
of those have been caused by this mining

00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,980
activity in the wattage on right now are

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,810
working

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,560
they're in talks with the government of

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,720
Guyana to push back against this

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,490
Canadian gold mining company that wants

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,510
to come in and mine

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:37,930
Rudy Mountain which is a site of

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:41,340
considerable cultural significance so

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:44,470
here's here's a quote from Ron James the

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,110
the sort of person who does a lot of

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:50,110
mapping work with ArcGIS and like lugs a

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:52,209
bunch of maps when he goes when he takes

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:56,320
the plane ride from Georgetown to let

00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:58,060
them and you know also is doing a lot of

00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,050
good work with plotters and that's

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,280
difficult on generator power and I'm

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,560
just gonna read this quote really fast

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,110
because I think it's important to quote

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,209
directly from our partners that we work

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,769
with so by mapping the mining pollution

00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,780
sources we now understand how it affects

00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:15,519
wider river systems and water supplies

00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:20,260
that are essential to our villages for

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,420
fishing bathing and drinking we're

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,950
bringing this monitoring information to

00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,209
the attention of the environmental and

00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,400
mining authorities yet the problem

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,500
continues unabated and to give you some

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,790
more idea of what we're talking about

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:36,360
here so this is a map of the whole map

00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:39,730
pretty much is the traditional

00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,390
territorial extent of the Whopper Chang

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,709
and the blue areas are formal titles

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:48,549
that have been granted by the government

00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:50,320
and down there in pink are the mining

00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:52,900
the existing mining concessions that

00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,030
they've had to deal with and Maruti

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,890
mountain where this new bout of gold

00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,220
mining that they're organizing to resist

00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:03,269
is in an area that the one of the

00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,709
communities in the middle I Shelton is

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:06,940
requested a territorial extension for it

00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:11,730
and it's you know it's it's a

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:14,440
complicated difficult political problem

00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,200
but importantly this work has been going

00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,989
on for a while since 2000 this

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,919
particular mapping effort so it's not I

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:25,510
think it's important for technologists

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,050
like me who want to work on these

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:30,760
projects that you're coming when

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,370
presence is requested for technical

00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,490
assistance and kind of just listening

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,080
and understand

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:45,580
and working with existing political

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:47,750
projects so the other another group that

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,970
digital democracy has been partnered

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:55,639
with is Alianza Sabo this is a group

00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:58,400
that operates out of Ecuador and the

00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,710
main problem for the Huaorani and also

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,930
the kafan and other groups in the area

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:07,370
is oil Maya is oil drilling and so

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,590
there's been drilling since about the

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,229
60s and it causes all kinds of problems

00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:15,949
as you can imagine like damage to

00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:17,750
ecosystems deforestation and the new

00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:19,910
concessions that are going in are for

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,410
block 22 and this is something that the

00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:26,000
Huaorani and other communities in

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:32,090
Alianza sabo and also neighboring areas

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:34,639
are trying very hard to resist and their

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,139
message is quite clear our message for

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,770
the oil companies our land is not for

00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:42,080
sale

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:43,550
and so here is a map that they put

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,130
together and I'm going to start to talk

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,020
about how this map was put together so

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,169
this map is really cool this is a map of

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,030
Huaorani traditional territory and here

00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:55,520
is a village this is an interactive map

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,349
that the Huaorani have chosen to publish

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,120
to share with the world hopefully to

00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:01,570
share with you you can see that there's

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,130
a lot going on in this map we've got

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:07,430
we've got the locations of important

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:11,419
plants for making thatched roof we've

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:13,430
got tapir tracks Jaguar tracks important

00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:17,530
medicinal plants here with a tree with

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:20,240
the plus where snakes sometimes occur

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:21,830
the locations of villages this one is

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,340
really cool you can't see it too well

00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,710
but that's a cell phone icon and so this

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,599
is a location where you can pick up a

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,060
cell phone signal maybe you have to hold

00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:33,979
it in the air or maybe you have to stand

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,330
on top of a car to get it but you can

00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:38,150
get it and that's really important

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,680
because if someone in the community gets

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,110
a snakebite and they don't have any

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,449
anti-venom then they can call for a

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,229
helicopter to come in and hopefully save

00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:48,080
someone's life

00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:49,759
so this map is

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,909
there's a link to it in the in the notes

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,830
it's you can see this is quite full of

00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:57,860
resources but if you look on a

00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:00,440
government map this area is empty they

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,750
don't put things like you know where

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,919
these important resources are on their

00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:08,240
maps and this gives the Huaorani and

00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,090
other groups an important bargaining

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,669
tool for talks with the government to

00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:16,340
stroh hey we are using this land for

00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:18,560
these important purposes and we don't

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:28,849
want this extractive industry to come in

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:31,159
and you know and harm us so for in terms

00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:34,780
of what technology is needed you know

00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:39,050
technology in itself is only a tool for

00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:41,389
informing these other processes like

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:43,219
local decision making like the community

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:46,539
needs to be well-informed to have

00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:50,569
meetings like not only with external

00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:53,029
parties like governments but also for

00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:57,110
just you know having good information

00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:58,819
about your territory part of that is

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,740
gathering evidence like with smartphones

00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:03,560
looking at the locations of oil spills

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:08,419
and things like that or mining like

00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:10,250
mercury equipment and also preserving

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:12,680
traditional knowledge is an important

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:16,340
component of this especially with the

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,050
older generation passing on and the

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,520
younger generation in many cases

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,409
unfortunately moving to the cities

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:25,219
without without learning these things so

00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:26,900
technology tools are useful for kind of

00:08:25,219 --> 00:08:31,940
preserving that knowledge before it

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:33,770
might be lost so there's two main

00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,539
components for these technology tools

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,159
there's the mapping components and then

00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:40,339
the environmental monitoring components

00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:44,180
so for the mapping tools loading

00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:46,670
satellite imagery so that people can you

00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,899
know trace our rivers and paths and the

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:53,449
locations the villages is pretty

00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:55,040
important and like I said paper maps are

00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:58,370
also a big important component of this

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,380
any maps that are made it's good to have

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,490
a hard copy because hard copies work

00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,899
very well offline

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,209
in these in these sorts of environments

00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:10,779
you can pass them out to families in the

00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:13,100
villages and you can also you know

00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:15,950
document the locations of important

00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:19,940
traditional medicines or important

00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:23,630
cultural cultural sites that's that sort

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:26,450
of thing so in in terms of environmental

00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:29,779
monitoring that might consist of taking

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:32,089
photos or taking video gathering GPS

00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:33,860
coordinates with GPS proper GPS devices

00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:36,260
and smart phones because the sensors

00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,140
aren't quite as good and also taking

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,480
like quick notes either sometimes via

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,470
text but often voices is a bit easier

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:47,240
when you're out doing the field work and

00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:52,010
some of the communities are also using

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:55,040
drones to do aerial surveys a big

00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:59,120
problem with this work which is sort of

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,620
what what I and what digital democracy

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,390
has been working on is kind of shoring

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,930
up the shortcomings with tools that are

00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:08,060
broadly available so tool professional

00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,850
GIS tools are quite difficult to learn

00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:13,399
the learning curve is very steep they're

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,290
generally not collaborative so you know

00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,990
you can't involve a whole community or

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:20,500
you can involve neighboring communities

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:24,320
in with a big group mapping project and

00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:27,290
very often there are poor online

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,180
assumptions like some of the drone the

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:32,600
drone imaging tools require an internet

00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:35,810
uplink for the purposes of you know

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,670
having a licensing tracker thingy and it

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:41,360
just doesn't really work very well if

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,730
you've got a really spotty solo signal

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,230
or if you have a satellite internet that

00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:50,000
has an aggressive cap so there's also

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,980
power sources are a big challenge so

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,190
most of the villages have solar panels

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:58,070
and like many of family homes have small

00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,839
solar panels or people often like use

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:01,970
their motorbike or they use their truck

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:06,079
to power like cell phones usually

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:09,650
sometimes small laptops internet access

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,870
is difficult it's quite expensive most

00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,480
of the villages like in Guyana have a

00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:17,139
village office that has a satellite

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,760
blink but they're they after you go over

00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:20,560
a certain point like 20 gigabytes it

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,300
just stops working completely so you

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,620
know if there's a new Android update

00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,600
available and all of the phone's

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,180
individually download the exact same

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,829
data maybe like 20 times then you've

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,990
spent your whole cap for the month so

00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:34,180
it's it's quite challenging working with

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:36,040
those sorts of constraints and also the

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,310
devices themselves have to be quite

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,339
durable you might drop your phone in a

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,899
river or ants are a huge problem we have

00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:46,570
this problem on the Big Island - ants

00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:48,279
love electronics they live to like get

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:52,990
in there and lay a bunch of eggs and

00:11:48,279 --> 00:12:00,339
I've had SDR card full of ants this

00:11:52,990 --> 00:12:02,019
happens quite often so these these tools

00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:03,970
have to work offline they have to be

00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:05,680
able to collect important information

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,329
and they have to be easy to learn and

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,100
that also means that they have to be

00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:11,980
easy to teach so these communities

00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,269
ideally should be teaching each other

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,660
they shouldn't have to rely on these

00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:19,060
external parties to kind of come in and

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,870
swoop in and and do things that that's

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:25,480
not a very good way to set up this this

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,920
sort of a project which is anti-colonial

00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,019
in nature so you really don't want to be

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,720
reproducing that kind of dynamic as much

00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:33,940
as possible and it's important too that

00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,670
the map presets are based on local

00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,319
knowledge so all of the maps in the

00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,029
Huaorani map that i just showed you were

00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:43,569
designed by the local community on paper

00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:46,959
and then a designer came in and made SVG

00:12:43,569 --> 00:12:47,829
versions of those so here's a great

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,769
quote from Tessa

00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:54,639
who's the monitoring coordinator in

00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:56,079
Guyana for the septa technology changes

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,519
every day and I'd like to learn more

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,930
about developing software and writing

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,310
commands because right now we are

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,069
dependent on people coming from the

00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,930
outside to do this for us

00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:06,540
it's kind of an important power

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:10,829
dimension to be aware of that

00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,829
technologists have these skills that

00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:18,880
that put us in a position of privilege

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,500
and power and it's important to point at

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,260
that and think about how to remedy it

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,720
and Tessa is great and she's already

00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,800
running Linux and learning programming

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,079
another important consideration with

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,959
this is that the data belongs to

00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,600
communities it's not the sort of we kind

00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:40,259
of have this idea of open data that can

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,970
be quite problematic if you're putting a

00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,589
sacred site on a map means that a bunch

00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:47,100
of vandals will show up which happens

00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:49,769
then or you know if you're pointing if

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,139
you're including the locations where

00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:55,829
gold can be found you certainly don't

00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:57,779
want to have a gold rush coming on to

00:13:55,829 --> 00:13:58,709
indigenous territory and causing all

00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:01,529
kinds of problems

00:13:58,709 --> 00:14:04,649
so it's important that the communities

00:14:01,529 --> 00:14:06,360
decide how their data is shared so as

00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:08,999
far as data transfer goes for these

00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,639
projects there's of course the internet

00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:12,990
but it has caps with satellite service

00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,399
or sometimes cell phone service and

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,509
sometimes the cell phone service is

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,249
using the satellite network or people

00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:23,129
might drive into like the next big town

00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:26,129
like in to let them or into a town

00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:28,110
that's on the road system in Ecuador USB

00:14:26,129 --> 00:14:30,899
drives are fantastic way to transfer

00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,699
data in these environments and our

00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,879
database our peer-to-peer database tools

00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:37,290
work really well with USB drives you

00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:39,809
might have a local offline router or

00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:42,179
Bluetooth or etc ADB is also a fantastic

00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:44,790
tool for communicating with an Android

00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:46,860
smartphone you can copy files and you

00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,449
can do a lot of you can run unix

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,509
commands on the phone so we've been

00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:53,819
using that a lot to install to install

00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:56,100
the software onto the devices okay so

00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:59,550
why given all of that background context

00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:02,850
why does peer-to-peer p2p makes sense

00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:05,279
for this kind of a problem space well

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:10,829
importantly there's no critical or

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:12,839
privileged devices so nothing that can't

00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:15,420
get lost in a river can't get covered in

00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,549
ants you know you have many devices

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,819
making writes offline and everybody

00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:22,649
every device has a backup and the

00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:24,089
devices can talk to each other in this

00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:27,629
kind of a network called the gossip

00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:30,809
network in order to transfer information

00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:31,879
you have implicit backups and it's it's

00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:36,600
pretty great

00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:39,120
so the tool that I've been working

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,600
partly on mostly in the database layer

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,180
is

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,430
called Matteo it's for desktop and

00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,410
mobile it uses ID editor which is a tool

00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,870
for OpenStreetMap and so the data model

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,880
for OpenStreetMap is used in ID editor

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,540
and we have some glares iOS and p2p DB

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,769
that use peer-to-peer techniques so just

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,870
to give you a quick idea of what that

00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:03,449
looks like here's a just a quick

00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:05,220
screenshot of the tool to make an

00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:07,290
offline peer-to-peer network you can use

00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,930
this thing called a CAPA architecture

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,279
that's where you have an append-only log

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,440
tools like git have this sort of

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,910
structure internally also and you build

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,790
materialized views on top of that log

00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:19,860
things that might be like a key value

00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:23,250
store or a spatial index for mapping

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,930
data we use the Open Street Map model

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,029
because a lot of the tools are based on

00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,980
that so it has nose nodes ways and

00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:31,500
relations and here's some examples of

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,540
that we do have to kind of change this

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,490
model a little bit so for example IDs

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:39,240
you can't monotonically increase IDs

00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,980
because two devices might try to create

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,139
the same ID so what you can do is

00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:47,189
generate very long cryptographically

00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:49,230
random IDs instead for that versions

00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:51,990
also have a similar problem so you can

00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,750
use the hash of the previous document or

00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,490
you can use the location in a in a

00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:59,459
vector clock like the sequence number in

00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:02,639
your version entries and with this few

00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:06,030
small changes like this you can build

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,829
these kind of networks so awesome pizza

00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,199
P was our first iteration it uses an

00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:11,939
appendant log based on this tool NPM

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,850
module called hyper log and we have some

00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:16,500
materialized views for a KB store a join

00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:18,780
model that kind of lets you deal with

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:23,819
more normalized data like osm data is

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:26,189
and spatial index that kdb tree the

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,260
thing is with peer to peer with this

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:30,690
kind of gossip network right performance

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,299
is actually very important because every

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,250
time that two devices sync up you have

00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:37,710
to write all of the records in and we

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:40,350
got to the point where with one of the

00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:42,809
prototypes it was taking 15 minutes to

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:45,690
sync a database with about a quarter

00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:48,299
million records on it and so for the the

00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,850
new version that's right performance has

00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,980
been really important and here's some of

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:57,110
the components in the new

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:59,570
version other future applications

00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:01,549
include building unordered materialized

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:03,590
views so things that were kind of out of

00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:06,160
order because that's useful if you need

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:09,200
to use encryption to kind of have a

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,059
sharing model that where you might want

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,710
to also have remote backups and not

00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:15,919
necessarily share that information with

00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,240
the whole public so here in the in the

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,549
slide notes I'm gonna skip over this

00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,200
real quick but have just a quick example

00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:24,080
of like how you can build this kind of a

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,110
key value materialized view if you're

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,429
interested and it's important to think

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:30,799
of it in terms of like you might think

00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:32,660
about it get repo where you can have

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:37,120
Forks of the data and then also tools

00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:40,520
for merging the content back into place

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,780
spatial index are a big part of this

00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,740
work because they have to work really

00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,880
fast have to work really well offline

00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,520
everything that we've done is built on

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:55,250
the debt project tools like hyper core

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:59,870
and random access storage modules and as

00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:01,520
far as future work goes the sparse

00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,230
replication is also a big element of

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:07,040
this because as these databases grow

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:11,660
then you can't store the entire database

00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:13,669
on a single device so as far as future

00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,280
work goes we've also recently got a

00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:19,850
grant for this other related project

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:22,730
called peer maps and this is matéo the

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:25,400
tool also got a 50k grant from Samsung

00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:28,580
so get to work on this more full time

00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,230
and as far as the database go as far as

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:36,020
the project goes this is more of a tool

00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:37,790
for building something that can take in

00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,770
all of the planet awesome the

00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,210
OpenStreetMap data and kind of

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,040
distributed over these peer-to-peer

00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:46,429
networks in a way that's also going to

00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,350
benefit the mapping work with matéo

00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:51,350
because a lot of the core components are

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,970
the same so and this is just a great

00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:55,160
quote I wanted to end on this is from

00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,980
Opie our mapping coordinator I just want

00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:00,380
to read it really fast we wrote you why

00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,059
Ronnie like my pay oh because it is an

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,400
open program and it's not too difficult

00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:05,600
to learn it's been really helpful to us

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,190
to allow us to manage or

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,020
mapping program and for the first time

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,090
people in all the villages including the

00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,400
local technicians but also even the

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,169
elders who don't speak Spanish or know

00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,390
how to read have been able to understand

00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:19,490
it it is also the first program we've

00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:21,200
ever seen where we can use our own icons

00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,789
for things and for it to be in our own

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,280
language rather than in English or

00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:26,900
Spanish with Matteo we have for the

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,730
first time a tool that we can use to

00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,140
make our own maps and we can build a

00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,360
strong team of people who can train

00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,190
others to map the mapping project has

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,470
United many villages to defend and

00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:38,600
manage their lands together and it is a

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,400
process which is leaving a legacy for

00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,440
the future both the maps and the skills

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,549
that our people can use to fight for our

00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:48,200
livelihoods and our rights and I have a

00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:52,100
bunch of links if you're interested in

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,960
more of the projects and also in some of

00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,450
the activism here locally on Hawaii

00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,280
that's indigenous life thank you very

00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:02,280
much

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,280
