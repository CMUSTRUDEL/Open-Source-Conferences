Publication date: 2019-06-24
Playlist: JSConf HI 2019
Description: 
	Jessica Lord tells the story of how Electron was spun out of the Atom editor project, and how she worked through skepticism about the role of Electron in the developer ecosystem and eventually built up a team and engineered a community around it.

yeah I'm Jessica Lord I'm an engineer

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,339
I'm based in New York I'm really excited

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,410
to be here I've never been here before

00:00:13,339 --> 00:00:18,270
and I'm really excited to have the

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,220
opportunity to give this talk I'm not

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:22,220
going to talk about how electron works

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,849
or how to use it I'm gonna talk about

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:29,010
how it even came to be I guess and so

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,750
first I want to say what electron is

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,759
some of you may already know you've

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,860
either decided you love it or you hate

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,219
it and so for those of you who have not

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,690
decided if you love it or you hate it

00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:42,540
electron is an open source library built

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,910
at github that combines node and chrome

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,180
into a single environment so that you

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:50,039
can use web technology like HTML CSS to

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:55,350
build desktop apps that will run on Mac

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,969
or Windows or Linux okay so when we

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:03,229
start this story we go all the way back

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:05,759
to 2015 so long ago but actually

00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:08,430
electron which at this point was called

00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:10,619
atom shell was about two years old at

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,380
this point so electron is like six years

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,130
old now an atom was even older atom

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:20,160
github github text editor was even older

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:23,190
so it's 2015 and I was working at github

00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,080
and I had just moved on to the atom team

00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:29,250
and I moved on to the atom team because

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,720
I wanted to write more JavaScript and I

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,759
moved on to that team to do more

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,520
JavaScript not because I had any idea

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,170
about desktop applications or what the

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,030
woes were of someone who had tried to

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,090
build a desktop application before I'd

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,920
never ever considered what's the desktop

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,610
application how are people making them

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,800
how do they usually make them and the

00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,130
reality was that native desktop

00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,720
applications typically meant if you

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,069
wanted them to work on every operating

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,619
system you might have to have three

00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:01,860
separate teams building three separate

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,629
apps to work for all of your users and

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,310
that's a lot of resources so you

00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:07,170
actually may not be supporting all of

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,170
the platforms you may be only supporting

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:17,980
one or two and that had been the reality

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:27,580
of building desktop applications Oh No

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:30,160
okay not great okay there we are all

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,450
right so I was on the atom team and I

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,390
was there cuz I was pumped because I was

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:37,230
going to write JavaScript more and the

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:40,150
more I on boarded to the team and

00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,830
learned about how Adam worked I learned

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,230
about Adams shell and that it was

00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:46,330
actually pretty special that Adam was a

00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:47,950
desktop app that worked on three

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,319
operating systems and that it was

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,110
because of Adams shell that I could do

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,180
all of this and I thought that was

00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,450
pretty special I think Adams great I

00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:01,120
still use Adam but as a text editor and

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:02,620
there's other text editors and Adam

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,360
shell was doing something that nothing

00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,910
else really did and I felt like it was

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:11,769
doing something that was potentially

00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:14,950
really empowering and so I learned more

00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:17,079
about how the team arrived there earlier

00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:19,060
on in Adams days they had sort of done

00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:20,560
some shopping for libraries because

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,709
there had been this vision for building

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,410
the desktop app Adam it's when there was

00:03:23,709 --> 00:03:29,700
chromium embedded framework but this is

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,959
this is my Goldilocks illustration

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,410
chromium embedded framework wasn't too

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:38,319
heavy it was all of Chrome in wjs didn't

00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:42,370
embed node in a way that was as seamless

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,290
as it could be and the developers on the

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,380
atom team at that time we're talking to

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:50,380
people on nwj s and they met Chang zc

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,959
Ben's on github and they really shared

00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:55,660
this vision of this other more perfect

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,690
bowl of porridge which could be Adams

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:02,019
shell and so github contracted Chang and

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:04,180
he started building Adams show and get

00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:06,910
in Chang eventually joined github

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,450
full-time and that was kind of the state

00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,760
of things

00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,730
Adams shell was a dependency of Adam

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,359
maintained by one person meaning it had

00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:18,280
a bus factor of one so if anything

00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:22,150
happened to Chang it would be really bad

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,700
and and it was just kind of hidden there

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,970
as a dependency of Adam there was no

00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:31,180
plan for it and just one person taking

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,880
care of it and so there were already

00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,490
people

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,220
in this space wanting to build desktop

00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:40,820
apps with web technology and so slack

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,410
and Microsoft were looking at this and

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
so if you already were in the headspace

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,650
you were already searching for a

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,010
solution you and maybe already tried n

00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:51,200
wjs to you at least knew enough to

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,060
question like oh how is Adam doing this

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,740
and then you could go into that Adam org

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,310
on github and ruffle through all of the

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,470
repositories and then you would find

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,450
Adam shell and you'd be like oh this is

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,090
how Adam is doing it but that was kind

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:08,290
of the only way to know what was

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:11,090
happening until Microsoft did that and

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,490
Microsoft built an editor called vs code

00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:18,500
which is like an editor just like Adam

00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:21,620
but so they were going to launch vs code

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,870
and we knew about that on the adam team

00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:26,120
and we thought it would be pretty silly

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,700
for them to launch a new text editor and

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,910
say that it was built on adam's shell

00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,370
there was no reason for it to reference

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,800
another text editor and because you

00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,620
could build anything with adam shell it

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,950
just then at that point seemed really

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:48,140
silly for whatever people built with it

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:51,170
to be tied in name to Adam so vs code

00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:59,690
was the impetus to name adam shell

00:05:51,170 --> 00:06:03,740
electron which is a part of it wasn't a

00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:06,050
lot of thinking behind it but but i

00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,600
honestly was pumped I'm like see people

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:11,240
are using this like let's do some stuff

00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,980
like electrons awesome and I thought

00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,870
this was going to be the kicking off

00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:19,040
point and so in our team meetings and

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,600
our mini summits

00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,070
I was the person when they were like

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,440
okay what's on our roadmap and I was

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,060
like electron stuff electron stuff let's

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,190
do something electron like let's put

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:32,990
resources into electron we really need

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:37,700
to not ignore this and I was probably

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:43,310
annoying but I was told electrons not

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:45,380
important which is wrong that no one

00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,960
will work on electron

00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:53,320
so wrong and if I want to work on

00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:54,610
electron I should use my weekends rude

00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:06,020
[Applause]

00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:09,560
very busy so the thing is I persisted hi

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,810
I researched the space the usage the

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,210
people that were working on electron and

00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:17,120
using electron what was missing what we

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:21,340
really needed and so I started building

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:25,010
roadmaps and I just kept pushing and

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:27,190
eventually I got my 40 hours to spend on

00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,690
electron

00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:32,600
still on the atom team as a person on

00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:36,950
the atom team but who could just work on

00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:40,430
electron and so inside of the github org

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:44,170
what was to my benefit was that really

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:47,120
you only care about github com

00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:48,800
everything else is kind of outside the

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,450
scope a little bit like there's the

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,410
world of desktop apps there's the github

00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:56,690
desktop app and there's atom and then

00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:58,580
down trailing atom would be electron so

00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,500
I got to be in this kind of special

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:04,280
position that I was a little bit out of

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:08,750
the way out of sight not too many people

00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:11,450
bothered me so that's why I got to say

00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:18,590
first things first documentation which

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:20,690
never happens and let's see if I can get

00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:23,510
this to work without no I can't I'll

00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:26,060
just keep going this way so I started

00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,190
with documentation and I also started

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,950
with a static site because static sites

00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,599
are great and maybe you only need a

00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:34,849
static site and use your google jam

00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,250
stack and learn more about how you

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,590
probably just need a static site I use

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:43,550
Jekyll because it was github and github

00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:46,790
pages supports Jekyll out of the box and

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:48,590
so luckily Chang had written a bunch of

00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:52,730
documentation already and I went through

00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:55,730
all of that edited it made it consistent

00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:59,250
language and then I made a standard for

00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:01,620
the markdown semantics for it

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,540
and it was really important to me to

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,579
have a single source of truth the

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,610
electron Doc's lived in the electron

00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:11,040
repo and everyone gets a copy if you

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:14,310
fork or clone or download electron you

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,550
get a copy of the docs it's really great

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:20,699
when the docs live in the source try and

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:23,069
do that and their markdown they're not

00:09:20,699 --> 00:09:26,850
in some other language that requires an

00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:29,370
ePub book thing software they're in

00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:33,660
markdown they render on github people

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:36,899
have heard of markdown and so I made a

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:40,589
style guide that literally tells you

00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:43,920
like how many how many h1 headers there

00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:47,610
should be one on a page of documentation

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,500
and it goes on to say exactly how we

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,980
would describe what a method would be

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,230
and what an event would be and how to

00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,089
represent these things and markdown and

00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,750
it was important to have this be

00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:04,410
consistent not only for the end users

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:09,689
but so that we could target it with CSS

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:12,120
later so we have a Jekyll site and we

00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:15,360
have a folder of markdown Doc's on in

00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,059
the repo so I never managed to learn

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,610
Ruby at github so I wrote a bunch of

00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:25,079
note scripts inside of my Jekyll file to

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:27,540
stream out that Doc's folder oh yeah

00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:28,439
sorry backing up every electron release

00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,480
is a tarball

00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:33,029
and because the code or the

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,980
documentation is inside the repo every

00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:36,059
electron release contains that versions

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,329
Docs

00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:41,550
so I wrote the note scripts to stream

00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:44,879
out that doc folder and then basically

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:48,120
pops out the version number and things

00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,559
like bread crumb information file name

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,629
information and all of this stuff so

00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:53,490
that I could then generate the front

00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:57,509
matter that Jekyll wants on the top of

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:59,990
its pages so that we would end up with a

00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:02,430
site that would have really nice-looking

00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,730
Doc's with information like the

00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:09,329
breadcrumbs and the version and then

00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:11,939
another part of making the standard for

00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:13,020
how we were going to do documentation

00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:15,060
was also saying

00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,220
that all of the API Doc's are gonna have

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,370
a single line at the top that just tell

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,080
you in one sentence what this is so that

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,330
you don't land on a page with a sea of

00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,190
text and you can just figure out our am

00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:29,160
I even in the right place to begin with

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:31,590
and then part of working with electron

00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,930
is that there are two processes main and

00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,780
renderer and that's important and it's

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,850
different than other libraries and so

00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,770
it's also at the top of the

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:44,490
documentation here so that you can know

00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:48,450
that you're in the right place alright

00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:52,070
so again making being really concerned

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:54,990
about how we were using markdown to

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,730
document the code was also knowing that

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,200
it was going to end up on this website

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:03,300
so that we could do things like target

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,190
elements like that some API is an

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,040
electron work only on Mac or they work

00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,630
only on Windows and so knowing that it

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,400
was going to be on the site we can use

00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:15,930
the CSS to make it a little bit better

00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:17,700
and make these things look like tags but

00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:20,100
it's also important when you're thinking

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,130
about that to not forsake the original

00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:25,230
markdown don't do something so wild that

00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:27,420
it then becomes unreadable and markdown

00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,430
I wanted it to still be readable and

00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:32,700
markdown but also something I could

00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:36,240
target and improve with styles on the

00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:39,450
website so that was the first thing and

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,060
then the next thing was how to get

00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,440
people started on their very first

00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,140
electron app I wanted people to get

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,570
started quickly I wanted people to be

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,010
able to understand and also I didn't

00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,620
want to have a lot of extra work because

00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:55,410
I was maintaining him doing all this

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,540
stuff on my own and then I had my next

00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,760
kind of battle because I was still in

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,210
the atom team and still getting input

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,610
from people and Adam used to be in Ruby

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:07,110
actually before it was open sourced and

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:09,030
written in node and so a lot of people

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,740
on the team had come from that world and

00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:14,720
they were like there needs to be an

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:18,780
electron in it like a rails in it and I

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,330
typed rails in it before and you get a

00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,920
lot of folders and I didn't want that

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,620
experience for people coming into

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,890
electron I didn't want you

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,360
to run a command that generated a bunch

00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,790
of folders that you didn't understand

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,790
and you maybe didn't need half of them

00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:37,460
and the thing is there's nothing wrong

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:40,400
with an it scripts and scaffolding but

00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:42,470
it was wrong for electron-electron apps

00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,930
you could build a single app that it

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,750
runs in your menu bar and tells you the

00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:52,060
weather and is this big and you can also

00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:55,940
build slack so we could either build a

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,890
scaffolding system that prescribed one

00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,590
way to write electron apps which there

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:03,350
isn't or we could build a scaffolding

00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:05,300
system that supported every single

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,630
flavor and recipe of electron app

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,660
possible which is a lot of work so I

00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,680
felt like we would just no we weren't

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,410
gonna do that

00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:22,040
these are flags in an imaginary command

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:28,190
line scripts that just say no um luckily

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:30,380
I got my way and I got to do this

00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:33,740
version instead which is the electron

00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:36,890
Quick Start which is a bare-bones

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:40,880
electron app that you clone and then you

00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:45,700
npm install and npm run and it launches

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:48,350
a very bare-bones electron app and so

00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,450
for me i wanted it to be really simple i

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:54,440
want it to be a jumping-off point and

00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:57,140
not do too much but also let people know

00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,680
where they were so in this the dev tools

00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:02,570
opens up so as a web developer you're

00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,190
you can already orient to yourself it

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,170
looks like Chrome it looks like things

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:10,040
you're familiar with and then there's

00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:11,930
only a couple of electron API calls just

00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,840
to demonstrate what that is but other

00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:16,520
than that it is super simple and when

00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,100
you open it in your text editor you see

00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:22,430
an index.html file and you know what to

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,260
do with that and you can start you can

00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:28,640
start editing it and see the changes

00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:30,700
right away so developers developers

00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,700
developers

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:38,160
I prioritize the developers who did not

00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,830
realize what electron was and what they

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,780
could build with electron I did not care

00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,760
so much about the ones that were already

00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,500
building vias code and slack because

00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,810
they got it they were already in that

00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:51,990
headspace they were already looking for

00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:53,490
something like electron and I wanted the

00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,500
people who didn't yet know that they

00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:59,040
could do things with electron to know

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:02,940
and so the next thing I worked on was an

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,790
electron app that demos the electron API

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:09,810
so especially in the early days it was

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:11,760
still kind of confusing at what electron

00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,100
was to begin with it was Chrome and it

00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,650
was node and desktop apps and what do

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:21,270
people mean with native operating system

00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:23,070
and it was I felt like one of the big

00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:25,470
hurdles was still explaining to people

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:28,680
why you would use electron what you

00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:32,910
would do with it and so the API demo app

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,800
is an electron app that opens up you

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,570
download it you already get the sense of

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,430
like Oh an electron app is something my

00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,160
users would install like a normal app

00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:45,140
with icons and it's a very familiar flow

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:48,450
and then you open it up and you have a

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:51,300
left sidebar of common electron things

00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:54,270
like opening a new window printing a PDF

00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,790
and some of these common native things

00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:59,010
that you would use an electron and you

00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:00,930
get to demo them and actually interact

00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:03,060
with it and see like oh this is what

00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:06,060
they mean when they say system dialog

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,640
and start to get ideas and see what you

00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,920
can do with electron and a cool thing

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,280
about this app is that it's an electron

00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:18,990
app and the sample code is the actual

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:21,650
code so we can use the node API to fs

00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:24,839
read a file and then use the web api to

00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:27,150
say the text content of this element is

00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,760
what we just read from this file and so

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:31,950
in terms of maintaining the app when you

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,230
update the app the sample code is also

00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:38,610
updated it's not two things you have to

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:42,180
take care of so reoccurring theme is not

00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:45,750
giving yourself more work another thing

00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:49,200
is that this was a few years

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:51,810
and es6 was still really new and I'm

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,580
targeting developed like web developers

00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:58,260
who aren't using es6 everywhere and I

00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,730
didn't want to write just because I

00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,380
could I didn't want to write a bunch of

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,530
JavaScript that looks different to

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:06,450
people and but at the same time wanted

00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:09,420
to highlight that a feature of electron

00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:13,140
is that you get es6 out of the box and

00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,300
so the API demos app explains that there

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,700
are three bits of es6 that we're using

00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:20,160
and here's what they are it was constant

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:23,190
let each string templates that way

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,290
people are made aware educating them and

00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,450
also just not writing a bunch of

00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:30,780
different looking code because we can or

00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:35,610
it's the new cool thing cuz it's not

00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:37,560
about you also this app was built to

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,530
open up I wanted people to be able to

00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:44,820
split it open look at the insides and

00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:48,870
see how an electron app works and so all

00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:50,670
of the files and folders are thought

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,280
about so that they all relate so that

00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:57,540
you can open it up and you can find the

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,790
HTML view and the corresponding main and

00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:03,390
process main and renderer process files

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:05,040
that go along with it and then there's

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,410
documentation about that folder

00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,690
structure and diagramming of how this

00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,770
app actually runs from start to

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,830
beginning which is something I would

00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,930
love to see more often I want to know

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:22,190
like what happens when you run this what

00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:26,190
happens first okay so I said that I was

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:28,200
prioritizing new developers that didn't

00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:30,000
already know what electron was but

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,960
doesn't mean I didn't care at all about

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,110
the people who are already contributing

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,540
electron really needed those people and

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,310
needed the electron community and create

00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:47,340
a space for this userland

00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:49,230
ecosystem to evolve because electron had

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,880
been built for atom it had the features

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:53,120
that atom needed it didn't have the

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:58,960
features that a slack or a chat app

00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:01,779
needed and so it took it took those team

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,700
to contribute those features back to

00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:07,029
electron and that was really essential

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:09,820
for making electron better and making it

00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:12,279
have tons of features and api's that

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,899
atom would never come to on its own

00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:17,620
because they were never things that Adam

00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:22,110
was going to do and so there is a place

00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:25,360
on the site where it's huge now you can

00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:28,330
contribute your electron app and the

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,159
goal was to help people find each other

00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,809
so people writing electron apps could

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,480
find other people writing electron apps

00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:36,039
and hopefully some of them were open

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,580
source and people could learn from each

00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:42,940
other and then there's userland which

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,890
has all the stuff that the users have

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,730
built which makes sense for people to do

00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:50,770
like building a react specific Wow five

00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:54,720
minutes okay

00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:59,020
a react specific tool for starting

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,929
electron apps with react so then

00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:04,029
eventually one more atom person came

00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:06,549
over to electron we got head count to

00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:11,679
hire one more person there were four of

00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:14,110
us we got to God electron to its 1.0 we

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,120
moved it all out of the atom org

00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:23,590
it got its own org we had our own

00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:27,370
meetings and it was really real and then

00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:31,600
like Mary Poppins I went on my way for

00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:37,360
greener pastures I wanted to work with

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:38,830
more women if I'm real so the electron

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,120
team is great now it's a lot different

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:46,090
but anyways that was my own thing so

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,490
final thoughts and why I thought any of

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:53,380
this was maybe worth talking about is

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:56,020
that community engineering is something

00:21:53,380 --> 00:22:00,370
I when I look back at what I was working

00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:02,350
on then and kind of what it would be

00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:05,320
called now or what I was doing at all I

00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:09,700
think of it as community engineering and

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:11,430
actually now I've seen ipfs do a job

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,620
posting for community engineer

00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:18,150
ghin shiver at glitch is a community

00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:22,290
engineer and and community engineering

00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:23,820
is a thing and I think it's great and my

00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,430
background in the urban design and

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,410
architecture I think is not so different

00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:31,290
to why I found all of this work really

00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:34,070
satisfying because it's about helping or

00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:37,710
it's about how people understand and

00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:42,060
experience a system and building tools

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,890
that put new developers first electrons

00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:45,720
situation was also really different and

00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:48,840
I think that worked to its advantage it

00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,780
wasn't like Adam it wasn't Adam was

00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,060
github vision and an internal vision

00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:56,600
that had been shaped and cared about for

00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,650
a really really long time and so

00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,260
electron didn't have that electron

00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:03,360
wasn't planned it was off kind of to the

00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,210
side and all of that worked out really

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,680
great for electron and electron got to

00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,570
be in this really unique position where

00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,210
it was an open source project that

00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:14,340
really responded to the community the

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:16,860
community is who had cared about because

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:21,320
there wasn't there wasn't this internal

00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:25,290
github vision like there was for Adam

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:27,810
one day though electron will be gone and

00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:30,840
it should be because it should be the

00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:35,640
stepping stone to the next thing and if

00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:37,560
you hate electron and CPU usage you

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,040
should hate more if nothing ever

00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:42,480
replaces it because that's the problem

00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,520
but it should be replaced and something

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,690
better should come along and I also hope

00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,510
that our current ideas about

00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:52,020
documentation and talking about code

00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:55,800
will be gone too another thing I did

00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:58,470
outside of like my official electron

00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,660
capacity was challenging myself to try

00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:04,020
to explain electron in the simplest

00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:07,230
terms as I could and so I created the

00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:09,930
site essential electron with the

00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:12,180
limitations of each section has to be

00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:14,700
two to three sentences it can't use

00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:18,060
jargon if there's industry terms I can't

00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:20,640
avoid they're defined below and there's

00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:24,570
links on the bottom of each section for

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,730
more information and I just want to

00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:29,429
- I love that people are doing more

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,960
illustrations and diagrams and I just

00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:33,630
hope that keeps growing and we change

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,789
the way we talk about code and and who

00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:43,110
we assume is reading our documentation

00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:46,230
and so in general I hope that you see

00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:48,000
ways to scale down and actually give

00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:54,889
yourself less work so that you can focus

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,889
on people and yeah I guess that's it

00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:03,880
