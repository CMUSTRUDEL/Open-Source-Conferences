	00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:11,759
all right so I am going to be talking

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,080
how to make your website not ugly which

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,890
I think everyone can agree is a good

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,570
thing yeah okay all right so a little

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,919
bit about me I'm a former journalist I

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,710
know there's actually a lot of former

00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:27,390
journalists here think okay yeah I was

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,130
kind of expecting some noise and I had a

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,630
stint as a print designer I've started

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,120
doing a little bit of web design but my

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,930
background is primarily as a software

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,519
developer ten-forward consulting and

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,129
medicine I also have a second to

00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:42,600
somebody we have some Guinan stickers

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,520
because we're named for the bar in the

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,329
enterprise so if anybody wants the

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,500
guidance sticker come find me afterwards

00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:51,390
ten-forward we primarily work with

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,390
startups so a lot of times they don't

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,480
have a budget for a designer or for us

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,649
to do any kind of in-house design and so

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,390
this talk kind of originated because

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:01,620
there was a lot of stuff that I knew we

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,179
should be doing but we didn't have

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,559
anyone who had the existing knowledge so

00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,619
I kind of had to figure it out myself

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,570
and then fun fact I read the second book

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,780
of the storm white archives in one day

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,670
if anybody's a Brandon Sanderson fan

00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:18,000
yeah it's a thousand eighty eight pages

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,200
I took a day off of work when I got it

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,050
because I knew I wouldn't be able to put

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:30,030
it down all right so we're gonna look at

00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:34,050
a real website from 1996 Rae right

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,989
pretty attractive this is a senator's

00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,369
website by the way this isn't just like

00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:41,899
some kid in their basement like I was

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:44,489
making a terrible website this is like a

00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:51,030
congressional website so who thinks that

00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:53,160
this is well-designed okay okay I made

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,910
this this look is kind of like coming

00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,170
back a little bit god forbid but right I

00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,119
mean most of us look at this and we

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,160
realize yeah this could probably be

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,840
improved so the point of that is you

00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,580
know more than you think you do right so

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,020
even if you don't have any design

00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,119
experience or when consider yourself

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,709
creative you can at least recognize when

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,590
something could be improved or when it's

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:16,260
when it's really not working but why do

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,409
we care right doesn't it matter more

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,630
that what we're building works well so

00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:24,970
usability is a big one

00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,530
it doesn't really matter if everything

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,220
works well if people don't know how to

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,640
find it

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,070
right credibility is another big one so

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,080
there's a study from Stanford University

00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,580
they had ten different categories and

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,700
they asked people to rank the categories

00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:43,890
by which one they felt gave them the

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:47,380
most trust in a website on first visit

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:49,740
46% of people said the visual design was

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:53,340
the most important that was the the

00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:56,800
category that had the most votes

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,690
functionality was only 8% so especially

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,710
when we're first coming to his site we

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,180
don't really care how it works is we

00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,830
haven't gotten there yet we want to know

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,760
we want to be able to trust the website

00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:08,980
and then interest is the last one so

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,590
this varies really widely depending on

00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:14,350
what study you look at but it seems that

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,750
it's from about 10 seconds to 50

00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,160
milliseconds is how long we have to

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,010
convince someone to stay on the site

00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,620
before they bounce so maybe you're

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:27,150
thinking okay I'll buy it I'm listening

00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:29,650
see we have to say disclaimer of course

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,670
there are always exceptions right so

00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,860
everything I'm going to talk about today

00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,020
are sort of broad guidelines depending

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,960
on the site or applications target

00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:40,210
demographics the intended use you know

00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,550
these are not going to necessarily apply

00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,710
but they found in Sonya sonoran group

00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,630
does a ton with UX and they revisited

00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,820
some of their major findings from like

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,320
ten years ago twenty years ago to see

00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,330
does is this still truth Suzy still

00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,040
holed up and they found that usability

00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,250
guidelines tend to be very durable so

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,950
the idea being that design trends and

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:02,050
patterns definitely change over time but

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,000
human behavior does not as anyone who

00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:07,990
has dated an ill-suited partner knows

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,070
all too well so a lot to cover I'm going

00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,060
to speak pretty fast because I have a

00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,760
lot of things I want to get out and I

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,190
don't have a ton of time but you can

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,549
follow along I have my slides up online

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,120
and I'll have a link at the bottom and

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:23,170
I'll have it later

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,080
so yeah all right so first we're going

00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:28,360
to look at words and how we think about

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,100
text as like a visual element then

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,330
images when do we use them what kind do

00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,910
we use how do we use them in the right

00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,080
way and then design as kind of an

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,920
overall picture how do we think about

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,960
design from a lot

00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:43,150
Cole perspective alright first we want

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,650
to make speech visual so there was his

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:49,900
28 2008 eye tracking study and they

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:53,290
found that visitors only read 20% of

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:56,200
text context on content on average so

00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:58,110
how can we improve that first we want to

00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,550
make sure that our text can breathe so

00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,870
lengths again depending on what study

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:05,970
you look at there's a lot of different

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:09,880
opinions about this but broadly speaking

00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,590
people prefer my links that are shorter

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,930
so 50 60 characters per line but they

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:15,610
actually read faster at longer links so

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,500
the New York Times for example which I

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:18,760
use them for a lot of examples in here I

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,860
mean they're a site that's literally

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,800
meant for people to be reading giant

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:28,060
blocks of text and they keep their line

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,010
length at right around like 75 so kind

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,720
of anywhere between 60 and 100 is fine

00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,520
again depending on what part of a site

00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,320
it is but going longer than 100 people

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,470
start to they don't follow all the way

00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,510
to the end of the line line height we

00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,330
usually do about 1.4 again this depends

00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:46,780
on what your typeface is this is not 1.4

00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:49,090
pixels or EMS it's 1.4 times the font

00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,620
size of the element and that tends to

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,260
you know again generally speaking that

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,820
works really well and then padding so we

00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,290
do at least like 15 pixels because

00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,420
especially if you have like columns of

00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,910
text if the columns are too close people

00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,200
just read straight across if they're too

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,730
far away people get to the end they

00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,500
don't know where they're supposed to go

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,390
next so just making sure that you have

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,610
ample space around your text so that it

00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:12,730
it's easy to follow the flow of what

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:15,790
you're trying to do so here's an example

00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:17,590
of maybe not how to do it but you know

00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,660
the lines are really close together you

00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:21,210
can see that the text from the different

00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:25,300
lines are actually touching each other

00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:26,410
it's really wide I just look at this and

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,960
I immediately want to go check out

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,190
something else and here's how they

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,370
actually do it so this again is from The

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:36,010
Times so there's plenty of spacing but

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:38,680
it doesn't feel like there are gaps we

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,790
can see that long column of white on the

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,680
side we're going to talk about that a

00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,370
little bit later but like white spaces

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,450
your friend

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:49,960
it is not wasted all right and then it

00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:51,700
has to be legible so contrast

00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,830
there's a great website that I always

00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:57,040
check all of my color combinations on

00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:58,630
its web a morgue they have a contrast

00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,700
checker and it checks with the wk

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,590
standard so making sure that it's it's

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,150
compliant with accessible standards and

00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,830
this is important because just because

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:08,230
you can read something doesn't mean that

00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,750
everyone can read it right I think about

00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:13,540
1 in 10 people in the US have some kind

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:16,930
of disability and that's a lot of people

00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,520
and so a very easy way to make it easier

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,560
for folks to consume your content is to

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,070
just make sure that it's the contrast is

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,920
good size 16 pixel is as a browser

00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,840
default for a reason especially as we

00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,030
have an aging population who maybe is

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,230
having you know vision issues like it's

00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,850
really important that your text is not

00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:36,790
too small and again this depends on the

00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,710
type face so we just redesigned we're

00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:40,900
redesigning our site and some of our

00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,790
text we actually put the default at 20

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:47,110
because it just tends to be a smaller

00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:51,520
more condensed typeface so who can read

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:55,990
this oh come on

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:59,470
I want your eyesight and I clearly could

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:01,120
not read that and then we've here right

00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,980
and this still would not pass those

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,720
those standards for accessibility but

00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:10,540
it's way better all right so then we

00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,370
want to make our text scannable so like

00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,050
we said earlier that study from 2008

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:18,400
people only read about 20% of text

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:21,460
content we lose people very quickly when

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,040
it's a text heavy page and so making

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,680
sure that they are able to scan through

00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,090
everything will allow us to keep people

00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,870
longer and I'm going to talk about this

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,940
a little bit later in the presentation

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,890
some ways to do this highlight the key

00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,180
content using subheads

00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,030
and this I thought was really

00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:39,070
interesting we actually read faster when

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,930
text has a mix of uppercase and

00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,640
lowercase letters and it's not because

00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:45,010
that inherently is easier to read we're

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,420
just trained to read that and so when we

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:48,670
see all caps are all lowercase it

00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,720
actually takes us you know split seconds

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,540
longer to be able to process that

00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,960
content well it would list another great

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:58,120
way to do it so this is the site where I

00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,610
just kind of stripped out a lot of their

00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,470
styling and if I come here I just see a

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,430
giant block of text I don't really know

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,050
what it's about

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:06,970
I have to I know that I have to invest

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:08,379
at least a few minutes to figure out

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,420
what they're even talking about to see

00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:11,800
if I'm interested in it and this is what

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,259
it actually looks like so we can see

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,910
it's very clear what the title is right

00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:17,350
that grabs my attention immediately

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,600
they have keywords at the top so I can

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,899
look at the keywords and see okay am i

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,339
interested in this is this worth my time

00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,050
they pull out the first paragraph and

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:28,180
make it bigger they have sub heads so

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,980
maybe I see okay I know a little bit

00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,089
about people scanning websites but maybe

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,439
there's something new in here that I

00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:34,089
don't know about so I'm gonna skim

00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:35,649
through the sub heads see if one catches

00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:36,939
my eye oh I didn't know about you know

00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:41,379
this new study let me read that

00:09:36,939 --> 00:09:44,649
paragraph all right keep decoration to a

00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:47,889
minimum so this is something that I

00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:49,839
think is is it's more attempting to not

00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:51,009
do this as there are so many different

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,189
you know like google fonts or so many

00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:56,500
different free typefaces that we can use

00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:57,699
and it's it's easy especially for like

00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,439
clients that we work with to be like oh

00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:04,449
we want like six different typefaces

00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:06,009
no not gonna do that and here's why we

00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:08,019
usually pick like two or three so maybe

00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:09,550
we have one typeface that's dedicated to

00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:12,660
our headers and sub headers and one

00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:15,519
that's for body text color is again so

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,040
two to three and the reason for this is

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,019
because when you have too many typefaces

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,819
or too many colors our brain

00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:24,069
instinctively assumes that it's an ad

00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:26,110
and we just completely skip that we

00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:29,500
don't even look at that content we just

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:31,269
skip it completely so again kind of

00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,620
using more complex fonts or typefaces

00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:34,120
for the headers where the text is

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,589
probably bigger and then your simpler

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,949
ones for the body text which is probably

00:10:35,589 --> 00:10:41,230
going to be a little bit smaller so I'm

00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:42,370
not making fun of this website and

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,230
actually felt much better

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,699
about using this example in this

00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:47,920
presentation because I saw that they

00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:49,750
redesigned it and it's much better now

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,350
but this is what it used to look like

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:54,430
and when I look at that site right first

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,809
of all I don't know where to go because

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,910
there's a lot of different elements that

00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:59,920
are competing for my attention the nav

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,809
isn't kind of an unusual spot that's not

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,689
where I would instinctively go to look

00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:06,129
for navigation I assumed that all of

00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:07,000
those squares at the bottom were ads

00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:08,649
because they all have different

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,899
typefaces the colors are all different

00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:12,730
font sizes all different and those are

00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:15,630
actually just like pages on this site

00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:16,720
there like programs that the church has

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,370
so

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,629
this is a better example like every time

00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:24,129
that I go to this slide I just kind of

00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:25,930
like yes this is just nice it's very

00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:28,050
clear the navigation is where I expect

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,879
it to be it's clear what page I'm on I

00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:33,189
know what pattern I know at a glance

00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,930
what pattern this site is using to

00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:36,850
disseminate information and a big thing

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:38,290
that I'm going to talk about is how you

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,660
want to make people learn one pattern

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:42,670
and stick to it right we want to make

00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:47,050
using our application or website as

00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:48,910
painless as possible okay we recap quick

00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:51,160
so we want to think about speech as a

00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,389
visual element within a website or

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,160
application so give it plenty of

00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:56,379
breathing room make sure it's legible

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,730
make it scannable so that people can

00:11:56,379 --> 00:11:59,800
skip around to what they're interested

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,519
in and keep it simple not so many colors

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,550
or too many typefaces alright

00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,569
we want to use our images appropriately

00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,129
and early I don't think there's any

00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:13,000
situation where this image is not

00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:17,709
appropriate but that's another

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,480
conversation so icons a company that's

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:22,059
actually called user testing which is a

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,209
little too on the nose but they studied

00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:27,279
190 icons in 2015 and they asked people

00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:28,569
what they asked people to predict what

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,149
would happen when they clicked on a

00:12:28,569 --> 00:12:33,519
particular icon so they found that if

00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:35,199
they gave them icons that were unique to

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,670
an application so for example Twitter

00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,980
has the little like feather thing that

00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:40,449
you click if you want to write a message

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,949
that one everybody knows but exempt you

00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:43,809
know icons like that that are unique to

00:12:41,949 --> 00:12:47,529
a specific application if they did have

00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:49,870
a label only 34% of people knew what it

00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:51,819
was going to do so that's like a third

00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,730
of people so 66 or some people guess

00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:57,670
wrong if they use more generic Universal

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,740
icons again without a label 60 percent

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,509
of people guess what it was going to do

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,430
correctly and if they put a label on

00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:05,259
those more generic icons than 80 percent

00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:09,100
of people got it right but that's still

00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:10,329
you know one-fifth people didn't know it

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,120
was going to happen when they click that

00:13:10,329 --> 00:13:17,800
icon so the idea is kind of there are

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:20,500
maybe three like truly Universal icons

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,059
it just doesn't exist and especially if

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,250
you have an application that is used by

00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:25,600
an international audience I mean you

00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,829
just you cannot assume that people know

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,829
what something is going to do

00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:34,209
so yeah labels are the rule not the

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,919
exception they work best often in a

00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:37,509
navigation or a menu setting that's kind

00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,329
of again where we expect them as well or

00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:42,309
if they're if you use them for

00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:43,839
decoration not as part of the actual

00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:46,149
like functionality and then avoiding

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,979
icons with conflicting meanings so I

00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:50,949
want everyone to think what icon would

00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:54,999
you choose to mean share just give

00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:56,619
people a second okay these are all icons

00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:59,139
that have been used in software to mean

00:13:56,619 --> 00:14:01,089
sure they all look completely different

00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:03,999
from each other some of them I really

00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:05,349
don't understand why they went that

00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:06,879
particular route but that just kind of

00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:09,729
goes to show right there there really

00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,779
are very few Universal icons and you

00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:11,919
know some people have come up to me

00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:13,359
after this talking like well what if we

00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,419
put hover text on it well hover text

00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:18,669
doesn't work on mobile for one and also

00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:20,409
that is creating extra work for the user

00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:22,689
right we want to make it easy for people

00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:25,449
to interact with our content so if I

00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:28,509
have to admit if I have to put invisible

00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:29,109
work into understanding how something

00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:33,639
works

00:14:29,109 --> 00:14:35,859
I'm already just you know irate by that

00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,889
experience and not really having a good

00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:42,809
time with it all right so then images

00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:45,909
who has heard of banner blindness a

00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:47,919
couple people okay so this is back in

00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:50,769
the days when I was building my Buffy

00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:53,669
the Vampire Slayer website and pretty

00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:56,829
much all sites had that like flashing

00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:59,169
rectangular ad right at the top if you

00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:01,539
remember that that was so ubiquitous

00:14:59,169 --> 00:15:03,039
that we started to instinctively ignore

00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:05,439
that section and we'll see that again in

00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:11,919
a little bit we just literally don't

00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:14,019
even look there now kind of realizing

00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,669
this this banner blindness people have

00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:16,809
started to put their ads elsewhere right

00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:19,659
so how many times when you're reading

00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:21,399
through like a news article and then it

00:15:19,659 --> 00:15:22,569
says like content continues after the ad

00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,369
and there's just an ad right in the

00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:26,799
middle of the text right that's kind of

00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:28,149
the new one of the new patterns but we

00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:29,949
skip that too you know I find that I

00:15:28,149 --> 00:15:31,239
notice what that is and I just don't

00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:34,539
even look at it I just skip down to the

00:15:31,239 --> 00:15:39,249
rest of the text so we we adjust for the

00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:42,499
patterns of ad placements so this ties

00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:43,639
into you know basic UX because you

00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:45,529
want to be aware of that right so don't

00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,269
put key content in these areas that we

00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:49,399
expect to be ads because we literally

00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:52,639
don't see them we just skip right past

00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,319
it make sure that your images are

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,999
integrating images or graphics are

00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:57,949
integrated with your content right so if

00:15:55,999 --> 00:16:00,319
if something is clearly a stock photo

00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:03,169
that brings down credibility if it seems

00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:06,289
not related to the content we again kind

00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:08,029
of assume it's an ad and it's just

00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:10,159
distracting so so news a Norman group

00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:11,539
they found that the first thing that

00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:15,709
users are drawn to on a website is

00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:17,659
actually plain text then faces so if you

00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:20,989
have like one of our clients had a blog

00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:23,449
and they kept wanting us to put more

00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:24,349
images into their blog just for the sake

00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,609
of having you but it's like all we just

00:16:24,349 --> 00:16:26,899
want to break up the text let's put some

00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:29,059
images in and we had to come back and

00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:32,389
argue like just getting a random stock

00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:34,399
image of a flag like actually detracts

00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:35,959
from your content right that makes it

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,169
look more like an ad that doesn't mean

00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:41,059
people want to read it so making sure

00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:43,759
that our images are informative and/or

00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:46,339
relevant right so maybe it's a picture

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,499
of the company team or someone using the

00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,909
app or like a workflow image you know

00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:52,879
something that is actually related to

00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:57,649
the text that ties it together instead

00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:58,819
of being distracting people have maybe

00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,069
seen this before this one's pretty

00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:02,959
popular

00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:05,329
they have also redone their website a

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:08,240
little bit if you go to links cars.com

00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:10,429
it's a little better I stuck with the

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,220
old one because it's worse and also

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:15,679
because they now have a little graphic

00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,029
on the top that says that even with that

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,889
terrible website they're still like the

00:17:17,029 --> 00:17:22,309
number one best-selling car dealer in

00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:25,189
the UK which is true there's like very

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:26,539
successful but I think they you know

00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:28,820
this is the exception that proves the

00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:30,289
rule it's just very distracting I'm not

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:36,039
entirely sure what they're doing because

00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:38,720
you don't really see any cars here so

00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:41,779
yeah maybe maybe not where we want to go

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,909
on the other hand this kind of takes off

00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:45,350
all those boxes right the content it

00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:47,450
might be a stock image but at least it's

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,119
very related to the content of the

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,159
article it's integrated directly because

00:17:50,119 --> 00:17:53,600
we have the title going over the image

00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:55,100
so we can see that they are connected

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,600
they are part of the same thing

00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,690
not like a standalone where we might

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:04,269
expect you to be an ad and it's simple

00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:07,220
its effective alright so another recap

00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:08,750
we want to think about speech from a

00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,370
visual perspective right so how do we

00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,380
make sure that we can read it that it

00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,470
has enough space that it's easy for

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,090
people to to connect with we want to use

00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,399
our images appropriately so icons should

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:20,690
like seriously always have a label one

00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,370
thing I like to do if I'm gonna use an

00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,870
icon especially a unique icon for an

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,559
application is I go around to everyone

00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:26,690
in my office

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,789
show them the icon ask them you know

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,590
within the context of the appliques and

00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:32,090
if they don't all give me the correct

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,539
answer then I don't use it I go back to

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:38,929
the drawing board

00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:40,730
alright seven to ten I'm going to think

00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,470
illogically about our design this thing

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,470
we we think logically about anything

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,480
else that we do

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:51,230
so patterns patterns are your best

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,159
friend if you are so for example

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,009
something that happens a lot in our

00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:56,809
office is we have an existing site that

00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,220
maybe we had a designer come and do and

00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:00,259
we use a template or you know whatever

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:04,250
the case is and the client wants to add

00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:05,629
a new page and so we end up building

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,649
that page from scratch and we just base

00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:08,570
it off the existing

00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:09,889
design so we look at what are the

00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,539
patterns that we've been using already

00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:13,070
right do we have a certain kind of

00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:14,419
column that we like to use do we have

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,179
like color banners that go all the way

00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:19,669
across that we can use one thing that

00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:21,529
our a designer friend of mine said once

00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:23,539
was like there are literally a billion

00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:25,490
websites so just find one you like and

00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:27,289
kind of copy it because for the most

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,720
part what we're doing you know again

00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:33,200
this is where that's sort of like well

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,909
not all websites if you're building

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,289
something that that needs to have a

00:19:34,909 --> 00:19:37,850
unique design it needs to be really

00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:40,549
trendy and eye-catching like obviously

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:43,549
you want to do something unique but in

00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:47,389
the most kit in most cases we just want

00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:51,649
something that looks good so quality

00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:52,909
Trump's originality in most cases find

00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,950
something that works use it as a model

00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:56,000
right just focus on the patterns I'm

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:57,500
making sure everything is consistent

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,269
right that idea of like teaching our

00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,740
user one pattern sticking to it so that

00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:02,059
it's very easy for them to navigate

00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:04,879
through the site or application find

00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:07,039
what they're looking for so this is

00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:08,810
actually one of my favorite bars in

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,400
Madison

00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,600
this is our old site they got a new one

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,940
but they keep a link to that keep the

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,680
old one up for like nostalgia but this

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,550
was their real website until maybe a

00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,020
year ago and it's completely useless

00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,610
right I know nothing about the bar I

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,380
have no idea how all those st. Patty's

00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:28,100
Day pictures are because they've been up

00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:29,870
there forever weird things are

00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:32,150
highlighted weird things are bolded they

00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,560
have multiple colors some things that

00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,430
are underlined aren't actually links

00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,430
it's just kind of a hot mess

00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:41,870
here on the other hand we have I mean

00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:44,470
it's this is like just patterns right

00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:46,820
everything is in patterns we have our

00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,820
columns we have our navigation on the

00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,590
side we can see the filters everything

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,420
is structured the same the squares are

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,340
all the same size it's very easy to come

00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:59,150
to this having never used it before and

00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:02,230
be able to find what you want alright

00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:04,850
who's heard of progressive disclosure a

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,980
couple people okay so progressive

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,840
disclosure is the idea of not

00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,820
overwhelming users with content but

00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,650
making it easy for them to find what

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,780
they're looking for so we're gonna talk

00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,920
about some ways to do that who is

00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:19,220
familiar with the F shape reading

00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,450
pattern more people okay so this is one

00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,400
of those ones I mentioned earlier the

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,840
durability of usability guidelines and

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,550
this is one that they went and revisited

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,750
he goes 20 years later and they found

00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:31,760
that it's still true

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,860
so it's this right the red is where we

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,020
spend the most time looking at a site

00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,490
and then the blue and clears always been

00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,040
the least time so we can see there's

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:43,490
this sort of broad F shape so we start

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:46,640
in the top I don't know left and right

00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:48,770
left corner and then we kind of cascade

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,930
down and again you can see that the

00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:56,240
intensity of our consumption of content

00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:59,020
drastically like tapers off the farther

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,880
down that we get they found that for

00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,310
languages that are flipped from English

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,050
so where you read the opposite direction

00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:07,790
the FC pattern is still there it's just

00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:10,480
flipped kind of like you would expect so

00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:16,250
this is this is kind of a universal

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:18,830
behavior so top to bottom important to

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,720
less important right they found that in

00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,490
2014 they found that a hundred and fifty

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,680
six percent more people

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,290
see you know sort of like above the fold

00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,700
so in newspapers the above the fold was

00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:29,750
literally above the fold right if you

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,400
were holding a physical newspaper in

00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,140
your hands they put the eye-catching

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,360
stuff at the top because they wanted you

00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,070
to be invested enough that you would

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,260
bother to actually open the newspaper

00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:40,970
and that same behavior right human

00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,100
behavior does not change we just ported

00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,870
that behavior over to the web but

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,670
instead of a fold we have a scroll so

00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,950
it's kind of like before the scroll so

00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:54,200
100 see 6 percent more people look at

00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:55,460
the content before the scroll so what we

00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,750
want to make sure that we are we are

00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,120
drawing people at the top so really

00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:01,010
getting our our key concepts at the top

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,840
of the page and then avoid putting

00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:06,680
content in this traditional ad area so

00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:08,150
if we go back to look at here right we

00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,190
can see that we don't even look at the

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,710
top for the most part that whole top

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,150
section we don't even look at part of

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:15,440
that is banner blind as part of that is

00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,060
that we now kind of expect that a

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,950
navigation is there and we first get to

00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,060
a site we're not necessarily interested

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,260
in the navigation right we want to

00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,270
figure out well what are they about

00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:26,680
do I care and if I care then maybe I

00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,680
want to go click for something specific

00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:31,310
so here's a good example right again

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,310
from the New York Times so we can see

00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:36,320
that in that area that we don't look at

00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:39,590
they just put other stories it's like if

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,990
we click on those great if we don't not

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:44,480
the end of the world they have a nice

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:49,160
big title I know exactly what this is

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,790
about the image is like very relevant to

00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,080
the content

00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:55,640
I have subheads so I can kind of scroll

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,590
through see what I'm looking for they

00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,440
understand that you know and you can see

00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:02,120
there's almost an F on this page right

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,500
they understand the way that we are

00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,310
going to interact with the content and

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,480
so they decide with a bunch of

00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,160
whitespace there because we're not

00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:12,560
looking there anyway like why bother

00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:14,480
putting something there alright so again

00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,550
with consistency right if there's one

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,770
thing you leave with today it's a

00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:22,670
consistency in patterns in design are

00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:23,750
like your best friend so links and

00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,100
buttons right idea if a button has a

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,810
shadow one place it should probably have

00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:29,480
a shadow all the time forms should have

00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:34,470
the same color if you have like alerts

00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,970
the red should be the same color tables

00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,470
should look the same your header

00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,120
typefaces and size it should be the same

00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,030
and now you know we have some sites

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,620
where that are very very data heavy so

00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,929
like for the University so they're just

00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:48,390
literally looking at data from research

00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:49,620
projects and so tables for like one

00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:51,990
category you might have like a different

00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,400
color for the header right so that they

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,270
can use that it as a visual cue to see

00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,770
what they're looking at but otherwise

00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,390
everything is the same because we want

00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:59,070
to make it again we want to make it easy

00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:06,270
for people to find what they're looking

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:08,190
for so which part of this text do you

00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:11,700
think is the link is that the green or

00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:13,140
is it the underlined yeah no one

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,520
answered because like you have no I'm

00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,530
going unless you click on something is

00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,299
it you know it's the green maybe where

00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:20,580
you hover and it gives you that sort of

00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:22,789
weird definition or it wants you to

00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,110
click somewhere else to go somewhere I

00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:27,090
look at this and I have to stop and

00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:29,039
think and what I don't want is to think

00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,960
about how the content works

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,520
I want to you know ideally I'm thinking

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,570
about the content itself and like you

00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,520
know it's thoughtful and deep and

00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:39,000
whatever but I don't want to think about

00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:42,360
how to interact with it so functionality

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,429
is a part of design the structure so I'm

00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:48,120
a full site developer so I do beckon in

00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:49,860
rails and then front-end and on a new

00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,059
project or even if I'm just adding to

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,650
the architecture of an existing product

00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,390
I think about how the data models can

00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,490
have a direct impact on the user facing

00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:59,400
implementation so I sit then I think

00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:01,049
okay what am I likely building out on

00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,669
the front end in the interface that

00:26:01,049 --> 00:26:05,340
someone's gonna use how can I make sure

00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:09,679
that I am sort of preparing for that to

00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:12,539
be a you know like a cooperative

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,650
misadventure which is like kind of a

00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,880
business phony word but you know what I

00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,240
mean like how can I think about how they

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,240
work together

00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:22,679
bugs Trump Beauty right so we saw that

00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,059
46% of people saying that visual design

00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,210
is the most important for building

00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:28,710
credibility versus 8% for functionality

00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,450
but if you decide to stay on a site

00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:32,220
because of the visual design and then

00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,380
the links are all broken in the forms

00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,860
don't submit you're not going to stay

00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:40,070
anyway

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:42,179
right so this I really like this quote

00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:44,880
design is where science and art break

00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:47,370
even so the idea that you know I think a

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,220
lot of people when they hear visual

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,120
design they think

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:53,200
that it's it's not really you know

00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,220
especially if you're more of a back in

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,840
partner but they think it's not really

00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,280
relevant to what I'm doing right the

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,659
code is one thing the visual design is

00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:02,110
another thing but they all fit together

00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:04,360
and impact each other and if we're aware

00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:09,789
of that then we can like really build

00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:10,750
kickass all right final recap so we

00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:12,730
want to think about our words as a

00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,440
visual construct right how do we make

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:18,490
sure that they are able to be read

00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,830
easily and quickly images icons should

00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:22,510
always have labels photos and graphics

00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:25,150
should be integrated with the content

00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:26,710
relevant informative stock images are

00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,090
not your friend because we look at text

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:30,669
first that's what we're drawn to then we

00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:33,760
look at faces random flag pictures are

00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:34,690
just like whatever and then how do we

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,030
think about design from a logical

00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:39,039
perspective right so using patterns and

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,510
being consistent keeping in mind that F

00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:44,470
shape reading pattern and how that

00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:45,580
affects where we put what content being

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,030
consistent and then of course making

00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:51,460
sure that it works so some additional

00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:53,020
information a bunch of citations that

00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,539
you can check out for where I got all

00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,970
this information and that's all I have

00:27:55,539 --> 00:28:02,729
so thank you

00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:02,729
