yeah okay so my talk is titled the

00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:15,570
browser as a modular networked video

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,140
synthesizer and everything I'm going to

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,900
talk about is online in the form of sort

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:27,269
of a code editor and graphic surrender

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:31,289
at this at this website Hydra editor dot

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,730
glitch dot me and this is sort of a tool

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,070
I've been building but really it's more

00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,690
of an investigation of of three

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,089
different things that might seem kind of

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,549
separate collaboration in the creation

00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:43,680
of live visuals possibilities of

00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:46,739
peer-to-peer technology on the web and

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,350
feedback loops and has also become a

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:54,589
platform for live coding visuals in

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:57,479
JavaScript so I'm going to start with a

00:00:54,589 --> 00:01:00,059
reference from the 1970s this is the

00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,580
satellite arts projects by kick Galilei

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,960
and che robe into it and what they did

00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,970
was using using satellites in 1977 they

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,729
streamed video from two different places

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,729
and composited them on top of each other

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,890
and what they said was that this marks

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,320
the first time that the geographically

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,140
dispersed electronic image was

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,179
contextualized as a live immersive place

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,579
where artists and others could convene

00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:28,229
and co-create together on a scale that

00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:30,840
could be as cultural inclusive as

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,880
desired and so this is before the

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,630
internet existed this is just satellites

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,909
and they applied to get access to this

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,640
the satellite and to send video from one

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,340
place to another and it's sort of this

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,310
utopian idea that as soon as maybe if we

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,009
just put two images on top of each other

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,659
we create this third place it's not here

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,659
it's not there but it's this other place

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:58,319
that's some hybrid of these these two

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:04,530
places and I want to stay here for a

00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:06,990
second because I think we still use this

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,690
idea of a place in talking a lot of

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,310
about the web it's a website as if

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:15,000
you're going somewhere or it's an

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:18,330
address a webpage just this idea that

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,960
when you access a website you're you're

00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:25,650
going to a place and it's sort of this

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,120
analogy that doesn't necessarily have

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,100
that much to do with the underlying

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,380
technologies like if I go to a web site

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,410
my browser sending a message to a server

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,810
somewhere that server sending messages

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,370
back to me I'm sending messages back but

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,310
it's not there's not that there's

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,840
actually a place that I am necessarily

00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:47,400
and then also this idea that it's live

00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,290
and immersive I think Andres is talk it

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,450
was a good example of maybe we're just

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:57,090
getting right now to this idea of a live

00:02:51,450 --> 00:03:01,230
immersive place on the web so I want to

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,960
jump a little to now which is um and

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,390
talk about WebRTC which is a browser

00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:09,630
protocol for streaming video audio and

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:12,930
data directly between clients so this

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,000
means that now in the browser we can be

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,090
a little less dependent on a centralized

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,940
server this server here is this pink

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,550
thing or some some way that all of these

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:27,690
clients can talk to each other but then

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:30,830
WebRTC says that I can as a client with

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:35,990
a browser directly send video audio and

00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:40,560
data to another person who's connected

00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:42,540
and in this diagram I'm I'm sure a lot

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,520
of people have seen it before but but

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,330
says maybe with this kind of these kinds

00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:50,310
of decentralized protocols we can go

00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:52,650
away from the left-hand image which is

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,860
more essentialized Network and go

00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:59,210
towards the right-hand image which is

00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,920
more of a decentralized network where

00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,660
where let's of different people can

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,010
connect and exchange information in

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,470
different ways and there's a lot of

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,860
exciting projects I think being built on

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,800
these this type of protocol caught for

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:17,729
example web tour in speaker browser the

00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,500
dot protocol and stuff like that and I

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:21,150
just kind of got interested in this

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,759
protocol and started doing experiment

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:28,379
sending video balancing video around the

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,919
internet and as I was doing that I sort

00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:35,169
of started to feel like this

00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:37,340
this thing on the Ray of this network

00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:40,129
looked a little something like this

00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,529
thing which is another reference from

00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:45,199
the 70s because for some reason a lot of

00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:46,099
my references are from the 70s maybe

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,969
it's cuz I'm from San Francisco

00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:55,779
originally but anyways so what this is

00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:58,969
is an analog video synthesizer and and

00:04:55,779 --> 00:05:02,479
basically it's a bunch of boxes some

00:04:58,969 --> 00:05:03,919
boxes create a signal by the time that

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,689
signal gets to the screen on the right

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:12,139
the pattern of the signal creates a

00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:14,210
pattern and the boxes are designed in

00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,340
such a way that many of the boxes can

00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,590
receive a signal and transform it and

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:22,639
then so the order in which you connect

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:26,990
the boxes will affect what comes out on

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:30,169
the the final screen and this is similar

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:33,589
in analog modular synthesis for audio as

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:36,169
well as analog modular synthesis for

00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:40,339
video and so I thought what if we kind

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:44,360
of treat this thing this thing kind of

00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:47,300
like like this thing instead of thinking

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,580
of of a website as actually a place what

00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,819
if we think about it as a bouncing

00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,949
signal that we can play around with and

00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:57,080
so so I started experimenting with this

00:05:54,949 --> 00:06:02,620
idea about two and a half years ago or

00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:07,039
something and so what this is is

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:10,370
basically here I'm using WebRTC to send

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:15,819
a video signal between various browser

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:19,879
windows so here I'm sending this in this

00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:21,169
video to this window and compositing

00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,050
them with each other and then I'm

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:26,719
sending this video in this video here

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,750
and compositing them with each other

00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:31,490
over here and these are all happened to

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,639
be on the same computer to kind of show

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,770
the idea but they could be you know when

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,250
one window could be in China and one

00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,629
somewhere else one here but this is I

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,350
don't know why this was interesting to

00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:44,270
me it was just

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,590
let me explore this idea and because I

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,810
didn't know what I wanted to do with it

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,480
instead of actually making a user

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:53,990
interface as I was experimenting with it

00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:56,650
I just live coded in the console kind of

00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,360
playing around with different things and

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:04,820
seeing what happened just with this sort

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,740
of routing video streams and throughout

00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:08,790
the Internet

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,790
[Music]

00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:19,409
yeah

00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:28,180
and so Daniel sand in the creator of

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:33,820
that synthesizer that I was just showing

00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:35,350
key he said the modules are designed to

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,330
maximize the possibility of

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:39,700
interconnection thereby maximizing the

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,920
number of possible modifications of the

00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,990
image and so the idea his idea is that

00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,850
the more of those boxes that you have in

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,830
the modular synthesizer the more you can

00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:57,670
route signals maybe the more

00:07:47,830 --> 00:08:02,200
possibilities you have so now I'm going

00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:04,270
to move into the the tool that I've been

00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,840
building to experiment with this this

00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:10,480
idea

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:12,220
it's called Hydra and it's at that link

00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:18,220
I showed earlier called Hydra editor

00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:19,870
glitch that me and so it's designed to

00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:22,690
let people experiment with with what I

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:25,450
was just showing you not just within by

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,670
sending video to different windows but

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:31,150
also just all within the same video with

00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:33,880
it within the same window I mean and so

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:44,080
I'm actually gonna get rid of what's on

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:47,970
the screen and so the basic unit within

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,970
this is is an oscillator

00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,360
okay so here we have an oscillator which

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:19,820
is like one of those boxes in the

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:21,650
modular synth world and then in order to

00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:26,180
see it I need to connect it to a screen

00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:29,150
so here's I connected the oscillator to

00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:31,340
an output and you can think of in this

00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:34,160
case this is a JavaScript library that

00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:37,100
I've created for working with this model

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,020
of sort of video synthesis and and you

00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,180
can think of each function as if it's

00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,420
one of those boxes that we're seeing in

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:46,640
the modular synthesis world so now that

00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:53,210
I have an oscillator I can give it

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:59,380
certain parameters like frequency sync

00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:59,380
and also separate the colors somewhat

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:11,750
and then I can also start to transform

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:18,520
the signal so psy can make it rotate so

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:18,520
here I can make it rotate more

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:39,420
I can make it into a kaleidoscope

00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:39,420
for example or I can pixelate it

00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:47,420
[Music]

00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:50,910
and so so here sort of the analogies are

00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:52,860
each each function is is one of the

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:54,810
boxes in the modular synthesizer each

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,330
parameter is kind of like a knob and

00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:59,400
then the chaining of the functions acts

00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,260
like the patching cables for people more

00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,010
from who are familiar with my dealer

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,810
synthesizers and this is this is

00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,640
interesting to me this is all running on

00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:12,090
WebGL and this chain of functions

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:16,050
renders to a single shader and I was

00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:18,870
interested I think a lot of abstractions

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,720
for dealing with graphics either talk

00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:24,540
about canvas like which you use a lot of

00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:27,770
drawing metaphors so there's a canvas

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:31,200
you draw a shape you draw another shape

00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:36,030
or they use sort of 3d metaphors like a

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:41,460
lot of what we just saw which is a box

00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:44,730
lighting a scene and so here I'm using

00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:47,190
this other metaphor which is the video

00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,320
synthesis and transforming a signal

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,780
metaphor and so with this if you want to

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,580
repeat something instead of writing a

00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,890
loop and saying I'm gonna do it now a

00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:59,280
hundred times I just apply a

00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:05,280
transformation so here I could do repeat

00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:10,770
and so I I could do it two times or I

00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:12,990
could do it 200 times and it's not more

00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,910
problem it's not more intensive for the

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,190
process for the processor at all because

00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,140
they're just transformations to the

00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,230
coordinates directly on the graphics

00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:26,880
card and the result outputs a pixel

00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:29,430
color and so that's all well and good

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,940
but this is just sort of a single chain

00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:34,620
of things and so what I was really

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,360
interested in for that mess of cables

00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:41,700
and how things were out into each other

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:45,150
and so what I can do here is I can have

00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:51,750
various various sort of output screens

00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:52,930
and so here and I can also use different

00:12:51,750 --> 00:13:02,320
sources and

00:12:52,930 --> 00:13:05,290
I'm gonna use my webcam here so they're

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,170
there you actually want to put this over

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:13,810
there and that over here and so now I

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:18,250
have I have my two my two screens and I

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:21,520
can then also blend them together so I

00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,560
have one output called a zero and one

00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:27,430
called oh one so then they can now say

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:30,160
I'm gonna use a zero I'm gonna blend it

00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:36,760
with a one and then I'm gonna output it

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:40,120
- OH - and so then there I am and

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:43,209
there's some different sort of blending

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:54,040
operations here wait I'll make this a

00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:58,120
little and so one other thing that I

00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:00,459
sort of took from modular synthesizers

00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:04,300
either what happened what's happening

00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:06,160
now is I'm combining two colors and the

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:09,790
two colors of the two images on the Left

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,830
create the colors on the right but I

00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,380
could also use the colors of one thing

00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:18,850
to affect the coordinates of the other

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:25,470
thing and so that in the analog world is

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:29,230
called modulation and so I can I do that

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:33,190
so now you it's the colors of the thing

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:35,770
on the top are affecting the coordinates

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:45,160
of my camera so it ends up with this

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:53,649
kind of were P thing and so hi everyone

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:56,920
I repeat myself and so this is just

00:14:53,649 --> 00:15:03,930
something I I made this to experiment

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:06,390
with and a lot of and also back to the

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:08,550
image showing all the windows still if

00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:11,640
anyone else is connected to this website

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:14,520
I can use what they're doing as an input

00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,820
to what I'm doing which is sort of just

00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:20,520
an experiment of of what happens when we

00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,839
combine images in this way and then some

00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,540
of the other things I've experimented

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,670
with of this this is like using the

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,140
screen as an input to itself when

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:38,940
creating feedback and this sort of

00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:44,550
trippy thing oi here I'm using my

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:46,830
Twitter feed and and also sources and

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,140
the software can either be someone else

00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:52,800
who's connected they can be a camera it

00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:56,130
can be any browser window or it can be

00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:01,380
any application window or it can be a

00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:04,110
canvas element and so here here this is

00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:10,110
my Twitter feed with some video effects

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:13,500
applied to it or this I use a live

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:18,240
stream of Time Square and a live stream

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:21,150
of an aquarium and then live coded the

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,050
mix between the two and and this for me

00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,060
it's really just an ongoing

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,529
investigation of trying something out

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,130
and seeing what happens and trying

00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:28,130
something else out

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:52,880
and another experiment this was using a

00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:54,980
chromium with no background and so I

00:16:52,880 --> 00:17:00,770
could actually just use my desktop as

00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:03,950
input to this video synthesizer but with

00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:07,750
without without having windows so that

00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:07,750
was just a fun experiment I think

00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,090
and so one of the interesting things to

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,610
me with this sort of setup is to be able

00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:37,660
to make it easy to experiment with

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:42,010
feedback which in in the video world

00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:43,540
feedback is where you have a camera and

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,120
the output of the camera goes to a

00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:50,710
screen and then the camera is looking at

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,179
that screen itself and so there's no at

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,340
some point there's no starting point

00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:56,590
because the image of the camera is on

00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:58,900
the screen and the image of the screen

00:17:56,590 --> 00:18:01,120
is what's coming out of the camera which

00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:06,670
is similar to recursion in programming

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:08,770
or some of Escher's asurs drawings or in

00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:11,530
the 10th century the snake that eats its

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:15,270
own tail so it's the this idea of things

00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:17,950
that that don't necessarily have a start

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:22,000
so I'm going to show a very quick

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:27,010
example of that here it's also can be

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,220
useful for making fractals and so here

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:32,580
I'm just gonna output a shape can you

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:36,160
see my code or should I make it bigger

00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:40,270
it's good okay so here here I have a

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:45,700
shape and then I'm gonna blend the

00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:47,550
output of that with with itself so the

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:51,450
output here is called a zero we'll just

00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:51,450
trust me on that I guess

00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,710
so I'm gonna blend the output with

00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:58,630
itself and we don't actually see any

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:02,200
difference because we're drawing a

00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:07,720
triangle and then we're mixing it with

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:10,720
itself again which is a triangle but I

00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:15,730
could after each time I mix the whole

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:17,650
thing repeat repeat it and then mix it

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:25,150
with itself again and so to do that with

00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:28,470
this I could just do repeat and we get a

00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:30,880
sort of fractal like thing which is

00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:34,470
something that at different scales is a

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,470
repetition of itself and

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,870
it's something that's I'm just playing

00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:42,410
around with it's really interesting with

00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:45,530
this kind of set of obstructions is to

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:54,470
be able to in only four functions kind

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:59,070
of describe describe a fractal we're

00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:02,480
gonna do one more little little demo

00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,480
[Music]

00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:19,059
I'm going to start with the camera again

00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:25,150
hi that's my face very big and then I'm

00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:28,120
gonna blend it with the output and then

00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:30,760
I'm gonna use that modulate function

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,950
that I just showed you where the colors

00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:36,540
of one thing affect the coordinates of

00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:36,540
another thing and so here

00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:56,490
so I get this sort of liquidy thing and

00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:12,120
they could add a little more contrast

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:16,289
maybe let's see maybe a little more and

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:20,700
so it turns out that that feedback is

00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:23,370
useful for modeling MA for modeling

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:28,980
things like fluid dynamics as well

00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:30,750
because you can think of the colors of

00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:34,620
the texture as sort of a representation

00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:38,100
of pressure and then on each each loop

00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:46,409
sort of effect the system using using

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:50,070
colors so yeah some things I've made

00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:54,259
like experimenting with this just this

00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,259
pretty simple simple setup

00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:17,500
also it can be useful for creating

00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:17,500
reaction diffusion like like patterns

00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:46,519
so one thing that the creator of that

00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:51,440
modular synthesizer that I showed at the

00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:53,479
beginning talked about he talked about

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,799
the idea of this feedback loop which has

00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:59,269
had sometimes like a mystical mystical

00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:01,070
implications at different moments in

00:22:59,269 --> 00:23:02,570
history but he says the reason you put

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,159
yourself in a feedback loop is so you

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:06,229
can learn something or rather learn to

00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,789
do something you know you do something

00:23:06,229 --> 00:23:09,679
in the results get processed somehow

00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:11,509
perhaps just by yourself just looking at

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,309
it and you do another thing and the

00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:15,889
results of that get process and your

00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:17,960
actions can cause constantly be tuned or

00:23:15,889 --> 00:23:20,299
corrected or refined by what you see and

00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,950
and something that happens with playing

00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:24,950
with these systems that can be kind of

00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:27,440
delicate is that even though I know

00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:29,899
exactly what each function does at the

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,299
moment of playing with it a lot of times

00:23:29,899 --> 00:23:35,149
a really unexpected thing can happen

00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:37,070
like like in this example if I make one

00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:39,710
of these variables just change one

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:43,220
number maybe it makes it really it goes

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:47,239
away now and so it can be really

00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:50,539
delicate and so being able to live code

00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:53,330
it or - I'm actually executing parts of

00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:56,389
the code at a time and being able to

00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:59,349
code it see the results code it see the

00:23:56,389 --> 00:24:01,609
results to me is is very similar to

00:23:59,349 --> 00:24:04,669
putting yourself in that feedback loop

00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:09,169
with which in an analog world is like

00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:10,519
patching cables together and so part of

00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:12,799
this is that since I put this online

00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:15,019
about a year ago a lot of people have

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,989
started to use it and I still feel like

00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:19,759
I'm learning to use it myself and so one

00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:22,519
of the things I wanted to do is make it

00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:26,119
easy for people to share to share what

00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:30,200
they're doing and so there's a Twitter

00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:33,109
bot uh-huh and basically this is it kind

00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,070
of instead of having to pay for hosting

00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:40,039
and have people upload images they're

00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:42,320
basically directly from the editor we

00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:46,039
can upload an image to the Twitter bot

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:51,440
so here and I'm gonna say J s comm

00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:52,909
Hawaii yeah and then now it should

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:59,479
upload what I do

00:24:52,909 --> 00:25:02,769
did to the Twitter bot let's see there

00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:05,869
we are and so what happens is when you

00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:07,940
when you click on a link here then it

00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:11,840
opens the editor with the actual code

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:14,840
that someone used to make it and so so

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:19,249
to me since I started making this about

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:22,009
a year ago it's become now there's

00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:24,950
probably like 200 people using it and so

00:25:22,009 --> 00:25:27,259
part of it is that the software also

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,809
becomes a community and part of it is

00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:31,999
how the things that I've been building

00:25:28,809 --> 00:25:36,259
into the software can help people share

00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:39,139
what they're doing and so so in the

00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:42,229
Twitter bot you can also see this what

00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:44,179
this happened came from what someone

00:25:42,229 --> 00:25:50,739
else did earlier and this came what so

00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:54,080
from what someone else did earlier and

00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:58,009
this is also something I perform I'm

00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:01,279
live with it there's a community of

00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:04,609
people who do something called live

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:06,409
coding which people do within the tech

00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:09,320
world but also they do it more within a

00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:12,409
music of the music world that which is

00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:15,799
write code in front of people to make to

00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:18,859
make audio visuals and so there's a

00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:21,679
website of people who are interested in

00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:23,899
this kind of thing of of live coding as

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:29,840
a performer as an audio-visual

00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:33,109
performance and so and I view some of it

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,509
as sort of a direct descendant of the

00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:38,119
the video synth idea of putting yourself

00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:42,229
in a feedback loop this is one of the

00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:44,169
creators or the original the first

00:26:42,229 --> 00:26:46,009
people to do live coding as a

00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:48,859
performance thing and he had a live

00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:52,039
coding band called slub in the in 2003

00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:55,249
and and said he was heavily influenced

00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:56,779
by reading paul Cleese pedagogical

00:26:55,249 --> 00:26:59,560
sketch I'm not going to read this

00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:03,020
booklet but

00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:04,940
but the idea of live coding is sort of

00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,410
an exploration in which you're trying

00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,150
something out the computer does

00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:09,980
something you respond the computer does

00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:14,240
something else and you're sharing that

00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:18,749
with a with a live audience so thank you

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,749
