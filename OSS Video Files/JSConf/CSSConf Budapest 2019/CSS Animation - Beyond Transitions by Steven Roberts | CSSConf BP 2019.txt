Title: CSS Animation - Beyond Transitions by Steven Roberts | CSSConf BP 2019
Publication date: 2019-11-04
Playlist: CSSConf Budapest 2019
Description: 
	Sure we all know about the power of CSS transitions, we use them day in and day out to animate the state of a button or link; but CSS is capable of so much more when it comes to animation, especially when paired with SVG, and itâ€™s about time we started utilising it.

Steven has a passion for design and the web in particular, he spends much of his time experimenting with upcoming technologies. He has wrote a number of articles, features and tutorials covering a number of frontend topics such as CSS Grid, Flexbox, Responsive Typography, CSS Animation and SVG.

00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,820
how about now

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:25,470
yeah there we go cool hey hello my name

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,180
is Steven as I was just introduced and

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,400
I'm gonna be talking about CSS animation

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,850
and going beyond just using transitions

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,829
and so except my name's Steven Roberts

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,480
you can follow me on Twitter and club

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,030
pen the links are across the bottom the

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,280
whole way I'm in this industry

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,020
for around about 10 years I did a lot of

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,149
agency work and then have since moved on

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,070
to a company called assembler where I

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,510
now do a lot of design development and

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,039
UX I sort of look after all of that but

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,960
enough about me and that's not why

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,820
you're here so why bother to animate it

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,699
all well animation can be used for a

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,190
number of reasons I use animation to

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,140
delight your users so simple animations

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,790
can really create a memorable experience

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,210
can get people coming back to your

00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,979
website to to to see the things that

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,510
you've done and you can really just grab

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,530
people's attention with really nice

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,630
simple animations so use animation to

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,520
inform so this is using the animation to

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,650
inform the user that something has

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,960
changed or something is happening this

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,900
is especially useful when submitting

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,759
forms or pulling down theater or

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,710
anything like that because you'll be

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,240
able to give a visual indication that

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,970
something's happening in the browser and

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,250
it's not just pong it's not just stopped

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,720
things like this tend to stop users from

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,040
clicking around or clicking the button

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,909
three or four times as we saw in the

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,280
other talk so you can sort of help add

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,950
your user just few visual cues in

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,990
animation and finally use animation to

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,430
confirm so this is quite similar except

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,380
it's just confirm that something's

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,420
happened confirm that the debt has been

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,960
sent confirm that something's loading

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,090
and all those sorts of things so why

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,369
bother to animate in CSS so CSS is

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,750
performant simple and powerful and you

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:08,550
can see they're performing has a little

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,349
asterisk next to it that's because we

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,900
only have a few safe properties that we

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,920
that we can animate in CSS and there's a

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,080
transform or pass

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,610
geom filter and while that may seem

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,130
quite limiting there's quite a lot you

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,390
can do with just those properties and

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,920
it's worth noting as well that in the

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,800
future this won't be as much of a

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,170
problem things like the Firefox quantum

00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,760
engine will take away a lot of that pain

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,170
and the only reason you can't use the

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,209
other properties or you shouldn't use

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,250
them as much is because it will cause

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,350
Jan Kaas to will cause your animations

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,019
to slow down it will cause quite a lot

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:44,580
of performance issues or it could so why

00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:47,310
why go beyond transitions what's wrong

00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:52,260
with transitions then this is my

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:53,580
favorite slide okay so and we just look

00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,410
at a couple of transitions now some of

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,150
them are fairly simple this is probably

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:00,680
things you've done before so as we hover

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:03,120
over here and we change the color and

00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,910
then on this next one when we hover over

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,430
it it changes to an X so you can see

00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,709
there the the transition code itself is

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,900
just stroke 250 milliseconds and then

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,090
we're going to apply a timing function

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,680
of easing out and then same for this one

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,220
except we're going to animate all of the

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,560
properties not just the color and then

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,880
magic happens because it's not quite

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,660
that simple you still gotta tell it when

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,790
and what to animate so here that menu

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:33,269
turn it into a cross is made up of four

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,100
lines so the the middle bit is two lines

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,590
stacked on top of each other so then

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,810
when we hover over we hide the top and

00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:44,180
bottom lines and then transform the

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,180
middle lines out over to Korea across

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:52,230
simple issue so one more quick example

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,549
and so these are just some cards that

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,680
you might have on any typical website

00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:59,130
and the bottom corner is going to be

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,040
used to to show a category or to show a

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,890
name or something like that and as we

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,410
hover over that's revealed so again this

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:12,060
is using transitions now animation so

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,530
upon hover we're going to change the

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,709
border width of the after and the

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:19,200
opacity of the before so the after is

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:23,940
the the rectangular corner and the

00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:26,700
before is the text so it's pretty cool

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,810
so transitions are awesome but limited

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,580
we can only animate from

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,560
value to another and we require some

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,080
sort of interaction in order for it to

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:40,530
fire so this is why we're going to go

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:42,510
beyond transitions so none of this is is

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,820
exactly new CSS animations have been

00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:46,790
around forever so why am i standing on a

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:49,050
stage in 2019 talking to you about it

00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,450
because it just feels them to use it

00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,700
feels since since Apple went and killed

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,230
flash the the animations taken a bit of

00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,850
a backseat on the web no one seems to

00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,990
really be doing much with it there's a

00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,030
couple of websites where you're like oh

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,820
that's cool but that's kind of about it

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:05,700
whereas we've got this tool in in CSS

00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:07,770
that has quite a simple syntax you can

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:10,200
do so much with it and we can bring the

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:15,060
web to life again like it was back

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:16,710
before Apple okay so I'm gonna stop

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,240
complaining now and inspire and said or

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,410
at least try so this is the first

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,120
animation we're going to look at and

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,290
it's a simple scrolling Mouse you've

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,000
probably seen something like this they

00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,919
usually sit at the bottom of like a hero

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,220
area or something just to indicate to

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,000
the user that you can scroll down so how

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,880
does it work

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,770
so this animation is made up of an SVG

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,570
and just two elements inside there

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,630
there's a rectangle in a circle and

00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:41,490
we've given them both a class name so

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,160
the first thing to do is to style the

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,870
the elements within our SVG so we're

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,330
just going to give a stroke color and

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:51,030
width a fill color and an opacity for

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:53,910
the the actual scroll and then we can

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,639
see we've managed to style our style our

00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,840
mouse then we can move once we've got

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,930
our styling we can move on to the

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,700
animation so here we're saying we have a

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:06,060
keyframe animation called scroll and

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:09,000
from 0 to 20% we're not going to do

00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,880
anything and then from 20% to 100% we're

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,039
going to move along the y-axis 36 pixels

00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,110
and then we're also going to elongate

00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,479
the shape which is by stretching it

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,240
along the y-axis using scale Y and then

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,860
we're also going to fade it out so now

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,260
we've created our animation we need to

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:29,400
set that so we give it an animation name

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:34,650
duration and an inspiration count and it

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,760
didn't work so why didn't it work so we

00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,789
were missing the transform origin

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,470
property so this is quite important when

00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:41,800
you're animating especially with SVG and

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,990
things like that because then not

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:48,850
using the regular Dom they have their

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,740
own Dom separate to HTML one so here

00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:53,710
we're saying we're going to transform

00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,479
from the center and from 20 pixels and

00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,310
then once we've applied that we can see

00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:58,750
it's starting to move down over where it

00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:03,610
was kind of just stretched on the spot

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:05,410
before so it's nearly what we had as the

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,389
example but not quite so he's the two

00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,220
side-by-side the one on the Left sort of

00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:11,770
dropping down and stretching and the one

00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,150
on the right is what we're aiming for so

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,699
without going back and changing our

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:17,620
animation we can accomplish that with

00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:19,539
one line of code so here we're just

00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,090
using the animation timing function and

00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:24,130
we're using cubic Bezier instead of one

00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,310
of the preset values like linear or ease

00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,780
in or ease out or anything like that and

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,599
but cubic Bezier just allows you to add

00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,979
custom functions and the numbers look

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,360
horrible but don't worry about that this

00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:35,440
generator isn't all that sort of thing

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,289
out there so you can go and have a play

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,720
and see what looks good what doesn't and

00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,550
what you're aiming for so then when we

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,139
apply that you can see we now sort of

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,210
have that nice or particular little as

00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:51,010
itself goes up and then comes down again

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:52,810
so in less than two three minutes of

00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:58,810
talking we've gone from completely

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:59,830
installed SVG to a finished animation so

00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,229
it's no bad but you've probably seen

00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:09,460
something like that before let's see if

00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:11,380
I can really impress you this time so

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:14,580
this animation is created entirely with

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,580
SVG and CSS

00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:26,250
so how did I do it so the the key to

00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,870
this is the the animation steps function

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:30,730
we'll come back to that in a moment but

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:34,300
that's really the key to what's

00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,620
happening here so step one for creating

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,140
this animation was creating the image

00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:41,560
itself so start by drawing one of the

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,180
poses as a vector I think I used sketch

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,460
but you can use whatever you want and

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:48,670
then you go ahead and draw the remaining

00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:50,950
poses in my case that ended up being ten

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,540
and that was because it was a time

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,770
factor that I needed to get the work

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,360
done

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:59,440
tends a nice round number for doing

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,930
maths which is always fun and ten

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:07,750
actually works okay in terms of not

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:09,010
seeing seen it stutter as it replays so

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,110
once I had all of my separate bird

00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,839
elements I split them into equally sized

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:15,490
cells the actual boxes aren't needed

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:20,080
that's just to show you where I've

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:21,790
positioned the birds and then now that

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,080
we've done that we can move on to make

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:28,030
the bird fly so in our HTML we create an

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,890
element can be a div or whatever you

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,570
want and give that a class of bird and

00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,970
we then set that image we've just

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:36,580
created as the background for our

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,290
element I will then set in a width and

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:41,110
height and we're using the will change

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,760
property which is a performance property

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,310
we will just send that the background

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,080
position is going to change so if you

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,310
prepare yourself for that we're just

00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,810
telling the browser that this is going

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,150
to change prepare yourself and then we

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:54,190
hopefully will see less studies and

00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,230
things like that and the width and

00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,410
height I'll come back to here so the the

00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:01,480
height was just a random number I chose

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:04,120
125 pixels looked good and then to get

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,400
the width we take the size of our

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,690
original SVG divide that by the number

00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,880
of frames and that will give us the

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:12,640
width of one frame so that ended up

00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,890
being 88 pixels so when we look at that

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:20,440
we can see that that's just one frame of

00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:22,959
that image so if we go to our our actual

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,630
animation and create that luckily here

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,760
we just need one line and that's it so

00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,140
our animation fly cycle just says when

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,660
you get to the end the background

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,210
position will

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:37,610
moved negative 900 pixels on the x-axis

00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:39,740
then we apply that so we apply the

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,650
animation now like I said the animation

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,200
timing function what that is doing is

00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:47,210
instead of like linear or moving from

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,740
one element to another it's going to

00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,750
step through whatever you tell it

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,070
however many times you tell it to so

00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,290
because we're moving background position

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,420
and we're doing it over 10 steps it's

00:10:54,290 --> 00:11:00,190
going to move across that image 10 times

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:02,810
in the number of in the time that we set

00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:05,810
so I'm setting it to repeat infinitely

00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:07,450
so it's just going to keep going and so

00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,440
then I'm setting the duration and delay

00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,910
for the first burden I'm send the

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,100
animation duration is going to take one

00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:15,230
second and I've set a negative to lay

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,390
here and what that does is say that once

00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:22,550
the page loads the animation will

00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:26,990
already be running so that's our bird

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:28,250
flying on the spot so now that we've got

00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,980
one we can go and create multiple

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,200
variations of that in my case I've

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:36,500
created four so we have birds to three

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,580
inform using modifiers to to set the

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,740
names and then I'm just setting

00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,390
different durations and delays and by

00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,610
doing that we're using the same element

00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:45,860
and the same animation but we're just

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,650
offsetting them slightly and what that

00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:51,440
does is create a nonlinear repeatable

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:54,200
animation so all of these are exactly

00:11:51,440 --> 00:12:00,290
the same but just running in different

00:11:54,200 --> 00:12:02,330
timings and different delays so now that

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:05,530
we've got our bird flying on the spot we

00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:05,530
now need to move it across the screen

00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,570
so first of all we position rough Albert

00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,290
in a container position that container

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:18,170
off the page and then we can move on to

00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,610
our animation and this is actually a bit

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,280
more complicated than the last few I've

00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:24,950
shown there's a number of steps to it

00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,920
and so that to begin with I'm saying the

00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:31,430
translate Y value which is opened down

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,050
on the the y axis is 0 translate X is

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,640
minus 10 so we're pushing it off to the

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:37,430
off to the left and then I've set the

00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,960
scale down to now point 3 and as we

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,230
reach 10% of our way through our

00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,190
animation we're just moving along the y

00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,350
axis

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:47,420
along the x-axis so what we're doing

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,770
there is is not just flying in a

00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,870
straight line from left to right we're

00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,760
sort of going up and down as we go and

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,890
I'm also setting the scale up and down

00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,930
as we go to give the illusion of depth

00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,070
so by doing that it sort of looks like

00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:01,190
the birds getting closer and further

00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:02,870
away by changing its scale and there's a

00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,210
number of steps between there but by the

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,910
time we reach 60% of the way for our

00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:09,590
animation I want it to be finished so

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:13,190
it's going to be off the other side of

00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:15,880
the screen and not visible anymore now

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:18,830
the reason for stopping at 60% and

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,150
repeating those values at 100 is that

00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,510
when it were if we want to create a

00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:25,400
delay between the animation iterations

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,950
there's no syntax to do that you can't

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,690
say you know repeat infinitely but delay

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,790
3 seconds between each one there's no

00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,610
way to do that so the way that you do it

00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:37,100
is by setting the same values as

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:39,200
different parts of your key frames so by

00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,660
60% we're finished but it's going to

00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,940
keep running until at 100% and still be

00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,160
off the side so then when it comes back

00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,790
around the others will still be going

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,190
which you'll see in a moment so we need

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:55,520
to apply that we've got a timing

00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,960
function of just linear and the duration

00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,740
color is infinite so it's just going to

00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,750
keep going and we've set the name so we

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,600
need to do what we did for set our

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:12,250
duration and delay and then we can say

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:12,250
it going says our first bird

00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,499
so feelin Korea are other variations

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,269
like we did with the the single-bird

00:14:16,499 --> 00:14:18,779
just set different durations different

00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:20,610
delays

00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,079
I'm not saying negative delays here

00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,610
because I want them to sort of follow

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,589
each other across the screen so it's

00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,809
delays of one two three four seconds

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:30,139
something like that and then we can see

00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:30,139
that run

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:45,580
go right

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:48,670
so what else and so this is animation I

00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:52,900
created for assembler for favoriting

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:55,510
your suppliers and when we run it it

00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,220
sort of grows shrinks fills in and we

00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:03,460
get those lovely sort of pop-up circles

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:07,330
around it so how did we do that again we

00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:11,020
turn to SVG first we create our image so

00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:12,850
we create our SVG create a path give it

00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,470
an ID and then we can move on to

00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:18,670
actually write our heart shape which is

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:21,760
nice and simple m1 2.7 four five one six

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:23,620
now kidding use something like sketch or

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,750
a some sort of vector edit there is

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,890
somewhere way where it can output this

00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,230
for you so that you don't have to write

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:32,080
yourself all credit to you if you can

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:37,200
write a heart in SVG without using an

00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,200
editor and so there we have our ship

00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:43,780
export that as an SVG and then we're

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,000
going to add the circles in afterwards

00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:49,110
we'll do this just by hand because this

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,220
is really simple it's just eight circles

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:53,470
so we just create a group for them

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:57,970
position that group in the center and

00:15:53,470 --> 00:16:00,810
then just create eight circles so our

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:03,970
next step is to create that animation

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:06,520
but as before we need to create our

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,380
initial styling for our SVG so we're set

00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,670
in a stroke a stroke width of fill color

00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,770
and then we're set in the transform

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:15,430
origin and then there's our initial

00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,900
styling for our heart so next we can

00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,990
move on to create the animation and

00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:25,480
we're going to animate the transform

00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:28,000
fill and Stroke so if we start with the

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,330
color at 33% of the way through our

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,580
animation we want the fill to amend the

00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:35,680
same color but the stroke to change and

00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:41,020
then by the end we want both the stroke

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:42,790
and the fill color to have changed the

00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,450
reason for that will become apparent in

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:48,460
a moment so then once we've done the

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:50,890
color we can look at our scale so we

00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,300
want to say by that 33% mark which when

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:55,360
our

00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:57,640
stroke has changed but the actual fill

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,680
hasn't we want the heart to shrink and

00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,840
then as it's doing the rest we want to

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,209
come to come up above its original size

00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:07,540
and then back down to its original size

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:09,400
so by setting the scale to match the

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,290
stroke color and then how about

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,580
everything else happen at the end we

00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:15,190
managed to sort of choreograph our

00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,510
animation so as it's getting smaller The

00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,730
Strokes filling in and then as it's

00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:25,000
coming back up that's when it starts to

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:28,390
fill and fill the color itself so then

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,180
we can move on to our circles and again

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:33,280
initial styling we just want to position

00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,390
them the reason for the transition there

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,310
have just been really sharp

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,960
one-millisecond is because on the

00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,430
reverse when you click it for a second

00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,050
time I don't want it to animate back in

00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:44,980
I just want it to stop

00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:46,600
and then we've positioned them there

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,120
they are all on top of each other all

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,770
eight circles and then we need to

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,070
position them in the right position so

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:55,920
here I'm using a for loop in sass but

00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,520
you could do this by hand if you wanted

00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:02,170
I'm just saying

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,870
rotate each of the circles by the the

00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:07,390
iteration that we're on and 45 degrees

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,250
so it'll increase by 45 each time and

00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:12,670
then we're going to move it out over

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:15,540
away from the center on the x-axis it's

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:18,550
important to know that if you do the

00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:20,620
translate before the rotate it will

00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:22,270
perform them in that order so it will

00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,210
move and then rotate it as opposed to

00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:27,970
rotating then moving so it's definitely

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,730
worth knowing so there we have our

00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:34,450
positions of our circles around the

00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:35,890
heart so next we just want to move those

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:38,500
cells to when it's actually active

00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:41,230
because we don't want the hearts circles

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:45,040
to be positioned around like that all of

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,600
the time so we can create some

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,330
additional styles for when it is active

00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,270
and all we're doing here is just saying

00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:53,830
for the circles we're going to transform

00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,270
so we transition the transform property

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:59,380
in the opacity property so we're going

00:18:55,270 --> 00:19:01,830
to animate the moving left and the

00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,830
fading out

00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:08,670
so this is really slowed down so you can

00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,670
see exactly what's happening

00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:21,140
and then this is the actual size and

00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:21,140
speed that it runs out on the website

00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:31,230
cool the boats were better right

00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:33,960
so what else so this is an animation I

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:36,510
created for for an M framework that I

00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,040
wrote a long time ago now and but the

00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:43,200
animation I think is still really cool

00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:45,000
and there's nothing on here that I

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,890
haven't already showed you how to do so

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,650
the majority of what's going on here is

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:52,380
just translate or transform so

00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:55,280
translating the y-axis or translating

00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:59,040
the x-axis and then I'm just hiding the

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,800
overflow so on the the slider in the

00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,090
middle that's just using steps like I

00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,830
did for the birds and it's just stepping

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,320
through the animation is supposed to be

00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,940
in smooth and then again with the scroll

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,310
in ones they're just to smooth up and

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,680
down animation so the only thing

00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:19,320
different here is the the actual drawing

00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:23,550
which happens at first so how do we draw

00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:26,070
in code we can do this with CSS and we

00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:27,690
can do this with SVG so the two

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:30,560
properties that we need to do this at

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:34,020
the stroke - array and stroke - offset

00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,270
so the circle itself I'm sorry the

00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,230
circle itself I've created a circle it's

00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:42,270
worth knowing and we set a stroke width

00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,800
color and then we've set a - array of 50

00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:46,440
so setting the - array is just gonna put

00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,660
gaps in the stroke and the number you

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,270
set inside the dasher is the number is

00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:53,160
how big the gap will be so by setting

00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,710
the gap to 50 we can see we've created a

00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,870
50 pixel gap and then a 50 pixel stroke

00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:01,980
and then a 50 pixel gap and it'll just

00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:03,720
repeat infinitely so if we take that

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,460
stroke - array and increase it to be the

00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,280
full circumference of the circle which

00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,170
in this case is 940 we have a stroke

00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,060
that covers the entire circle but we

00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:15,570
also have a gap that will cover the

00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:17,430
entire circle as well so if we then move

00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:19,650
on to offset this is where we can start

00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:22,680
offsetting where the stroke drawing

00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:24,630
starts so by setting that to 50 we

00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,640
create like a little bit of that we

00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,260
start to see 50 pixels of that gap and

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,070
the rest is of the stroke that we've

00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,410
created

00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,850
and if we set the gap to be all the way

00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:36,360
up to the circumference of our circle

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:39,540
the same as they as the - array was we

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,980
then have no stroke whatsoever we do but

00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,790
it's just hitting because it's been

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,200
pushed off and we're only seeing the gap

00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:48,060
so then we can animate that so once

00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,920
we've pushed all of our outlines out of

00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,170
the way so that we we can't see any of

00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,260
them we can animate that back into view

00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:57,060
using keyframes so I've got a keyframe

00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,950
animation here called draw and we're

00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,800
setting the stroke - offset back to zero

00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:05,430
so it's gone from 9:40 buck-20 where it

00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,870
started then all I need to do is run

00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,900
that animation so we set the animation

00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:12,270
name the duration and then I'm setting

00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,220
fill mode animation film mode here to

00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:15,660
forwards and basically all that means is

00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,580
once you reach the end of the animation

00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:20,040
don't go back to what its original value

00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:23,310
was just keep the keep the values from

00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:25,350
the end and then when we run that you

00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:32,490
can see we've drawn the outline of the

00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:35,370
circle so literally all I've done there

00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,990
is just apply two different different

00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,130
durations and different delays and

00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:43,950
things like that and then the whole

00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:48,960
thing gets drawn on Lord so one more

00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:52,590
example this is where the the talk

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,350
really came from about a year year and a

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,600
half ago I brought a article for web

00:22:55,350 --> 00:23:00,120
designer Marc and as part of that we

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,710
went and looked at a whole bunch of

00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,810
animations from around the web that were

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,490
doing either using flash or JavaScript

00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:07,890
or something like that and we looked to

00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:11,010
see if we could recreate them all in CSS

00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:12,540
and the whole point of this was this was

00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:15,870
the cover for the the piece when it came

00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,940
out it was an actual print magazine so

00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:20,670
we decided that we would also on top of

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,260
that doing animation of the cover using

00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:25,350
all of the techniques that that we've

00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,420
discussed so I thought it would be nice

00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:30,540
way to event my talk would be to talk

00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:35,280
about this particular animation and how

00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:36,660
we got there so the the bit I'd like to

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,140
talk about specifically is this little

00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:39,140
jumping I

00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:46,940
so how did I do it so again it's it's

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:48,500
all SVG but then we jumped into our into

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,660
our code and we we start creating our

00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,270
keyframes so we're saying here that our

00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,350
keyframes called bounce and then out 25%

00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,330
of the way through the animation we're

00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,910
going to move up along the y-axis 24

00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:01,370
pixels and then by 35% the animation

00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:07,990
were back down on the ground so when we

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:11,000
run that it works but it's kind of dull

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:13,880
doesn't really have any life to it it

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,190
doesn't feel real it doesn't even

00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:20,480
doesn't even feel like a cartoon it just

00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,950
looks a bit bland and so we want to

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,840
breathe some life into our animation we

00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:26,180
want to see if we can sprinkle some of

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,920
that Pixar magic on it so when I need to

00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:29,300
do something like that what I tend to do

00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,190
is turn to storyboarding and

00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,500
storyboarding allows you to quickly plan

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:36,440
your animations as you can see you do

00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:38,200
not need to be able to draw um but

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,240
basically all this is doing is saying

00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,250
number one is where we will start number

00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,100
two we're going to duck down ready to to

00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:48,230
jump number three is reaching the top of

00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,970
our jump number four is the London and

00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,830
then five and six is that kind of

00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:55,880
springing back into position once you've

00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:59,780
landed so once you've got your plan how

00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:01,370
do you call it that so step one which

00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:04,100
we're saying is ducking down ready to

00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:05,240
jump we're going to scale the y-axis so

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:08,330
we're going to squash it along the

00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,510
y-axis 80% so we're going to scale from

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:13,430
in this big down to here and the next

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:14,840
point is our actual jump so at that

00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,330
point we're going to move along the

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,370
y-axis like we had before up 24 pixels

00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,410
but then also going to bring the scale

00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,510
back up to its normal size because when

00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:25,780
you jump you tend to stretch out as you

00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:29,330
reach the top of your jump I've also

00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:32,540
there I'm bringing the animation on 25

00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:35,180
to 27 percent of the way through by

00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:37,280
having that sort of that little bit in

00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,380
the middle of 25 26 and 27 where it's

00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,640
all got the same properties it means a

00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,900
little sort of hung at the top of the

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:47,420
jump a little bit before coming back

00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:49,130
down so then step 3 was the London so 35

00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,140
percent of our animation we're landing

00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,519
again we've gone we've ducked down we've

00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,109
gone off we come in

00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:57,709
back down for the London's or translate

00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:59,029
why is it zero our scale is a 95 percent

00:25:57,709 --> 00:26:01,359
of its original size because when you

00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:04,190
land you tend to shrink slightly and

00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:06,769
then our last one is bringing that sort

00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,809
of spring back to to where its original

00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:11,899
position was and again I'm finishing

00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:14,359
here at like 40 percent because I wanted

00:26:11,899 --> 00:26:17,229
to run and I wanted to repeat infinitely

00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:22,009
but I'd I want that delay between

00:26:17,229 --> 00:26:24,619
between repeats so again that springing

00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:30,320
back is so we've dropped down and 95 and

00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:34,249
then we go back up to 1 so really we've

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,649
we've added 5 or 6 different steps to

00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:39,469
this animation and we've managed to make

00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:41,299
it look a lot more alive and feel much

00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:46,789
more playful than it did before oh it

00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:49,339
was just up straight back down and then

00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:51,919
in con I in context with all of the

00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:53,690
others you can see we're just doing the

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,209
same thing with the ears so the the

00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:59,239
flushing is again use the same animation

00:26:56,209 --> 00:27:01,070
they're just offset delays same with the

00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:06,649
the jumping eyes they both use the same

00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:08,089
animation it's just different delays so

00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:10,639
all of the animations I've shown you

00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:12,950
have in common well they're all created

00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:16,190
with this I have CSS and the majority of

00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:18,259
them were created with SVG but most of

00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,079
all it's it's that the majority of them

00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:23,599
are simple and effective it's it's

00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:25,549
simple in its idea it's not you know

00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,429
trying to be overly complicated it's not

00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:30,619
trying to do too much and I think that's

00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:32,869
kind of the key to a lot of animation is

00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:35,979
finding something that that's quite

00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:37,849
simple but really grabs your attention

00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:40,099
so hope I've managed to leave you

00:27:37,849 --> 00:27:42,919
feeling inspired and to go have a play

00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:44,329
with SVG and CSS animations there's a

00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:46,669
collection of everything I've talked

00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,899
about over on code pen I will tweet that

00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:49,700
link out there so if you want to follow

00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:54,940
me out learn I'll make sure that gets

00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,940
out there and thank you

00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:02,210
