Description: 
	Sure we all know about the power of CSS transitions, we use them day in and day out to animate the state of a button or link; but CSS is capable of so much more when it comes to animation, especially when paired with SVG, and itâ€™s about time we started utilising it.

Steven has a passion for design and the web in particular, he spends much of his time experimenting with upcoming technologies. He has wrote a number of articles, features and tutorials covering a number of frontend topics such as CSS Grid, Flexbox, Responsive Typography, CSS Animation and SVG.
