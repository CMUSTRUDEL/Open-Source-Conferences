Variable Fonts & Readability: The Rising of Custom Reading Experiences

http://cssconfbp.rocks/speakers/damien/

A good reading experience is something highly personal: We all need different environments, we all love different font faces and we all have a specific medium at the bottom of our heart. With only one design, how can we accommodate everyone? Variable fonts and CSS are here to help us offering inclusive reading experiences.

Damien is a queer product designer focusing on accessibility and fighting for a more inclusive web. Speaker in Europe, they talk in web conferences about using design and CSS to craft more inclusive experiences. Design systems & Accessibility Lead for Castor EDC in Amsterdam, their inner self is a wild raccoon.

that's more than perfect thank you so

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:14,730
let's talk about like reading how do we

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,100
read and how the hell like how we can

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,740
help our users on internet to read

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,590
better and if I want to discuss this

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,260
topic it's because we all read like it

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,930
can be in books it can be in your couch

00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,289
with a really nice atmosphere it can be

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:35,160
since doing a stage with vastly picture

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:38,309
but it's still reading or a bit less

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,890
pictures and both texts it's sometimes

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,329
about newspaper magazine just having a

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,579
really huge headache because of the news

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:48,210
we are also reading more and more on

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:52,050
screens all the kind of screens and

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,840
media and almost everywhere and that's

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,039
why I wanted to discuss with you today

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,100
reading because that's something we're

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:02,370
doing every day that's something that we

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,769
all are doing because even if we don't

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,010
want to you're reading advertisements in

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,560
the streets and usually we don't really

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,700
know how does it work

00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:16,890
so hi Damien so really nice presentation

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,689
so we'll be really quick on that but my

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,180
twitter handle is I am evil oh and I

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,189
love Twitter at least I love discussing

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,830
with people on Twitter way easier than

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,110
face-to-face because in general I try

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,820
never to speak with people which is

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,329
today a bad example but like that's not

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,619
entirely true

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:36,060
I love discussing with people I'm just

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:38,430
really good at creating awkward

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,770
experiences with people really fun for

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,259
people more quad for me but you will see

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,020
that can be nice and I like just to do

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,790
some content warning so I'm using quite

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,159
a colorful language so please pardon my

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,320
french and there will be few videos

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,990
including one with really annoying sound

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,149
I'm really sensible to sound but I'm

00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:58,950
really sorry in advance and usually my

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,500
sense of timing is really pretty pretty

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,149
bad so I will do my best to speak with

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,780
you about reading raccoons and Jack

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:07,049
Kurata

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,670
so buckle up it will be quite and quite

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,060
intense but let's talk about readability

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,700
and first why and the main reason why

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,970
it's because I can

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,800
I have a permit saying that I can do

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,650
what I want and today with you it will

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,200
be about a really complex cognitive

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,730
process which is readability really

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,170
complex because even if most of the

00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,050
people are doing this since the youngest

00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,210
age it's an acquired skill like you need

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,040
to learn to know how to read and it's

00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,950
not something easy because you need

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,680
first to learn the alphabet and then you

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:42,230
need to learn what is this kind weird

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,940
mix of letters together that are words

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:47,270
you need to learn morphology orthography

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,460
semantics phonology and once you have

00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:52,970
all of that you can start learning like

00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:56,540
languages and the issue is that it's not

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:58,730
a life long skill like you can get you

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,620
can acquire reading difficulties like in

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:04,040
your life it's not something you will

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,980
keep like until your lecture last day

00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,650
and the thing is the web is many

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,780
text-based and aside of the web being

00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,560
mainly text-based add the debate on burn

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:18,680
on a burn but I'm sorry it will be burn

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,110
so the thing is the texts that are

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,790
composing our website that is the root

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,010
element of our website is not accessible

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,800
because not everybody can read it and

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:30,140
outside of reading impairments there is

00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,850
one good example I'm not English speaker

00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,470
in native so English for me was

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,670
something I had to learn I was in front

00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:36,320
of a lot of website and not

00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,930
understanding one word of what people

00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,550
attend to me I hope that today is better

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,959
and I can hear my English and you can

00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:46,519
understand English and not sure about

00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:49,070
myself but we will try to see so reading

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,690
is really important and it's now also in

00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,670
the way card so in the guidelines for

00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:56,180
accessibility it's one of the success

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:58,430
criteria it's saying a lot of stuff

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,920
because we cog but mainly the

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:04,160
information here is the fact that it's

00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,080
about text pacing and that's one awful

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,850
thing because if you're taking just the

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,010
accessibility guidelines and if you're

00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,810
doing the CSS or the JavaScript for your

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:13,760
accessibility form to make your website

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,720
accessible the only thing you have to be

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,680
careful about is text pacing and

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,450
unfortunately there is a lot of studies

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,820
on dyslexia showing that we don't care

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,350
about we don't care so much about tech

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,419
spacing that's not the most important

00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,230
element but still that's the only one we

00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:29,420
can measure

00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,880
so light heart space between paragraphs

00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:35,930
space between words and space between

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,690
letters really important and before

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,130
going on CSS and the phones I just

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:44,600
wanted to see with you

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,830
why readability through dyslexia and one

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,840
of the reason why is because in

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,850
accessibility as usual the idea is

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,890
always to help the most impaired people

00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,260
to be able to help everybody if you're

00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,630
solving issues for the people having the

00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:00,200
highest and the cap in front of some

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:02,600
actions you can help everybody so it's a

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,240
same with readability dyslexia is one of

00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,190
the most common reading impairment it's

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,240
more or less 10% of the population

00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:13,580
worldwide 10% of the population it's

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:16,130
huge and in some countries in Europe

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,020
it's even worse in a way like for

00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:21,020
example Scandinavian languages because

00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:24,980
of the really big amount of vowels and

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:27,200
like sounds in the language they are

00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,890
like up to 15 to 17 percent of the

00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,960
population it's really a lot and the

00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,910
thing is you can try to find this like

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,500
sick child but it's not always inside

00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,360
childhood too because when you learn a

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,220
new language you're facing your sounds

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,710
you're facing new things that you did

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,140
not know because not part of your first

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,910
or second or third languages and this

00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,910
can trigger also some kind of dyslexia

00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:52,670
and finally because this sixth it's not

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,440
only about reading it's about a lot of

00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:56,390
stuff happening in your mind in your

00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,830
cognitive processes mainly about

00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:02,330
problem-solving and this is impacting a

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:06,050
lot of the way not only revision

00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:09,170
internet but we just navigate so how do

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:12,280
we read them the first thing is the fact

00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:16,250
that reading is not so much about the

00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:20,000
text it's about the sounds that we make

00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:22,070
it's about the reason that we are having

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,340
when we're speaking it's about the music

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:27,800
that we're creating so when we are

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,080
reading a text even just for self

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,750
we are always hearing a voice that's the

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,210
way our brain is trying to make sense of

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,220
a texts you are hearing it to understand

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,970
it to understand it and that's really

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:43,760
important because this voice will impact

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:46,070
sometimes even more than the word itself

00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,290
and themselves like the feeling that you

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,420
will get from this text it will impact

00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,330
the way you will understand it it will

00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:56,780
impact a lot the way you will digest

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:59,090
this text so reading is mainly of

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:02,450
phonological process I love more than

00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,280
three synapse like so phonological

00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,710
basically means that it's the

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,400
association between a sound and the

00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:12,560
meaning and that's how reading work so

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,360
basically like this when you're trying

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,000
to read there is like two different

00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,980
voice in your head when trying to read

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,690
it and make it a loud one trying to

00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,870
understand it and another one which is

00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:27,680
the word around Eve trying to interrupt

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:29,210
all of that and if you need to create

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,630
this sound you need to take the words

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,940
and to make it a sound and for that

00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:37,010
reading is using our eye but it's not

00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,260
linear at all even if all our texts i

00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,810
bet are based on lines it's not senior

00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,760
at all because we're reading with a ball

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,620
like our eyes are kind of a ball so you

00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,660
cannot really like move it easily with

00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:50,120
six muscle on a line so we're doing

00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,800
something called cycads so basically

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,470
when we are reading we're just jumping a

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,030
lot from places to places from group of

00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,310
letters to other group of letters and

00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:01,940
between each of the cycads we have

00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:03,470
something called fixation so it's the

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,180
fact that we're stopping on a group of

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,000
letters before going to another one

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,830
and during this fixation it's the moment

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,470
where the reading experience is

00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:14,120
happening so at this moment everything

00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:17,450
is thought to be blurry around ookubo

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,550
feathers except the group of letter

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,130
itself so we are dancing like funerals

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,110
and all the shapes are round and that's

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,940
the reading moment and that's how we can

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,700
calculate the readability of a texts

00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,850
usually i tracking counting the number

00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:35,060
and length the duration of saccades and

00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:37,339
the duration of fixation so it's less

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:39,260
about words that it is about staring at

00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:41,419
screens and that's quite nice because

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,480
that's will that something we'll love to

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:46,400
do every day but it's like it's not real

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,190
about staring at screen it's essentially

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,200
about identifying shapes shapes of

00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:54,130
paragraph with one more time do we care

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:57,009
because I hate as much as I love

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,649
despite these texts first we will like

00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:01,209
look at the shape of a paragraph then

00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:04,209
trying to find the different words

00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:08,980
within the paragraph to identify more or

00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:12,009
less what it is about and this is our

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,529
reading experience on string not linear

00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:17,130
at all and that's why you can probably

00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:19,480
read if despite the misspelling because

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:22,360
we don't care about the order of letters

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,029
we just want to recognize shapes as I

00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,569
said to sound and this is happening

00:09:25,029 --> 00:09:28,769
thanks to you letters identify features

00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:32,230
letters

00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:34,300
phones variable phones that's where the

00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,920
link exists between the two things and

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,139
the I didn't think features it's

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,660
basically the top part and the lower

00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:44,199
part of the word that can explain why we

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:47,500
can read more easily lowercase word than

00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:49,540
uppercase and when you have mistakes

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,089
that's also why you can identify more

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:56,290
easily that bubble is problem and not

00:09:52,089 --> 00:10:00,790
the awful blob of letters that is the

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:03,790
last one because it's about sound like

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,500
it's also like the change of letters

00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,720
needs to happen in the sense that it's

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,389
part of the same syllabus it's them it's

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,100
part of the same group of sound and in

00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:13,750
the two first ones we have the same

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,360
number of sounds that's in the last one

00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:20,439
so that's how we can easily read text

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:23,370
despite installation I know it's really

00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:27,540
early in the morning my brain hurts too

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,540
but here's something for you

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:43,079
I love trash pandas it's the nicest

00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:46,480
thing ever

00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:49,930
so what's the point of all of that the

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,000
point is like we need to design for

00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,310
readability and we need also to

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,139
implement for readability and the best

00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,029
way to learn it to look at airports

00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:00,310
because they have to do that in a really

00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:01,959
stressful environment which is a moment

00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,699
where people just want to think about

00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:05,260
the vacation just want to go in the

00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:07,149
plane and don't want to do any

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,699
pathfinding and any game in the airports

00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:11,230
so let's just take a look quickly at

00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:13,810
what they're doing and the first thing

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,990
that they are doing its owning only one

00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:18,550
phone face only one everything is

00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:21,370
written with the same thing with the

00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:25,540
same phone things and a series of

00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:28,120
variations of ways this is really

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,250
helping for the like content charge and

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,769
also what they're doing it's not only

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:35,529
the way but it's really subtle but

00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:39,310
they're playing with the tracking

00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:42,940
between two letters like tteyuu is going

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:46,360
together so the two is way closer than B

00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:50,850
and D for example so still one phone

00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:53,500
face a series of different font wave and

00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:56,410
different tracking and you can find this

00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:59,680
consistency in the background with C Phi

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,089
which is also really close and way

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,899
closer that would be a C and E together

00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:07,540
for example so basically that's what

00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:13,420
they're doing it's readable it's

00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:17,319
efficient that's great but can we do

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:20,140
better because it's static it's great it

00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,980
works its efficient but it's not working

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,250
for everybody

00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,079
first you need to speak English that's

00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:30,209
something you need at least recognize

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,380
letters and numbers but also it's not

00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:34,329
adapted to everybody some people don't

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:36,069
like the contrast between yellow and

00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:37,810
black because it's really aggressive

00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:40,540
it's one of the highest contrast you can

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:43,390
find great for readability not so great

00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:48,040
for autistic people so some autistic

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:54,010
people so great but not cast

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:55,390
so can we do better ah the sound is not

00:12:54,010 --> 00:13:00,520
there sorry

00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:02,740
so yes I'm sorry

00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:06,700
and yes we did because that's basically

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:09,790
what happened with with variable phones

00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:12,700
it's not only we can do it like there is

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:16,120
now a way to do that with only one file

00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,460
so variable font will help you doing

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,640
will help you do the extra mile and

00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,500
doing like all the effort to go from

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,500
just offering a readable experience for

00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,410
everybody to offering a way to customize

00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,120
the experience for people and this is

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:35,230
important because accessibility is

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:39,250
really really really really hard and if

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:42,190
it's really hard because it's something

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:46,000
that you will never manage to do

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:50,220
entirely you cannot create a fully 100%

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,950
accessible solution like you have to do

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,360
at some moment choices between solutions

00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,370
because not everybody's learned not

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,779
everything is compatible and because

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,820
there is no one fits all solution the

00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:04,510
only way to be accessible if you do

00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:06,959
customization and the creation of

00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,520
accessible and inclusive experience is

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,490
something quite interesting because it's

00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,589
about people quite interesting but it's

00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:18,420
also about collaboration and

00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:21,070
customization collaboration because

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,290
first we need to collaborate with our

00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,450
users we need to understand their needs

00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:28,480
we need to know that what we're doing is

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:31,990
meaningful for them but also because it

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,010
can help creating a lot of collaboration

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:37,330
between designers and engineers

00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:38,770
everybody wants to do accessible on

00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,510
accessible web like I never heard

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:44,290
someone saying yeah no I don't want to

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:47,110
like I don't care okay I don't care I've

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:49,660
heard it but nobody wants to do this on

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:53,740
purpose like being like I want to create

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:56,260
an inaccessible interface so usually the

00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,450
gap between yeah I'm really interested

00:14:56,260 --> 00:15:00,640
and I'm making accessible websites it's

00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:01,100
not so much about skills because you can

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,710
learn

00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,590
on internet it's more about discussions

00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:08,300
on collaboration you need first to share

00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:11,780
the same language between designers and

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:14,300
engineers because language is a really

00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,010
root element to reality the best way to

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,980
share common reality between people is

00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,420
to share some language and designers and

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,850
engineers don't really know anymore how

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:26,960
to discuss together but variable phones

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:29,030
can be a solution for that and also it's

00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,210
a good way to customize experiences for

00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:35,420
our users and to offer them the way to

00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:37,240
do what they need to do to be

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:43,430
comfortable with what you're offering

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:45,110
and reading is really about this because

00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,210
we have different we all have different

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,650
capabilities some people can read like a

00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:51,260
whole book during the whole day without

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,910
any break just reading reading reading

00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,940
reading reading if I'm starting reading

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:59,540
a book in 15 minutes I'm doing five

00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:01,220
other stuff every time newspaper books

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,750
whatever I'm just doing five other stuff

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,430
at the same time so we all have

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,500
different capabilities attention span

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,400
but we also have different media that we

00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:12,890
that we appreciate some people will only

00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:15,860
read on screens if it's about with a Inc

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:18,320
for example like Amazon Kindle and all

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,930
kind of stuff other people really want a

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,000
book some people don't care it's like

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,130
different app ability is different media

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,060
and because we're all not read in the

00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:30,530
same way so sorry medium sorry all the

00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:33,980
website forcing you to read a lot of

00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:36,230
content in one uniform way there is no

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,390
standard standard like readable

00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,890
experiences and that's something you can

00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,360
find in all the products in the markets

00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:45,590
that you can like that you can use to

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:48,290
read some contents I have a really

00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:50,840
strong hate for a MP but that's also

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:53,660
because while creating the web next to

00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:56,330
the web there is medium trying to

00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:59,360
recreate that this kind of like package

00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:01,160
of readability like it's supposed to be

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,080
readable but not for everybody

00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:04,880
there is solutions that will take the

00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,070
content and offer it to you in a way

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,710
that is a bit more customizable and

00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:11,300
that's sometimes it's quite nice because

00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:14,270
you can at least find what you're more

00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,360
comfortable with and there is

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,829
RSS feeds the website themselves and

00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:20,420
assistive technologies that will adapt

00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:22,900
entirely the content that you're

00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,579
offering to the needs of the users and

00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,679
basically variable phones will bring you

00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:29,750
all over there with like the

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,900
customization possible for your products

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,200
and in a way if you have to see it this

00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,559
way

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,360
it's basically viable phones are moving

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,059
more and more from the experimentation

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,920
stage to offering the same kind of

00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:44,600
experience that we have with a font size

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,990
to go from size to girl are a bad idea

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:50,300
by the way just so so you we can stop

00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,850
doing this because browsers can do that

00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,920
and it's not the case with variable

00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:57,380
phones like you cannot rely entirely on

00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,780
browsers to do that because it's really

00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,450
dependent on the fonts that you chose

00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:05,090
and what are the different capabilities

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:07,190
so thanks for asking

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,440
Damian how do we implement such a thing

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,020
like should we give complete freedom to

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,400
our users and as usual when someone is

00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:18,920
asking should we give complete freedom

00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:28,820
to our users hell no hell no no no no no

00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:34,000
never never never never never with

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:38,000
what's happening in here I'm a freedom

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,720
so viable like viable phones what is the

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,950
variable part of a viable phones the

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,900
variable part is in fact for access and

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:53,840
it looks like CSS and all the modern

00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:57,230
capabilities really love access so here

00:18:53,840 --> 00:19:00,890
we have like one which is maybe best

00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:03,500
known so the weight of a font and here

00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:05,470
you can play like with sorry with weight

00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,020
and a value be like we'll value after

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:11,720
it's not revolutionary but it's quite

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:15,440
nice because the main difference is like

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:18,170
two main difference are first you have

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,440
only one file quite nice for performance

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:24,200
quite nice optimization but also you can

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,410
do really nice transitions there is no

00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,580
jump from one state to the other there

00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:30,409
is a really smooth

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,850
transition because it's based on vector

00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:36,140
and you can easily go from one to the

00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:39,740
other so wait the second one is width

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:42,669
and for this one it's something that

00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:46,309
people love to play with in InDesign

00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:48,049
that it can be really awful for the

00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:50,210
readability but at the same time really

00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:52,760
nice because you can basically expand

00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:55,250
the weight of a letter but still keeping

00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:58,340
something which is consistent which is

00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:01,130
still designed to be like expanded in a

00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:03,830
specific way even when it's really

00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,330
condensed it's still readable I would

00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,929
not advise going this condensed but

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:11,240
still it's readable and only working

00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:16,659
with CSS and the same working with

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:19,970
transitions Roman versus italic but

00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:22,519
please don't do Italy first because

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:25,730
readability is really impaired with

00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:28,580
italic and also because usually most of

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:30,380
like most of the really cheap fonts that

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,740
we will find don't have a real italic

00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,539
tetris-like slant the folks but quite

00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:39,320
nice view too just for the optimization

00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:44,450
part only one file during doing the

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:48,500
Roman and the italic here just no

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:51,740
transition and the last one because we

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:54,049
always need the last one you can slant

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:58,669
you can do some some slant like you can

00:20:54,049 --> 00:21:01,639
change the the angle like the Dom the

00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:03,740
degree of the fonts you can already do

00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:06,559
that with rotation of each character

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:09,980
which is a pain but here the good thing

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:12,950
is that the baseline stay the same so

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:16,399
characters until are more and more

00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:19,789
slanted but the line is still the same

00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:22,880
so same here working with vectors really

00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:27,289
nice for transitions and all of that is

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:30,200
working with one line of CSS which is

00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:32,570
really not so difficult and in project

00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,149
doing for example like projecting react

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:38,120
with style components assuming that we

00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:40,039
can offer a full customization easily

00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,100
thanks to this kind of solution based on

00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:45,610
changing the value with JavaScript

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:48,160
so these are the foxes but as usual I

00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:51,370
love adding a bit of bonus so there is a

00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:55,240
bonus one it's not really an access but

00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:58,360
kind of so it's the optical size the

00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,690
optical size is a concept in in

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,540
topography which is really important we

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:07,330
completely lost it in font files in the

00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:09,970
web we recreated it with having a lot of

00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:12,100
different variation of font weight and

00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:15,280
declaration in CSS and changing the

00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,410
classes changing the declaration but now

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,870
we can do this just from a phone file

00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:24,430
which means that the fonts can be only

00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:27,730
one font again and fully adapted to what

00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:30,130
we want the user to experience so this

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,140
can be really a great game changer for

00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,870
the way we are loading phones and the

00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,850
way we are doing performance because

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,590
only one file loading a bit of

00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,580
everything

00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:42,460
subsetting can be nice in this case to

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:45,520
not load everything but still one file

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,570
and you can set within this file a

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,630
variety of presets

00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:53,290
preset like this so the optical size

00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:57,100
it's a mix of everything it's the fact

00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:59,260
that you can change the way you can

00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:01,240
change like the space of characters you

00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,220
can change how they behave we can change

00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,480
the body of it you can change the sign

00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,370
you can choose everything because

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,380
everything is based on vector and the

00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:12,370
idea is the fact that the type designer

00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:15,190
will set breakpoints like will CSS and

00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:17,050
at specific breakpoints we will have a

00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,030
different position for the vectors and

00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:23,890
we can move easily from one to the other

00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:25,750
and that's how we can recreate the kind

00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:28,270
of layout that we have in magazine for

00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:31,630
example because this is already existing

00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:33,490
in CSS a lot it's in design system it's

00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:36,100
what we call usually like the different

00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,260
text variations bodies small tags

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:42,580
caption legend like all these kind of

00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:45,190
things are different creative ways to

00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:49,750
create different optical sights like if

00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:52,420
we see the one made by Shopify supplies

00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,950
as a design system you find it here

00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,100
there is display small there is body

00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:59,169
there is subheading

00:23:55,100 --> 00:24:01,340
and all of that relying on only one font

00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:03,080
so now thanks to this kind of

00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:06,380
capabilities we can go from one font

00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:13,029
with one star per different font way to

00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:16,600
one song and one compile and that's

00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:21,230
mainly for me how we can recreate

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:24,049
accessibility like features with this

00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:26,779
kind of solutions for like with web

00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:28,759
fonts like it's it's basically the best

00:24:26,779 --> 00:24:31,129
way we can have now to propose an

00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:33,139
experience where we can have like some

00:24:31,129 --> 00:24:34,669
switcher some way to customize we can

00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:37,519
let people going from one process to

00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:42,049
another process like to have something a

00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:45,350
bit like more build something a bit more

00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:49,970
like with more ascendant with Madison we

00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:52,669
can work on that and thanks to that

00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:55,100
there is one linked bonus it's the same

00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:58,159
more less but it's what it's offering us

00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:00,980
it's offering us to define also custom

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:04,669
access optical size is what at the

00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:07,220
beginning one custom acts so that's why

00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:09,080
it's a bit linked but this can also

00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,789
allow you to work with the designers to

00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,960
create for example a variation for

00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:16,490
dyslexic people because open dyslexic

00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,120
open dyslexia is definitely not a

00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,220
solution

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,750
in the sense of offering just this as a

00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,549
relative is not working for this texting

00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,769
people because it's targeting only a

00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:26,450
really small part of the sexy people

00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:29,210
they need to have like this kind of

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,100
optimization but you can just create

00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,610
like a lot of different custom access

00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:36,559
defined with four-letter tags and in

00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,659
this case in accessibility you can ask

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,919
tech designers or you can try to work

00:25:38,659 --> 00:25:41,330
with the type that you were designed

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,399
like that you were working with and

00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,080
trying to merge all the phone together

00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:48,080
like all the phone files together in

00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,179
only one by working on three main axes

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,789
the first one is the asunder and des

00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:55,570
under length the second one is the ball

00:25:52,789 --> 00:25:59,269
size and the last one is the ball shape

00:25:55,570 --> 00:26:03,409
so basically what does this it means

00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:05,629
that you can change easily the length of

00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:08,000
the the southern part and the a southern

00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:08,820
part that also the weight of it and this

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,529
can reel

00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:13,350
be helpful if you want to make the

00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:16,139
experience more readable but you can

00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:19,830
also play with the thickness of the ball

00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:22,139
so on the B side although the main core

00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:24,360
part of the letter and something you can

00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:28,049
play with and that's the best way

00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:30,450
usually for typefaces to be more

00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:33,630
readable because if you make it if you

00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:37,169
make the body a bit heavier and if you

00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:39,720
make the most of the weight of it on the

00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:42,509
baseline it's a good way for people to

00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:45,600
make the difference between a b.a.p

00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:49,860
energy especially if you also offer the

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,629
the idea of having a bit more lengthy

00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,950
ascendant and ascendant because in this

00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:55,110
case there is absolutely no confusion

00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:58,289
between what's going up and what's going

00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:02,279
down and you can play with almost any of

00:26:58,289 --> 00:27:04,799
the variation so you can easily with

00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:07,110
only one file move from like the regular

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,000
text that you would have to the one on

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:12,809
the top

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,820
same for serif versus Sun serif because

00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:17,820
it's entirely based on vector it can

00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,200
only be just a variation with the

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,840
optical size that you move from one to

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,419
the other and optical size are working

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,730
with like font size so you just have to

00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:29,190
set for each font size which one do you

00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:30,870
want to use we're gonna take another

00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,059
crack at Whitman coming in there like

00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:37,009
five times what are you gonna do annoy

00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:37,009
him into talking haha

00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:47,500
so I hope that I was not doing this with

00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:49,030
you like just shouting for like almost

00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,250
30 minutes in you hear this kind of

00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:53,530
information because you can experiment

00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:55,720
quite easily and you can have a better

00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:58,420
success than Jack Peralta in this scene

00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:01,390
and the way to experiment is basically

00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:03,430
doing this like there is a fault that

00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:06,010
you can use doing this and the variation

00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:08,260
of the font size is helping to move

00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:10,690
other font weight is helping to move the

00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:12,670
horse for example but you can also do

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:15,580
this kind of things which are way more

00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:18,070
useful because accessibility is not only

00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:20,350
about how do we read but it can also be

00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,570
about what is the thing that we get from

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:25,300
the texts for example like with

00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:27,580
different text here we can have a

00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,820
different feeling a feeling of anxiety

00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:33,010
and we could also try to reduce anxiety

00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:36,130
by providing different variation of

00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:38,350
fonts so people can reduce the wave and

00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,540
the emotional width of a font size for

00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:43,600
example so these are the kind of changes

00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:46,180
that you can do with only one file you

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,610
can also do color changes so if you have

00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,740
like a website of or brand that are

00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:53,110
using all full color that are not

00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,960
accessible you can also rely on this to

00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:57,760
change the branding and the logo first

00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,010
of all the font in the logo to another

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,960
color based automatically on different

00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:07,060
choices I know it's easier to change a

00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:10,270
level but it's cool and one of the last

00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:12,070
example it's this one it's the website

00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:14,980
of a typography web typography

00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:19,000
conference called unperson and all of

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,980
this is only one font file which in the

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,900
end is really amazing because the last

00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:25,870
argument for one font file next

00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:28,390
performance is it's only one from fair

00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:31,480
to replace so all the people that rely

00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:34,150
on replacing specific and main font file

00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:38,320
in style sheets for accessibility reason

00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:40,540
it means only one file replaced in these

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,010
websites to get a correct experience if

00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:48,190
you cannot read the text over there so

00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:50,850
Indian 3-3 small information if you're

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:53,140
really interested by experimentation in

00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:53,880
variable phones I would really advise

00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,520
you to follow

00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,710
Davidge Jonathan Ross amazing type

00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,210
designer doing a subscription model for

00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,710
almost nothing and every month are

00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:04,770
getting a new typeface that you can

00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:06,690
experiment with but also what BBC

00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,460
experimentation were because they played

00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:11,550
a lot with this and that created some

00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:14,310
really nice try and experiences on

00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:16,530
variable fonts also on subtitles to see

00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:19,080
how it can help making subtitles more

00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:21,270
efficient and to visit V fonts calm

00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:23,010
which is a listing of all the variable

00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:25,380
forms that you can use at the moment

00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:27,060
like bold well-known and access praxis

00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:29,760
which is just a website giving you a lot

00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:30,240
of information on in the end how does it

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,290
work

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,350
so one fun filter will demo so I hope

00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:39,190
that you're ready to implement that and

00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:45,519
thank you

00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:45,519
