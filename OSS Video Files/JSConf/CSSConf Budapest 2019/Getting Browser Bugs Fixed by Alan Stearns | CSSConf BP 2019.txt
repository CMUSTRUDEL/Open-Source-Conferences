Description: 
	When you run into a browser bug, what can you do? I’ll give how-to steps ranging from a quick vote on a bug through submitting a test case, all with real-life stories on how effective some extra effort can be. At the end of the talk listeners will have the resources to submit bug reports with W3C cross-browser tests that can be incorporated in every browser’s test systems. This gives the best chances for fixing the problem, and ensures browsers will regression test the fix for eternity.

Alan does Web standards and web component development at Adobe, also Co-chair of the CSS Working Group at the W3C
