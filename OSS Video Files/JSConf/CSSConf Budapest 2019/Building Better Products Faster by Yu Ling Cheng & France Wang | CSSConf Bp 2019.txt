Title: Building Better Products Faster by Yu Ling Cheng & France Wang | CSSConf Bp 2019
Publication date: 2019-11-05

Description: 
	Original title: Building Better Products Faster: DevUx is the new DevOps

“Front-end development has gotten trickier over the years. As new frameworks enable more complex behaviour, UX expectations have also risen. Yet, we still work the old way: Product defines features, designers make mock-ups, then developers integrate them. Side effects include: blocking dependencies, rework, misunderstanding, frustration, for everyone involved.

In this talk, we will provide you with a proven starter kit to improve all your future collaborations, among other things how to:

- define the right process from the first concept of the feature to its design to its implementation on the app
- define the perfect mock-up for painless design handoff
- provide technical insights during the design process
- involve the designer in your development process for a finishing touch

Join our movement and start growing a DevUx culture on your projects: build better, work faster, be happier!”

What attracted Yu Ling to web development was being able to get visible results quickly. After an 8-month entrepreneurial adventure she joined Theodo to sharpen her CTO skills and build apps to grow businesses. Today, as a lead developer, she puts her energy on making her dreams of flawless Dev-Ux collaboration come true.

France had always been wondering if there was a way to be both creative and analytic, to solve problems as well as think out of the box. And then, she found UX/UI design. Now, she is a lead designer at BAM where she has spread her passion for atomic design, typography, and building amazing products with the help of the devs on her teams.

00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:10,050
hi I'm Judy I'm a developer hi i'm fran

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,250
from a designer by the way how many

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:17,250
designers do we have today not a lot but

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,770
as expected as a mostly tech conference

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:25,890
but how many developers work with

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:28,170
designers so that's of us today and well

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,230
we're very excited to be here today and

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,480
spark to dev UX culture so what step UX

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,340
it's basically well the idea of

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,940
spreading the love between designers and

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,210
developers finally so just a bit about

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,390
myself so I'm a little developer at

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,250
theater it's a service company and what

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,520
I do is help my client build new

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,160
products so this whole story about dev

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,370
u8 started actually with the project so

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,770
a year ago I was on this project and I

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:02,280
have to build a chat service in six

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,489
months so the project starts and the

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,680
designer sends me all the mock-ups and

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,140
actually I get stuck at the first

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,360
feature because I have to display this

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,140
chat bubble but I don't have the icons

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,570
so I asked the designer for the icon and

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,780
he sent me this and actually I cannot

00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:25,470
work with this blue background so I

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:28,229
asked for the icon on me and then we're

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,030
working on the remote so the designer is

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:32,369
not there and I have to wait for the

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,470
icon and I just cannot just go there and

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,950
poke him and say yeah give me the icon

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,829
please give me the icon so I wait and I

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,020
guess and I get this nice PNG but then I

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,909
realize hey colors should be

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,009
customizable and actually I cannot do

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,829
that with the PNG I I really would like

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:53,060
an SVG format so I asked for an SVG

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:56,130
format and I wait for the fight to come

00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,930
so finally after all those back and

00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,939
forth about the stupid icon and

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,380
basically I wasted half a day on this

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:06,180
well I finally get to finish my feature

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,860
so he must hear the frustration in my

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,569
voice when I tell this story but at that

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,080
time I had much more things to worry

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:10,869
about

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,360
I had to

00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:16,060
tends to pack ends to manage I had a

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,310
team to train so really when it comes to

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,819
markup integrations I didn't want it to

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,739
come that way and be so painful so then

00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:27,069
I took a step back and then I remembered

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:29,079
that well I had a friend Hoss who has

00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:30,970
actually an experiment a designer and I

00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:32,590
wondered how she was working so I

00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:36,579
reached out to her and asked for her

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:38,379
help and her insights so when she called

00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:41,140
me was actually pretty funny because I

00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:43,299
was suffering on my own project back

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,609
then I was working at a sister company

00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:48,220
of thedo and so I was working with a

00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:50,440
client and a very simple app it was a

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,700
mobile application with a very classic

00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,930
sign up and login

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,730
so I gave the design for the signup form

00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,370
to the developers who start working on

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,829
it and then asked me for the login form

00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:05,349
and I go why do you need it because

00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:08,049
they're actually the same design with

00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:10,150
different wordings but they insisted so

00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:11,859
I ended up providing it to them but I

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:13,599
was very frustrated because if you look

00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,370
at those design side by side they're the

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,220
same structure the basically the same

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,049
thing and it's just it felt like they

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,720
didn't try to understand a product as a

00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:28,090
whole and were just designing the pages

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,799
as he came and I was actually I had

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,690
other things to do I had a product owner

00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,340
who didn't want you to usability testing

00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,989
so I was trying very hard to convince

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,620
him that that was very important to do

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:42,370
and a very short timeline to design the

00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:46,389
rest of the features of the app so I'm

00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,919
having to copy paste the same design and

00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:52,060
then changing the wording was that the

00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:54,250
last thing I wanted to do so having

00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,889
heard each side of the story we realized

00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,169
that by under sting understanding each

00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:01,239
other more we would actually enjoy

00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:04,000
working together and that's how we

00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,609
started this whole Devi web thing and so

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,859
we experimented on new projects we've

00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:11,079
worked with other teams and we were able

00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:13,000
to map out four levels of dev UX

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,099
collaborations so I'm going to work

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,590
through them

00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,690
grunts you're obviously STIs function

00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:21,810
then you can move up to level one the

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:25,500
basics then level two efficiency and

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,880
finally the Holy Grail symbiosis so what

00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,770
we're going to do is walk you through

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,840
different projects at different stages

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,990
of collaboration to illustrate our

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,720
points and before that just a summarize

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:39,210
of the context so the usual team

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,009
composition of the project would be the

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,110
product team with designers and

00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:45,060
developers working hand-in-hand with a

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,520
product owner that sets the product

00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,460
vision and the roadmap around this team

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,620
we have stakeholders such as the CEO of

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,900
someone from marketing someone from

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,490
another product team or even legal

00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:01,470
that's gonna tell you yeah I need this

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:03,479
or that so for the first story by the

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,130
way all stories are true for the first

00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,199
time I'm going to take a food tech app

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:10,410
that my company worked on a couple of

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,849
years back I didn't work on the project

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,860
we're actually working with a freelance

00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:16,050
designer who had a very limited time on

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:19,349
the project but I did follow the project

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,990
very closely and so it started like this

00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:25,199
the designer had time in advance to ship

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,449
all of the design for the product so he

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,979
provides that to the team and the

00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:31,530
product owner is very happy because

00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:35,820
that's exactly what she wanted so the

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:38,580
team happily starts and actually one

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,440
week later the CEO sees the app and he

00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,270
is very unhappy with the UI he says

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,580
that's totally not what he wanted for

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,039
the app and actually that puts a stop to

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:49,050
everything the team has to start over on

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,150
the design and the development team has

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,599
no choice but to only work on the

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:57,930
backend for a while and it took

00:05:53,599 --> 00:06:00,659
literally three weeks and 17 attempts to

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:06,130
find a UI design that actually worked

00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:07,900
for both the PIO and the nd CEO and

00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,210
from then development can start again

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,830
but that's when the designer had to

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:15,190
leave because he only had that much time

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:18,640
on the project and that's in theory if

00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:20,110
all the designs are great great but of

00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,970
course there were things that were

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,340
missing there were behaviors that were

00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,540
not clear and so the developers they

00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,430
have no one to turn to except the

00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,500
product owner so they asked her for

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,720
advice and she goes well I'm not a

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,700
designer so I really don't know so they

00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,430
do what they can and then we call this

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:39,070
best effort which means they try to do

00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:41,080
something that not too ugly and Kanna

00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:45,070
works and let's hope nothing breaks

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,340
and so yeah so let's look back and see

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:51,070
what went wrong so first thing the CEO

00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,230
made the whole team start over and this

00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:55,090
happens when the process for product

00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,970
definition is not clear so this happens

00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,560
mostly with macaws being late too many

00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,080
people being involved in the decision

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,250
process there's other problems that can

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,230
happen too

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,240
like for example the vision of the

00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:10,210
product is not well defined so it's very

00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,700
important at this very basic level to

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,710
clarify what each team member has to do

00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,060
what their responsibility is and to

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,800
define key moments where they can

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,040
synchronize with each other so a very

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,310
simple very basic process would be the

00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,190
product owner is the one who is in

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,900
charge of the product vision so he

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:31,120
writes down the specifications and the

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:33,490
description of the task description he

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,040
has dedicated moment with the designer

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,510
so that he can pass on that vision so

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,280
that the designer can make the mock-ups

00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,620
and there's a separate moment for

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,320
developers you altogether define the

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,260
technical strategy to implement all this

00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,630
so of course this is a very simple way

00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:52,030
of doing it but don't be afraid of

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:53,440
adapting this to your context for

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,340
example if you know that your product

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,860
owner wants or likes to have user inputs

00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,040
before he decides of the needs bring him

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,800
into your user research if you know that

00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:08,470
developers can be very picky about

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,510
certain things in the design invite them

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:13,330
to the UX workshop so that they can

00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:14,020
together you can find solutions for the

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,139
upcoming

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,789
juice etc etc and it might look a bit

00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:20,319
scary like this because it looks like

00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,150
they're all those big meetings but they

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,479
don't have to be big meetings you can do

00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,780
this

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,180
a synchronously over slag or on any tool

00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:30,220
that you use you can do that over a

00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,169
coffee break five minutes the important

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,680
thing is just to update every member of

00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:38,110
the team product design product owner

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:42,459
all together on what is the new

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:45,329
direction for the product so what's the

00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:48,220
second issue the second issue is that

00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:51,220
actually the there were missing assets

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,410
and that happens a lot when designers do

00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,930
their job ship the designs and they just

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,910
leave and the thing that don't worry

00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:01,570
they don't realize is that mock-ups are

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:03,760
not development reading material so what

00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,339
I really encourage people to do is to

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,290
have a meeting developers and designers

00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:11,290
together to define what needs to be

00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:13,720
delivered alongside the mock-ups and to

00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:16,120
centralize those the assets and

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,250
everything in the design house so first

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,200
you could just for example it could just

00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,850
be a simple checklist of everything that

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,709
needs to be done it may be its static

00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:27,040
content maybe it's images where can I

00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:28,990
find those images etc a very useful tool

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,820
is to use the design hand off tool

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,100
because they centralize everything you

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,470
can download the asset but you also can

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,480
see how the screen was built so that you

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,670
see the margins the font size the font

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:45,480
colors you can even export some code

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:49,060
when depending on the under product and

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,550
yeah my personal favorite is is the

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,070
plane but there's a lot of tools on the

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:56,190
market so we can talk about it later if

00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,950
you want

00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:00,930
and the third thing is that because the

00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,340
designer had left the developers were

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:06,390
left on their own to figure out some

00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:08,190
behaviors and solutions and this this is

00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,530
again is because the designer had to

00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,720
leave before the end of the project what

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,970
we really encourage you to do is to find

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,280
a way to keep the designer working in

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,710
parallel of the developers for instance

00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,470
I always manage to during a certain

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:23,550
sprint help the developers with the

00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,020
current feature they're working on

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,750
because since I worked on the feature

00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:29,610
beforehand I can help them with certain

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,330
issues certain things that we hadn't

00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:35,010
seen upfront but I can also test the

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:38,220
previous features so they can learn from

00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,870
them and avoid some mistakes in the

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,390
future and I can start thinking about

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,550
the upcoming features and if the

00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,560
roadmaps of designers and developers are

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:50,160
well synchronized then it's completely

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,700
possible to do this so if I want to

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,440
summarize if you cut the design and

00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,570
development process in three phases

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,690
product the finish definition mock-up

00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:02,940
delivery and development the product

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,920
definition phase four to go to the basic

00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,590
level of collaboration you need to have

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,070
a well-defined process on the mock-up

00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:10,350
delivery

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,210
it's important to centralize everything

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,480
so that developers know where to find

00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:18,270
the information and the assets and on

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,980
the development side work together where

00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:23,160
next to each other so it's easier to

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,930
communicate and not have moments where

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,960
you just don't know what to do and have

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:30,000
no one to answer to your questions if

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:34,920
you do all this then you got to level

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,040
one so welcome you've got the basics so

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,390
what happens now with level one project

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:44,250
so the team here is working on a travel

00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:48,890
agency tool and what they're trying to

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:53,330
do is display an itinerary on the map

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:57,030
this is the design that the designer

00:11:53,330 --> 00:12:00,390
suggests and the team implements it but

00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:04,440
actually when it goes live the itinerary

00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:07,079
do not look very user friendly and that

00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,990
happens on most itineraries so the team

00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:12,990
has to roll back the feature and the

00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:16,860
designer has to work again on the new

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,060
design this time with numbers for each

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,120
please

00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,800
I mean numbers for each day and the

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,620
place is that the traveler is going to

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:30,450
visit the thing is the designer did not

00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:33,810
think of the case where itineraries loop

00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:36,000
so developers get stuck when first a

00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:38,310
date will happen at the same place as

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,290
day five and they need to figure out

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:43,290
something to display that information

00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,240
and in the first the designer decides to

00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:49,070
use a tooltip to display that

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:53,010
information and then the developer

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:56,250
finished the development they implement

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:59,459
the tooltip and well they decided to

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,529
improvise on the hover and active state

00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:03,600
of that tooltip because they really were

00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:06,000
eager to finish that feature and

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,010
actually I don't think the designer

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,630
really liked it but he went with it

00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:14,760
because they wanted to bring value to

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:16,670
the users as fast as possible so what

00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,040
are the new challenges that arose here

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:23,100
well first of the designer did not use

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,949
real data to build their mock episode

00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:30,930
they were not really working on real use

00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:33,390
case and they did miss edge cases so to

00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,610
provide that proven that it's essential

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:39,420
that designers work with real data when

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:42,300
it comes to like having complex

00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:44,459
situations and developers can provide

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,980
those data and then can also provide

00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:50,730
technical insights during the mock-up

00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:53,970
creation so for instance this is a tool

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:56,190
that house uses on sketch so it's it's

00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:58,680
called craft and what you can do is

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:01,900
basically use an API to get some data

00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:05,230
and use those data to populate a lists

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:07,450
so getting an image getting a title and

00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:10,029
it's really powerful when you need to

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,620
populate for say a table or a list

00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:14,320
because we all know there are many

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:19,390
educators and it's good to work with

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:22,540
real data the second thing that was

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:26,460
missing was really a list of the states

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:28,660
and edge cases on components and

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,850
sometimes what can also miss it within

00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,529
when it comes to responsive you don't

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:36,640
know how at the screen behaves and the

00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:39,460
layout behaves so really important to

00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:42,160
have a style guide that some of all the

00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:45,430
states and behaviors of components and

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:49,589
also define the break points for your

00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:52,540
responsive behavior so we've mentioned I

00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:56,680
mean it was mentioned in the previous

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:59,350
talks do you have like a common language

00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,120
between designers and developers and

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,550
that's why I really like the style guide

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,580
it's really a UI contract between the

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:10,120
two and so you know what colors should

00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:13,420
be used on the app you know what font

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,820
size what font you should use you know

00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:17,920
the convention around margins and

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:22,000
spacings that should always be multiple

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,130
of some values you know like how the

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,080
patterns should behave you've got all

00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:31,510
the states and you've got the form

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:35,140
different variations of forms errors

00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:36,990
States etc so I don't know if you have

00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:40,240
this on your project if you don't really

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:42,040
try to get this as soon as possible

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,650
because that will help you in your

00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,959
choices and to get an app consistent and

00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:49,399
also

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,579
another thing that's helpful is user

00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,589
flow what I like when I work on a

00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:57,649
complex feature is really to understand

00:15:54,589 --> 00:16:01,660
how you go from one screen to another so

00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:05,089
here we have video uploading work flow

00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:06,949
so first you start with the uploading

00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:10,040
page then you move to your processing

00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:12,199
page and finally if it's successful you

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,199
get a preview and if it's not you go

00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:19,790
back to the initial upload page with an

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,949
error message this is an example of how

00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:22,639
the designer can show you how the

00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:27,130
layouts

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:30,470
behave on smaller and wider screens and

00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:32,750
really the designer can provide all

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,970
these but it's essential that developers

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,250
are unloaded on this and really

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,009
understand how to use style guides or

00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:43,190
layout etc otherwise you'll just keep

00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:45,860
asking questions to the designer or just

00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,389
not follow the rules and and the app

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:52,670
will not look like what the designer

00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:54,439
intended so to summarize for product

00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,019
definition it's essential that the

00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:59,709
designer has real data and can work on

00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:01,550
the different edge cases and for that

00:16:59,709 --> 00:17:04,370
developers can provide technical

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:06,020
insights and for mock-up creation and

00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,480
development it's essential that

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,250
designers and developers speak the same

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,179
language and you can define that

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:15,860
contract with a style guide and if

00:17:14,179 --> 00:17:17,900
you've done all that in congratulations

00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,409
you're you're reaching the level -

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:23,630
you're being efficient already you've

00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:25,880
you've got rid of most of the friction

00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,970
points so it's quite an achievement when

00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,669
you're there and things get well happier

00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,860
so you could just stop there but

00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:36,669
sometimes projects are more demanding

00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:39,740
and you need to level up your game

00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:42,590
so let's see how you can go from a level

00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:45,830
2 project where everything runs pretty

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:47,330
smoothly - and a new battery this is

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,240
actually a project that yielding and I

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,850
worked together on and we were working

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,520
for a product owner who was one very

00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:58,200
picky about the user experience and he

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,509
was right he was a market leader

00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,149
afford to have bad user experience on

00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:06,509
his tool and the tool was a technical

00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:07,830
tool was for death plotters and in this

00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:10,499
tool there was a very lengthy

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:14,100
documentation as you can imagine and so

00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:17,369
I wanted that when you scroll down the

00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,859
documentation you can see the anchor in

00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:22,109
the navigation on the left update so

00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:24,239
that you always know where you're at

00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:27,330
and you can easily come back to a point

00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:29,009
that you've missed previously and of

00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:31,230
course the product owner was completely

00:18:29,009 --> 00:18:33,239
on board with this idea except that your

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:35,190
link tells me well I'm sorry but it's

00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:37,950
too complex and we cannot fit it in a

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,809
roadmap right now so the product owner

00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,639
is pretty disappointed but he

00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:46,769
understands and he goes along with it

00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:48,629
and I try very hard not to cry and as I

00:18:46,769 --> 00:18:50,399
said the product owner was very picky so

00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:52,190
he would always make us change tiny

00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:55,859
things here and there in the interface

00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:57,929
if things were small and not quite right

00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:59,340
with fixit's spacing was not right with

00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:01,499
fix it

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,749
alignment was not right with fix it

00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:06,600
colors were not right I'd find a new

00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:09,139
color and then we'd implement it and as

00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,869
you can see we were a team that was very

00:19:09,139 --> 00:19:15,299
we would pretty fast in answering and we

00:19:12,869 --> 00:19:17,279
were very efficient working together but

00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:21,029
there were still some friction points

00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:24,299
and we could do better so how can we do

00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:26,549
better the first thing you'll notice is

00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:31,590
that some cool features got shut down

00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:35,100
because of complexity and this actually

00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:37,320
is happened because I didn't involve

00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,330
your link beforehand before going to the

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,279
product owner and giving my suggestions

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,049
what I should have done is sit down with

00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,669
her say okay I want to do this I think

00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,259
it would be a great addition to the

00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:48,600
product what do you think can we do this

00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:52,080
and this way we could have found a smart

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,580
solution together instead of then going

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,200
to the product owner then going through

00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,299
her and having to shut it down and

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,759
making everyone very disappointed and

00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:01,019
wasting everyone's time actually I want

00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:02,800
to give you an example on another

00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:04,570
product

00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:09,720
of where this happened and it was very

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:15,070
efficient there was this pricing range

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:17,200
that's called cider and so when the

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,990
development started they realized that

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,930
when it's very together you cannot read

00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,580
the prices at all and so the rubber came

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,830
to me and said okay what do we do now

00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,840
and I said oh but I actually wanted it

00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:30,910
to look like that and he looked at me

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,440
and he said okay so we have this pretty

00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:35,230
long form and you want me to spend

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,900
however long on this I mean can't we

00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:41,650
find something that's easier to do and

00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:43,600
so we it took two minutes literally on

00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,640
my desk and we just said okay what's

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,360
important the important part is not to

00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,860
at that point when the two ranges are

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,370
very close it's not you have both

00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:56,760
numbers visible users are probably going

00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:59,410
to slide so if one of the numbers is

00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,750
legible it should probably be enough at

00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,940
least for the first for the MVP and so

00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,440
we added a white background behind the

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,080
first number so that you would always be

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,300
legible so in retrospect this was

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,510
probably not the best solution design or

00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:15,670
UX wise but the message here is that we

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:17,320
spend two minutes together and we found

00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,180
a solution that we were both happy with

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,170
and that's what I really want to

00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,170
emphasize on

00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,130
the second thing is that there were lots

00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,399
of back-and-forth in order to improve

00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:33,470
and polish the app and those were every

00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:35,299
time the they would it would be much but

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:38,809
they would accumulate and become small

00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:41,000
delays and so what we ended up doing at

00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:43,309
the end of the project was every week

00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,200
Yelena and I would just sit down and go

00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:47,330
through all over the app for one hour

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,950
and we together we would find the little

00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,539
inconsistencies that do things that need

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,980
to be improved and polish the app

00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:54,529
together so we would basically per

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:57,620
program and this worked well but also

00:21:54,529 --> 00:21:59,330
something that works very well if if

00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,789
designers and developers share common

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,830
design patterns so by that what I mean

00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:05,389
basically speak the same language but

00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:08,630
beyond speaking the same language

00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:11,360
understand a bit the logic of each other

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:14,330
each other's logic for example if I have

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,309
a team that understands some basics of

00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:18,620
UX if I tell them I want the designs to

00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:21,230
be keyboard aware then they will know

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:23,269
that whenever a ship we talk about a

00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:25,460
form the buttons needs to be pushed up

00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:27,440
by the keyboard whenever someone's going

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,960
to type and I don't want do not have to

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,880
redesign every time the state where the

00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,490
buttons are below and then the buttons

00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,820
are pushed up because we understand each

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,620
other

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,139
or on the other side on the other hand

00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:42,590
if I have basis of understanding of HTML

00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:45,440
I know that well if for example in this

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:47,899
example the this a table with two

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,639
columns I know that there's going to be

00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:52,909
a minimum space that I want to leave

00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:54,860
between the two columns I can show it to

00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:58,610
the designer through the design hand off

00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:02,330
tool by putting the max width of the

00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,950
dump of a big give actually and so that

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,840
the designer can inspect it a developer

00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,850
can inspect it and doesn't need to come

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,620
to me and say okay so when it's long

00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,659
actually the text needs to wrap but I

00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:15,019
don't know where and so this way it's

00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:18,200
much easier and much more efficient so

00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:20,570
this would be our advice you go from

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,419
level two to level three make sure to

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:25,429
involve designers developers in the

00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:27,110
mock-up design process and find smart

00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:29,600
solutions together whenever you find

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:32,690
small small problems make sure you

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:35,450
understand and share the same design

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,640
patterns so that you do not always need

00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:40,270
to be

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,790
asking questions and have moments where

00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:44,620
you sit down together and improve the

00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:47,350
app together as a team because that's

00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:50,770
your common goal is to produce the best

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:52,810
product for your users and if you do

00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:56,620
that then you're amazing and welcome to

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:58,360
the Volturi so now that you understand

00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,160
all about the different levels of

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,350
defects collaboration how can you

00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:06,130
actually spark this new culture within

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:08,110
your teams well first thing of just

00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:10,150
define where you're standing now and

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:12,790
where you want to go if you have very

00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:16,630
solute situation if you just don't get

00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:19,720
along just sticks stick to the basics if

00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:23,490
you have lots of delays lots of

00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:26,860
back-and-forth a focus on efficiency and

00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:29,710
finally if you have high UX expectations

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,750
or if you just want to have fun then aim

00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:34,000
for the same disease so basically this

00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:36,520
summarize the different levels of def

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,220
rave def ux collaboration that you can

00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:41,350
reach but the most important message

00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,780
that we have for you is that dev UX is

00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:46,270
all about the mindset so you need to

00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,760
think as a team and act like a team

00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:50,830
player when is the last time that you

00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,500
had lunch or had a beer with the whole

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:56,380
team with your designers and and just

00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,360
chat because those team-building moments

00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,550
are essential to build empathy and

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:05,530
understand each other's problems and

00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:07,690
motivations so much for instance my

00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,660
message to the developers here in this

00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:12,340
room is really that designers cannot

00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:16,870
guess what you need to work properly so

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:18,760
don't hesitate to ask them and well do

00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,380
not hesitate to call the designer

00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,060
whenever whenever you have a design

00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,510
question because they will save you time

00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:28,300
they used to solving those issues second

00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:29,620
thing to keep in mind is that details

00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:31,750
are here for a reason

00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:34,090
so you can rely on something like a

00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,730
style guide or the design system to know

00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:38,560
the truth of what the app is going to

00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,290
look like so whenever you have a doubt

00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,870
on colors on phantom sizes just refer to

00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,930
that and pay attention because the

00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:49,200
designer has like take

00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:53,430
taken the effort to well provide you the

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,530
information so really use it and finally

00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:57,300
if you want to make your job more

00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:00,840
interesting show that you care about the

00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:03,120
product so that's the product owner and

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:07,350
the designer will involve you when

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,900
you're making decisions on the other

00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:11,220
side what the mindset I'd like to share

00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,710
the mindset I'd like to share with

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,690
designers is first of all that mock-ups

00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:18,930
are not development relief material so

00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:21,210
you will need to provide extra steps for

00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:24,000
the developers to to work and so as I'm

00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,950
watching what they need another thing

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,800
that I've learned is that developers are

00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,900
amazing at finding errors and edge cases

00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:34,770
and so it's so much easier when I evolve

00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:37,980
them early on on on the design process

00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:39,480
so they can tell me well this what what

00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,160
is going to happen when this error

00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,680
happens and I'm like oh are we gonna

00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:45,090
have this error yes believe me this is

00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,070
my experience of course we're gonna have

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,750
it so it's it's so much easier when

00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:52,380
they're in the room with me to discuss

00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:56,220
those points but beyond that it's beyond

00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:58,020
the smaller component edge cases we

00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,760
often get frustrated when we come up

00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,620
with a nice design and want it to be

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,230
implemented and tell us well no sorry

00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,870
it's too complex but actually what I've

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,400
learned is also very frustrating for the

00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,560
developer to not be able to do it

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,940
because they do care about the product

00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,340
that I want it to be the best possible

00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:17,040
so to avoid everyone's frustration just

00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:19,080
involve the developer all the time

00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,430
during the process because that's how

00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:26,400
you can now come up with better features

00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:28,400
to in order to share the dev you access

00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,960
period around us

00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:35,340
yelling and I have been doing this

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:39,120
monthly Deborah wax drinks with people

00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:41,280
around us and it's they're very the idea

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,500
is just to chill and talk about what

00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,320
we're watching on Netflix what we

00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,360
excited about in the next tools that are

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,600
coming out for example recently I shared

00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,370
a lot about sketch 55:58 which i think

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,550
is going to change a lot of things on

00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:59,880
the design side of the project

00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:01,650
and it's great because you can discuss

00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,740
in a very informal way about your

00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:06,990
problems about what how you feel as a as

00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,679
a person in a team that might be working

00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:12,960
well or might not for example in stencil

00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,200
and recently not actually I learned

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,340
during the first of these drinks is that

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,990
actually even though there's friction

00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,090
sometimes between developers and

00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:23,130
designers developers are always so much

00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,620
happier when they work with designers

00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,450
because in the end at the end of the day

00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,760
they're just prouder of the product that

00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:33,120
they're making and that was meant so

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,770
much to me yeah I I really like those

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,800
drinks - I mean wine and cheese like

00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:40,260
what what's more serious and more

00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:42,300
seriously like there's something that I

00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,480
learned and that was surprising to me

00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:48,300
and actually I felt very relieved to

00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,309
learn that is that designers are happy

00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,760
to work with developers because they

00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:56,400
help them make their more make them more

00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,110
thorough with their work and and that's

00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,790
a relief for me because before that I

00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:03,360
only thought I was being annoying with

00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:06,390
all those requests and questions so I

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,460
think that's our message here if you
