How did you learn CSS? The standard way is in a class, online course, or even during an internship - but what if I told you that you can learn it by making a game. Don’t believe me? Well, I conducted a survey with developers that pointed out 100% of the people that made a CSS game or drawing learned something new in the process.

In this talk, I’ll present an illustrated space-themed game developed only with HTML+CSS. Trust me, on this talk, I’ll convince you to develop games and drawings using CSS by showing the benefits of these learning methods on your career in front-end. You are not a creative person, fine, let’s also demystify the myth that these drawings and games are exclusively made by super creative people.

Giulia is a Front-end Developer at Toptal. She is a CSS enthusiast that enjoys developing small and fun projects that assist in learning new technologies (like her dinosaur that speaks a mysterious language). She enjoys joining initiatives to make the technology field more welcoming to women, such as joining the organization team of Rails Girls Sorocaba.

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:24,660
if they are just fun or if they are

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,510
useful for something so first of all I

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,580
want to talk a little about me so I know

00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,969
my name may sound Italian but I've

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:36,300
actually from Brazil and well I mean a

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,879
relationship with CSS since 2014 and

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,940
well this is a bit fun but I have to say

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,430
it was love at the first website and

00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:46,079
well right now I'm a freelancer UI

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,690
developer it's opto which is cool

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,329
because I can work a lot with CSS which

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:53,370
makes me happy and as she said I'm a

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,680
cash sugar I have three cats and it's

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,010
just great to write CSS well my cat is

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,570
seated behind beside me that's great and

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,180
I'm sure hockey strawberry is number one

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,979
fan which are actually they are from

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,409
Japan but I'm not talking about the ones

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,510
from Japan they are actually cultivated

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,549
in a small town near my hometown and

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,080
this strawberries are awesome because

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:18,090
they are just the perfect mixture of

00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,430
sour and sweet I'm Dino Kiki's best

00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:22,229
friend he is my dinosaur and don't worry

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,150
I'm gonna talk about him in a couple of

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:28,020
sites so just hanging there about this

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:31,049
information okay enough about me and now

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,479
I want to know about you so I have a

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,939
question for you please raise your hand

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,520
if you have a cold just for fun if you

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,860
did a project create a lot of people did

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,810
it I'm really happy about it it's okay

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,970
if you didn't because sometimes we just

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,009
have a lot of work we have a lot when we

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,810
get home it's okay if you don't have

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,909
time for it or if you didn't right now

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,090
maybe we can change that by the end of

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,799
this talk who knows and also I want to

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,500
know from you if you did include this

00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:59,750
fun project in your portfolio please

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,079
raise your hand fidget

00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:06,840
okay good not a lot of people but that's

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,750
good so this talk is all about talking

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,740
about how our fun projects can impact

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:16,020
not only in our learning but also you

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,240
no portfolio and what these things can

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,430
do for our career if they have an impact

00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,050
or if they're just a firm project we did

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,900
and maybe we like to share with our

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,970
friends

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:29,280
well as I told you I have this dinosaur

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,950
it's actually a website it's called Dino

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,560
Kiki calm you can access later but I

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:36,570
have to say it's a bit loud so just

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,840
don't like this in a public place maybe

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:43,800
it's a little while and well I curated

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,500
this in 2014 and back then I was an

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,750
exchange student at United States and I

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,940
really needed an internship I was just

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,920
starting with from and developing and I

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,500
wanted to know jQuery because it was a

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,810
hike back then and I didn't know a lot I

00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,120
just learned that in the university so I

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,190
decided to create a project so I could

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,130
include in my portfolio and maybe get an

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,170
internship and it was a bit crazy idea

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,030
because when you click over him he just

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,840
speaks like the syllable Kiki in

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,090
different voices

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,460
so it's random every time you click over

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,870
and it's a different Kiki and also the

00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,450
syllables will start popping up on the

00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:21,510
screen and it was inspired by two things

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,730
which I kind of useless first is this

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,320
website called please pet dog you just

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,780
click over the dog and starts petting

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,370
him and random things like he's happy

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,950
you're petting him starts showing up on

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:33,990
the screen and also this vine I know

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,240
vine is dead I'm really sad about it

00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,490
because I really loved buying about this

00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,530
man walking in the street and screaming

00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:42,420
Kiki and saying he was a dinosaur it's

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,300
mama dinosaur finds its baby

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,940
I like that fine so I put together both

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,730
of the things and created that website

00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:52,710
and well it's actually listed on the

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,660
useless website so we can say it's

00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:57,120
useless when we think about a business

00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,570
perspective but it's not useless for me

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,450
I use it first to learn jQuery but I'm

00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,210
still using it for example last year I

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:08,700
started working UJS so I decided to

00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,950
change it to VJ s and lo j s instead of

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,910
jQuery and PHP which were a bit a little

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,000
bit outdated

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:18,330
and even today I have it on my portfolio

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,220
and even the job I'm currently in people

00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,750
always look at it and say oh cool you

00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,700
have the dinosaur

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:28,950
like and it's nice is that it's a way

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,840
that I created to learn new things or to

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,570
practice the things that I'm working on

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,790
and this talk it's about these things

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,910
and I just wanted to share with you this

00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:43,050
example but no let's dive in this into

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:45,140
the CSS yeah I just saw about the

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:49,590
dinosaur but I promise it had a point

00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:52,140
okay so it's about CSS drawings and

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:55,170
games so first of all I just want to

00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:59,310
show a bit of what is our CSS draw is

00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,840
what is a CSS game so I opened it here a

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,640
few code pens

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,670
this one was not a baby it was made by

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:09,000
this person called Marcin I guess it's

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:12,300
Peppa Pig okay don't you think this

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,070
person had fun well creating this I mean

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,560
I don't know why this person created

00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,840
maybe Sheila he or he or they liked

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,870
liked it or maybe their children liked

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,910
it I'm not sure even though it's Peppa

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:25,620
Pig is a pretty simple drawing probably

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,620
it wasn't that easy to create this we

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:32,340
see a CSS especially when we consider it

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:35,310
has borders and ordered things and well

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,060
this one is when I created about the

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,500
solar system it's a bit animated and

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,090
this drawings are the base for the

00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,160
presentation let me do right now so

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:46,320
every drawing on the presentation is

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,550
actually ice creams a screenshot of

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,790
something I draw with CSS and now about

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:55,410
games I found this really cool game it

00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,410
was made by this person called Jerry low

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:01,110
it's in cold pan and it's made with only

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,990
CSS and you have to stack the yellow

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:08,100
squares over each other so for example

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:10,830
here okay it's working and then you lose

00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,229
if you do this and then you can play it

00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,900
again so it's an interesting game it's

00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:17,430
nice and it's made only with CSS this

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,900
person probably had to learn new things

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:23,840
or practice in if you already know and

00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:27,150
less there's this roaming I mean

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,690
probably you saw it on the Internet this

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,729
is just awesome this I mean it's really

00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,160
hard to create something like this with

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:38,160
any kind of thing like even with paper

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,250
or with pain and we call it's just

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:46,380
awesome so I just want to remember you

00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:49,680
all that CSS yeah also be art so I made

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:54,710
this emojis lies just to have to inspire

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:57,930
how I felt when I saw this and well know

00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:00,470
hopefully you remember what CSS drawings

00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:03,300
and games are or if you didn't know and

00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:05,580
when is all of this when I did some I

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,680
was wondering every everything I learned

00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,780
and how I liked this things and they

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,930
were helping me to exercise part of this

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,670
CSS and HTML things and I was wondering

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,980
if other people felt like it so I

00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,570
decided to conduct a survey with

00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,910
Brazilian developers because this area

00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,980
was in Portuguese and I created a

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,530
Kitchener and shared on Twitter Facebook

00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,810
and other social networks asking about

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,310
how people felt about these things so

00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,670
the first question but there are six

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:34,950
participants 60 and the first question

00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:38,400
was if they ever heard about CSS

00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:40,950
drawings or games and I'm gonna make you

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,750
we were folks raise your hand again of

00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:45,450
your time so I want to know from you

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,520
before the stop have you ever heard

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:52,110
about both of these topics or any of

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,090
these topics cool I was expecting a lot

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,120
of people because we're in at CSS comp

00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:59,130
and that's great and I was expecting

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,530
also a lot of people to say they did on

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,190
my survey that happened I think

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:07,320
seventy-seven percent it's a good number

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:10,950
but then I decided to ask if this

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,570
developers created a CSS drawing I want

00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:16,320
to know from you did you ever create a

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,890
lot CSS Joey yeah we got a similar

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,450
result

00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:23,250
and most of people didn't then I decided

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,990
to ask about games I mean I was

00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,240
expecting a very low number because I

00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:31,620
think CSS games are something that are

00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:33,719
not as popular and I promise this is the

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:38,340
last time did you ever develop a game

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:41,460
it's only HTML CSS and you are cool we

00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:44,520
have people who did it and well my

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:47,100
survey we got like one person I was a

00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,089
bit sad but most of all it made me think

00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,709
about why why pee

00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:53,709
but you know what it is maybe they

00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:56,680
really love CSS but it's not a way they

00:08:53,709 --> 00:09:00,519
usually experiment with CSS maybe they

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,230
do other kinds of experiments but I

00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,790
asked it I also asked it this

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,509
participants if they learned something

00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:11,199
new from this experience and they did

00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:13,569
learn but I think this is one of the

00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:17,350
things that make people not want to draw

00:09:13,569 --> 00:09:20,709
or play or develop a game with CSS it's

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:22,600
something that is fun but maybe just the

00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:24,970
people think is not something good for

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,240
their career which I completely disagree

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,819
because when we say something is useless

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,279
we're saying that it's useless in the

00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:35,439
business perspective or something we do

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,040
in our everyday lives but it can be

00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:39,220
useless

00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,649
it cannot is not useless for us or for

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,649
other people who are working with this

00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:46,899
technology and okay going back to the

00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:48,850
part where I just said the participant

00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:51,129
said it helped them to learn something

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,829
by creating the CSS games or drawings

00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:56,110
and specifically I asked it a few topics

00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:59,949
all of them said it helps you practice

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:02,290
creativity because sometimes you just

00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:04,420
don't create a drama frontstretch but

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:07,569
you can still work on your creativity

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:10,809
why why are you a developing it and also

00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:13,929
other technical topics such as CSS

00:10:10,809 --> 00:10:17,050
positioning HTML tags CSS selectors

00:10:13,929 --> 00:10:19,839
several elements and sort of and classes

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:22,269
in CSS and I was thinking like I told

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,850
you so I'm glad more people also learned

00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:26,800
something it was not only me they the

00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:30,249
people who created these things they

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,620
actually learn something from x but

00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:34,120
there is this other code which I think

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,069
it's something that people say

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,139
especially when I talk about drawings a

00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:40,509
lot of people say well not a lot of

00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:43,059
people but someone say well you need to

00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:45,129
be super creative about it I cannot just

00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,769
make a drawing I don't have an idea for

00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:50,170
it well it's true if you want to create

00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:51,670
something new you need to have some

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,519
creativity but it doesn't mean that

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:58,269
every time you create a drawing or a

00:10:54,519 --> 00:11:01,840
game you need to use your own idea like

00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:04,690
100% you can't create it

00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,810
using things that already exists so for

00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:10,270
example my chip is if you don't have an

00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,070
idea but you want to practice the SS but

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,530
creating a drawing you can recreate

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:17,860
something that already exists I did this

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:20,140
for example one of my first drawings was

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:23,110
this black cat from Sailor Moon called

00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,910
Luna and I want to draw her I don't know

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,660
why I really like Sailor Moon when I was

00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:31,960
younger and I searched on Google and I

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:36,100
decided to draw probably her head with

00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:39,250
the moon over it and I created this code

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:41,700
but it's actually animator her ears move

00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,340
and I was pretty happy with the result

00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,200
because well I learned those things

00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,660
especially how to create her cheeks and

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,640
everything else the moon so I could

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:58,000
practice things that I would get that I

00:11:51,640 --> 00:12:00,220
am going to use on my job and well after

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,250
this okay I gave a shape how to start

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,260
but maybe people just say creating a

00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:08,350
drawing is not like creating a website I

00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:09,690
don't know how I can start I mean how do

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:13,570
you start a thing like that

00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:16,060
so I created a cycle that works for me

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,100
it's not a rule you can use it if you

00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,900
want if you already have yours that's

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,850
great it'll be cool to talk about it

00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,490
please like let's know other regions

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:27,340
would you be ready to drawing and the

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:30,010
first step is you get an image and you

00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:32,800
break it into geometric forms I'm not a

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:34,870
very good drawing on the paper but if I

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,540
create something that's on my head I

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,430
draw it very badly on paper and then I

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:42,370
try to break it into geometric forms

00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:44,620
because by breaking into geometric forms

00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,110
because it's easier to create something

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,850
in CSS from the geometric forms because

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,580
probably when we're developing a website

00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:54,160
we already created like a circle or a

00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:57,250
square or even triangle so it's better

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,860
to break these things step number two is

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,410
to use HTML to represent pieces of the

00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,230
drawing for example you have a drawing

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,590
that have a head you can call you can

00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:10,090
have a jib with a class called head and

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,880
step number three which is the one that

00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,750
takes most of the time is to style each

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,779
piece of the HTML

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:21,740
so this cycle works for me but as I said

00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:23,660
it's not rule right and we're gonna talk

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,910
a little bit about each one of these

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:30,259
steps and how we can create this a more

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:32,810
practical way so I am gonna choose Dino

00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:36,170
keke as an example this is gonna take

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:38,720
his head which I made only with CSS so

00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:42,980
first we break it into geometric forms

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,259
so here it is this hat is made by this

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:49,040
element some of them are repeated so we

00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:50,959
have a kind of oval and a rectangle and

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:55,269
that yellow thing which like I have

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:58,610
circled I that's his mouth and his teeth

00:13:55,269 --> 00:14:01,670
for this I'm gonna use his body or his

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:03,649
head in it as an example so I created

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,389
this day of called body and well there

00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:09,050
will be another one for the eye another

00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:12,079
one for the mouth and so on then I'm

00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:14,480
gonna style using CSS so I broke it into

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,959
children choose their magic forms the

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,689
first one is the body which is an green

00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:23,209
oval with border-radius to make it looks

00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:25,399
like this and then there is another step

00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:28,759
which is his neck which I use it the

00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:32,180
potato element after which is just a

00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:34,519
rectangle and well when we put both of

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:38,870
them together they look like Dino Kiki's

00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:40,579
neck or head and you can do that with

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,230
different things if it's a more complex

00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,939
drawing you're probably gonna have to do

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:45,259
it over and over again and you're

00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:49,389
probably gonna have to worry about

00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:51,649
pixels and how to combine things so

00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:54,439
differently for a website which you can

00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:57,139
use flexbox or grid in this case when

00:14:54,439 --> 00:15:00,860
it's like a drawing from an animal or a

00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:02,329
person I tend to use like left and top

00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,160
positions more observable positions

00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:05,930
because the same way as if we were

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,959
driving on the paper it would think oh

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:11,300
this looks better like right here so the

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,399
same thing happens with CSS it's just

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,170
one pixel I for one pixel right can

00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:19,699
change the drawing so that's why I use

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:21,559
absolute positioning okay I talked about

00:15:19,699 --> 00:15:23,000
drawings you may have an idea Hotch

00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,350
greater drawing hopefully you really

00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,089
think about I'm gonna make a drawing

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,339
let's think about what I'm gonna to draw

00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:31,339
but I didn't talk about CSS

00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:33,589
games they just showed one so not the

00:15:31,339 --> 00:15:37,189
time to talk about CSS games and I'm

00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:40,850
excited okay so I'm gonna present to you

00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:45,709
I space team memory game this game was

00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:48,199
made with no images no JavaScript no CSS

00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:52,689
preprocessors everything our playing and

00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:55,670
cool CSS and it's actually responsive

00:15:52,689 --> 00:15:58,069
okay can we play that or the probably

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:05,329
sounds a bit boring but I don't think

00:15:58,069 --> 00:16:08,329
it's boring so let's play it okay so

00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:10,790
here's the game in the memory game it's

00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:12,889
a set of cards that we have to find the

00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,790
similar cards hopefully you play that

00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:16,100
when you were a child

00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:18,019
but if you didn't for example we have

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,360
like animals and we have to find the two

00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:23,629
monkeys or the chuji laughs and then we

00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:27,860
set this card Society this one is made

00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:30,019
with planets and on the solar system so

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,329
the first thing I do is I click on the

00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:35,540
card and it shows the planet then I have

00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:37,519
to find another similar one well if it

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,529
they are not similar nothing happens and

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,170
the same way I would play with paper

00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:45,860
that I have to turn the cards back and

00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:48,050
from I would turn them back again but

00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:51,199
let's figure let's think I found a

00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:53,089
similar one okay I know it's this one so

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,189
when you find similar ones it has this

00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:57,370
small animation saying hey you find me

00:16:55,189 --> 00:17:00,410
and then I change the background and

00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:05,089
well then you can keep playing it is

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:09,370
responsive so for example if I change

00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:13,159
for like a smaller screen here it is I

00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:15,740
use a CSS grid to make another order of

00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:18,079
the cards so it's not Wrentham because I

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,329
don't have a random function in CSS at

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,220
this time but you can change the thing

00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,529
three different screen widgets and then

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,850
they change the order of the cards so

00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:28,580
you can play it again that won't be

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,980
boring for example here is not it's

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,950
actually Venus and if you open it it's

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,360
in another position okay so now I'm

00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,370
gonna cheat a little bit to show you

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,230
what happens when we play all of the

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:42,350
game and we win please don't tell

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:52,160
one that I was doing this okay so I'm

00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:54,770
gonna select all the cards okay done

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,870
I want again or it gets happy and say

00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,730
yeah you won and then you can refresh

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:01,940
the page and play it again if you want

00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,350
it so this was made only with CSS the

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,520
drawings are the one from the solar

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:09,290
system drawing I show you earlier and

00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:16,510
well hello let's talk about how this

00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:19,250
game was built any more technical way I

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:21,440
think the main question I had when I

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:24,470
wanted to do this game is how could I

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,080
create a click basic action without a

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,549
JavaScript event because usually when we

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,290
think about clicking things and

00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:32,780
interacting with things we always think

00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,400
about clicking with JavaScript depending

00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,350
if you're using vanilla JavaScript or a

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,830
framework it changes but it's always a

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:41,570
kind of on click event the secret at

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,450
least for me on this case it was to

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:47,450
combine label and checkbox because if we

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:49,460
think about your checkbox well it

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,840
changes its appearance when we click

00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,000
over it so if you click on the label

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,000
it's check if you unclick if you click

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,490
again it's unchecked so this allow us to

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,549
have a label and change the state of

00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:04,880
this checkbox and this is the move the

00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:07,580
beginning in China of this game so for

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,309
example each card both parts of the

00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,679
stars and the planet are labels I've

00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:14,419
done the checkbox it's not visible

00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:17,030
actually so that's why it's a blank

00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:19,970
screen so it's hidden you don't see the

00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:22,100
checkbox but there's actually actually a

00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,130
checkbox for each one of the cards the

00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:29,809
cards are a label for a hidden chat box

00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:31,520
and here's an example of the code so we

00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:34,070
have an input this example is for the

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,250
planet Mars and then we have the label

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,320
which have two sections the first one I

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,410
call card front which is the place that

00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,559
the stars go this each of one of the

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:48,770
stars it's a see HTML chip it's just

00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:51,700
like a white point like two pixels I

00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:54,220
think with some opacity reduced

00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:57,730
and then there is the card back which is

00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,700
just a planet and the text of the planet

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,679
so both of them are on the label and I

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,519
just changed their visibility according

00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:08,529
to the checkboxes state so let's think a

00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,720
little bit more about the game logic and

00:20:08,529 --> 00:20:12,610
this is something I just realized when I

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,799
when I was creating the game and I think

00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:17,200
it's really cool it's allowed me present

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,700
this year I really like cycles so this

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,769
is the last one from the presentation

00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,990
but the first thing that happens when we

00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:25,179
start playing with the car is that you

00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:27,309
click over the car when you click on it

00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:30,309
they change both the checkbox we've

00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:32,169
changed it to stay so if it was not

00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:36,940
check it you can check it and vice versa

00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:39,700
and then it will change the visible part

00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,799
on the car but let's think a little bit

00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,529
more about the step number two about the

00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,330
check box so there are different states

00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:48,909
they're different phases actually

00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:50,889
there's the first one when the when you

00:20:48,909 --> 00:20:53,590
start playing the card and all the cards

00:20:50,889 --> 00:20:54,940
are with the Stars showing then you can

00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,950
click over it and it's going to show the

00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,049
planet and also there is the third one

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:03,639
which is when you click all of the cards

00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:06,580
and you won the game so the case number

00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:10,510
one it's when the checkbox get becomes

00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:12,190
check it this is the cool thing if you

00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:14,620
look at the code and you think how to

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,080
create a game you'd ended up trying to

00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:19,929
use try to use conditionals such as a

00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,779
else but there is no such thing in the

00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:26,620
CSS so how do we create a similar

00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:28,659
behavior if we don't have an if in CSS

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,059
because we want you click on the card

00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:33,519
and if the stars are visible we're gonna

00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:36,909
hide the Stars and show the earth or

00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:40,450
another planet so here's the code I use

00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:43,419
it to simulate this if which is I'm

00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:47,139
gonna when the check box first is

00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:50,350
checking then I'm gonna show the part of

00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:52,299
the card which called card front so I'm

00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,340
hiding this sorry I'm gonna hide this

00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:58,659
part the card front which are the stars

00:21:54,340 --> 00:22:00,429
and then in the same case which means if

00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:03,669
the checkbox is checked

00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:05,300
I'm gonna show the card back part which

00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:09,500
are the planets witches

00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:11,390
or and then there's the keys number two

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,730
which is the opposite it's actually

00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:16,850
going back to its isness initial state

00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:18,800
which is else if the earth is visible or

00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:22,790
the stars are not visible I'm gonna hide

00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,620
earth and display the Stars which is

00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:27,410
just going back to the original state

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:30,650
which is not showing the card back which

00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:35,210
is earth and then display in the card

00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:37,910
fronts which are the stars and the case

00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:40,370
number three which is when you won the

00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:42,230
game you select all the cards you did

00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:45,500
right you'll play the memory game and

00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:47,330
then both of the planets the similar

00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,490
planets are visible in this case earth

00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:51,530
number one is visible and number two is

00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,330
visible then I'm just gonna make the

00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:57,980
background darker and include a small

00:22:53,330 --> 00:23:01,220
animation and here it is so I think this

00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:04,220
is school because when I look about I'm

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:07,690
gonna explain this what I can simulate

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:10,940
is like well if oryx's check it and

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:12,920
number two is check it then I'm going to

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:17,360
change the background color of the card

00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:19,580
back so I think when we are using CSS on

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,070
our jobs creating website business

00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,130
applications sometimes if we don't stop

00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:27,830
and look at the selectors like this we

00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:30,350
just keep doing our CSS and we have so

00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:33,110
many things sure it is the code clean am

00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:35,630
i using new technologies and it's pretty

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:39,230
cool to experiment and look at the CSS

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,700
in another way I think it's good and

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:42,950
you're probably gonna use that on work

00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,480
later maybe there is one way that you're

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:46,430
gonna need to use the selectors or

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,650
create something similar to an if and

00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:50,630
maybe you just haven't thought a lot

00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:54,830
about it yet you just didn't give you

00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:57,980
time to do that and well I created this

00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:00,170
game initially because I wanted to use

00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,450
CSS grid and I was working a lot with

00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:04,640
sass but I really wanted to use he

00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,650
assess custom properties so there are a

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,600
list of few things that I wanted to

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,430
learn by creating this game but after I

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,870
created it and I started looking at the

00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,870
code okay we have a notification

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:22,250
well I realized I learned more things

00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:25,280
than I was expecting so here's here's a

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:27,320
list so as I told you CSS grid because

00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:31,640
that was the main point of creating this

00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:33,170
game and CSS custom properties but I

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,840
ended up learning more about the

00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:38,210
limitations often for checkbox and do

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,700
HTML tags it's something that we use

00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:42,940
maybe you already know but it's cool

00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:46,310
practice and to explore it to its limits

00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:48,290
it's nice to see what we can do with the

00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,990
checkbox because when we are using your

00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:53,990
lineup on our applications maybe we

00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:56,660
don't don't see how important it is or

00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:59,390
how cool it is now I look at the

00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:01,970
checkbox in another region it's cool and

00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:04,250
also animations and transitions with CSS

00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:06,350
I think animations and transitions is

00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,240
something that is really cool to learn

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:10,310
with drawings because you can animate

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,770
them and you can do crazy things with

00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:15,830
them and it's really important to use

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:17,900
transitions on your website but you know

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,940
if you include too much it's not good

00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,280
but if you not conclude it it's also not

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:27,170
that cool so it's a really nice way to

00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:29,510
try and probably I learned more I mean

00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:31,910
I'm talking with you so maybe I learned

00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:35,450
also how she talking with people a lot

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:36,740
lots of people I don't know so it was a

00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:39,070
really cool experience

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,750
I created other games after that and

00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:45,230
probably I'm going to create more in the

00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:48,350
future but that's not all

00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:50,990
hopefully you are motivated to create a

00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:52,730
drawing or a game I don't know I know we

00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,740
still have two more days of conference

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,060
and maybe we have a lot of work next

00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:58,490
week because we were in the conference

00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,260
but when you have some time if you're

00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:02,660
interested you would be really cool if

00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,040
you try to make one and make a list of

00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:06,080
the things you want to learn and the

00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,480
things you learned it's really nice to

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,550
see your progress and it's a really cool

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,620
way to learn more things because there's

00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,630
so many ways you learn right I mean all

00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:17,390
any courses we can take classes we can

00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:20,450
talk to people and this is just another

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:22,370
way that you could have fun with if you

00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,070
were tired of other methods of learning

00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:27,580
try anyone try to experiment something

00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:29,440
try to educate something that you think

00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:31,660
it's cool it doesn't need to be super

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,300
used it's super useful for business

00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:38,080
application but it can be your

00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:40,330
experiment your thing and that's okay so

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,400
if you ended up great and running

00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:45,070
that'll be so cool and if you do please

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,140
share it on your social networks and let

00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:52,300
me know let's see some with the past no

00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:54,160
because it would be really cool and here

00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,450
are the links for the game so if you

00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,820
