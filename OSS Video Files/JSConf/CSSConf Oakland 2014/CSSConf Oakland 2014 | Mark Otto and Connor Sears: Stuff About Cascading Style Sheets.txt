yeah hi how is everyone CSS I look yes

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:10,170
it's these date on chairs everybody's

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,870
way too comfortable you need like

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,790
plastic chairs we were send out on

00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,780
belief that's what's happening thanks

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,730
everyone for coming out today

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,150
thank you for Karolina for organizing

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,650
and the rest of the jss crew really

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,990
excited to be here this is the first

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,490
time we've given a tandem talk together

00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,830
manjar has given most of this talk

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,399
before but not without me here to hassle

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,690
him and take over half of it so let us

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,780
know how it goes by heckling us

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,770
throughout please heed there we go there

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,890
we go all right

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,950
cueing it this is us we're Connors and

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,090
MBO on Twitter and github I'm just

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,300
kidding I'm not gonna use that's how you

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,129
can find as Alex said we both work at

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,899
github I've been there for just over two

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,140
years Connor a little over a year and a

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,370
half we work on github calm basically

00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,420
but a couple of different product

00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,829
features around there which we'll talked

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,050
about talked about a little bit later

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,190
before that we both worked at Twitter I

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,379
worked there for two and a half years

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,820
Connor about the same amount as well I

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,200
was pretty good time together

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,810
we've actually been together for about

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,630
six years now it's the second longest

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,880
relationship I've ever had in addition

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,729
to work in a cool product companies we

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,280
we really like open source I created

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,770
bootstrap which is the be and Connor

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,659
created ratchet which is the are both of

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,799
them are front-end frameworks ratchet is

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,119
for if you ever heard a ratchet ratchet

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,790
is for basically if you want to build

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,070
mobile applications in HTML CSS that's

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:36,180
what that does for you bootstrap then is

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,470
mobile to desktop bottom line was point

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,509
of mentioning this is that we've spent a

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,460
lot of time writing HTML and CSS Adam

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,380
mentioned he's been writing CSS for 10

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,530
years I don't mean to one-up him but as

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,799
a good friend of him I will he does by

00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:51,479
15 years and it's awesome but anyway

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,860
here's gonna take it away now with his

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,810
talk all right

00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:59,330
all right you can sit down it's fine um

00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,840
cool so yeah thanks for letting us be

00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:01,970
here

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,350
so we're designers right so this

00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,300
conference is really interesting I've

00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:08,330
been to a number of them one other one I

00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,580
don't know I exaggerated anyways up in

00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,720
Australia once but anyways what's really

00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,580
cool about this is that we've got like

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,820
designers and developers right like we

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:18,230
got a mix of people and you know even

00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,060
though we're product designers that's

00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,560
sort of what we identify as like when

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,990
people say what do you do I'm a designer

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,000
right but we write a lot of code and and

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,970
we work with a lot of engineers every

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,950
day and you know fancy to say we've

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,020
written some Ruby before and JavaScript

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,920
so I mean a lot of these principles even

00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,780
though we're talking about design a

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,930
little bit you know it applies to

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,850
everybody so we're gonna step back and

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,760
just talk a little bit about like design

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:46,340
in general like what do we actually mean

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,750
because I think it's important so yeah

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,130
design is a process I'm not gonna read

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,200
just every slide by the way I now keep

00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:53,800
I'm looking up there yeah design is a

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,060
process and it's getting to a solution

00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,580
you got a problem you trying to solve it

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,320
and a lot of times design kind of looks

00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,590
something like this and hopefully you

00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:06,019
can see the circles they look little dim

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,190
but anyways you know you do a lot of

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,840
sketching and do a lot of wireframe

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,610
getting Photoshop you get in the code

00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,620
and it's like this whole big ordeal it's

00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,570
exhausting design gosh it's supposed to

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:18,019
be this uppity like thing right we're

00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:20,600
all designers and we realize that like

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:21,769
really just solving the same problems

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,720
like over and over again in different

00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,739
fidelity right were you sketching and

00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,360
I'm not saying anything I mean this is

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,190
bad like this is a good good step but

00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,330
when you're sketching like you're trying

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,380
to solve the problem then you get the

00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,000
wireframes you get a little bit more

00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,650
context and like you get a little more

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,760
handle on the problem you realize that

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,290
all those decisions you made are

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,940
probably wrong or like half of them

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,890
wrong so start making them again and

00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,630
then you get the Photoshop and you spend

00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,070
a lot of time in Photoshop and you're

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,090
doing that and and then you get into

00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:45,530
code and you realize all of those

00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,700
decisions were stupid you wasted all

00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,260
your time you have to read make all

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,610
those decisions as soon as you do things

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,590
like what Adam was talking about in here

00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:53,239
you know you have people using the thing

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,390
and it's a real tangible piece of

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,790
software that you build and really what

00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:01,100
it boils down to for us at least and

00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,620
based on our you know the six years

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,000
we've been together as mark says it

00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,220
boils down to just working through ideas

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,270
and no matter what we do and then moving

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,230
into CODIS

00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,210
quickly as we can because that's

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,270
actually where you know we think the

00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,980
best part of design is made and and yeah

00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,780
so I mean this is the point sort of what

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,489
we're thinking about is that practice

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:21,860
I'm greatly improves when you move into

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:23,900
code the design process becomes way more

00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,960
clear and focused your decisions become

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,880
quicker they become clearer and we think

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,800
they just make for better products and

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,500
that's why we like HTML and CSS we spend

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:39,650
obviously bootstrap we spend a lot of

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:41,360
time working with CSS so so why why this

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,640
code make it better

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,820
well I think the first thing is that it

00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,350
actually elevates the conversation so I

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,820
don't know about you guys but I've been

00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,920
in like a lot you know I spent some time

00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,370
doing like contracting work and stuff

00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,630
back in the day or old graphic design

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,280
boutique firms and things like that and

00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,320
you spent a lot of time like biessing

00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,060
everyone you know like hey look at you

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,380
know this is the theme and the metaphor

00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:06,620
we're working with no that's bad I don't

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,970
mean to like downplay it but a lot of

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,490
times you end up like looking at a

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:13,370
picture of software and that's not very

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,740
helpful like oh you know design is the

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,240
thing we're building it's not the file

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,630
that goes into the trashcan after we're

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,100
done and and so this conversation we've

00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,140
time and time again and meetings like

00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,880
you're looking at this piece of paper

00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:27,620
and you're trying to make decisions and

00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,870
what that boils down to is arguments

00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,130
over box-shadow or I guess drop shadow

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,290
if you're talking in Photoshop terms

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,420
like whatever like these conversations

00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:37,490
kind of get stupid so when you're

00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,980
dealing with like code and you can get

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:43,130
real data in there and real feels it

00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,560
feels real you know it all sudden your

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,150
conversation becomes way more focus so

00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,820
that's one reason why you should move in

00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,230
the code quicker your decisions get

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:56,380
faster and hopefully your product

00:05:51,230 --> 00:06:00,500
development cycle is is faster code

00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:03,050
inherently promotes or ideally promotes

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,330
systemic design and by systemic design

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,520
we just mean like design patterns I you

00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,960
know as you're designing things you find

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,220
that you're building the same thing over

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,600
and over again well maybe you should

00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,669
simplify that we just got done talking

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,200
about a a talk that does is talking

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:17,990
about this exact same thing but even

00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,540
like on a higher level than just CSS

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,560
attributes we're talking about like

00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,260
modules on the side like

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,000
a user card on say a social media site

00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,250
or something like that like we ended up

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,320
making those user cards like 15,000

00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,820
times and they're all different it ends

00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,230
up being like 5,000 lines of code and

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,240
that's no good

00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:37,669
and that 5,000 lines of code is off

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,950
oftentimes like a very good indicator of

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:42,020
maybe you need to simplify make it one

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,180
module that works everywhere and so much

00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,220
simpler amount of code so code allows

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,740
you to figure that stuff out way easier

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,620
than a Photoshop document or maybe 50

00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:54,650
Photoshop documents up on this wall and

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,560
we'll go over that and a little bit but

00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,940
lastly and I think most importantly and

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,380
I think this conference is a testament

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,680
to this is that it lets you speak the

00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:05,210
same language we're all here and we can

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,889
all talk to each other and we have a

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,960
commonality no matter if you are like a

00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:12,260
hardcore visual designer that works with

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,000
CSS or a hardcore you know engineer and

00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,639
it's working mainly with JavaScript or

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,200
whatever you know go down the list we

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,120
all can look at this stuff and it's blue

00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,919
down to text that we can all speak the

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,040
same language and we call with software

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,419
like github shameless plug we can all

00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,190
work together and I think that's really

00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:29,419
important because it's really hard you

00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:32,210
know Marc and I tried to like

00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:34,250
collaborate over you know this document

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,660
this keynote document it went horrible

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:37,789
it was terrible I just didn't make any

00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,289
change there's terrible but code like

00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:40,390
this is all just a code which I guess we

00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:43,400
could have done that I don't know

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,510
realization right now um wouldn't let us

00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,890
speak the same language work better

00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,940
together so I think that's another

00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:54,200
benefit of the design process in code so

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,910
anyways so putting that into perspective

00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,889
a little bit though one of the the

00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,990
biggest projects that Connor and I the I

00:07:57,889 --> 00:08:01,669
guess the privilege to work on was nunu

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,840
Twitter and if you're not familiar this

00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:05,060
hashtag nunu Twitter

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,130
refers to the version of Twitter comm

00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,000
and then the mobile clients that came

00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:11,840
out exactly three years in one day ago

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,400
which was when they went from the

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,039
sliding drawer to the expanding

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,570
collapsing tweets on Twitter com we

00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:20,990
worked on that we worked on for that for

00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:24,800
six months in early 2000 or mid 2011 all

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,240
the way to early December so the gist of

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,370
this talk should be stuff that hopefully

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,659
we all realized and at least know or

00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,000
I've heard people talk about which is

00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:32,959
that code is better let's get the code

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,370
faster because that's where everything

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,090
is going to be anyway so why don't you

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,529
move there very quick

00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,479
so hopefully this shouldn't be anything

00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:39,950
too profound we just want to explain

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,229
some some cool stories I think from this

00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,060
so this is new new Twitter this is what

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:45,500
it looked like it's kind of pretty

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,940
similar still except they've changed the

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,460
header and a couple of things they've

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:51,200
doesn't some new type and whatnot but so

00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:53,270
Jack Dorsey came back and Bennett

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,820
mid-2011 he's like I'm gonna put my mark

00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,050
on this this product again and so he

00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,060
pulled a bunch of designers there about

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,180
a dozen of us or so into a conference

00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,740
room and we basically stayed there for

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,430
four weeks it was a four-week design

00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,680
sprint and the idea was to basically

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,779
whiteboard and then go to photoshop and

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,670
mock up the iPhone clients and the the

00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:15,260
desktop web clients of how this brand

00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:17,660
new reimagining of his product would

00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,310
look and so it wasn't very pretty to

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,870
start there's a lot of sketches here

00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,250
that's a lot like there's a nav mental

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,900
model I don't remember what it was but

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,950
there was three circles above and I

00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:27,290
think that's what we're getting at we

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,550
just need three things but I was like we

00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,710
couldn't figure in that out by just

00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,510
whiteboarding and doing tons of

00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,890
Photoshop mock-ups and I can tell you

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,570
why we didn't figure it out by doing

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,240
tons of Photoshop mock-ups so we did a

00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,070
ton of Photoshop mock-ups for every

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,660
single view and it's a little grainy

00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:44,540
it's actually horrible to look at I'm

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,070
sorry but we had these monster documents

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,770
and these are literally every single one

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:50,570
of these phones and screens is a PSD and

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:53,600
when we updated one we had to update

00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:55,370
about 4,000 more which was awesome at

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,930
the time but not really and we did the

00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,360
same for desktop and then we did the

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,470
same for our m5 client html5 client

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,030
they'd be the same for our Android

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:03,380
client and so that was the first four

00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,540
weeks it was awesome we just

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,420
photoshopped all the things and then

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:10,820
then our boss pulls us aside and he

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,110
tells us this scope prototype it but

00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,220
don't write prototype code this is gonna

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,920
write production cuz we're not time to

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:19,610
write prototype code and we're like cool

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,589
look at this we got this do this and

00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,180
then let me start think about cuz we're

00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:25,700
gonna write we write twitter calm that's

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:29,060
so that's unbelievably awesome and then

00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:31,730
it's oh no what are we gonna do how do

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,620
we do that this is range of emotions in

00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,200
this couple of weeks while we try to do

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,970
this and so myself Connor and one of the

00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,410
guy are on this we're tasked with

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,870
rewriting all of Twitter comms

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:43,430
HTML and CSS and we're like let's just

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:44,030
start programming let's just get right

00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,709
to it

00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,630
shout-out to Jessica Dillon for the

00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:48,350
photo here she tweeted it a couple

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,670
months ago

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,280
I think it's fantastic so we just

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,600
started coding and the first this is the

00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,270
first time we actually realized this

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,800
which is that PSD s don't mean squat

00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,390
when you're building things on the web

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,610
because you'll have this pixel perfect

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,780
design but once you actually start to

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,100
code it you realize all these different

00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,920
things and a lot of madama brought up as

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,540
well and is that you're gonna have all

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,680
these different people accessing this

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,090
content from different devices and you

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,740
don't know their situation you just have

00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:15,020
to do your best to accommodate for all

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,880
those unknowns and so when we started

00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,830
coding this we cut it up and maybe like

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,930
a week of real basic prototype here of

00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:24,020
it and then we loaded it 97 it just

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,670
promptly crashed the entire computer fun

00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,010
fact this is because we were using HTML

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,600
semantic elements and the html5 shim

00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,400
which apparently just didn't work for IE

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,080
7 welcome that's that version or

00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,720
something so we had to scrap all those

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,980
plans and we rewrote that entirely but

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,660
we didn't we would not have realized

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,830
that if we just stuck in Photoshop for

00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,200
even longer while we try to figure out

00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,990
design decisions one of those design

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,940
decisions for example was consolidating

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,680
all these similar things into one

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,510
component one instance of this component

00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:53,450
one do one thing have one thing do one

00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:55,280
thing really really well and an example

00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:57,170
of that is like an avatar full name

00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,680
username or two lines of text next to it

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:02,720
we had about six of those in those four

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,240
thousand mock-ups and Photoshop that we

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,740
had done and so when we got them and

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,240
we're starting to code this for the

00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,560
engineers with the engineers we're

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,840
seeing stuff like this where it's like

00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,720
this is the same thing but slightly

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,130
different and we'd be into lazy people

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,560
that we are we don't want to code the

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,360
same thing multiple times so we said no

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,280
no we're doing one thing and this is

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,750
what it's going to be and so we become

00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,310
like we became like an intermediary

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,920
between the rest of design and the

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,030
people that actually know engineering

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,620
where that are writing all the

00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:32,210
JavaScript and then the the rails code

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,070
to actually power this stuff one

00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,630
component one piece of data it pushed

00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,310
the product forward because instead of

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,930
having six different things that users

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,490
would see that are slightly the same

00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,870
there was either gonna see just one

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,040
thing and that's how they know they're

00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,050
actually looking at Twitter they've seen

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,460
the same thing what's actually

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,810
interesting about this is it Maps really

00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,370
well up to today's frameworks and style

00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,810
guides if you go to a company they have

00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,480
a style guide this is how we do this

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,830
this how we do buttons and forms and how

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,570
we lay out our pages and things like

00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:58,390
that it's a lot of that shared knowledge

00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:01,670
but a lot of its also unique

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,440
lastly three years ago we didn't really

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,550
know this like this is still thing

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,470
people are talking about today is like

00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,350
it's at github it's not it's not shipped

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,900
until it's fast and at Twitter when

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,820
we're crashing things that 500 million

00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:16,520
monthly uniques I think we're trying to

00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:18,440
access that's not a good thing so speed

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,940
becomes the future that we talk about so

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,250
instead of having the conversation about

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,500
what size box yet oh we're gonna use we

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:26,540
said no no no no box shadow because

00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,000
browsers three years ago couldn't do it

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,380
especially ie9 at the time just one of

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,910
the amount of box shows we wanted to do

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,170
and if remember twitter.com it's

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,970
infinite scroll you just getting more

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:37,700
and more tweets more and more box

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,560
shadows it's just just bringing the page

00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,210
to a crawl so it answered all those

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,980
stylistic questions and allowed us to

00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:44,780
focus on the actual interactions and the

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,820
speed and the overall picture of the

00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,890
product and it was immensely useful and

00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,240
I think I can speak for the both of us

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,470
want to say it was by far the most

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,010
illuminated an awesome product we've

00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:56,170
ever worked on

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:59,300
you're not allowed to speak for me but

00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,160
it's carried forward in the three years

00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,840
since then that we released that and two

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,630
more projects we worked on at Twitter

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,430
and even practice worked on github so

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,900
see what that looks like yeah so I mean

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,910
we talked a little bit about Twitter we

00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,290
joke around like it's been like two and

00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,520
a half almost three years since we're at

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:15,260
Twitter we should probably stop talking

00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,470
about Twitter for a while all right it's

00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:25,520
it's in the past mark anyways so let's

00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:27,230
talk about Twitter a little bit we did

00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,610
twitter.com your new Twitter and then we

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,560
had to iterate on it so I mean one of

00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,320
the first projects we sort of picked up

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,360
after that was the profile redesign so

00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,370
you kind of have me to blame for like

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,990
this well not really I can't really take

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,170
credit for the center to avatar somebody

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:43,190
centered an avatar before I did but

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,350
anyways we started doing this project

00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:47,420
and you know we started falling into the

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,850
same traps like alright let's start

00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:52,930
doing Photoshop documents for a thousand

00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:56,210
different iterate or like every you know

00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:58,850
permutation of this profile everything

00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,530
that could happen so yeah we did that

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,330
for about a day I was like oh Wayne I

00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,770
remember we already figured out what not

00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,780
to do in this project so we started

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,370
coding it again right and this is just a

00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,020
mobile prototype you know we mentioned

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,340
that a lot of bootstrap and ratchet are

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,230
open source projects came out of our

00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,370
work at Twitter well this is a perfect

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:16,010
example this is like sort of what

00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,500
ratchet started which was a mobile Iowa

00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,180
prototyping tool originally came out of

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,710
and so we started building this stuff

00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,290
and it you know it did a couple of

00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:26,360
things obviously we already talked about

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,520
letting us figure out you know real data

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,910
even if it's just JSON dumps that we

00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:34,040
were able to plug in it let us do user

00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:35,840
testing let us get in front of users and

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,520
actually hand it to them but one of the

00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,680
biggest things this particular project

00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:42,380
actually taught us was they allowed a

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,840
small group of people to get a lot of

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,520
momentum around a very simple idea and a

00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,050
big company I don't know about you guys

00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,370
like obviously you know I hadn't

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,880
mentioned Salesforce that's a pretty big

00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,650
company

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,930
well little bigger some medium-sized

00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,580
would you say anyways yeah we some of us

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,980
may work at big companies it's really

00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,080
hard to get momentum going well I think

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,280
code and our experience is it's proven

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,750
that it's like really easy to get

00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,790
momentum when you're actually to have

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,040
something that feels real so in this

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,180
particular case like we're running a

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,460
bunch of red blocks I won't name names

00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:14,960
but anyways I'm just kidding I will name

00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:16,640
names it was Marc Jacobs I was able to

00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,110
take you know the phone and say alright

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,460
here's this profile here's something

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,320
cool we could do really quickly and just

00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:23,510
go up to the CEO go up to dick and say

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,770
hey man can we build this they could be

00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:26,810
really cool if we could build this and

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,760
of course he's like it looks done why

00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,170
isn't it shipped right because you know

00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,120
he's not trying to figure out this low

00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:34,310
level organizational crap he just wants

00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,470
to ship product and get stuff done and

00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,870
so like you know you get that momentum

00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,900
going and yeah it's really cool so I

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,970
mean this is just one example so again

00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,280
not to talk about Twitter forever

00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:48,020
I went over to github and you know we've

00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,030
been talking a lot about big projects

00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,340
like new Twitter and profiles that's

00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,660
pretty cool but this really just applies

00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,670
to everything so this is a really small

00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:58,610
project first project I worked on it I

00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,900
get up I just sort of grabbed you know I

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,180
looked at the site and I was like what

00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,459
sucks on github.com that I could fix

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,280
really simply and it was our Senate page

00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:08,420
our joint page and I sort of was able to

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,550
open up a pull request and of course

00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,959
this is what github is based around open

00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,570
up a poll or Kratz cut a branch and

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,459
start working on it so it's really cool

00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:18,490
to be able to like get in there and

00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:20,540
start designing some stuff but just

00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:23,030
roping back to like that design process

00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,199
it's not saying this isn't a design in

00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:27,050
the browser talk like we're not trying

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,870
to say like old design philosophies and

00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:31,460
old design techniques are antiquated and

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,430
throw them out and you're a loser if use

00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:36,590
them cuz I sketch all day long like this

00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:38,300
is sort of like what I think is you know

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,770
one of the things that allows you to

00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,059
even code faster is getting your ideas

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,770
really quickly going back to that

00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:44,690
simplified process just get your idea

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:47,059
out as quickly as possible whether it's

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,130
a sharpie or a pin and then move it

00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:51,170
through to code as quickly as possible

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,210
so I mean this is just a quick flow but

00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,850
it's another example of how we were able

00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,590
to get momentum around in just a new

00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,260
company I didn't know anybody but mark

00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,940
and be able to get something ship really

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,800
quickly and obviously that it's gonna

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,780
vary you're gonna get different mileage

00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,790
from company company but in general

00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,340
whether there's a lot of bureaucracy or

00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:13,100
none at all like it's proven to be like

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,630
a really good technique and of the many

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:19,610
right ways of doing something this is

00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:21,670
one that's worked out for us the other

00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:24,110
one for me has been split this which

00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:25,970
until very recently was probably the

00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,309
most requested feature in all of github

00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:32,600
history how many people use split this

00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:33,950
side by side this yes nobody like half

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,160
the room at least half the room Connor

00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:39,559
come on you guys check so in addition to

00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,730
Pawnee bridge names we jump right into

00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,130
polar coasts because we can actually

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,780
show people these things I bought a year

00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,120
and a half ago I did a quick mock-up and

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:48,950
then tweedle Twitter with some code and

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,240
tried to make side-by-side this happen I

00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,059
just couldn't because the code was so

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,200
convoluted in that case I got shut down

00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:56,210
I'm gonna shut myself down by trying to

00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,679
do even more mock-ups with it and then I

00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,240
got a little more momentum behind me and

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,420
I was able to do it after some brief

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,130
refactoring to our diffing code and we

00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,600
made it happen by opening the polar

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,010
quest and exactly two months later we

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,950
had it shipped to the entire user base

00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:11,870
and so went about two and a half weeks

00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:13,820
of like in this code in this in this

00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,900
pull request here and it includes

00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,480
screenshots from the stuff that I'd

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,190
worked on you see today's split this

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,300
actually collapsed the additions and

00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:24,830
deletions onto us combined rows whereas

00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,750
the original prototype didn't so that

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,490
was a product decision we made after we

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,809
started feeling it out in the browser

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,490
after we start actually using it

00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:34,309
ourselves because do you imagine trying

00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,840
design like dips in Photoshop or sketch

00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:37,309
that sounds horrendous I'd have to copy

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,840
and paste code a bunch of times and then

00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:40,520
by the way we just shipped syntax

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,140
highlighting on tips today we'd have to

00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,820
do that to you because that was going on

00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,530
at the same time and trying to recreate

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,910
all this stuff which is horrible so we

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,679
figure out the basics jumped into code

00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,360
open up a branch or start a branch open

00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:51,860
a pull request and we got this cool

00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,060
thing at the top my top comment you can

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,320
actually play with it on a staging

00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,970
environment cuz I have a cool thing

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,790
called branch labs we just push code out

00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:00,650
there and I got some vulgar commits and

00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,720
some really shitty commits there too and

00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,250
we just kept iterating on this branch

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,690
and we actually got to play with it and

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,280
that's the point is that you get to did

00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,570
you get to those real fields of like oh

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,100
click this button all the sudden I have

00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:11,450
a split diff and I'm writing these

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,130
comments on one side and these comments

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,720
on another side I'm telling Conor how

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,850
awesome or how bad his code is and

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,590
that's awesome that's how we should be

00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,110
doing these things as close to the end

00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:22,490
goal as possible and that's what we

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,010
basically want to reiterate today is

00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:26,150
just that get to code real fast and no

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,130
matter if you're a designer or developer

00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,870
by title you will be an awesome product

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,520
designer because you're building it

00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,320
where it's gonna end up and that's

00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,750
what's most exciting about what we do

00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,360
why we write all the HTML CSS that we do

00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:40,520
and that I think about wraps it up for

00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,200
us thanks so much for coming out

00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,200
