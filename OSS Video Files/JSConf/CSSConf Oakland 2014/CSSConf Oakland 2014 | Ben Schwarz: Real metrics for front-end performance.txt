Title: CSSConf Oakland 2014 | Ben Schwarz: Real metrics for front-end performance
Publication date: 2015-01-25
Playlist: CSSConf Oakland 2014
Description: 
	Building a super-performant front-end is far harder and more intensive than making onLoad or onDomReady happen quicker — After you've removed "blocking scripts", what do you do?

In this talk I'll show you how to put best practice tools to work for you & your team.

We'll explore how to keep your pages scrolling buttery-smooth, the depths of undocumented Chrome devtool APIs, how to create your very own clean-room environment to test and measure while coordinating collection of performance metrics over many geographical borders — then how you can make it all happen within a continuous integration server.
