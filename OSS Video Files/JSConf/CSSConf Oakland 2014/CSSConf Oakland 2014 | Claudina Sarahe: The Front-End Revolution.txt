Title: CSSConf Oakland 2014 | Claudina Sarahe: The Front-End Revolution
Publication date: 2015-01-23
Playlist: CSSConf Oakland 2014
Description: 
	This is a talk explores events in the history of front-end development have lead to the bouleversement within the field. Despite what you may think, the revolution has nothing to do with the tools and technology. Twitter adoption isn't what started the Arab Spring; Node isn't responsible for JavaScripts renaissance; and Wikipedia's most significant accomplishment has nothing to do with the fact they are one of the most visited and trusted sites and completely human powered.

	00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:17,490
test testing yeah well better hmm

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:20,039
feedback good yeah awesome okay so uh

00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:23,130
what makes something revolutionary all

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,230
right something is revolutionary if it

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:28,949
totally disrupts the established order

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,140
and it replaces this order with a new

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,090
order namely itself and it's going to

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,399
completely change the dynamics of

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,620
everything around it so we've been

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,660
witnessing this massive shift in

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,399
front-end development it's becoming one

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,390
of the most in-demand specializations

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,940
and we we have all these new tools and

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,399
frameworks that are really not only

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,230
changing our lives as developers and

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,110
designers but they're affecting how we

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,399
do things on a day-to-day basis and it's

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,859
this it's their effect on we do things

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,960
they're giving us these capabilities

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,689
that we can basically turn into new

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,420
opportunities so for example get comes

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,320
out in 2005 and then three years later

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,460
we get github and it's this

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,920
transformation that I actually believe

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,770
is revolutionary our tools are

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,590
transforming our behaviors and to quote

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,810
Clay Shirky revolutions don't happen

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,500
when society adopts new technologies

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,700
they happen when we adopt new behaviors

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:34,829
so what are these new behaviors that

00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:37,259
we've adopted first let's make sure that

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,540
we're on the same page about what I mean

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,180
with the behavior and how behaviors come

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,680
to be so a behavior is the product of

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:49,020
three factors and this is fogs behavior

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,040
model he studies persuasive technology

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,860
at Stanford and in this model he states

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,100
that in order for a behavior to occur

00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:01,079
you have to have sufficient motivation

00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:04,079
sufficient ability and you have to be

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,969
triggered so motivation is pretty much

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,829
the worst thing should never rely on

00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,720
motivation for trying to get someone to

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,700
change their behavior we all know how

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,650
well New Year's resolutions go you're

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,040
really motivated couple days later

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,750
are not so great ability as you can see

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,140
here can really be thought of as a

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,560
factor of how easy something is to do so

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:30,150
the more the easier it is the more able

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,590
one is and lastly trigger so dr. fog

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,049
actually really believes that we should

00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:37,349
focus on triggers and simple triggers

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:40,709
will help us create habits and habits

00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:43,620
are nothing more than automatic

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:46,260
behaviors so now we're going to walk

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,599
through and see how our tools basically

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,090
got us to change our behavior and they

00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,400
did two things first we had to adopt the

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,790
tool which is a behavior change and then

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,200
as a consequence of adopting that tool

00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,920
we gained some new behaviors and I'm

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,900
going to walk you through this so to

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,220
understand how this came to be we need

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,280
to back up a little bit and we need to

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:10,920
go back to the mid-aughts and there is a

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,280
lot happening in development and around

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:17,489
2004 we had the release of the rails and

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:22,470
Django frameworks 2005 we had get

00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:24,239
frameworks and we also had this slew of

00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,680
JavaScript frameworks that were that

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,889
were coming up and they were really

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,530
aimed at helping developers address the

00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:36,030
inconsistencies across browsers because

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:40,290
it was a nightmare and so jQuery comes

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:44,150
out in 2006 and it wasn't the first

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:47,310
framework but it was the only one that

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:52,199
took into consideration three factors

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:54,150
that allowed it to succeed first jquery

00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:57,299
itself was a simple solution to the

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,099
problem the code was really simple it

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,959
address one thing and it did it really

00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:03,870
well and that was letting us this deal

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,260
with dom manipulation second from the

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:10,139
get-go jquery released with really good

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,870
documentation so prototype actually had

00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,909
pretty much been adopted into rails by

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,709
that point and it kind of was the the

00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:19,709
main one but it didn't have

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:22,139
documentation in fact it was like after

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:25,830
a year before it actually released

00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,450
documentation and the last one that I

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,450
think is incredibly important

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,640
is John really understood the value of

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,100
community and so from the get-go he

00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,030
issued this invitation to participate in

00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:42,050
to collaborate and it took off the

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:46,890
second day someone released a plug-in

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:49,770
and this was this was incredible for us

00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:52,350
I mean prior it was very difficult for

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,580
us to contribute back to JavaScript

00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,380
interview back to our front-end

00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,350
languages in fact it's sort of

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,570
JavaScript tumultuous the history that

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:04,560
got us into this browser war place in

00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:07,050
the first place so really what jQuery

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,000
did is it created this environment where

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,760
people could get things done without any

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,160
barriers it made it incredibly simple to

00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:17,850
get started and allowed anyone with

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:23,490
sufficient motivation to contribute and

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:26,370
it's a success arguably jQuery is the

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:30,540
number one framework and use on the web

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:34,440
to date but beyond its fame for me it's

00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:37,350
these three simple design decisions that

00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,720
have started to affect other languages

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:43,350
to date and I've really led to the rise

00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,900
of like no Jas and our newer frameworks

00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:49,860
and our new ways of doing things so

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:54,090
jQuery paved the road and set an example

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:56,940
of what to do and collaboration really

00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:59,580
cannot be underestimated it means the

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:03,810
prospect for new ideas that can make our

00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:06,420
tools better so because we're so steeped

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:09,630
in this culture it can be really hard to

00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:14,760
forget that collaboration in front end

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:18,240
is a new thing it and for CSS this

00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,650
ability is actually even more recent so

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,960
let's go back we're going to still stay

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:26,790
in about two thousand seven or CSS was

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:29,760
just a giant nightmare and around that

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:31,920
time we had decided that 960 pixels was

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,760
like the best way and the only way that

00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:38,840
we should design we also had a bunch of

00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,260
IE things to deal with

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,110
and while we had css3 and we were really

00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:47,720
excited to stop all these hacky ways of

00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:51,020
having to create border radius or like

00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,210
load our our HTML with a ton of images

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:57,139
just for gradients all it did was

00:06:53,210 --> 00:07:00,100
introduce a bunch of complexities and it

00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:04,990
really just made us incredibly desperate

00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:08,169
for a solution so and then additionally

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:12,110
this thing was about to come out and

00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:13,639
completely flip how we thought of web

00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,700
development and take our standards and

00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,100
just turn them upside down so we were

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:22,580
clamoring for a way to deal with this

00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:27,050
problem and really I see the rise of CSS

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:31,250
preprocessors as almost inevitable in a

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:33,410
way because CSS was so difficult we had

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,450
high motivation and were motivated

00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:39,110
enough that we were going to seek out a

00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:41,500
solution so much like what was happening

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:45,110
in JavaScript we had all these different

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:50,200
options but it really came down to two

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:56,599
these two and how did that come to be

00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:58,190
first I've been much the same way as as

00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:01,130
what happened in in the JavaScript

00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,419
community sass and less did a really

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,510
good job at addressing the

00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:08,840
inconsistencies less actually remained a

00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:11,300
really powerful contender because it was

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,060
a lot easier to use and it gave us that

00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,910
same power without the hurdles of having

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,010
to deal with like an indented syntax and

00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,990
setting up Ruby and all these other

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:24,280
complications when all we wanted to do

00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:27,229
with style and make our sites beautiful

00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,750
granted the adoption in Twitter

00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:31,490
bootstrap didn't help but I actually

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,070
think that now that Twitter bootstrap

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,320
has released an official passport we're

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:41,330
going to see much more focus on that and

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:44,839
less on left and before I go on I do

00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:47,480
want to thank less for one thing if it

00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,520
wasn't for less I don't believe that

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,250
sass would have would have adopted the S

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,430
CSS syntax as quickly as possible

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:58,190
and so the designers of SAS were really

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,990
aware that hey you know what by doing

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:02,180
this we're going to make it a lot easier

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:04,810
to get people to change their behavior

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:08,690
and to get people to adopt staff so

00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:12,550
that's what they did but there was one

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:17,780
other major turning point that really

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:21,770
allowed SAS to edge out less and that

00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:25,940
was compass compass was kind of like the

00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:28,820
jQuery for SAS and in fact compass

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,280
really abided by the same three design

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,190
decisions that allowed jQuery to stake

00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,770
its hold in front-end development SAS

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,450
was pluggable at first by design but we

00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:41,720
weren't really sure what to do with it

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,950
so Chris releases compass and shows us

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,300
what we can do with these new

00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:48,920
capabilities it's simple it's at this

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,930
get-go the most popular thing was

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,490
probably the css3 mixin so that we

00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,120
didn't have to write all those crappy

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,680
border radiuses and vendor prefixes

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,570
second it had really good documentation

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,980
you could actually learn how these

00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,800
mix-ins and these things were created

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:09,200
which helped you create new ones and

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:11,420
third Chris also issued a a call for

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,180
community and you could create your own

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:17,200
compass extensions and we learned how to

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,550
make Ruby gems and we release them why

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,420
because we really really really really

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:27,080
wanted to and to date there are over a

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,940
hundred and forty-two compass and SAS

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,010
extensions and it's growing those are

00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:35,690
just the people that have registered so

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:36,800
we can see that we really wanted really

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:39,290
we're looking forward to this and we're

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,070
happy to share when that opportunity was

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:45,500
presented so our front-end tools are

00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:49,040
really lowering the threshold for

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:51,620
finding good ideas as a result these

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,070
good ideas are getting incorporated back

00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,950
into the parent language so you can see

00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,810
CSS borrowing variable taking variables

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,660
and some of the things that the newer

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,800
stuff from SAS and also on JavaScript

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,690
the influence

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,250
of coffee script is really guiding the

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:13,040
newer decisions for the tc39 team and

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:17,930
harmony but what's really amazing is

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,839
that we are now empowered to do this

00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:23,720
ourselves without having to rely on

00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,640
these institutions I mean they're a

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,519
little slow moving and I know they have

00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,320
rules in place but if we had waited for

00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:38,630
them can you imagine where we'd be right

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:41,750
now not fun so our tools have triggered

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:44,570
this participatory cultural revolution

00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,670
but really changing how we are able to

00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:49,730
work together and to work around

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:52,490
obstacles and barriers it's really a

00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:55,790
fundamental new way of thinking about

00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:58,730
innovation it's bottom up it's

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,399
participatory its democratic it's a

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:05,540
little crazy and all these are great

00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:08,390
phase our tools have enabled groups and

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:11,540
individuals to try radical things by

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:13,970
removing any barriers we've created

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:17,360
environments who people want to get

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:20,660
things done and they can and not only

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,360
that our environments are encouraging

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:28,459
and supportive and they're nurturing our

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:30,880
creativity and individuality these are

00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:34,970
the necessary ingredients for change

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,750
collective participation plus collective

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,930
action

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:43,380
our ability to learn and work is growing

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:46,560
stronger and stronger in a relatively

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:50,460
short span of time we have completely

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,620
changed how we do things I mean we

00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,840
wouldn't really dream of approaching a

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:59,950
project without any one of these new

00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:03,040
tools so

00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:06,280
what's the point of all of this right at

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,030
a certain point we're kind of like why

00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:11,740
do we need so many things do we need yet

00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,660
another build tool and yet another

00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:18,130
static site generator and yet another

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:20,400
way to process or compile our CSS I mean

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:24,070
it may start to really seem redundant

00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:26,170
but it's really not quite yet because

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:29,830
right now the best thing that we can do

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:32,770
is to continue to spur and encourage

00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:36,160
this innovation our imagination or

00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:39,730
creativity a lot of our life is sort of

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,460
spent focusing us down these paths and

00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,620
the more that we can stay open and allow

00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:49,510
ourselves to experiment the more new

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:51,940
ideas that we can keep generating so I

00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,380
really predict that in the following

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,640
years we're going to start to see a

00:13:53,380 --> 00:14:00,070
shift from technical problems to more

00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,710
human problems it's going to be about

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:05,020
the human connection tech will be a part

00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,000
of what we do but it's not going to be

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:11,140
that first solution that we should jump

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,780
to right so we really need to take care

00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:16,570
right now to make sure that we are

00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,580
building helpful welcoming communities

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:22,510
that are going to celebrate diversity

00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:25,660
and difference let's continue to ensure

00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:28,810
that we are open and supportive to

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:32,860
everyone no matter beliefs skill set

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:36,030
skill level or discipline remember to be

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:40,420
kind and in the words of Chris Epstein

00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:42,399
let's not firm form cliques

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,870
so what's incredibly wonderful and

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,459
encouraging to me and should be to

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:49,570
everyone is that we are actually

00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:51,639
succeeding look at us here today the

00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:54,070
organizers of this conference value

00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:58,620
community value diversity and they and

00:14:54,070 --> 00:15:01,180
they put that first and it's incredible

00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,800
the second thing that I also found

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,279
really interesting that we might not

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,560
know is that at the same time that we've

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:10,449
been changing our behaviors we've

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,279
actually done so in a way that's

00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:20,410
designed for resilience so this is a

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:21,940
small world network and what it how it

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,940
works is that you have these tightly

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,550
small connected groups that then have

00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,170
loose connections to a larger group so

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:31,149
here like this would be kind of our

00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,949
larger group and within this I'm sure we

00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:35,740
have like tightly smaller groups like

00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:39,070
see some of my SAS people over there and

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,940
I'm sure there's no dl and every but and

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:44,860
despite that we have these tiny little

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:48,130
close connections and then we can branch

00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:52,240
out and so small world networks are

00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:55,420
actually incredibly advantageous they

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,660
first are resistant to damage which

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:01,600
makes us really strong and second they

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:06,269
transmit information really well we act

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,269
both as amplifiers and filters

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:13,639
so given that we are so skilled at

00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:16,100
creating such a resilient network that

00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,199
is based on valuing contributions and

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,720
the uniqueness of every community member

00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:23,930
and the fact that we can do this in such

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,720
a short amount of time I really believe

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:30,339
that we have a lot to contribute back to

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:33,199
society beyond just beautiful websites

00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:36,980
so citizens the world over are calling

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,139
for a change and I really believe along

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,300
with many others that this change is

00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:44,329
only going to come to a participatory

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:47,089
revolution we're the same design

00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:50,089
decisions that made our tools so great

00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:53,079
and allowed them to succeed are applied

00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:58,180
to other systems like urban planning and

00:16:53,079 --> 00:17:01,310
education so we developers and designers

00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:04,130
have an immensely valuable perspective

00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:07,850
to share beyond just our tech

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:12,049
communities we are successful practicing

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:14,540
models of participatory culture I mean

00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:17,480
we're more than just you I developers in

00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:22,040
my mind we are leaders of one of the

00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:23,839
largest movements in the world so being

00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,169
a front-end developer means to hold this

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,299
immense power in your hand write code

00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:33,049
literacy suddenly becomes more than just

00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:36,200
a job or career change it's the ability

00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:38,620
to contribute to this large human

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,620
network

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,440
so what

00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:47,290
decide what we want to do with our new

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,810
capabilities what opportunities do we

00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:53,470
want to create where do we want to

00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:56,410
create these opportunities be it here

00:17:53,470 --> 00:18:00,850
for our front-end communities or back

00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:07,420
home for your neighborhoods remember

00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:11,410
we're doing something right already so

00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:14,710
as you create an experiment remember to

00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:17,880
encourage and reward participation along

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:21,970
every step of the way don't worry

00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:27,010
doesn't have to be a big thing make

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:29,290
up right now thank you Eric Suzanne and

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:34,270
if we can get he's right over there by

00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:37,810
the way so I believe if we continue to

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:40,920
do this right if we continue to innovate

00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:44,830
in the way that we've just observed our

00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:48,070
innovations are going to certainly have

00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:51,040
a really really high potential to

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,250
continue to be revolutionary thank you

00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,250
very much
