Description: 
	Designing a page's layout in CSS has traditionally been a hard problem, though developers have come up with a lot of amazing hacks. Today, and in the near future, much of this pain will disappear, as CSS introduces new layout specs, like Flexbox and Grid, and other layout tools, like the Sizing and Alignment specs. This session will explore some of the new abilities enabled by CSS's new layout specs, introducing you to techniques that can you can apply today (depending on your required browser support) and in the near future, as browsers continue to implement these new specs.
