Description: 
	SVG is gaining popularity amongst front-end developers, and for good reason. Simple vector shapes work well for icons and resolution independence makes SVG a great choice for responsive design. But did you know there’s a fun party land hiding inside your average SVG?

Find out about some of the lesser known (and crazier) capabilities of SVG, like morphing SVG shapes, SVGs that draw themselves, and even filling SVG with gifs. We’ll also look into the code guts of what actually goes into an SVG so you can start making SVG parties of your own.
