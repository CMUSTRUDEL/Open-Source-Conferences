Title: CSSConf Oakland 2014 | Elyse Holladay: I Have No Idea What I'm Doing
Publication date: 2015-01-25
Playlist: CSSConf Oakland 2014
Description: 
	We've all felt compelled to say, "oh but I'm so bad at this," lest someone think we might have something valuable to say. We've all felt that surge of inspiration, followed by frustration, sometimes to the point of being unwilling to try again.

I talk about the shit we don't know we don't know, and how we can be intentful about how we learn, challenge ourselves, and share our knowledge. I'll explore impostor syndrome and the fine line between deceit and "fake it til you make it.", how yoga and coding are similar, and how to be a constant beginner.
