thanks everybody for coming out today so

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:09,200
my name is Adam for those of you who I

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:11,759
have not gotten to meet in person and

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,009
yeah I don't know what the title of my

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,800
talk would be other than things I've

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,279
learned about CSS over like ten years of

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:27,230
typing it sometimes so when I went to

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:29,699
college this was one of my cool alright

00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:32,329
this was one of my favorite quotes and

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,040
my chemistry professor gave this to me

00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:38,730
to kind of make us less afraid of

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,440
learning and trying to break down things

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,840
that already existed and I think that

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,489
this is really true in the world of

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,320
front-end development because it's

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,610
really really a very baby discipline

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,649
hasn't the internet hasn't been around

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,870
that long chemistry has been around

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,809
forever right and we're still learning

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,730
about chemistry constantly so I think

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,920
that it's really important to remember

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:03,510
even if you've only been typing CSS for

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,129
a couple of months that there's a lot of

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,470
work to do there's a lot of stuff that's

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,659
broken there's a lot of stuff that's not

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,420
fun about typing CSS or front-end

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,159
development right now in general so yeah

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,930
I try to keep that in mind that it's

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,380
part of our responsibility to fix it a

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,030
little bit so a quick couple things

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,119
about me I come from this state which is

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,799
in Maine it's very cold there home of

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,799
the Maine cat if you're unfamiliar

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,689
it's a pretty majestic beast I'm a

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,759
definitely a big cat fan if you did not

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,579
know I went to college in Ohio

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,500
another cold cold place and I studied

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,360
studio art there and then I moved to

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,460
this wonderful state of California

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,799
places much further south called Los

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,960
Angeles because I got a job designing

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,680
amusement parks which most people think

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,590
is like this but I didn't get to design

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,119
any rollercoasters at all that's smart

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,100
people who do physics and engineering

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,860
and things like that but they did let me

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,860
color pictures in of amusement parks

00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:07,979
but it was great training as a first

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,110
design job because designing amusement

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,599
parks is kind of crazy you have all

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,400
these things to think about like a

00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:16,230
family waiting in line for four hours

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,030
for one ride and you don't want to put

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,800
the two most popular rides next to each

00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,360
other because then they're gonna wait

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,370
back-to-back you want to spread some

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,140
stuff out you've got to tell stories

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,760
along the park and you don't know which

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,230
direction people are going to go in and

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:35,340
you want the story to make sense the

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:39,690
whole time but the biggest thing I think

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,900
oh sorry so I start designing amusement

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:44,549
parks and got a little bored with the

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,019
fact that they're still working on

00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,299
building stuff I was designing eight

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,830
years ago and on the web you can build

00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:51,330
stuff up in like an afternoon and tear

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,739
it down and probably most of the

00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,060
websites I've ever built don't exist

00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,580
anymore which I actually kind of think

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,400
is cool uh-huh so I went to work for

00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,440
this company and they called me and they

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,540
wanted me to come work on this print

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,209
platform where they were going to do

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,430
data visualizations of people's energy

00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,470
usage and mail it to their houses to get

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,510
them to use less energy and this sounded

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,030
so crazy to me I was like why don't you

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,100
make a website and they said we have a

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,890
website and nobody goes to it but we

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,780
print these reports and we save tons and

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,160
tons of energy and that sounded pretty

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,959
neat to me I was kind of a dirty hippie

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,880
in college and there weren't a lot of

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,609
other web jobs where I could save energy

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,350
but this platform that I had to work on

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,959
the reason I bring this up is it was a

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:37,500
print platform and it was completely

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,430
built with HTML and CSS and we had a lot

00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:46,109
of problems that didn't exist on the web

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:48,390
like there's no hover States right so

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:50,880
there's no animations there's no

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:55,380
interactive stuff everything's kind of

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,690
done in place you can't mess up printing

00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,060
you can't print something get a mistake

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,889
mail it to somebody's house you can fix

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,410
your website right and like maybe nobody

00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:05,850
noticed when you mail 750,000 or

00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,879
something to somebody and it's got the

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,560
wrong word in it or you know the text is

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,299
off the page that's not good for anybody

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,299
it's not good for your users and it's

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:18,600
not good for your cuffs

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:20,430
so when I worked at Opower I got to work

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,590
with a really talented group of software

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,680
engineers that taught me a lot of really

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,120
awesome things just about typing code

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,729
that helped shape the form of how I

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,830
think about authoring CSS so this guy's

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:34,710
name is Dave Copeland he's big in the

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,570
Ruby community but one time he

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,979
challenged me and he said Adam who do

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,860
you think is the best in the world at

00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:43,289
CSS and I don't actually think there's

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,720
one like CSS Overlord that rules us all

00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:47,520
or anything I don't really think there's

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,430
one person who's good at CSS but I

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,410
understood his question and I gave him

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,690
some names about people I thought were

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,190
pretty good at CSS and he said what

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,949
would it take for you to be the best in

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:01,770
the world and I started to answer that

00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:04,620
would be impossible which I realize is

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,940
like a horrible attitude to have if you

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,100
even though I don't think I could be the

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,050
best at CSS in the world I started to

00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,090
wake up and think like what would it

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,850
take like what is there left to learn

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,280
like what things can we discover how

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,010
would you become the best at CSS and

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,030
this guy is absolutely as crazy as this

00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:25,860
photo looks this guy's name is yoni and

00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,449
I was explaining this really convoluted

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,090
thing I wanted to build to him one day

00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:32,550
and he looks at me and goes dude this is

00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,229
like so trivial and I was pretty

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,060
offended and taken aback because I was

00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:37,620
like really complicated I've never done

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,479
anything like this it goes but so many

00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:41,669
people have I was like yeah I've never

00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,710
done it and he said you shouldn't be

00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:45,210
entertained by doing stuff a million

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,039
people have done before he said in

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,349
mathematics if somebody's done something

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,539
it's trivial and if nobody's ever done

00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:54,630
something it's impossible and I'm only

00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:56,159
interested in possible tasks and I

00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,690
thought that like blew my mind right I

00:05:56,159 --> 00:06:01,560
was like I'm just trying to get this box

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,909
like on a page like your advanced

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,130
electrical engineering degree doesn't

00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:07,260
apply to me here but I did think it was

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:09,750
a wonderful frame of mind to be and when

00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,070
we try to approach problems and so I'm

00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,330
going to talk about this stuff and I'm

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,479
starting to talk about some technical

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:18,630
things so I went to work at Salesforce

00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:20,490
and we did some business things there I

00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:21,900
actually have these slides that order I

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,730
went to work here first

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,360
so I get here

00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,180
[Music]

00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,190
and this is what drives everything

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:34,380
empathy right like CSS is my empathy

00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,080
medium I know that probably sounds weird

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,330
but like I don't care about clean code I

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,050
don't care about code in general I'm a

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,240
designer

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,120
I just want my users to like have a

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,940
better life I know that sounds really

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,730
freaking silly but like that's my mom

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:52,650
and she's awesome and like I've seen her

00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,180
use her phone and be frustrated by

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,340
trying to use a service and it just

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,110
doesn't work and it's like and these are

00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,910
my grandparents and my grandmother uses

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,130
the Internet like all the time

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,180
and she calls me to complain about it

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,790
and she's like I understand what this

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,250
works what browser are using nowadays

00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:10,290
but those are people that use the stuff

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,780
that we build and I care about their

00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:16,710
time I care about their frustration

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,780
levels so brings me to this topic of the

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:22,980
veil of ignorance so there's this guy

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:25,200
John Rawls who brings up this concept of

00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,210
like say you could change anything about

00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,040
the world we live in right like you

00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:32,610
could make completely new systems with

00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,660
completely new laws what would that look

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,970
like

00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:39,390
but the the catch is that when you wake

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,280
up tomorrow you're not gonna be you like

00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:44,910
you might be a woman you might be a man

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,370
you might be 105 you might be 12 you

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:50,070
might be really rich you might be really

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,600
poor and the point is like to think

00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,160
about all the stuff you don't have to

00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,260
think about this veil of ignorance we

00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,510
live in all the time right and I think

00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:00,630
this is true like beyond CSS in our

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:02,480
crazy country right now and I think all

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,800
of us live in like so many different

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,280
veils of ignorance --is where we don't

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,780
think about what other people go through

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,820
and I try to think about that at every

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,650
level when I write CSS I try to think

00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,930
about like you might not have a fast

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,130
connection and I don't mean some person

00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,630
in a third world country like have you

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,190
gotten lunch at the Ferry Building in

00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,320
San Francisco like I have like a

00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,810
brand-new phone I'm like in the building

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,610
across from major tech places no

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,130
internet cannot get text to load my

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,740
phone so like performance matters your

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,270
device matters so I try to I try to

00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,280
embody that I try to think and meditate

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:37,229
on all the stuff that my users are gonna

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,550
have to go through and I try to write

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:40,769
CSS that in here

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,050
things and doesn't take away from the

00:08:40,769 --> 00:08:45,510
experience but as somebody who's written

00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:47,700
CSS for like 10 years now this is kind

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,880
of how I feel every single day no matter

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,260
how much I learn no matter what other

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,690
people teach me no matter what cool

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:59,930
frameworks come out so so I worked it

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,459
like this

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,860
yeah this print platform and I had to

00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:07,649
make sure nothing ever broke ever which

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,209
was an interesting task and performance

00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,399
really mattered because it's print and

00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:12,839
they've got to rip these PDFs and like I

00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,310
could make performance changes that

00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,130
saved like hundreds of thousands of

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,660
dollars a year in print costs and I come

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,399
to the web and I started asking

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:22,860
questions for these feedback loops I

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,390
have on this like wonderful print

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,390
platform I say that slightly

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,670
sarcastically and I'm asking questions

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,110
like well what's better for architecting

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,790
your media queries this or this and

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,829
people like I don't know and I'm like

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,660
well I don't know how much is like too

00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:38,940
much CSS for a website like I haven't

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,620
built websites in forever I'm people

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,120
like I don't I don't really know I'm

00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,829
probably asking the wrong people I but

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,990
if I'd known any of you at the time you

00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:50,730
would have given me awesome answers so I

00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,110
kind of like as I get back to the web I

00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,060
start really questioning like what is

00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,600
good CSS I don't really feel like I can

00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,920
answer that question like that and I

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,200
think the first thing is like stuff

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,620
works right I for me like I just want

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,500
I've only ever been paid to solve two

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,140
problems on the Internet which is one

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,670
getting people to consume content right

00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,470
like they might be reading words they

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,360
might be watching a video they might be

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,279
looking at images but like no matter

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,959
what it is like it needs to be on a

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,640
canvas right I think if it's off the

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,500
canvas they can't solve that problem

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,089
with consuming the media and the other

00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,649
thing is like I need to get people to

00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:27,240
type into a box and hit submit

00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:30,029
and I'm just trying to not those

00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,470
two things up right like so I think that

00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:33,390
this is important and I think that

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,160
there's no bounds to this at all I think

00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,990
like these watches are probably gonna

00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,449
break all the websites that I've ever

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:42,060
made but when I start testing on watches

00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:43,320
I want it to work there so these are a

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,779
couple of things that I believe to be

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,670
true and I don't really have much

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:49,260
willingness to compromise them at this

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:51,029
point I think that everything should be

00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,350
readable on any device and I mean that

00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:54,120
like while you're walking down the

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,490
street or bouncing up and down in the

00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,579
back of a cab lawyer slightly tipsy I

00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,050
mean that like if you're dyslexic you

00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:02,730
should still be able to read things we

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:04,770
should think about the typefaces we pick

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,230
I think everything should be as

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,819
performant as possible like I don't

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,949
think the bar is high enough there right

00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:13,500
like a thousand milliseconds after that

00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:14,730
you're losing money and people's

00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,319
attention but you're also wasting

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,420
people's time and a thousand

00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:20,370
milliseconds isn't that long like every

00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,410
single millisecond counts so when people

00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,740
say CSS performance doesn't matter I get

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,270
really sad I think that designing in the

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,220
browser should be easy and we should

00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:31,230
have systems that promote that and I

00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,390
think that doing one thing extremely

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,640
well promotes reusability and I know

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,810
that that's been said a million times

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,699
before but you think about something

00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:41,970
like nicholas Gallagher's clearfix class

00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:43,949
and it's just this one thing that does

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,800
this other thing perfectly and almost

00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:49,079
everybody uses it and its canonical at

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,760
this point and like we need more of that

00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:54,990
we need more small things just just do

00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:57,089
one job really well so if I didn't know

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,770
better I would think that this quote by

00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:04,110
Douglas Adams was about CSS authors at

00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:06,270
least the ones I hang out with and write

00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:08,670
code with so and I would put myself in

00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:10,230
this camp in that I just constantly felt

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,089
as I was coming back to the web that I

00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,880
was doing the same stuff over and over

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:16,529
and over and over again and so I decided

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,779
to when I was trying to answer this

00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:20,339
question like what is good CSS I was

00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:24,480
like you know who might know is like the

00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:26,100
top 500 websites so I read all their CSS

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,560
and I'm not kidding about that I read it

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,480
line by line by line because I was

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,940
interested in why systems breakdown

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,800
right and CSS is kind of weird that it's

00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,319
people always tack stuff on at the

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,470
bottom so you actually get this linear

00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:43,529
view of how systems get up and

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,569
and like because I'm empathetic to those

00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,980
users my first priority is the people

00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:49,440
who actually use the products we build

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,420
but I also write CSS that I expect other

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,310
people to use and so those are my users

00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,529
and I care about them and this is all I

00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,959
see this is what I see front-end people

00:12:55,529 --> 00:13:01,949
do here's the myth about CSS that

00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:03,120
everybody sells you is like do me inline

00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:06,810
Styles are horrible

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,880
right dude if you run a class you could

00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,860
change it and it'll propagate everywhere

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,010
on your website this sounds like a

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,990
nightmare oh my god I don't know if

00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:18,029
everybody has a different job than me

00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:20,430
but normally I need to change like three

00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:22,470
things on one page as quickly as

00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:24,000
possible and get the out and like I

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,250
don't want stuff to propagate to the

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,630
thousands of pages that I can't see if

00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,279
you've worked on Salesforce as main app

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,540
it's not like you can just like run

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,279
through and like do some visual

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,600
regression testing like they have so

00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,220
many modules that get embedded

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,290
everywhere right and I think that's the

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,480
state of development but you constantly

00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,490
see this which is really just some this

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,160
seems like a lot of work to reset margin

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:45,510
padding to me and it seems unlearn able

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,779
like I'm not going to remember this the

00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:50,310
next time I have a project and I feel

00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:54,330
like if I was a cat and I saw that code

00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:56,130
I would look like this and and this is

00:13:54,330 --> 00:14:00,029
this is another example this is a

00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:01,650
different website like I'm lazy I know

00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:03,480
you guys don't really know me but I'm

00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,060
really lazy and it seems like an

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,220
incredible amount of work to put ten

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:12,839
pixels of margin on the bottom of an

00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:15,779
element yeah this is this is my internal

00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,370
catalog and like what I'm seeing these

00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:18,930
things I'm like you just really want

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,120
that Lego block like you want this Lego

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,270
block that does margin bottom ten pixels

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,040
and this is how I think about building

00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,540
the majority of UI not all of it

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,190
but I think it's really just these like

00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:33,480
small Lego blocks that I want to like

00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:35,490
throw on HTML really fast so this is

00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,900
another this person like I would have

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:41,670
left this job I would have gotten like

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:43,980
halfway and man text-align:right got it

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,930
yeah so but I start seeing this and like

00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,400
I asked this question that you know I've

00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,779
been typing CSS at this point for like

00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:55,020
six years and I'm wondering to myself

00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:57,630
like like how big is CSS right like I

00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,790
like so much of CSS you just use one

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:01,529
line things that just like how many

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,740
other times using in the system they set

00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:06,180
background color to ie right I mean

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,350
that's cool and then like look at the

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,350
classroom right gray wall

00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:12,660
you know like because they're just

00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:14,489
trying to change this one thing and like

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,739
I don't think this person's bad at CSS

00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:19,259
like I think they were trying to do

00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:20,639
something that are in a time crunch and

00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,129
this is their understanding of like how

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,809
to traverse the Dom I got nothing but

00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:31,799
love for that ah that's my happy cafes

00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:32,819
so yes yes this is like 20 kilobytes and

00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,029
you're probably like what does that mean

00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:46,439
and so there's some kind of limits this

00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:48,600
ooh so sorry so CSS is like finite for

00:15:46,439 --> 00:15:50,039
the most part right like I mean you can

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,689
do a bunch of crazy stuff too but it's

00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,639
not JavaScript it's not Ruby it's not

00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:56,100
like open-ended programming thing like

00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,410
most of what you're trying to do and the

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,989
web has already been done before and

00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:04,109
like they're just a set amount of string

00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:06,779
values so let me give you a good example

00:16:04,109 --> 00:16:08,489
here I don't actually know that much

00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:10,549
about animations background repeat'

00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:13,649
right like these are your only options

00:16:10,549 --> 00:16:16,350
so I wondered to myself yeah like if you

00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:18,720
just kind of dumped everything into one

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,189
file as single purpose classes how big

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,600
would that be because I'm looking at

00:16:20,189 --> 00:16:24,839
websites like why enjoying Salesforce

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,419
they have like a megabyte of CSS and

00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:28,559
like that sounds crazy to me but I was I

00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,999
don't know they've been around 14 years

00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,879
maybe that's a completely reasonable

00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:35,429
amount of CSS to have so when I say 20

00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:37,350
kilobytes I mean I have like 140 colors

00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:39,299
set to border color right like that I've

00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,429
never built a website doesn't need of

00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:43,379
this many border colors so I tried to

00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:45,779
like really blow this experiment out and

00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:50,339
put as many possible things in there and

00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:52,289
I put a bunch of scales in there but the

00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:53,819
point is is like 20 kilobytes that's

00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:56,519
minified in gzip by the way that's not

00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:58,139
just like a raw uncompressed file but 20

00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:00,539
kilobytes is pretty small and it's an

00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,769
interesting baseline to me and it makes

00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:04,110
me look at other websites like

00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:08,250
Kickstarter right it has 793 kilobytes

00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:10,679
they did this morning anyway that is a

00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,659
lot and there are two factors there

00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,189
right like you're sending that file to a

00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:16,139
client that somebody's got like download

00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:17,909
on their phone or their desktop but you

00:17:16,139 --> 00:17:21,779
also are giving all this work for people

00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:23,849
to like memorize or sift through later

00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:27,779
and so much of it it's just these little

00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:29,969
little Lego blocks anyway so that is all

00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:31,590
of CSS in one file it's kind of like a

00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:32,789
running experiment I have I don't think

00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,830
that your codebase shouldn't necessarily

00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:35,279
look like that was not what I'm saying

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:38,219
at all

00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,099
but I think I was kind of flabbergasted

00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:44,820
that I never asked myself what are the

00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:47,489
limits here so that's my happy cat

00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,070
there's only 20 kilobytes so if you

00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:52,200
actually take those single purpose

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,749
classes and you wanted to target a

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,059
multitude of media breakpoints you could

00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:58,499
namespace those classes to only target

00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:00,419
three different breakpoints

00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:02,669
so you're essentially got the CSS

00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:04,950
language times four right I don't know

00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:07,200
if you're following me here and that is

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,659
only 42 kilobytes or something like that

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,989
so this is kind of blew my mind when I

00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:14,639
started to put this together and I think

00:18:12,989 --> 00:18:17,399
that right now we're starting to see

00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:19,169
this move towards more in line style

00:18:17,399 --> 00:18:21,359
stuff

00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:23,669
I know react there's a talk right now

00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:25,019
going on about react where inline styles

00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:26,639
are like the future of the Internet and

00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:28,710
I could not be more of a proponent of

00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:30,509
this I totally think there's a place for

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:33,330
like component based classes and stuff

00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:34,919
like that but I think that you know I've

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,149
been running these tests on websites and

00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,489
I don't have the internet right now so I

00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:41,339
can't show you my numbers but you know

00:18:38,489 --> 00:18:43,559
you can't like 40% of most websites just

00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:47,039
breaks down to floats display colors

00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:48,809
order styles background colors and

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,219
positioning right it's just structure

00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:55,080
and skins there's like 40% of your CSS

00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:57,839
so I want to give a big thanks to this

00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,239
guy who has been working on this website

00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:03,119
called CSS stats comm with me which is

00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:05,549
this little thing that he and I built to

00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,499
start to try to answer some of these

00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:09,719
questions that we were constantly having

00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:12,570
like yeah how much is too much CSS when

00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:14,399
we refactor a large code base how much

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,839
is just redundant like where our biggest

00:19:14,399 --> 00:19:18,330
bang for the buck if we want to abstract

00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,339
things out so check that out if you ever

00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,200
want to kind of get like a little living

00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:25,349
style guide and see what your code base

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:29,639
looks like CSS stats calm this is my

00:19:25,349 --> 00:19:32,849
info but I want to leave you with

00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:34,980
basically a call to put that back up a

00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:37,140
call to arms to like expect

00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,320
more of ourselves and to push ourselves

00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,390
more because I think that our users are

00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,190
important and I think sometimes I've

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,780
worked with engineering teams and we're

00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:47,010
trying to solve problems and we get away

00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,600
from the actual problems that we're

00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,770
trying to solve which is that like we

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,380
just want to chip away at making

00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,850
people's lives better with technology we

00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,740
want to you know solves problems

00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:57,720
creatively but the most important thing

00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,490
to me is our users and making sure that

00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,750
like we respect their time so anyway

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:09,930
thank you very much

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:09,930
