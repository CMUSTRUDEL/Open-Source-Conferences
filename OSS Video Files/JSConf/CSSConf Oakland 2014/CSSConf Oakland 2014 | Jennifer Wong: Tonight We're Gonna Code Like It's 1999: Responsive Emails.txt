Publication date: 2015-01-25
Playlist: CSSConf Oakland 2014
Description: 
	It's the moment you’ve been dreading: the project of redesigning all consumer facing emails AND making them responsive becomes yours. And you've heard the rumors: designing emails means coding like it’s 1999, creating tables and adding styles inline (heaven forbid!), and throwing best practices and hopes of compatibility out the window. BREATHE. In this session, I’ll share the tips and tricks I learned, and help you get your emails in shape for 2015 and ready for the responsive spotlight.

alright so tonight or today I'm going to

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,049
talk about how we're going to code like

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,790
it's 1999 if you guys want I know you

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,440
don't have interwebs but for later on

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,890
you can follow along I've got a longer

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,890
version of the slideshow here so really

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,320
briefly Who am I once upon a time I used

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,210
to be a civil engineer but I quickly

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,810
became bored with a slow pace of the

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,000
projects I was doing so then I decided

00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:34,380
what industry do I want to be in I think

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,660
I want to be in tech because it's super

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,000
innovative it's super fast paced and so

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,820
I started working in this industry as a

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,180
quote community specialist in other

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,149
words i was doing customer support so i

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,239
totally hated it and i taught myself to

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:54,000
code i would spend nights and weekends

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,640
working on my side projects going to

00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,660
hackathons hack nights things like that

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,969
and eventually that led to success and i

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,530
landed a job as a web developer at hot

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,920
pads and i've been working there ever

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,040
since so here we go as a web developer

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,409
my first assignment at hot pads was to

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,330
redesign all of our emails and to make

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,009
the mobile friendly and i was like a

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,960
piece of cake no big deal right wrong I

00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:25,740
quickly realized that I had no idea what

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,210
I was doing but fortunately i'm here to

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,570
share all of my strategies and my

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:34,049
mistakes with all view so here's my

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,369
story about how emails are evil i'm

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,170
going to talk a little bit about design

00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,560
a bunch of things i learned before

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:44,189
during and after my emails were released

00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:48,390
and a bunch of resources that i found so

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,070
first up a little bit about design so

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,930
the first thing i wanted to do was to

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,970
redesign our welcome email since that

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,600
was kind of the punch in the face of our

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,640
users it's like hey come to our website

00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,560
welcome so what I did was I started

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,189
researching other people's welcome

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,719
emails so I look I scoured my own email

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,940
accounts i started signing up for all

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,700
these different services just so i could

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,710
look at their emails a lot of the stuff

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:19,530
is pretty instinctual

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:21,660
but I made a quick list oops so my

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,240
favorite email actually comes from indy

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,090
gogo it's not a welcome email but it's

00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:32,340
just really pretty so let's take a look

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,510
at IndieGoGo well it's huge okay so the

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,940
first thing that I notice about this

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,780
email was like the huge top anchor logo

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,310
ok this emails from indy gogo FYI I

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:46,260
noticed that they also have a lot of

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:50,040
really great content so you see lots of

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:51,570
images less text in general another

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,780
great thing they do is all their calls

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:57,930
to action are this bright magenta so you

00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:04,260
see URLs here in that color and then all

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:06,300
of these read more buttons and that's

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,740
consistent through the email a couple of

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,560
other things I noticed is they've got

00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,210
these social media icons as well as the

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,720
text down here which is really great for

00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:18,300
accessibility and then at the very very

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,950
bottom of course the unsubscribe and way

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:29,120
to update your subscription preferences

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:29,120
I am trying to switch tabs now

00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,340
whoops

00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,410
sorry about that

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,030
all right let's go back to my slides or

00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,030
not

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:13,230
all right everybody take a nap i know we

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:15,180
just had the lunch so yep thank you all

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:18,060
right so from that email and the bunch

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,920
of bunches of emails i was looking at I

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,480
had a found a bunch of takeaways and

00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,730
those are that you want to keep your

00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,410
emails texts light you want to keep them

00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,600
image-heavy just to keep the interest of

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,310
your users have that huge top anchored

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,010
logo so people know where your email is

00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:33,510
coming from and then also you want to

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,950
set a max width on your email you don't

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,850
want people reading across the screen

00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,990
just to see what you want to say alright

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,700
so the next thing I wanted to take a

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,660
look at was the emails that I'd be

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:47,610
working with so I did and here's the

00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,000
welcome email from hot pads I was like

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,860
oh my god so a couple of things first

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,890
off why is the logo right in the middle

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,630
of email I don't know another thing

00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,700
you'll notice is the spacing is really

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,590
inconsistent throughout the email it

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,400
doesn't really make any sense why things

00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:06,900
are have the margins that they do the

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,630
last thing I noticed was wait where do

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,220
you unsubscribe if your user the type of

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,560
user who gets really annoyed at all of

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,820
these emails pummeling your inbox then

00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,260
you definitely want to be able to at

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,100
least find that unsubscribe no matter

00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:23,880
how hard it is to find so basically I

00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:26,910
was like dog I was like wow okay so

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,320
that's what I'm working with so the next

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,340
thing I wanted to do in designing our

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:35,070
emails was to plan on what I was making

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,360
and I had a couple of goals in mind so

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:38,910
the first was to bring a bunch of

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,790
consistency to our emails I took a look

00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,500
at all of our emails across hot pads and

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,720
they were all different like the logos

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,570
in different places there are different

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,669
margins different icons so I was like

00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,650
all right let's bring some consistency

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,450
to them and in general having that

00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,150
consistency will bring brand awareness

00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:59,220
again seeing that top anchor blue logo

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:03,360
over and over again will make sure that

00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,890
your brand is recognizable so another

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,990
thing I took a look at in my planning

00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,880
was a bunch of pre-made templates I'm

00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,070
sure a bunch of you guys have seen all

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,599
those and there are just lots of options

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,900
which I'm going to talk about a little

00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:17,340
bit later and I actually didn't use any

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,770
of them

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:22,110
the reason why was because I was redoing

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:25,380
all of our emails we have a pretty like

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,840
specific user base that uses outlook a

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,630
lot still so I wanted to make sure I had

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,729
something that was customizable also

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:34,800
being that this was the first project I

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:36,540
did as a web developer it was a learning

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,970
experience for me and I had a lot of

00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,100
time on my hands so if you're a company

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,600
that doesn't have the time you could go

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,280
with a template but if you've got a lot

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,260
of time and you need a customizable

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,460
solution then I'd recommend just

00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:53,040
building your own the next thing I did

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,600
was a bunch of sketches so if I've

00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,940
learned anything from UX it's that

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,560
sketching is awesome so you see here

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,410
I've actually sketched the same email

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,300
four different times and in general when

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:06,060
you do sketch you will find that your

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,919
later sketches are much better than the

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,280
previous ones so it's good to just do it

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,200
over and over again another thing you

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,000
can do in planning your design is if

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,160
you've got the skills for photoshop i'd

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,930
recommend it it's great you can have a

00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,760
quick mock-up so you see here one of the

00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:26,820
earlier mock-ups of our wealth of our

00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:28,590
welcome email that i did another thing

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:31,050
to keep in mind is what i call the rule

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,610
of thumbs so minimum touchable area i

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:36,479
think a lot of people heard the number

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:39,539
44 x 44 pixels this is actually based on

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,120
the original iphones human interface

00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:45,450
guidelines which actually no longer

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,700
exists so wipe that number from your

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:49,080
mind take a look at these links you'll

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,380
find a bunch of different minimum

00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,849
touchable areas for different devices

00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,740
they vary quite a bit so you probably

00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:58,620
want to take a look at the devices that

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:04,020
your users have and then base it on the

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:06,599
largest size all right so here's my

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,880
template this is the email i created

00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,729
from the original one again you'll see

00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:13,889
the top anchor logo you'll see the links

00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:16,919
are underlined for accessibility as well

00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:20,099
as color colored differently i changed a

00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,990
bunch of things for mobile and for

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,910
social media so that you have images

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,460
instead and again with the text below

00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:28,590
for accessibility it's a little bit hard

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,220
to see but below that in the footer I'm

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:31,930
mimicking what hot pads

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:34,120
website used to look like it's the same

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,400
footer so people kind of see that

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,599
consistency from the web on to the

00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,159
emails so I like to say that it's an

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,760
aesthetic that Prince would approve of

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,560
and just for reference here's the

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,140
original email and then the email that I

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,210
designed so they see the content is a

00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:55,240
little bit longer in my version but I

00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:57,370
think it looks a whole lot better and a

00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,990
lot of trap or traffic shot up shot

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:04,720
through the roof after the redesign of

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:08,350
this email all right on to code a bunch

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,390
of tips and tricks so you can find my

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:12,310
template on github it's just the general

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:17,350
template that I created for the hot pads

00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:19,210
emails so why template a great thing

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,740
about having a template is that you can

00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,680
keep your code dry so you're not

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,820
repeating yourself so see in my email

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,290
what we're calling our little micro

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,880
listing it's like the same little block

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,130
of code just repeated over and over

00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:32,770
again again you'll see the consistency

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,930
in the hot pads logo so that people know

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:38,140
where emails coming from as well as the

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:42,460
frame and the footer so a little bit of

00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,870
abstraction goes a really long way all

00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,589
right some things that I learned before

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:52,420
I started coding my emails tables are

00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:55,860
coming Mozilla developer network says

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:58,150
note prior to the creation of CSS HTML

00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,420
table elements were often used as a

00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:03,670
method for page layout this usage has

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:06,400
since been discouraged or excuse me been

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,230
discouraged since HTML 4 and the table

00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:15,160
element should not be used for layout

00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:17,320
purposes emails sale ol to that so one

00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,230
thing I found out was that tables do not

00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,600
display as inline or block the default

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,690
CSS for a table is to display as table

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,130
probably makes sense but one thing I

00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,140
found it is you actually want to specify

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,030
your tables to display its block other

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,320
chrome otherwise chrome is going to

00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,320
totally ignore your max width

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,960
another thing I learned about we're in

00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,060
line styles you've got to use them

00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,660
because most email clients do not

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:48,030
support a head section in your HTML page

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,860
there's a CSS excuse me a page on

00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:52,110
campaign monitor letting you know what

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:56,400
CSS is supported over different email

00:10:52,110 --> 00:11:00,300
clients and also there are actually

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:03,480
really great websites that will actually

00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,590
put your styles in line for you so

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,660
unfortunately you're going to be doing a

00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:09,780
lot of this you'll see all of my Styles

00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:13,550
in line it's it's a mess but like I said

00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,550
you've got those tools that can help you

00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:19,800
another thing is the max width so you

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,470
see here I've got a really wide email

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,690
that I received so you're just going to

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,850
be just reading across the page so just

00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,620
take a note from print design you don't

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,030
want people reading across the page you

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,650
want them to be able to scan with their

00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:37,680
eyes so good max with number to keep in

00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:39,720
mind is 550 to 600 pixels and that's

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:45,330
based on most email clients preview

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:47,100
pains so quick note about comments

00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:49,500
you're going to have tables all the way

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,870
down your page tables within tables

00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,420
within tables for your email so you take

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,820
a quick look at the code up here I've

00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:59,490
got a couple of comments letting me know

00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,740
when one table starts and one table ends

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:06,390
and it's a good thing to keep in mind so

00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:08,630
use a lot of comments alright another

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,280
thing to keep in mind our image alt

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:14,940
alternatives so it's really good to

00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:17,220
always have an alt attribute on your

00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:19,440
image tags or a background color set on

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,720
them it's really good for accessibility

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,340
in case the email client isn't going to

00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:29,040
display your image oops so you'll see

00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:30,990
here gmail is not displaying the hot

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,300
pads logo so by having that alt

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:35,400
attribute it's really helpful for users

00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,870
to see what they are missing out on and

00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,280
you know if they want to click just to

00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,660
see the hot pads logo that would be

00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:44,580
great another thing again accessibility

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,470
so below you'll also see that I've set a

00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,630
background color on the footer of my

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,889
email just in case that image at the

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,319
bottom doesn't show you'll see

00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:56,939
see this nice blue border surrounding

00:12:52,319 --> 00:13:01,170
the email all right some things I

00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:04,009
learned while I was coding so media

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:07,980
queries we all love media queries right

00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:09,779
maybe well they're really great for

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,239
things like readability and targeting

00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:14,939
specific devices again this talk is

00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:17,309
about responsive emails so here you'll

00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:20,069
want to keep you'll see here that i set

00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:22,470
a max width on the background table of

00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:26,879
my email for any device or browser

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:28,559
that's much wider another thing you can

00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,509
do with media queries is use them in

00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,970
conjunction with fluid layouts and

00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:34,829
percentage based widths so you'll see

00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,100
here I'm targeting devices that have a

00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:39,629
max width of 480 pixels and for any

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,029
email clients that actually don't

00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:44,429
recognize media devices I also have the

00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,449
table with set to one hundred percent so

00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:46,919
it's really good to use those in

00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:52,589
conjunctions you can hit all those

00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:54,059
different email clients and a quick note

00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:56,489
about media queries so when I was

00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:58,980
designing these emails I actually focus

00:13:56,489 --> 00:14:01,470
on the browser first and then had them

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,139
degrade over mobile and that's just

00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:07,649
because our users mostly were accessing

00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:10,049
the emails on route on browser versus

00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:11,759
mobile devices so it's a little bit hard

00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:18,089
to see here it's cut off but you guys

00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:20,129
can check out those slides later alright

00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:22,739
the next thing to keep in mind is again

00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:25,439
device pixel ratio for your media

00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:28,410
queries so here I'm targeting all the

00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:34,439
retina or high res devices and I'll get

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:37,199
into that a little bit later okay

00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:40,169
important when should we use it most

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:44,999
people say never and for me and emails I

00:14:40,169 --> 00:14:47,069
say sometimes so important here what

00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:49,739
you'll see is sometimes your inline

00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:51,419
styles will be will overwrite your media

00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:55,739
queries and you don't always want that

00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:58,049
to happen so for my mobile devices I've

00:14:55,739 --> 00:15:01,559
set the header bar to be a height of 5

00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:03,010
pixels and for browser-based or like

00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,350
wider devices I

00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,640
have the header bar set to 10 pixels so

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,350
you'll see the inline style will

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,450
overwrite the media query so in this

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,370
case having important there in the media

00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:18,610
query will make sure that the header bar

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:20,380
stays small for mobile devices all right

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,090
this one's a little bit weird so the

00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:25,690
very bottom of this image you'll see a

00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:28,360
thin blue line at the bottom of that

00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,920
footer and I was like what is that where

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,800
did that come from why can't I make it

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,990
go away well it turns out it was a line

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,970
height issue so there are a couple of

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,340
solutions that will resolve that for me

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,440
and one is to set a line height on the

00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,420
surrounding column element the other is

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,830
to set the image to display as block so

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,780
it doesn't interact with those line

00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:52,000
heights all right lastly things that I

00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:57,460
learned after the release of my emails

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,500
whoops so this one is super weird and

00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:01,560
only occurs occasionally so occasionally

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,420
that I don't even have an example of it

00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,790
but once in a while your image will

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:09,880
appear with a thin gray border around it

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:12,040
I was like why is that happening and it

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,420
mostly only happened in gmail and I

00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,240
couldn't figure it out until I just

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,870
tried something randomly so it turns out

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,930
the reason was because I had the image

00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:25,060
on a different line than my anchor

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:27,190
element so actually putting them in line

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:29,200
got rid of that border don't ask me why

00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,210
if you guys see a gray border around

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:36,070
your images and emails now you'll know

00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:38,590
that this is the solution another thing

00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,810
I notice was my high-res images for

00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:44,770
retina were not being sized down so

00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:46,270
people were getting this email which

00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:49,360
obviously is not going to make them want

00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:52,330
to go to our site so it's like okay what

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:56,020
do I do well the problem is that outlook

00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:59,260
2007 1013 and outlook for internet

00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:01,390
explorer don't allow for HTML or CSS

00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:04,150
resizing of images so there's like oh

00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:06,970
great what do I do now well the solution

00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:08,680
is to replace your image with a

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:11,079
background image style on the

00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,570
surrounding column element and then set

00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:15,370
the image to display as none and i found

00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:19,610
that solution from campaign monitor

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:22,399
so see the code here so up at the top

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:24,949
you'll see for my high res devices that

00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:26,740
I've set a background image on that

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:29,330
surrounding column element and then I

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:36,009
set the image to display as none and

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:38,779
you'll see the HTML down here alright

00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:44,870
another thing I learned was at outlook

00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:46,549
2007 2010 and 2013 ignore max width so

00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,460
what you want to do here is have a max

00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:52,129
width bypass so you'll set a fluid

00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,769
layout for your baseline elements so

00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:57,529
you'll see here i set a width fluid

00:17:54,769 --> 00:18:00,200
width of a hundred percent and then a

00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:02,149
media query for any screens that are

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:07,730
larger than that to set a fixed width

00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:10,460
instead of a max width of 600 pixels so

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:14,990
you may be wondering outlook 2007 10 and

00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:17,750
13 WTF well it turns out that the

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:21,669
rendering engines for CH outlook 2002

00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:26,019
2003 our intern is internet explorer for

00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:29,600
2007-2010 in 2013 it's microsoft word

00:18:26,019 --> 00:18:31,580
yeah and i don't ask me why I would look

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,379
2011 they made the right move and they

00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,480
used WebKit they call it outlook for mac

00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:36,860
so the rendering engine is awesome but

00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:42,470
then I don't know why they just switched

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:44,779
back in 2013 alright the last thing that

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,419
I learned after the release of my email

00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:49,519
who is that gmail ignores any color

00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:52,279
styles on your anchor tags in the head

00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:55,460
of your HTML page so you actually have

00:18:52,279 --> 00:19:02,299
to go and sell every single anchor tag

00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:05,179
in line in your email all right now some

00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:08,179
quick resources so I found all these

00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:11,299
really great blogs style campaign is a

00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:13,490
company run by Anna Yemen you'll see in

00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:15,470
the background it's kind of faint but

00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,419
you'll see her device library so she

00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,820
spends a ton of time on email and

00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:22,759
marketing it's a really great blog lots

00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:25,010
of solutions there litmus is a testing

00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:26,840
suite for emails they also have a really

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,320
great blog and they take note of

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,899
weirdnesses in the

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,250
for an outlooks and I think everyone's

00:19:30,899 --> 00:19:34,230
pretty familiar with campaign monitor

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:37,289
and MailChimp again they have a really

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:42,029
great blog and they are both online

00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:43,679
marketing email solutions all right so

00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:45,480
off to the templates that I had

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,830
mentioned earlier so there's herb Inc

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,409
the same company that puts out

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,880
foundation again campaign monitor and

00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:52,889
MailChimp have their own templates which

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,860
are really great and then there's the

00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:58,139
HTML email boilerplate by shawn powell

00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,210
and i don't know if you can see it but

00:19:58,139 --> 00:20:03,419
it's in the background of this email so

00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:05,639
or of this slide and you can see it gets

00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,110
a little bit complicated so it

00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:08,970
definitely takes care of everything you

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,129
need but something to keep in mind it's

00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,110
a lot of code another thing to keep in

00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:16,710
mind is i just found out that sir pink

00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:19,590
actually doesn't support outlook 2007 10

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:24,450
or 13 so they made these great templates

00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:27,690
but they took the easy way and then

00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:30,049
lastly testing so email on acid and

00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:33,620
litmus are really great testing suites

00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:35,519
email on acid is free witness is not

00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,620
unfortunately the company i work for it

00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,179
has a subscription with knit litmus and

00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,970
so you may be see that in the background

00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:44,639
as well but basically you can send them

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:46,320
an email and they'll display what your

00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:50,070
email will look like across different

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,600
email clients and that's it you guys

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,809
have any questions you can speak to me

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,809
later

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,790
