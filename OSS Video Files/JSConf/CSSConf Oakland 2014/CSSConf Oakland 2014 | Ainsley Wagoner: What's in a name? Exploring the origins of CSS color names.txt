Title: CSSConf Oakland 2014 | Ainsley Wagoner: What's in a name? Exploring the origins of CSS color names
Publication date: 2015-01-25
Playlist: CSSConf Oakland 2014
Description: 
	Color names are a sort of easter egg of CSS. When we go to plug in styles, most of us already have specific, brand-related hex values that we use, but these 147 colors lay in wait for someone to call them by name and make use of their built-in capabilities. (Mintcream, Navajo White, Blanched Almond)

This talk will survey the built-in palette of CSS colors but go further to explore their origins and the implications. Who names them? What is their ancestral lineage? How does a color get added and who decides when to add (for this we will take a look at the case study of Becca Purple) What is the cut-off? Furthermore, what do these colors and names reveal about biases inherent within CSS?

mic check 12 hey everyone thanks for

00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:12,340
being back here from lunch I want to say

00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:15,039
thank you to jay s fest and CSS comp

00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,810
Oakland the organizers Carolina and

00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,660
Michael for giving me this opportunity

00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,340
to talk about something that I think is

00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:28,120
really fun and then I'm really

00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:29,980
passionate about so let's see very good

00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,500
so there's a lot of really fascinating

00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,140
math behind the display of colors on the

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:37,390
web there's hue and saturation and

00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:42,280
brightness and then variables of this

00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:44,440
and that is a whole talk in itself but

00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,569
what drew me to designing for the web

00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,309
and the first place was that first of

00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:51,579
all I could use really vibrant colors

00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:54,309
and second of all that the web connects

00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:57,879
you to information and stories and

00:00:54,309 --> 00:01:03,039
people so I want to talk today about the

00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:04,449
stories behind the hex values so for a

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,060
while I have loved these two things

00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:08,650
separately I love riding CSS code and

00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:13,300
making things look good on the web and I

00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:15,400
love color I got really into namespace

00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:18,070
colors when I saw this project it's

00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,670
called music for the Memphis group and

00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:25,680
it's just really cool basically visual

00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:28,140
album almost it's imagining of what the

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,310
what this design group the Memphis group

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,990
what the type of music they would listen

00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:34,150
to and the background is all these

00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:37,120
different Memphis group patterns and I

00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:40,120
like I started tweeting at the guy who

00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,250
designed it and asking him how he did it

00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,040
and he was telling me that the

00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,840
background is actually rendered all with

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,180
SVG's and three different layers of

00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,820
transparent SVG's and he was like I used

00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,370
all CSS namespace colors for the colors

00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:58,240
and this is something that I had heard

00:01:54,370 --> 00:02:01,470
of but I never really made much use of

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:05,110
namespace colors like just by themselves

00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,850
so I think everyone knows this but just

00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,039
to make sure we're on the same page when

00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,750
I'm talking about CSS namespace values I

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,730
mean when you're coding in CSS and

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,790
instead of typing in the hex value you

00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,080
can reference a set list of key word

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:21,940
color keywords I think

00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:23,200
about 147 of them and the browser and

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,250
everyone will know what you're talking

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,750
about so back to this project I was

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,450
talking to the creator of it and he was

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,960
showing me the color chart that he used

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:36,400
in order to make this design and I got

00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,820
really inspired and wanted to make my

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,510
own but put it in rainbow order like you

00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:46,030
do and when while i was doing this i

00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,040
spent a lot of time with the names and i

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,920
got really intrigued about where they

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,960
came from a lot of them are kind of

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,060
quirky like some are really normal but

00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,709
then some are really out there like I

00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,990
think on this slide we see peach puff

00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:04,270
and tomato and I wanted to know more

00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,150
about how those names got chosen and who

00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,790
got to pick them and I knew the story of

00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:12,550
one recent color edition I think a lot

00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,160
of you do that's Rebecca purple so most

00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:18,700
of you know this but almost exactly six

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:22,690
months ago Eric Myers a big writer about

00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:24,940
CSS and web standards his daughter six

00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:28,120
years old Rebecca passed away after a

00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,790
battle with pediatric brain cancer so in

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:34,450
her memory and in their honor a proposal

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:37,530
was submitted to name six six-thirty 399

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:40,930
after Rebecca and call it Rebecca purple

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,630
so this is this really incredibly human

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,630
moment touching story of naming of

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:49,120
colors and a great moment in the history

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,760
of the internet that really brings his

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,530
color to life and I was hungry for more

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,450
stories like this behind the naming of

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,340
the colors and I thought surely there

00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,260
were more instances of why something was

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,950
called papayawhip or a mint cream or

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:06,550
gainsborough so I went hunting for more

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:09,489
anecdotes I'll tell you what I found the

00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:11,580
reality is a lot more tedious and sort

00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:15,160
of black and white and boring but

00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,900
there's a lot that is revealed about the

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,680
history of the web and the possibilities

00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:23,320
that lay ahead of us so the first thing

00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:29,689
to clear up about CSS namespace values

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:32,360
is that they're not CSS original they

00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:34,939
were there web standard colors and i

00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:39,039
think i saw in Brenna's slides a lot

00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:42,199
like she uses them an SVG they're there

00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:44,089
they can be used across a lot of

00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,389
different platforms which we'll get to

00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:49,549
but they were originally descended from

00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:51,439
the x windowing system which is a

00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:54,259
windowing system for bit map displays

00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,319
common on unix-like computer operating

00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:59,649
systems so these were called the x11

00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:02,929
colors and they were first shipped in

00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:04,759
1986 so this type of windowing system

00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:06,919
was one of the first graphic user

00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,919
interfaces to render things in window

00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:12,019
boxes and so having these standard

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,989
system colors were really important for

00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:19,099
the differentiation of different areas

00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:21,019
and sections and windows the original

00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:23,929
late 80s list still had a lot of

00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:26,239
variation between monitors so there was

00:05:23,929 --> 00:05:28,669
kind of an agreed-upon set of names but

00:05:26,239 --> 00:05:30,169
even within those the different vendors

00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:33,469
would tweak the values for their

00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:35,539
particular monitor so neither the names

00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:38,989
nor the values were quite standardized

00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:41,899
yet until nineteen eighty nine we see

00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:44,569
the release of the fourth revision of X

00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:48,349
11 and most of the colors that we know

00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:50,300
today as web standard colors so here is

00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:53,989
the beginning of that x11 color list

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:56,989
these colors were user tested and tuned

00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:59,779
originally to an HP monitor and graphic

00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:01,610
designer started to get used to them so

00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:03,919
from there they were popularized by

00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,739
Netscape and then they started being

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,769
widely used in HTML browsers and finally

00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:12,469
in 2011 I think SVG officially

00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:15,139
standardized them and then also in 2011

00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:18,860
they were rolled into the css3 color

00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:21,319
module so we took a while but the usage

00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,149
in css3 is just the most recent tip of

00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,809
the iceberg for these standard web

00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:29,259
colors why did it take so long that begs

00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:33,110
a question there's a big gap between

00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:35,149
1986 and 2011 well as we have already

00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,489
heard today it takes a while for web

00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:41,240
standards to get rolled in and it's

00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:43,590
normal for things to take I think tab

00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,110
says like five years at the least

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,850
and also because apparently there are a

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,160
lot better ways to incorporate name

00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:52,080
color values in CSS which maybe you guys

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,820
make use of you can sort of define your

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,430
own values and if you really like a

00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,310
certain pink you can call it George pink

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:02,690
or project pink and then go from there

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:05,700
and so they're not necessarily needed

00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,840
but I want to make an argument for using

00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,540
them because I think they're really

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,580
great even though they're not CSS I

00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:16,260
think there's a lot of good reasons why

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:18,810
to use them they are time and user

00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,610
tested for accessibility I was really

00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,350
nervous about this slide because I was

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,240
like I'm saying this but I don't know

00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,740
how this yellow is going to look it

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,230
could really kill everyone's eyes but

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:33,600
it's going well so there you go because

00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,550
they were put through the wringer before

00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,430
at being added to the web standard list

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:42,000
we know that we can rely on them to be

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:44,550
good looking on the on the web and on

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,950
monitors so when you're writing code you

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,830
are obviously dealing with a lot of

00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:52,140
syntax and numbers and I think it's so

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:54,020
refreshing that you can just use the

00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,310
name and they're not case-sensitive

00:07:54,020 --> 00:08:00,710
again they're recognized by all browsers

00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:04,170
and they work across HTML and SVG and

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:06,510
they have really fun names so i will

00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:13,220
highlight some of my favorite ones we

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:15,780
have honeydew papayawhip mint cream

00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,370
Navajo white this was actually one of

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,390
the first ones that I was scrolling

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:22,400
through the list I was like what's

00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,400
Navajo white and why is it orange

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:36,530
cornflower blue Dodger blue orchid

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:42,690
antique white gainsborough saddle brown

00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:46,230
Peru ghost white these are just a few of

00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,460
my favorite so while it wasn't exactly a

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,830
committee of people sitting around

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:52,530
deciding to name something gainsborough

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:56,889
or bone white i did find out where these

00:08:52,530 --> 00:09:00,369
names came from so in 1980

00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:01,929
9 for the fourth revision of X 11 this

00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:03,519
is when a big bunch of the colors were

00:09:01,929 --> 00:09:05,379
added and one of the one of the

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,009
contributors to this was Paul raveling

00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:12,369
and he got a lot of colors from Sinclair

00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:15,339
paint swatches and a lot of the ones

00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:17,879
that a lot of the light and off white

00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:20,799
colors were from Sinclair paint swatches

00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:24,459
Sinclair paints was a california area

00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:26,949
paint supplier and after these colors

00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:28,029
were added they were actually bought up

00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:29,019
by somebody in the bought out by

00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:33,519
somebody else and they're like

00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:36,399
completely devoured now but I went

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:40,929
digging on paint forums and somebody had

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,970
a swatch book from the late 80s and you

00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:45,910
can sort of recognize some of these

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:49,239
names which is so cool I'll highlight

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,429
the ones that are like definitely in the

00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:54,309
web standard colors but it makes sense

00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:56,049
because thinking about like what the

00:09:54,309 --> 00:09:57,879
goofy names are in these web standard

00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:59,980
colors and when you're naming paint

00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:01,929
swatches and you have to find six

00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:06,299
different ways to say light orange you

00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:08,949
get really creative so hence papayawhip

00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:11,470
you may have noticed that a lot of these

00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:13,569
colors which were using this and Claire

00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:16,689
paint swatches there are a lot of beiges

00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:18,699
and off rights so this is one of my

00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:20,589
favorite sections but it does sort of

00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:22,629
beg the question like why do we have so

00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:25,149
many beiges I don't know about you guys

00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:26,980
but I I maybe use a lot of Gray's a lot

00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:29,379
of different like light or dark Gray's

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:34,720
but I don't really need that many bases

00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:36,850
well this is because there's so many

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,980
options for different browser

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:42,009
backgrounds when these were standardized

00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,689
in the late 80s and early 90s this was

00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:45,669
so designers could find like the perfect

00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:50,470
beige for their desktop browser

00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:53,470
background so another big chunk of them

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:56,829
came from John see Thomas naming a lot

00:10:53,470 --> 00:11:00,999
of the colors after Crayola 72 crayon

00:10:56,829 --> 00:11:02,769
box that he had on hand in scrolling

00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:04,869
through the list of the different names

00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:06,779
of Crayola crayons you can recognize

00:11:04,869 --> 00:11:10,510
some that are definitely rolled in I

00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:12,910
think I counted 39 that are

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,080
definitely from this list and this also

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,970
makes sense because when you're looking

00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,580
at naming a lot of colors it makes sense

00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:21,820
to reference a commonly held standard

00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,830
color nomenclature so these are ones

00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,600
that are definitely from Crayola crayons

00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:31,030
and then from there there's light and

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,770
dark variations so adding colors

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,620
actually seems to be a rare occurrence

00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,680
for web standards considering we're

00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:42,310
still working off the list released in

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,560
1989 besides Rebecca purple the names we

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:48,120
have today we're gathered from various

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,860
defaults and more or less are the same

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,810
even Rebecca purple which seems like an

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:56,140
obvious opportunity for doing something

00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:58,120
nice and beautiful and human why not

00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,250
name this color after the sweet little

00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,680
girl but there was a big debate over

00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:06,220
this over adding this and it was added

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:10,450
unusually quickly I think in less than I

00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:12,850
think it was like three months but this

00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:14,380
is because the creators of web standards

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,420
take their responsibilities very

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,670
seriously which is really good we want

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,610
that but it also means that colors never

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:23,290
get added to the standard list and I

00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,540
just wonder why should we stop there are

00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:27,610
we really cool with this or should we

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,980
question the standard list and make it a

00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:34,210
part of web culture to expand this list

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,830
of colors I believe that color is one of

00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:39,790
the ways that we can make the internet

00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,560
more human and more fun I think that

00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,450
default is boring and I think so many

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,510
websites seem to be generated from

00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:49,630
defaults they have the same navies and

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:52,390
grays and black and default bootstrap

00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,580
templates so I invite all color lovers

00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,200
to think beyond the default but I also

00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,110
challenge you to think about the color

00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:03,220
of the web we have so many colors at our

00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:05,110
disposal why aren't we using them we

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,780
have this great resource for trying

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:10,060
tested colors so there's kind of no

00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,890
excuse to just pick some of these and

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,840
start experimenting I think that's a

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:17,800
theme of today is experiment and be

00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,720
adventurous of course we have to keep in

00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,260
mind accessibility especially when it

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,100
comes to rendering text the w3c states

00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,199
that call

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,120
or should not be the only means for

00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:30,160
conveying information or prompting in

00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,949
action but still we should use more

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,199
color so I want to show you guys some

00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:39,310
examples of sites that are using color

00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:43,360
boldly and using it really well this is

00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:45,190
a site for pollen Midwest and I think

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,680
that this website really struck me

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,060
because they use colors that I sort of

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,550
thought were off limits like this

00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,009
magenta and bright yellow and they also

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,930
use a wider color palette than I

00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:58,389
normally do I think typically as a

00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:00,519
visual designer I pick one or two accent

00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:02,290
colors and feel like I'm even pushing it

00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,000
at that and then everything else I just

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:06,819
let be neutral and come stay in the

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,360
background but they've used all of these

00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:14,529
really bright accent colors and because

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,790
of the mastering of design they pulled

00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:18,670
it off and still made it look really

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,529
slick and professional but to me the

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,940
site is really memorable because of its

00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:25,209
use of color and because of its color

00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,579
palette so this is a portfolio for an

00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:31,089
Australian designer and also a really

00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:32,980
bold nice use of primary colors and a

00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:35,350
bold color palette that I think makes

00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:37,839
this portfolio website which we've all

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,660
seen a million of really stand out and

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,660
really be nice but you might be thinking

00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:46,089
I have to work on serious things I have

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,529
to work on financial site and I have to

00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:50,800
make websites that make people feel

00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:55,120
secure about using it and doing business

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:57,279
on the Internet I hear you the biggest

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,920
projects I've done have have been these

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,230
types of projects for nonprofits dealing

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,079
with financials and working with

00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:07,389
government websites too and the default

00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:12,220
there is again to use like navy blue or

00:15:07,389 --> 00:15:14,800
blue or blue and grey and black but my

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,079
trick is to kind of find like the little

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,810
instances where you can flip that out

00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:21,610
and what I do a lot is use instead of

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,880
that navy blue is like a like a green

00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:27,610
okay like a blue green and then use

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,139
illustrations as an opportunity to make

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,910
things really beautiful and you see an

00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:33,730
even wider color palette because i think

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:35,970
if you nine times out of ten if you come

00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,690
back with a beautiful design people are

00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:41,470
going to be

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:43,570
one over by that so I say make it

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:47,320
beautiful and don't ask permission to

00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:48,610
use pastels so there's one thing you

00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:52,270
take away from this talk I hope it's

00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:54,730
that but seriously we should have fun

00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:58,630
with color we should use these CSS

00:15:54,730 --> 00:16:00,850
namespace values and we should challenge

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,980
ourselves to think beyond default colors

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,340
and even push the standard list of

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:09,130
colors I want to make a shameless plug

00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:11,860
for my own CSS color chart if you want

00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,630
to experiment start here but there's a

00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,760
lot of really great ones there's a guy

00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:18,910
named Neil orange peel that has one that

00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:21,400
is definitely better than mine but

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:27,880
different but you have this link so use

00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:32,590
that one these are some some references

00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:34,810
i used a big thank you to Chris Lilly he

00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:38,500
was actually super helpful in answering

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:42,280
all my questions about CSS color specs

00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:45,010
and web standards and thank you to

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,630
lexington ladies code club and lexington

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,060
kentucky to let me try this talk out and

00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,890
to Code for America which is a great

00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,140
place to work that lets you do such

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:56,020
creative things with color even when

00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,300
working with governments and if you want

00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:01,150
to talk to me about being a fellow

00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:04,170
please do so thank you so much to CSS

00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,170
