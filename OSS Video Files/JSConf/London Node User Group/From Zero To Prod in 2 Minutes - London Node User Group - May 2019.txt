Title: From Zero To Prod in 2 Minutes - London Node User Group - May 2019
Publication date: 2019-06-04
Playlist: London Node User Group
Description: 
	Presented by Hew Ingram & Thomas Ankcorn

Writing code is great, working out how to host it is less great (for most people!). We recently ran a workshop at CityJs and made sure that everyone walked out of that workshop with an app deployed. In this talk we’ll chat through some of the things that helped us do that (Netlify, serverless functions and Vue) as well as some alternatives (The Serverless framework + lambda etc, firebase and other SPA hosting). The aim? To get everyone to feel empowered to build something fun (and potentially silly).

About the presenters:

Hew Ingram: I’m a Full Stack engineer at Applied (a little startup striving to make hiring fairer, smarter and easier - driving forward diversity in companies). I predominantly use JS but dabble with bits of python, PHP and others. Lover of all things Javascript + a big fan of building cool (weird) things, often for the hell of it.

Thomas Ankcorn: I'm a Software Engineer at BAE. I like JavaScript , starting but not finishing side projects and cats. Often referred to as some dude with a scooter.

awesome cool hey everyone we're going to

00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,089
talk about deploying to production or

00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:09,269
how to build um share and share with

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,980
your friends so we'll get into why in a

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,000
second and it'll make sense start off

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,950
with us

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,020
I mean Simon's basically covered all

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,270
about us my name is Hugh I work for a

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,640
little startup called applied we make a

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,210
software that helps you hire people in

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,019
an unbiased way and hire the best person

00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:42,180
if you wanna learn how to hi great

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:44,149
developers come chat with me so this

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,020
talk is kind of a fallout from a

00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:48,899
workshop we did at a conference called

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,350
6j s recently where we got a group of a

00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,649
roomful of people to build a tic-tac-toe

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,489
game with a like a I powered back-end

00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:58,800
some of you might be thinking why would

00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:02,449
you build AI to do tic-tac-toe good

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,960
because we could so quick question

00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:06,170
what's the coolest thing about

00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,260
JavaScript hands up

00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:13,729
how come on curly brackets mmm a fine

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:17,939
yeah whatever me Colin's

00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:20,220
Google variables anyone else this this

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:31,590
well we can debate that for a very long

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:32,460
time pardon come on speed yeah that come

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,380
on what's the coolest thing about

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,610
JavaScript it runs in the browser yes so

00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,020
we're gonna chat about building some

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,829
stuff that runs in the browser so

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,360
obviously oh no this is good work we've

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,560
built some weird stuff that runs in the

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,479
browser so hey this is a cool thing it's

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,020
a clock that uses a mocha everyone tell

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,119
the time off this

00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:57,130
it's a clock that uses emojis to tell

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,500
the time if you're boring you can toggle

00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,440
it into the normal mode where it uses

00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,119
the emoji numbers to tell the time only

00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,020
in JavaScript and the question might be

00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,850
why the hell did I do this the next one

00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,899
comes with a bit of story so I live in a

00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,880
house with some mates

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,500
and we've got a cat called grizzly chris

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,450
lee is an adorable black cat he's great

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,220
one day we came home to one of my

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,239
flatmates ben who was in the lounge with

00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:23,230
a different black cat and we were like

00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,570
Ben may what's up and he's like no it's

00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,209
Kristi I'm like that's not Chris Lee so

00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:31,120
I built a healthful app for him called

00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:33,340
grizzly or not grizzly where you get to

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,459
play the idea was to train him a bit and

00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,030
what our cut looks like so that's not

00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,010
grizzly

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,840
that's not grizzly that's also not

00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,019
grizzly that's not grizzly

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,080
that's a dog that's Brickley isn't

00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:48,310
grizzly great whatever you can go

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,890
through you can do some things it tells

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:54,250
you only one you know grizzly so there

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:56,319
is a point to this so I made that I sent

00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:58,750
it to my other housemate Rosie and her

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,840
reaction was oh my god can I send this

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,030
to everyone I know my answer was not oh

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,040
yeah it's on my machine I'll go and show

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,600
you it on my machine my answers no

00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,360
here's a link I've deployed it you can

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,900
go play with it and we're going to talk

00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:17,320
about how we did that this isn't just

00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:20,140
for dumb this is so applied we do

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,880
blind hiring I made this tool that helps

00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,230
people analyze their job descriptions so

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,030
you put in a job description it

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:26,950
highlights some stuff like gendered

00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,579
language some terms like state

00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:33,400
of the art whatever so masculine words

00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:35,769
like leading and lead stuff that sort of

00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,940
basically helps you guide you submit

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:37,480
your job description as inclusive as

00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,370
possible

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,239
I built this I don't know if it's gonna

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,359
make money I didn't know if it was

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,970
sensible I throw it together and I

00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:47,410
hosted it in a way that when I started

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:50,530
doing it I want it to be scalable and

00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,299
cheap so it's a react app so it's just a

00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,150
single page application chart on the CDN

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:58,709
it has a back-end the back end is on

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:01,900
service and the reason I did that was

00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:04,120
really cheap so it cost me nothing and

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,280
it scales really nicely so when I first

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,890
built it there were like two users

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,050
it cost me nothing it now has hundreds

00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,610
of weekly users not crazy but it cost me

00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,470
nothing if we Scout it up to like

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,079
millions of weekly users it would cost

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,669
me about like two pound a month to host

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,480
which is great because you know hey I

00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:21,070
don't know if it's gonna be successful

00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,620
so what we're going to talk about isn't

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,630
just something that you can do to make

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,080
widget you can also make useful

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:32,490
production-ready stuff that has actual

00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:36,280
users and real people which is cool

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,900
aha okay so when I was talking about

00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,430
when I think about doing this talk I was

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,360
like I'll give a brief history of web

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:46,630
hosting I'm I'm like 28 so I was born in

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,580
1990 I started writing code like pretty

00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:50,980
far down here so I don't really know

00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,210
much about web hosting so anyone thinks

00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,560
any of this is wrong which it might be

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,280
feel free to correct me

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,479
so instead born 1990 and like you put

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,190
stuff on servers right you had dedicated

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,210
private servers I had to talk to some

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,160
friends of mine who have been developers

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:04,630
for much longer but how this worked but

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,250
used to like rent an actual physical

00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,840
server in someone else's space and

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,360
you'll be able to what you could walk to

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,229
a box in a warehouse and be like this is

00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,940
my server cool fine whatever interesting

00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:18,820
fact who's ever built a website on

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:22,000
Geocities yeah I've got my first website

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,580
yes it is 1993 Geocities was released

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,620
which is pretty cool

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,820
some time passed 2006 comes around

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,870
people are talking about cloud computing

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:34,660
quite lot they do best launches in 2006

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,130
GCP launched two years later as he

00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,930
launched god knows how many years off

00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,380
that whatever but we entered the range

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,000
of cloud computing so very exciting but

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,669
basically I could no longer walk into a

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,900
room and go that's my server but I could

00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:48,250
probably vaguely point at a large

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,030
building and say my server somewhere in

00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:54,820
that we moved to virtual servers then

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:57,789
2015 8 OS lambda launched hands up who's

00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,919
used lambda hands up who's used in

00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:02,080
production awesome

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,240
so lambdas a service like a way to

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,220
execute code server lessly we'll talk

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,830
about what that means in a second

00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:11,560
spoiler no I went spoiler so lambda

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,820
launched in 2015 and we got to this like

00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,349
no server world where you have

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,000
serverless computers functions as a

00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:18,669
service and everyone's jumped on that

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,710
most cloud providers give you something

00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:23,970
that will do that

00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:26,930
ah Tom what is herbalist so so this is

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,280
exactly this so it's great - so better

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,770
[Music]

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,570
so yeah

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:38,130
burgers are not vegetarian you need

00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:40,110
service isn't server less who you so

00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:43,590
your service function is actually

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:46,590
running somewhere much for you on car

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,050
provider somewhere it can be invoked in

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:52,530
a number of ways like HTTP request its

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,600
TT to people's to many T's I or like a

00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,120
cron job or you can just put a click and

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,980
go run my several assumption beads and

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,470
Italy excuse me codes or one zip codes

00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,990
not actually running anywhere we're

00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:06,000
going to packaged up is a container and

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,580
it will create a container for running

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,530
and when it's finished I'll get rid of

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:16,800
the container after all most beautiful

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:19,830
anywhere in any region in a certain area

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,410
no yeah so anyone's not really doing

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,210
that work you kind of skip that and go

00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:26,250
to no opposite when your service

00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:30,630
function or larger and I scary for you

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:33,420
it's really nice so whatever ask you

00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:36,330
mentioned it's so cheap okarin how much

00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,550
it costs but I just AWS your first

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:42,030
million calls a month for free you next

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:45,450
million calls cost 20 P so reject 20

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:48,540
pieces most people copy of Ranger

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,640
yeah it's true yeah so it's really easy

00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,290
for a it's really like real one like a

00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,730
night they walk up on that internet area

00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,610
and it's the point your service function

00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,020
to a region somewhere they're also

00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,700
really very extended so I'm going to

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,490
leave your trigger something set up runs

00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:04,200
your container in the car if someone

00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,480
said so it could go to that I'm saying

00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:10,330
that if that containers resource usages

00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:13,000
two files no no no

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,919
and just keep running application today

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,340
because of charging for cheaper who

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:19,870
really care it's not your money is it

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,590
that's what very passionate so each

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,740
one's running on a separate sandbox

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,120
container

00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,150
who really knows it couldn't be some

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,159
boxes probably not and they're also

00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:33,750
really easy about did you kind of you

00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:35,950
don't have to think about kind of like

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,990
sharing states across multiple things

00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:39,459
with you can't think about that I

00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:40,719
removes a whole bunch of challenging

00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:42,120
things and makes it really easy to work

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,130
with

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,410
some people are so so this isn't break

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,800
for these reasons so the first one is

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:54,579
the overhead of the HTTP request yet but

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,320
everyone's webserver husband so who

00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:58,810
cares right next one

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,430
cold starts well yes if you need your

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,100
application to respond to users

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:05,950
immediately like as in real time stuff

00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,230
then you probably shouldn't be using

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,800
servers or solving problems or anything

00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:13,450
we've Network agency about frankly if

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,490
you do need it start quickly there's

00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,380
loads of choices you can make like not

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,540
using those in question your service

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,579
options a language more suited like

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:25,470
going what rust or anything else like

00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:28,630
forgot to mention and also people are

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,250
fighting tubes amber I'm locked into AWS

00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:35,130
and they put their prices up and my

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:37,450
business will be screwed hold 20 people

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,800
no there's no the platforms that solve

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,540
that problem like we've been clicking a

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,360
button I could deploy service function

00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:47,470
into a bunch of cars on a bus talk about

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,089
nation also sometimes the opponent could

00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,860
be tricky I always do some stuff with

00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,329
metal fiery snake but whole build

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,459
process and laser

00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:57,989
fancy stuff I couldn't do require and it

00:09:54,459 --> 00:10:00,299
was everything inside but it's not yeah

00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:03,939
absolutely fine

00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:06,489
also time off all of these pom-poms have

00:10:03,939 --> 00:10:07,929
like and match your best box with like

00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:09,959
in your little web so you can make up

00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:12,879
time up as long as you missed it and

00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,459
lambda you can make your your function

00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,619
times after 15 minutes and then five

00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:19,239
times after 10 seconds make your users

00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:20,619
waiting for that long something's

00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:25,660
happening definitely screwed up

00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:27,759
something else yeah loads of platforms

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:31,239
so soon once I really want to know care

00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:33,119
like Oracle's FN I'm sure that one's

00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:35,920
great

00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:37,619
they bought a startup called FN and

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:43,209
they've recorded their service thing

00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:44,290
like it is they are sauce if you want to

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,999
use it and then they said oh you just

00:10:44,290 --> 00:11:03,879
need to spin up a server running it and

00:10:45,999 --> 00:11:05,139
I was like ok no more I think yes I

00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:08,019
 we did the first set of

00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:10,149
assumptions anywhere we can with one of

00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:12,549
the couple to do those the servlet

00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:14,769
framework it's a token sauce thing you

00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:16,779
basically have a config file service

00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:19,540
where you want to run or which like

00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:21,249
region's providers whatever and then

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,449
they've got kind of a shared abstraction

00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:24,449
for which language you want to use

00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,879
yeah so that's pretty great I also have

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,709
a really local developer experience so

00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:37,809
you just run so I saw that's no easy why

00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,850
did you use it once let's hop on it or

00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:42,459
something like email forms for my web

00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:45,160
page no one said meaning that long but

00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:46,509
it's still a mosque on the anything can

00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:52,179
you imagine if I physically hosted

00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:53,679
pepper yeah yeah yeah also its yep so

00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:57,279
Kelis awesome great and easy there for

00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:59,019
burn so another place on actually deploy

00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,950
something so we did promise with the

00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,769
poisoning

00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:05,980
three minutes to be honest the biggest

00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:08,410
latency here to me using his computer I

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:19,899
pop over to a great little service

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:22,240
called math I don't work Oh get I've

00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:26,769
been since the I clicked nice icon gets

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:31,360
I get back to authorize I'm looking just

00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:33,910
like some github like then I think I

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,610
wants to play like kick it

00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:38,110
oh it's understand my package like

00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,279
Jason's some stuff and they're once

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,769
around these two months I'm gonna

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,769
publish this like actuary so I click the

00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:48,750
place lights and then I'll wait I like

00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:48,750
live a minute that's in silence waiting

00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:54,850
progress if you can choose which

00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:56,079
branches you want deploy neckla file

00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:58,389
also does a really cool thing where it

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,430
deploys if you make poor requests to

00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:03,040
your master or staging branch it will

00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,810
give you a link to go and look at the

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,970
pull request so I can then see a version

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:08,560
of the site spun up so if you want

00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,570
actually do testing or someone send you

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,560
a PR to code of you and you're like what

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,630
the hell does this look like you can

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,800
actually go and see it which is awesome

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,800
I wish I had that where I worked

00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:22,139
[Music]

00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:33,820
has anyone used magnifier anyone does

00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:37,149
anyone use it in production like with a

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,470
with the business that's pretty sick oh

00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,890
no I do know that actually because I've

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,300
seen it yeah it's really cool I've been

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:44,829
ridiculously impressed with it there are

00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,899
some other options so there's a company

00:13:44,829 --> 00:13:49,660
called desire that make they make next

00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:52,029
and next I think and right now is their

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:55,589
platform for this and it's that's what's

00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:55,589
the same thing firebase is very similar

00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:59,430
make some noise you see cuts appear

00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:02,490
everywhere

00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:11,400
and we are hired bigger come on we

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:13,050
should all come on there are any

00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,090
investors out there that want to sell

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:22,740
this as a product in touch with them

00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:23,760
yeah so yeah let the points really

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,530
bright

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,890
it took we might so you just have a

00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:31,440
project let get any put shitty makes a

00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:34,110
repo deployed any branches you check out

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,240
for just preview for you you can do any

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,790
testing you can put functions on that

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,210
which is just another name for some

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,590
yeah

00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,660
so the reason we spoke about service is

00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:44,820
because you can notify you can deploy a

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:48,270
service back-end in a function it can

00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,700
use JavaScript or go I think just cool

00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:52,800
lambda can use fight you more but

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,030
whatever yeah and you don't really need

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,590
to worry about configuration you just

00:14:54,030 --> 00:15:00,410
pick your buttons on there on the

00:14:55,590 --> 00:15:04,260
graphical user interface does it yeah so

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,790
why is there so many bridges sad if you

00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,740
want your users to be able to see us

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,110
like really quickly the functions are

00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:12,330
ten times more expensive than number so

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,340
if you actually start getting users for

00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,020
your back English though probably knew

00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,780
then us with a cheaper more

00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,100
cost-effective platform and then you

00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:21,900
don't get to worry about the

00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:27,750
configuration or any kind of dude its

00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:29,720
new Bebo a stripper the functions be

00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,710
more expensive an interesting one so

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,360
we've hosted bunches of things on

00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:35,010
notifying we don't pay anything they

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,230
don't want credit card details you need

00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,730
to start paying if you've got like

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:40,260
concurrent builds which if your deploy

00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,240
is taking 55 seconds and something any

00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,360
difference or if you have like team

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,730
members so for most of us it's a free

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,860
service which i think is pretty cool

00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:51,060
down I have a question for you what's

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,370
the weirdest thing people go in

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:56,550
JavaScript come on people I'm not the

00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,690
only one that does their Sam I don't

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:03,660
make me feel like I'm the only one that

00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:06,230
does this nobody oh my god you must have

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,230
built something weird

00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:14,610
well then do I have the challenge for

00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,500
you people of L know I challenge all of

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,699
you to go and build something weird play

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,550
with the Web API you haven't used before

00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:22,500
so the noisy kisi thing uses the

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:25,560
microphone I'd never used the microphone

00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:37,350
in the browser before don't know why but

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:39,329
there are loads of but go have a look

00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,100
through find some like Web API is that

00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:43,050
are weird and you've never used it's a

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,579
really great way to understand and like

00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:45,600
like Jordan was saying earlier the best

00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:47,699
way to try and understand something is

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,040
just go and mess around a net so go have

00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:52,259
a look and find some weird stuff in the

00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,899
Web API that you can use build it host

00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:58,470
or neckla flies send us links so you can

00:16:54,899 --> 00:17:01,170
tweet l nog with a tell nog org and half

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:03,389
Saigon hug you can tweet us I would love

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,579
I haven't asked Adam if this is okay I

00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:06,750
would love next week to show off some

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,750
weird apps that you have built like

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:11,370
we're all slightly weird intelligent

00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,230
people so let's let's make something

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:16,169
strange let's have fun with it

00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,150
javascript is fun let's do it does

00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:21,990
anyone actually gonna do it please say

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:23,010
yeah you will yes whirring here but come

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,270
