hello everybody for those of you don't

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:08,400
know me I'm Simon I like to do a little

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:11,490
hot tip which is pretty cool this is

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,469
actually not new to me this is actually

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,670
based on one of the first things that I

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:19,470
ever shipped at the Financial Times but

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,439
I forgot about it because everyone

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,260
always forgets about the console object

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,930
which is awesome

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:32,009
so I want to talk about two things which

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,350
is contoured up group and console top

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,460
table which is something you may already

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:45,270
know about them so I wrote a little

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:47,640
thing here that gets tweets on the

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:51,210
Twitter homepage and just returned it's

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,360
like a little objective stuff so I'm

00:00:51,210 --> 00:01:02,160
just gonna grab this and paste this into

00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:06,570
the Twitter homepage so I have I have

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:12,479
this tweet also in this probably a super

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:15,060
small tweets it's an array of all the

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,009
tweets that have loaded so I'm gonna do

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,009
is I'm gonna use console table table

00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:31,110
able to log out this really nice table

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,210
and it shows the screen name whether it

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,970
was a retweet or not who retweeted it if

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:42,060
it was do I follow them do they follow

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:45,869
me and the link to the tweet so that's

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,659
quite nice but you might think why would

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,970
you use it and I'll come to that in a

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,840
second the other thing that I wanted to

00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,930
show you is groups console or group so

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:04,259
if I just go back here another thing

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:06,540
I've got here is some code that gets the

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,440
tweets it filters food sweets it finds

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,240
are the ones from people who follow me

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,720
it's not very many

00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:20,820
it's cause console a group collapsed

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,440
with a string it's going to generate

00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:28,400
another table and then it's gonna win

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,400
that group so if we paste this in here

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:39,690
it comes up with this expandable group

00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:44,130
and I can open this up and have a

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:47,550
smaller table of these people which is

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:52,830
pretty cool so I said I would come on to

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:54,480
why this might be useful and I'm going

00:02:52,830 --> 00:03:01,010
to show you the thing that I shipped

00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:07,310
which still exists in the FT and

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:12,750
hopefully ok so it's an F T homepage and

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:14,160
we have this debugging thing called FX

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,250
dot d Beck I they used to work in the

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:21,180
advertising team and it's really hard to

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:23,610
debug when adverts didn't work so I

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,450
wrote this thing and what it does is it

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:32,150
creates these groups with tables inside

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:35,370
these are different advertising people

00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:38,310
Christ I'm sorry so anyone who still

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:41,640
works in advertising but you can have

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,450
nested groups here so this is the

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,500
attributes on me as a user

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:50,550
this is an open source is not a secret

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,460
that way so yeah this is a really nice

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:57,920
way of being able to do a nice UI for

00:03:53,460 --> 00:04:00,330
debugging sprinkle there's my hot tip

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,000
console of table and console table group

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,230
collapsed there are a couple of other

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,470
console things I might do in the future

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:10,390
and no one lookup console and Indians

00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:13,620
cool thank you very much

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,620
