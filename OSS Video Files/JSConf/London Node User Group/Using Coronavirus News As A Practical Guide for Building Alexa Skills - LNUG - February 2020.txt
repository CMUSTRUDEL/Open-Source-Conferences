Title: Using Coronavirus News As A Practical Guide for Building Alexa Skills - LNUG - February 2020
Publication date: 2020-03-13
Playlist: London Node User Group
Description: 
	Lightning talk - a practical guide for building an Alexa Skill. Coronavirus News.
Speaker: Artsiom Mezin

There is a lot of noise about the Coronavirus for a few latest weeks.
I've created a simple Alexa Skill which provides users with the latest update about the figures. Here it is https://www.amazon.co.uk/Artsiom-Mezin-Coronavirus-News/dp/B084M81B6Q

However, it feels like there are tons of stuff that could be improved.
I'd like to talk about the following things:

1. How to design and implement an Alexa app for less than one weekend?
2. What to expect from validation and rolling out processes?
3. Where to get and how to store the data?
4. How to automate the routine?
5. How this sort of app can help people?
6. What else could be done?
7. **I am eager to collaborate!**

Given the fact that I'm doing this in a little rush, it feels more like **a lightning talk**.

About me: I am a Senior Frontend Engineer at Behavox. I have almost 10 years of experience in JavaScript development behind my back.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
okay hello yeah I don't use a microphone

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,189
so I presume you can hear me

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:13,290
my name is Artyom Mason yeah it's me

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:17,100
more or less yeah I'm a guy who roughly

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:18,600
a year ago bought an Alexa dot and said

00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,939
to my wife like how we going to have it

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,010
just because it can be programmed by

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,890
JavaScript and time a JavaScript

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:31,349
developer I can do it yeah a year passed

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:34,920
and she asked like and what we have the

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:38,670
thin end what's next I said okay nothing

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,239
happened really but roughly how much

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,730
like two weeks probably yeah things have

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,000
changed you probably should recognize

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,559
this picture does anybody understand

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,030
what is this about

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:58,440
yeah for sure see I mean it's the reach

00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:03,890
of the bars like wow regional yeah

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:06,119
exactly so so many rumors like things

00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,659
information around the old media

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:12,210
channels about coronavirus and occasion

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,890
I found myself I constantly updating the

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,930
Guardian and looking for numbers

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,259
features like how many people are

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:22,950
getting ill and sort of like okay well

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:26,630
why why do you do this man like what the

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:33,770
point is can you automate the routine

00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:38,159
okay again apparently yes I I could

00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:41,909
first of all this is the dashboard

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,780
created by John Hopkins University the

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,880
guys they did a great job it's

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:52,110
constantly going down because of the

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,670
load because it became popular and I was

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,290
curious about the data for sure not

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,590
about the representation but about the

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,259
data and from my perspective if you look

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,090
at the data itself it's not so bad it's

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,640
definitely better than when you're

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,610
looking at the Guardian or BBC or

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,950
whatever media you prefer and if you can

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,720
get the pure data probably your life

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,600
will be easy

00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:18,440
I don't know at least my mic can be a

00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,150
believe yeah as I said I have an Alexa

00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,090
dot and decided to just create a simple

00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:26,870
up simple Alexa skill which I can ask

00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:28,330
Alexa tell me the virus news yeah and

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,550
get this data

00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:34,400
i-i'll try later to do a small demo you

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,260
will see let it be a dialogue if you

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,030
don't mind because I'm not really

00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:44,000
prepared does anybody want me to go

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,130
deeper into the Alexa skills topology

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:53,510
how does it work like what is this about

00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:59,510
I I don't trust you anybody not from the

00:02:53,510 --> 00:03:02,780
organizers team okay yeah they did

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,450
actually it looks like the web like the

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,280
Internet which we deserve it has a

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,130
front-end and back-end and front-end

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,650
it's like your voice you can simply ask

00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:14,810
Alexa like Alexa the keyword and then

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,840
something Sampson yeah

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,959
Oh magic is happening on the Amazon site

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,470
and your back-end which is a normal web

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:28,330
back-end it can be apparently server

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:32,330
less function it can be a simple server

00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:36,830
gets just a JSON file just Jason input

00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:39,950
nice more and the Alex in my case the

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:46,100
Alexa voice service expects from you to

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:49,340
get the Jason back it's deadly simple so

00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:53,390
you Jason King should contain the text

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:57,080
like plain text what Alexa dot supposed

00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:59,180
to pronounce yeah don't really want to

00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:02,030
explain how to do the hello world

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,790
because there are so many articles

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,850
around the web describe and if you

00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:10,160
google l NOK Alexa

00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,650
something you're gonna find a brilliant

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,680
talk which been delivered for last year

00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,810
right just brilliant talk which covers

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,930
all the things I'm trying to tell about

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:22,760
like snacks I don't know pitfalls

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,740
gorgeous or something yeah you have a

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,990
link if you if you're interested in how

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,750
to

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,870
you have a little oops yeah but how to

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:35,940
design these epitaph as I said you need

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:39,449
to communicate with Alex skill skill kit

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:45,120
by sending and getting getting and

00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:47,340
sending Jason's the most like fastest

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,380
things that you can do it's a several

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,610
less function for sure and the scene is

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,860
that you can do everything in your

00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:55,169
browser yeah like you go to Amazon you

00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,389
type like I want to do an Alexa skill

00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,580
they say yes okay sure

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:01,830
let the skill that the editor you can

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,099
edit the code there just don't do this

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:07,889
just don't trust them for sure you can

00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:10,979
do it in browser but you will suffer a

00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:12,870
lot yeah try to do everything in a

00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:18,210
proper way like a programmer like try to

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:21,060
understand how these things happen in in

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,159
the AWS how to upload several its

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,180
functions they just don't use the web

00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:27,690
interfaces

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,630
it's a nightmare yeah and my idea was

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:34,830
okay I theoretically I can get data

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:38,460
somewhere yeah and I can download this

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:41,250
data like pull this data in a hourly

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:46,849
basement and uploads to the dynamic to

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:51,060
be table yeah and each time when my user

00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:53,070
if I gonna have any users ask Alexa to

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:58,080
do something my the second function of

00:05:53,070 --> 00:06:01,650
mine gonna get JSON input and I go to

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,150
the dynamodb table and returns the

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,810
features about the Parana virus and

00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,190
basically that's it that was the idea I

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:10,530
believe it was the right idea because it

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,960
took me about six hours to implement all

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:15,590
the stuff I'm not going to share the

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,289
code if you don't mind today

00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:22,110
yeah but the data the first go is where

00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:27,539
to get the data nowadays github it's a

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:31,460
powerful powerful network network for

00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:33,870
getting any kind of insights data rotate

00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:36,960
pylon of libraries for shoe for shoes a

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,849
code but data itself and these guys from

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,659
the John Hopkins University

00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:45,150
created a community around around the

00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:48,089
scene like they combined all the data

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:51,900
all together they frequently updated

00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:55,199
this data and it started like two weeks

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:58,499
ago from the simple it's not longer case

00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:02,189
yeah we start from the simple Google

00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:05,819
spreadsheet which also a possible thing

00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:07,650
yeah but then under the some pressure

00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,680
from the communities they switched to

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:14,460
github repository and start providers

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,969
with a non-normal data but normal

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:21,599
problem of the case first pitfall that I

00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:25,020
get in a wall got in was the format like

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,699
luke guys it's a wh old World Health

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,889
Organization quite serious in my

00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:36,809
understanding organization and look at

00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:38,520
the formats a day the day provide it's a

00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:41,959
province states yeah

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:45,089
don't you see that it's something wrong

00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:47,849
we really lived for I don't know for

00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:53,279
maybe a couple of days with with this

00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:55,919
format well be Jean and confirmed it's

00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:59,990
pretty much the same thing but yeah it

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:05,399
is what it is again github github mate

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:08,459
sings perfect like people just convinced

00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:11,999
owners it what is wrong how to change

00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:15,270
the format people make a lot make lots

00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:17,129
of pull requests like suggestions Python

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,990
tools and so on song look it's it's

00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:21,749
amazing like to be a part of this

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:25,439
community itself it's a team it's it's

00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:28,020
an amazing scene yeah the next go she is

00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,629
about storing the data like Amazon DB

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:34,139
again ardent DynamoDB again it's a well

00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:36,539
powerful well known solution lots of

00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,370
information about it but the first and

00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:40,500
probably the most important things that

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,889
you should know about this is that you

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:47,610
should think in advance it's very very

00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:49,769
important to think how you're going to

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,200
store the data what is use FEMA will be

00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:53,970
before you start doing something

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,540
for example it's not possible simple

00:08:53,970 --> 00:09:01,139
just simply just sort all the entries in

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:03,870
your table so you should you should sort

00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,579
by primary key I mean you should think

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,110
about it in advance when you when you

00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:09,870
design in Sam so my first idea was okay

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:13,380
my primary key is a timestamp I got I

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,949
get all the data into the row and I'm

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,100
good

00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:18,810
I'm not well I am good because I can

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,630
study and retrieve all the data and

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:24,510
source it in my runtime because it's not

00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,269
a big amount of data but it doesn't look

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:32,160
like a proper way of doing things

00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:34,980
yeah so put some efforts on dynamic GB

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,639
stuff well if you gonna do something

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:41,519
like this the next girl she is about

00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:45,360
routine I already said it like you are

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:48,990
able to create several ways lambda

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,420
function just in the web interface just

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:54,000
don't do this

00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:59,579
AWS provides you with a powerful really

00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,949
powerful CLI instruments that can help

00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:04,230
you with everything from deploying to

00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:08,610
testing like you can run your functions

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:10,620
you can deploy your function you can

00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:15,300
package your function functions like all

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:20,279
this stuff and as as far as this tools

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:22,649
our CLI tools you can do it on CI on the

00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:25,560
high side easily if you invest just

00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:28,500
little bit efforts in the beginning on

00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:32,550
this part you will not regret just trust

00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:35,370
me it even even given the fact that it

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:38,370
seems easy just to type some JavaScript

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:41,130
in web interface and forget about yes

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:44,279
rah there are a couple of CLI tools

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:46,310
provides us which we chez WS provides us

00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:46,310
with

00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:52,929
I like Sam personally first of all

00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:57,049
because it's it has cool yeah

00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:59,629
logo but secondly because it allows you

00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:01,759
to run your functions in the same

00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:04,339
environment in the same container that

00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:09,709
is going to be used in the production

00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:14,660
site it's it's good yeah then how it

00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:17,209
works and just a little bit of demo you

00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,699
created a project the project looks like

00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,829
this basically what you need to do you

00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:24,319
need to define what the invocation name

00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:26,809
of your Alexa skill is the next go chase

00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:29,449
think about it trice like think about

00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:32,809
dynamic DB schema twice and about decent

00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:36,049
price because you will not you will not

00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:37,989
be able to change it like you need to

00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:40,160
redeploy the entire application

00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:44,360
application to change the vacationing

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,809
then yeah it's quite important okay and

00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:50,619
you define like what your users going to

00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:54,199
say to get the information and you good

00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:58,100
then you just look in your code for this

00:11:54,199 --> 00:12:04,879
intent and respond properly responds

00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:07,369
properly the funny thing is that alex is

00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:14,239
quite sensitive for accents particularly

00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:16,160
for my accent I'm not sure that if I say

00:12:14,239 --> 00:12:18,110
something like Alex a virus news is

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:31,579
going to respond me something but I can

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:34,389
type it eighty thousand four hundred

00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:38,559
fifteen confirmed cases exactly

00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:38,559
27900 five yeah

00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:49,550
thank you yes basically you you've got

00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:52,520
probably the point like I retrieve the

00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:56,570
data I organize the data in the latest

00:12:52,520 --> 00:13:02,390
numbers across the world and returns as

00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:06,760
adjacent in a proper format it more like

00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:11,120
proof of concept like also I want to

00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:13,520
share the advice like the pieces of

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,710
advice like recommendations from World

00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,720
Health Organization what to do how to

00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,330
protect yourself risk do you know what

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,090
is the most popular advice from them

00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:30,590
what we watching here did you wash your

00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:34,130
hands before eating pizza yes I did yeah

00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:37,010
apparently apparently it is and this is

00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:39,250
the next pitfall the next gotcha like I

00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:41,090
decided okay I'm gonna share

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,640
recommendations it's a World Health

00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:46,700
Organization recommendations and not so

00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,350
easy it's not so easy because Amazon

00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,170
doesn't like the idea to share any

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:54,890
health-related recommendations it took

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:59,000
two days for review process and

00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:01,280
eventually I was like kicked off they

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,520
didn't like the idea to share any kind

00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,950
of recommendations with no disclaimer

00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,210
then now I have to add a disclaimer to

00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,390
my description that it's just

00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:13,430
recommendation and pass it over to them

00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:17,090
again yeah

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:20,570
the next beautiful thing twice read read

00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:25,940
this boldly policy testing before before

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:29,780
you do it before doing Alexa skills it's

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:32,540
going to save you some time why it's so

00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:36,070
important like why the verification

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:38,690
process is so important because you can

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:41,450
have only two versions of your legs

00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:43,940
skills at the moment like the production

00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:47,000
Alexa skill and the election skill in in

00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:51,310
development if I send this Alexa this

00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,230
version to review yeah this I I just

00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:58,150
have to wait until the result

00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:03,070
I cannot do it constantly well another

00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:06,590
let's insight that I got from this story

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:15,020
yeah yeah we can if you don't mind let

00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:18,760
let me try like if I'd been tested in

00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:18,760
development it should work I believe

00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:45,280
Alexa asked virus use what can I do

00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:55,390
avoid

00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:57,520
eyes nose and mouth exactly it works but

00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,710
it works only in development

00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:05,500
I still cannot pass the review process

00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:05,920
but I will will do yeah why I'm doing

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,310
this

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,220
like I really think it can help some

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:14,830
people at least it can help to set up

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:18,430
routine maybe for kids but again don't

00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:20,290
mention kids on your legs that's a skill

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:23,410
description if you mention it you have

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:26,650
to mark mark your skill as a kit

00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:31,060
oriented and go to the really long like

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:33,220
say red corridor for reviewing but it

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,620
should help like I have in mind like a

00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,180
couple of ideas what to do I will speak

00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,910
about it a little bit later what but one

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:42,820
of these ideas is okay I'm asking alike

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:45,820
so what to do she responded me like wash

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:49,240
your hands and then she asked like do

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:52,980
you want me to set up a reminder and

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:55,810
yeah it technically it's possible but I

00:16:52,980 --> 00:17:00,760
you need time to implement it and I

00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:03,640
think it might be useful too for Foulke

00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:08,940
it probably and yeah as I said if you

00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:13,030
read the news you probably got something

00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:15,700
but no features but no numbers and here

00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:19,450
you can get just numbers especially if

00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:22,030
we can implement something on analytics

00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:24,820
eyes like how bad is it like is it going

00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:29,230
better is it going worse I believe it

00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:30,940
can help yeah what what could be done

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,770
it's actually this talk it's more about

00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:36,840
promotion rather than about teaching

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:40,750
someone like if you speak Italian and

00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:43,840
really want to do the thing like speak

00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:48,520
to me we add to tellen language because

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,110
Alexa poor Alexis skills supports number

00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:53,440
of languages here and you need to

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:55,930
implement just one skill and do some

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,570
internalization stuff it's also fun from

00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:01,300
technical perspective but probably would

00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:06,730
be would be interested

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:09,040
in in like in the card situation yeah we

00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,770
can add more info like it's not only

00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:17,830
about getting features it's about wash

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:20,080
your hands is about not to squeeze any

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,960
kind of information can be useful I

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,060
believe well why not data analysis if

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,120
you just really obsessed about the

00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:31,510
numbers and you can get from this table

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:34,330
we is wonderful formatting information

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:39,010
is it going better or is it going worse

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:43,390
for particular region why not let's add

00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:46,030
it to to the task to the skill features

00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:49,810
everybody loves inventing features like

00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:54,220
this is the most like adorable thing in

00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:58,150
our job I believe so if you if you have

00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:01,020
some you want to share I don't mind to

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:04,180
speak to yours educational functions

00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,300
recently I spent a week in my home

00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:10,240
country in Belarus and unfortunately

00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:13,260
over there there is a scene like people

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,200
basically people basically a scary about

00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:19,960
Asians people it's it's horrible they

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,960
just they really don't want to go into

00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:27,220
the same bus with a guy of Asian

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,200
national it's like it's what and this

00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,420
another point why I'm doing it like I do

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,100
believe that if you share the

00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:37,480
information about it

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:40,180
it can help ya

00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,950
and take their plates about me like I

00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,560
talked a lot about automation but

00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:45,970
unfortunately I didn't do it like it's

00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,740
not done still it's not done

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,260
I can deploy for example one of my

00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:55,360
function and another is deployed

00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:57,580
manually yeah it still need to do about

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,920
pitfalls I told you during the talk but

00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:03,460
probably I missed something replication

00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:06,610
can be tough Yeti stuff through one

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:09,160
version in a time think twice before

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:12,130
sent the skill to the verification and

00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,500
the last but not least this statefulness

00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,190
if you're going to deliver a dialogue

00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:19,420
with

00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:20,680
Alexa it's thin like itself it's not so

00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,240
easy because you don't have like a

00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,610
proper browser with cookies and

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,410
something you need to play a little bit

00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:31,120
with this JSON that you get from the

00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:33,540
Amazon but it's still possible yeah the

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,540
end is near

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,910
