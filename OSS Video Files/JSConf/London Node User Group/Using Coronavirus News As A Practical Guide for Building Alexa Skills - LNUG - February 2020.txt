Publication date: 2020-03-13
Playlist: London Node User Group
Description: 
	Lightning talk - a practical guide for building an Alexa Skill. Coronavirus News.
Speaker: Artsiom Mezin

There is a lot of noise about the Coronavirus for a few latest weeks.
I've created a simple Alexa Skill which provides users with the latest update about the figures. Here it is https://www.amazon.co.uk/Artsiom-Mezin-Coronavirus-News/dp/B084M81B6Q

However, it feels like there are tons of stuff that could be improved.
I'd like to talk about the following things:

1. How to design and implement an Alexa app for less than one weekend?
2. What to expect from validation and rolling out processes?
3. Where to get and how to store the data?
4. How to automate the routine?
5. How this sort of app can help people?
6. What else could be done?
7. **I am eager to collaborate!**

Given the fact that I'm doing this in a little rush, it feels more like **a lightning talk**.

About me: I am a Senior Frontend Engineer at Behavox. I have almost 10 years of experience in JavaScript development behind my back.
