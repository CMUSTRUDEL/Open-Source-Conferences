	End-to-end testing Single Page Apps and APIs with Cucumber.js & Puppeteer
Paul Jensen

Developing web applications as separate front end and back end parts is a common practice, but brings with it the challenge of how to test those parts together in an end-to-end fashion.

In this talk, I will show you a strategy for being able to test your web application with Cucumber.js and Puppeteer, a library for running Google Chrome in headless mode. We'll also explore how to handle things like seeding the database for the API before running tests, how to select elements in the DOM via Cucumber step definitions, and how to do this in a nice fashion using Node 8's async/await feature.
