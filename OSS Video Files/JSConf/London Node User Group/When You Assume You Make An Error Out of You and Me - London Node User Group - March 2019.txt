Title: When You Assume You Make An Error Out of You and Me - London Node User Group - March 2019
Publication date: 2019-03-29
Playlist: London Node User Group
Description: 
	Presented by Gabrielle von Koss

Our choices in wording are frequently more powerful than we realise, and we risk using this power liberally and erroneously. Letâ€™s take a look at our ideas about how we communicate in our code and in our speech, and what effects those ideas have.

My name is Gabrielle von Koss, and I work as a developer at the Financial Times. You can find my retweeting activity on @gvonkoss.

it gives me a good opportunity to

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:09,920
illustrate what I'm here to talk to you

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:12,000
about so I think that we can agree that

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,480
everything I say from here on out will

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,850
also apply to myself I'm going to make a

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,529
small caveat that asterisk up there will

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,449
appear whenever there's going to be a

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,600
gift on the following slide as a trigger

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,539
warning for flashing visuals all right

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:31,080
so I'm Gabby I work at the Financial

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,669
Times we are the world's leading news

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,550
organization and business and economic

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:38,190
affairs I have been very lucky to work

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,809
in a company that values its culture

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,910
very strongly because it means that the

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,739
people that work there care about the

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,420
people that work there which makes it a

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,309
very good environment to learn and

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:52,230
develop in both personally and

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:55,440
professionally I work specifically in a

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,710
team called origami we are the FTS

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,620
component library and our main purpose

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,739
is to make other people's work easier

00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,810
our users are developers with various

00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,490
different backgrounds that work for

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,530
various different ft products and those

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,810
ft products have various different users

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:16,140
so our responsibility is to make sure

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,670
that our components are clear in both

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,150
their functionality and the

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,970
documentation one of the ways in which

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,580
we do this is by maintaining a public

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,500
registry that has information on all of

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,700
the components that we own and develop

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:38,490
and it provides demos to assist others

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:42,240
in the documentation so at the beginning

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,750
of last year we rewrote and redesigned

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,540
the registry and when we launched it we

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:50,850
decided to get a cake yeah a celebration

00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,710
and everybody loves cake so we thought

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:58,020
it would be a good thing to be like to

00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:00,780
come use our new product so I think I'd

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,290
used that opportunity to ask for

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,680
feedback about our new product and I

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:10,050
wrote on the cake box for cake slice

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,920
please to leave nice feedback on post-it

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,920
note I thought I was being charming

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:19,220
see there it is I did it and we did get

00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:27,260
feedback and the feedback was on the

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:31,880
cake so it's pretty amusing people get

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:33,650
creative when it's on demands but it

00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,000
really didn't give me what I had asked

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:41,170
for because I assumed that people knew

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,340
what I was talking about and in reality

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:45,110
we have been working on the registry for

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,030
quite a while so my team knew why there

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:49,010
was cake everybody else so very

00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:54,530
delicious chocolatey and most

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:56,360
importantly free cake which is that but

00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,400
this brings me to something that I'm

00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,570
going to say a few times throughout this

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,860
talk and it's something that I'd like to

00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:06,140
highlight it's very easy to forget that

00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:10,940
others don't know what we know and that

00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:13,310
we don't know what others know at one

00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,710
point or another I believe we all make

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,320
assumptions that we believe to be an

00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:21,800
offensive and because of what we don't

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:25,400
know those assumptions can be harmful to

00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,170
our interactions so I'm going to talk

00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,560
about a few aspects of our industry

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:36,040
where we likely assume starting with

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:43,040
error messages yay yummy anyways sorry

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:44,510
so I skipped ahead I went to I guess

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,330
that nobody really wants to see error

00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:51,530
messages but they can be very useful so

00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:54,590
secretly we may be grateful for them

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,390
when they make sense some when they do

00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,430
make sense they have the ability to help

00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:01,490
us learn from the mistakes that we make

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,220
and potentially improve our code when

00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:07,580
they don't make sense

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:10,670
one of possibly two things can happen so

00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,980
first we've seen the error or it's tight

00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,350
before and we can have a guess at what

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,500
went wrong we can assimilate from our

00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:20,960
past and the odds are that this is going

00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:24,160
to sink a potentially unnecessary amount

00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,780
of time into debugging that error

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,400
because we didn't have the information

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,470
to get straight to the point

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:34,720
Oprah is a lot darker and that screen

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:37,720
than she's online or we don't understand

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,070
the error and the wording in the message

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:48,190
makes us feel bad about something that

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:51,040
we've done yes like so so I think we can

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,050
feel like we simply don't know how the

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,850
language works or we possibly feel

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:56,710
embarrassed that we don't understand the

00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,690
error or what we've done wrong and

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:02,880
neither one of those things do very much

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:07,780
for our belief and our own capability

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,580
and related to that I asked are you to

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,990
let me share this tweet because it

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,060
really struck me when I first read it

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,640
so there's tool builders we're

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,800
gatekeepers every time we print an

00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,910
incomprehensible error message someone

00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,660
decides they're not good enough at

00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:24,700
coding and I've been working this

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,740
industry for a few years but I can just

00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,810
relate to this pretty strongly because I

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,060
frequently come across error messages

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,120
that really make me feel like I have no

00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:36,070
idea what I'm doing

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,450
then they they also make my faith and

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,450
what I think I understand pretty wobbly

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,230
so what I want to focus on today is

00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,200
point number two when the error messages

00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:49,930
make us feel bad I want to highlight

00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,280
some of the problems that exist with the

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:55,030
ways in which error messages are

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,820
communicated and picked a few examples

00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,260
to illustrate my point but this will

00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,470
apply to other error messages that

00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:06,070
you've seen out in the wild so let's

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:10,450
begin type error undefined is not a

00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:14,380
function a big problem that we have here

00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:16,150
is ambiguity to one extent or another

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,580
all of the error messages that I'm going

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,700
to show you are ambiguous they're not

00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,620
specific about what's gone wrong and the

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,700
wording implies that the reader knows

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,210
where to start

00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:30,730
if they see this error and this might be

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:33,640
true for some which is fine but it's

00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,730
also entirely possible that other people

00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,460
don't know where to begin

00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,800
and here the message is being ambiguous

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,840
by not telling us what undefined is

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,780
referencing now I'll make a small caveat

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,800
a lot of browsers have implemented

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,300
referencing systems but it doesn't

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,160
detract from the point that this still

00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:57,270
happens with other errors uncaught error

00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,700
object object so good if anybody knows

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:03,150
how to build this please tell me I need

00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,130
to know how to fix this problem big

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:09,570
issue that we have here is the

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:12,000
synchronous in most cases unhelpful

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:15,000
error messages are short they may be

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,770
shortened to the point for some but it's

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
also entirely possible that the point is

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:22,890
missed by others and I don't mean we

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,780
need to write a very long novel with all

00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,030
of the gory details about the era but a

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,760
sentence or two could help us get to the

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,430
point and whatever the error is in this

00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,670
case it's been shrunk down to two

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:38,970
generally unhelpful words and my

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:42,150
favorite unexpected token comma expect

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:46,380
if comma it doesn't even look like a

00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:50,490
real sentence so a big problem that we

00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:54,390
have here is obfuscation and this is

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,950
similar ambiguity the specifics of what

00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,320
has gone wrong have been hidden away

00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:01,050
somewhere and useful information is

00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:04,080
being withheld which is going to

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:07,470
complicate things from the beginning in

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,500
this example logically a comma is a

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:14,400
comma so I have no idea what's actually

00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:17,660
gone wrong and I have no information to

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,660
know where to begin to figure that out

00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,730
so I want to reiterate what I'm saying

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:27,930
by creating an imaginary scenario for

00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:31,200
you picture yourself at the entrance of

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:33,660
a hedge maze in daylight there are no

00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,419
threats in this maze and your objective

00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,849
is to get to the heart of it whenever

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:42,030
you get lost a mystical Boulder with

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:44,820
with instructions will materialize so

00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,680
you step into the maze after a few right

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,830
turns

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,910
a few wrong turns you have lost your

00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,100
sense of direction

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,140
and all of a sudden you see that

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,570
mystical Boulder and on close inspection

00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:04,010
it has a single sentence edged into it

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:06,170
and it says turn north and this is how I

00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:11,020
feel when I'm trying to understand a

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:13,970
message that I just can't identify with

00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:15,410
so next time we provide we write an

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:20,570
error message let's try to keep the

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:23,320
following in mind clarity to counter and

00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,880
be cute sorry context to contour beauty

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,140
how we provided a connection between the

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:33,200
problem and what's causing it

00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:35,120
elaboration to countess's sickness have

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,700
we been sufficiently the boast about our

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:43,670
error have we provided relevant details

00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:47,270
about the problem and clarity overall is

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,680
on message clear have resurfaced all the

00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,070
things that are important about this

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:54,980
error and I've a I've raised these

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:57,740
points to aid us in moving away from

00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,920
general assumptions that can be made

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,560
about our readers understanding and this

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:08,180
will allow us to make our wording as

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:10,700
inclusive as possible so these points

00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,860
not only applies to our error messages

00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:17,660
but they apply to our documentation as

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:22,910
well which brings me to the readme very

00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:24,950
often the readme is the single point of

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:26,779
reference that our users have about a

00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,770
project it is where all of our

00:10:26,779 --> 00:10:33,410
documentation can possibly live and it's

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,360
important that we are aware of the

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:38,060
information that we convey and how we

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,500
convey it and I bragged a little bit

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,940
about how cool it is to work with my

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,870
company in the beginning but it's so

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,700
that I can say that we make mistakes to

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:49,300
this

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:55,240
is a public repository that belongs to

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:57,250
the FT and this is all that's in it and

00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:03,580
I want everyone to focus on on this part

00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:05,790
of it most importantly I have many

00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,790
questions

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:13,740
what is this library

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:18,130
what's wrong with installing it globally

00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:23,590
what package manager I meant to use what

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:26,580
is MPT v what is this acronym and most

00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,580
importantly who is this for

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:32,710
first off this readme assumes that

00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:38,170
everybody knows where this library

00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:39,700
should be used so there's no context it

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,640
gives you a warning about installation

00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:46,900
instructions about installation but no

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:50,050
installation instructions and ultimately

00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:52,030
there's no explicit explanation for what

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:55,930
this active library actually does so

00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:58,930
there's no clarity the fact is this

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,760
project assumes that you work at the FT

00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,380
that you're familiar with our workflow

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,500
and that you know how everything fits

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:06,940
together and this may be true for some

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,350
especially maybe if you work on that

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,910
project but if you've just joined the

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:13,630
company regardless of your level of

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:15,340
experience you may not know but

00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,170
fortunately we can raise these things

00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:21,820
in-house and we've changed this readme

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:24,670
to look a little bit more like this so

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,860
we've specified we specified what this

00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:28,630
project is used for and we've provided

00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:33,640
further information for anyone that

00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:35,260
might need it or want it not only were

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,500
our installation instructions vague

00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:41,350
there were two years out of date you

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,970
know great so we've elaborated and

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:47,530
provided an explicit installation

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,820
command and we've emitted abbreviations

00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:51,220
and provided a little bit more

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,320
information so overall we've been more

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:57,310
explicit about the functionality of the

00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,840
project and we've been more clear we've

00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,700
facilitated other people's

00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,100
use of it and I know there's a lot more

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,110
that can go into readme and should

00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:07,150
probably go into remove me it doesn't

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:10,180
fit into one slide and that would

00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:14,200
probably be another 25 minutes so moving

00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:15,550
swiftly on even though we don't have

00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,740
time to go through all those things

00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:22,750
right now remembering to supply context

00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:25,480
elaborate where relevant and provide

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:30,730
clarity will help us improve the way in

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:32,650
which we write yet writing isn't the

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:35,380
only way in which we communicate in this

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:39,790
industry we talk a lot too right that's

00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:41,170
why you're all here so in addition to

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:45,570
what we've covered so far

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:49,300
the next equally as important point is

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:51,430
who is your audience and I can't really

00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:54,790
stress this enough I can knock the mic

00:13:51,430 --> 00:14:00,220
over though who are we speaking to and

00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:04,060
who are we writing for everyone in this

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:07,630
audience has a different spectrum of

00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:10,150
experience and understanding so when we

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,820
talk to someone from our version of the

00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:15,130
spectrum we talk to the filters of our

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,780
own experience it's important to

00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:21,010
remember that they are our own

00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:23,230
experiences and conversely the person we

00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,060
are talking to has a spectrum all of

00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:29,050
their own which is made up of their

00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:32,470
experiences so if we want to have a good

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:35,170
exchange we need to find common ground

00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:38,980
together instead of assuming there is

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:41,050
common ground and we probably don't

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,130
intend it badly when we assume that

00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,220
someone will know what we're talking

00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:47,290
about and hey maybe they do but it's

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,380
better to make ourselves clear from the

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,960
very beginning and there are a few

00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:58,270
things that we can do to improve our

00:14:52,960 --> 00:15:00,520
communication first we can start by

00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:03,460
acknowledging that we do make these

00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:06,010
mistakes that we do assume this means

00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,860
that we can begin to notice the things

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:12,330
that we

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:14,580
can approve second when we're talking

00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:17,850
about something we should work to

00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:22,020
elaborate without judgment it takes some

00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:23,820
practice for sure but it's important to

00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,560
learn to provide more information rather

00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,670
than to assume that the person that

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,850
you're talking to knows what you're

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:31,110
talking about I found myself in a few

00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,160
situations occasionally where I'm

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,480
talking about something and I'm

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,010
completely confident that it makes

00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,270
perfect sense and then I look at the

00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:41,580
person I'm talking to and they look like

00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:43,200
this and I know that I've had this face

00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,730
on quite a few times and it's probably

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,410
because I didn't get that elaboration

00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,030
it's probably because I didn't get them

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,890
to context I didn't understand the

00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:55,670
jogger could have been any number of

00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:58,740
things but just elaborating isn't enough

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:02,790
we need to pay attention to how we say

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:05,250
what we say we understand the world

00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:08,820
through the words we read further words

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:11,120
we hear and through the words we use so

00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,100
we should consider that very carefully

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,260
in this case it doesn't matter who

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,720
you're talking to but the words you

00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:22,830
choose to speak with are really far from

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,680
inconsequential which brings me to a few

00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:30,900
examples of language that we could learn

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:33,690
to avoid commentary like you would be

00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:38,520
crazy to think you would be blind not to

00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:40,530
notice this is a blissed it's a breast--

00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,940
and its alienating if you do think in a

00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,910
particular way or if you didn't notice

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:48,450
something why don't know what you have a

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:54,570
disability and it's degrading language

00:16:48,450 --> 00:17:00,620
so please leave this out words and

00:16:54,570 --> 00:17:07,200
phrasing like all you need to do just

00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:09,180
obviously clearly simply they trivialize

00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,810
what may not be obvious or clear to

00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,510
someone else

00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:18,260
and in reality of their filler words so

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:22,500
we can leave these out too and finally

00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:27,470
everyone knows any developer worth their

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:30,030
salt there are examples of crude

00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:32,220
generalizations that can be exclusionary

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:35,670
and we've already covered that we don't

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,440
know what others know so settings

00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,770
arbitrary and benchmarks about

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:44,580
somebody's understanding a worth is

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:49,740
pretty harmful so make sure we leave

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:53,090
these out as well give your interactions

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:56,190
your full attention that's a big dog

00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:59,610
with that we can start picking up on the

00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,570
things that we say we may use some of

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,470
the language that I've just talked about

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,940
unconsciously I know that I do but the

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,600
beauty in interacting with somebody else

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,130
is that it's a two-way channel so we can

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,980
make it known that we welcome the

00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,850
opportunity to learn from our mistakes

00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,940
with the people that we make those

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:19,980
mistakes with we can ask questions about

00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,330
the content of our conversations and we

00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,760
can provide our listeners with the

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,520
chance to correct us where we may have

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,230
gone wrong and may not have noticed and

00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,870
when we do ask those questions and we

00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:34,920
provide those opportunities there's

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:36,510
benefit in it for us as well we can take

00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,220
that chance to learn about what our

00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,870
assumptions we're in that scenario

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,190
and we can begin to correct ourselves

00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:46,920
when we notice that our language has

00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:48,870
slipped with these points and Minds we

00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,000
can go into your conversations with more

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,700
awareness we can make them more

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,080
productive more effective and more

00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:01,740
inclusive and I'd like to stress that

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,500
this is a learning process it takes

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,650
practice and we will probably make

00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,820
mistakes throughout that process but it

00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:13,350
doesn't cost us anything

00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:19,830
to try and we lose nothing by making the

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:22,530
effort so if we practice acknowledging

00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:26,370
your assumptions elaborating without

00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:29,160
judgment asking questions and paying

00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,720
attention to the words we use will be

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,920
benefiting from richer and more

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,140
constructive

00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:41,010
is going forward I'm pouring a lot of

00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:43,110
information energy into talking about

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:47,100
assumptions and how they may be negative

00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:49,320
things in rural but to a large extent

00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:54,120
assumptions are also simplifications

00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,950
that make our life possible so if we

00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,860
imagine for example that we're walking

00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:01,020
along the street your pedestrian okay

00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,280
you're assuming that the driver isn't

00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,420
going to drive up in front of you the

00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,270
drivers are assuming you're not going to

00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:07,920
jump out in front of them if you had to

00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,180
stop and ask every driver to make sure

00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,380
that that was the case nobody would ever

00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:16,560
get anywhere and it would be equally

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,600
unrealistic to try and have an answer

00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,300
for every possible situation we find

00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,090
ourselves assuming it which really begs

00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:28,800
the question once you start where do you

00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:32,670
stop and the correct answer is that

00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:35,580
there is no correct answer ultimately we

00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:37,110
don't have the brain power all the time

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,340
to come up with a solution for every

00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:41,100
scenario we might find ourselves

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,870
assuming in but we can lay the

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,190
foundations for the word choices that

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,010
we're making our arrows in our

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:49,080
documentation and in our speech which

00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:52,770
can help us cover a lot of ground where

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,500
we can't cover every eventuality which

00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:57,780
for the last time brings me back to we

00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:02,370
don't know what others know and others

00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:06,090
don't know what we know so in all types

00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:10,980
of communication let us strive to

00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:14,220
provide context to elaborate freely to

00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:17,850
convey clarity to be aware of the words

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,460
that we communicate with and to ask so

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:24,240
that we can apply what we learn to

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,680
ourselves with that will be setting

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,320
ourselves up for better interactions

00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,860
going forward and we'll be at a huge

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,860
advantage

00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:38,500
finally I'd like to leave you with a

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:42,549
quote from American novelist Iligan

00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:45,140
words transform both speaker and hearer

00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:47,200
they feed energy back and forth and

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:50,510
amplify it

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,169
they feed understanding or emotion back

00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:56,240
and forth

00:21:51,169 --> 00:21:59,120
an amplifier remember the goal is not to

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,940
make an ass out of anyone so thank you

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:08,380
for listening to me

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:08,380
