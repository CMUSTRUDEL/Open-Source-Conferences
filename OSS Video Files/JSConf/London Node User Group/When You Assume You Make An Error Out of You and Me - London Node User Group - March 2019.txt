	Presented by Gabrielle von Koss

Our choices in wording are frequently more powerful than we realise, and we risk using this power liberally and erroneously. Letâ€™s take a look at our ideas about how we communicate in our code and in our speech, and what effects those ideas have.

My name is Gabrielle von Koss, and I work as a developer at the Financial Times. You can find my retweeting activity on @gvonkoss.

About Pusher Sessions:

We're bringing the meetup to you. With Sessions, you can watch recordings of top-notch talks from developer meetups -- wherever and whenever you want.

Meetups are a great way to learn from our peers and to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. As developers ourselves, we at Pusher wanted to bring this great content to more people... So we built Sessions. On Sessions, you can watch talks that interest you and subscribe to be notified when new content gets added.

If you run a meetup and want to get involved, kindly get in touch.
