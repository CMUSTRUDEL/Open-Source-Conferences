Title: Testing Apps with Third Party Integrations - London Node User Group - March 2019
Publication date: 2019-03-30
Playlist: London Node User Group
Description: 
	Presented by Mike Solomon

In this talk we will examine strategies and best practices to develop and test node apps that make heavy use of third-party API integrations. As reliance on third-party services becomes more and more prevalent in the node ecosystem, developers need cost-effective, secure, reliable and fast ways to mock these services for both dev/staging environments and testing.

We will start with looking at nock, and open-source mocking solution for local development, and move onto unmock which provides mocks-as-a-service of popular APIs.

The session will have live coding for both nock and unmock using express to create a simple microservice and jest for testing. It will also present several popular design patterns for isolating and testing third-party integrations as well as strategies for integration testing apps that rely on third-party APIs, including corner-case and error testing.
