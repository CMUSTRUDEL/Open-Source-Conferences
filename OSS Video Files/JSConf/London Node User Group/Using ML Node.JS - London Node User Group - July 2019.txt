	Using ML Node.JS
Maximilian Berkman

An overview of ML in JS and what I was able to do with it.
How and why would use Machine Learning in NodeJS.
Iâ€™ll go over some general concepts in ML and then dive into how I leveraged limdu and created a multi-label classifier (called ac-learn) and how you can do the same. All while seeing how fun and amazing it can be.
The talk would be focused on giving you the pointers and tools to solve problems where ML is usually the best solution as well as how you can hit the ground running.
