Title: Large Scale Refactoring with Codemods - London Node User Group - November 2018
Publication date: 2018-12-03
Playlist: London Node User Group
Description: 
	Presented by Edd Yerburgh

Refactoring is part of the process of maintaining an application, but large scale refactoring that are more complicated than a find and replace are time consuming.

Codemods are a tool to refactor code by manipulating the abstract syntax tree (AST). In this talk I'll teach you what ASTs are, why we use ASTs in tools like Babel and eslint, and how to write a codemod that manipulates an AST.
