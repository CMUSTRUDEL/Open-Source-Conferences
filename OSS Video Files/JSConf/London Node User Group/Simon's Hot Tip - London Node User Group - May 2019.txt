	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,540
so I've got kind of a couple of small

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:08,160
small little tips one you absolutely

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,980
shouldn't do but one you can so that's

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,740
fine let's start with the one that you

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,230
absolutely shouldn't do so there's a

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,900
little bit of code here let me just zoom

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,640
in a little bit okay it's like it's an

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,810
empty HTML document and then it has a

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,630
script tag in there that creates a

00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:30,570
heading element it signs at NID signs it

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,980
some text and appends it to the body if

00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:37,910
any of that you don't understand please

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:40,320
do come to me in the break and so you

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:44,489
refresh this page maybe it's just too

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,440
quick because that's cool okay so that's

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,079
refresh in that and all it does is it

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,489
runs this JavaScript and and puts that

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:57,329
heading on something I learnt from one

00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:01,530
of my colleagues was that if you give an

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:05,360
element an ID it makes it a global

00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,729
variable which is pretty cool so you can

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,200
console.log l nog nog is the ID that

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:15,170
i've given it and it locks it out here

00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,840
so you should definitely never use this

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:21,320
but that's cool huh I gather this is

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,680
something that I implemented and then

00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:29,759
other people just did it to like keep up

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,920
I guess because I use cutting edge the

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,229
next thing is something that you can

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,600
actually use and I've decided to use

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,420
this do this in node so that Adam is

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:46,020
happy because I keep coming on with like

00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:49,350
front-end stuff so imagine this is like

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,509
the entry point of your application you

00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,700
may do something like this you have a

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:58,140
function and initialize and then you

00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,210
call that function what the more common

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,829
approach I think tends to be is to have

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,340
something called an immediately invoked

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:08,310
function which is where you wrap this in

00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:13,040
parentheses oh sorry let me just show

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:14,750
you that that works so it

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,989
runs it and it any console logs out

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:22,069
initialize clear so let me go back so

00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:25,269
you can wrap your function in

00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:28,219
parenthesis and then call it there and

00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:30,290
let's add another exclamation mark so we

00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:35,209
know it's the new one and if you run

00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:37,069
this so what goes so it goes through and

00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:38,239
you declare this function and you

00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,739
immediately call it it's called an

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,900
immediately invoked function expression

00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:46,569
so that's kind of cool

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,709
but something I learned recently is that

00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:53,030
you don't actually need these brackets

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:54,680
here I mean you kind of do but instead

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,120
of using those brackets which is weird

00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,609
because you get too many brackets and we

00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:05,060
don't write closure right is that you

00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:08,060
can do void up here and I put in a third

00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,909
did I put in a third thing no put in a

00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,430
third one just so you know it works so

00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:16,760
if that's exactly the same thing there's

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:18,379
actually no difference apparently but I

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,959
think feel like it looks nicer is your

00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:22,699
like air entry point of your file so

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,409
that's the thing that I learnt just may

00:03:22,699 --> 00:03:29,320
be useful maybe not it's no reason you

00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:33,300
can't use it yeah thank you

00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,300
