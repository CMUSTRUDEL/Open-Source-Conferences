QEWD-JSdb is a new concept for databases in Node.js. Although it's implemented on top of two incredibly fast, industrial-strength (though little-known) physical database technologies (the Open Source YottaDB and the proprietary IRIS databases), QEWD-JSdb abstracts their underlying hierarchical physical storage as on-disk JavaScript objects, blurring the boundary between what's in-memory and what's on-disk.

Rob Tweed (@rtweed) is a Director of M/Gateway Developments Ltd, and has been part of the LNUG scene since its earliest days - he was one of the speakers at its inaugural meeting, and has given a number of talks over the years, mainly focused on his Node.js-based QEWD technology/platform.

Rob has several decades of experience, developing and advising on real-world complex, business-critical applications around the world, in sectors such as healthcare IT, financial services and retail systems. He's specialised in database integration for Web and Internet technologies since the early days in the mid-90s, and has been immersed in Node.js since its earliest days in 2011!

A keen proponent of Open Source software, you can find all his work (including QEWD-JSdb) at @robtweed
