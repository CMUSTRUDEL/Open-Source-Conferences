	00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:06,629
so I'm gonna talk about a sorting text

00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:09,990
alphabetically you might be able to

00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:15,269
guess so I've got some names here

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:18,289
Monica Shawn Shawn miles and if we run

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:20,939
this way when we have this

00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:23,490
alphabetically function that were

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:28,289
passing to sorts which is a method on an

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:30,869
array takes each like pair and then

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,050
depending on the return value it sorts

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:38,219
them but you'll you'll see that if you

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:44,030
didn't know so running that we get

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:49,100
Monica miles Shawn Shawn which is cool

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:52,469
so that's good but this has some

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:56,910
limitations where if we introduce some

00:00:52,469 --> 00:01:03,989
new names with some little like accents

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:09,869
right using this same function will uh

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:11,460
uh will output this where we get Monica

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,880
miles Monica

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,430
Shawn Shawn Shawn and then Etienne is at

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,799
the end when it's him really should

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,600
probably be at the beginning right

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,979
because and this is based on how it

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,890
sorts like ASCII characters I believe I

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,570
might be wrong there someone will

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:37,470
correct me so I found out about this

00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:42,020
locale compare now this is a method on a

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:45,840
string and it compares both of them and

00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:48,149
we'll take the locale and then compare

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:54,420
the compare the characters based on

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:59,159
those so if we play that it sorts an e

00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:02,280
with a accent before an M in a sort of

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,070
this makes a bit more sense right and

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,700
there are some options you can pass to

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:12,209
local base and it will sort capital

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,180
letters before or after lowercase

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,519
letters think

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,230
oh but this is really handy and it sort

00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,480
of looks a bit nicer as well that

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:24,250
function alphabetically function looks a

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:29,170
bit nicer I think now there are some

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:30,579
limitations sort of where and I sort of

00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:33,459
just found this out actually as I was

00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:35,670
writing this about half an hour ago this

00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:39,189
is from the MDM box

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:42,939
so in German and a with an umlaut sorts

00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:45,700
before Z and in Swedish hey with an

00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:48,430
outsource after Z so we should expect a

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:52,690
positive a negative and a positive value

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:56,319
but in node they're both negative which

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:58,090
is a bit annoying and I this is

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:03,790
apparently something to do with node not

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:08,769
using a locale which is mental sure but

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:10,420
in a browser it works as MDM Docs well I

00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:12,250
say in a browser I've tested it in

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:19,389
Chrome and Firefox I don't know what ie

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:22,000
does so be a little bit aware that there

00:03:19,389 --> 00:03:24,250
are some limitations but yes that's my

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,169
that's my little hot tip is locale

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,169
compare yes

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,470
