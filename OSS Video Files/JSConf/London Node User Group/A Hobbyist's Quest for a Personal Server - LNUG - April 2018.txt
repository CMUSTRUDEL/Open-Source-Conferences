	A Hobbyistâ€™s Quest for a Personal Server
Salman FF

How easy is it for a non-techie lay-person to set up a personal server and have their own apps running on it?

There's been much talk recently about how large companies host our data, control it, and sell ads against it. But what if we all had our own servers with our own applications running on them holding our data which we control?

Is that doable today, using existing cloud services and node.js? What does it take? How easy is it?

For the past few years, I've been running my personal node.js-based server on AWS, Google Cloud, Openshift and Heroku, using mlabs and Mongo, as well as Dropbox!

So I'll talk about what it takes for a non-techie (or at least a newbie) to set up a node.js server using each of those environments - the pluses and minuses of each ... and why doing this would be a good thing in general.

About me: I am clean tech entrepreneur (@zemenergy.com) and VC executive (@top-funds.com). I code for fun. See http://freezr.info twitter:salmanff github:salmanff

a little bit more of a querque talk than

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:07,020
you're probably used to because I'm a

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,760
hobbyist and I'm not professional and I

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,340
was gonna say if you're gonna go down my

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,549
github I thought that we'd have this

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,560
talk before Pizza so that'd be okay but

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,990
after pizza I might get a little bit

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,789
sick because of the the spaghetti code

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,199
that I have in all of that and you know

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:23,820
I use Excel so I think we all have these

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,320
little tools and I use this exhales I

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,170
always use Excel to keep lists of

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,449
various things these are a bunch of

00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:33,809
bunch of web services that provide nodes

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,940
and hosting node and the one thing that

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:41,129
I always found frustrating but Excel is

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,629
that it didn't have track changes and I

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,760
think I've lost my key out there so

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,890
whenever I would change something here

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,350
because this does not exist this our IP

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:53,969
version of introversion doesn't exist

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,559
I want to track changes on Excel so I

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,070
went and built this little app that I

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:02,129
actually you know that I like which I

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:05,760
called mystery which basically has the

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:09,060
same thing and I have my little table

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,590
here and I can change things and put all

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:16,470
right key here and save it and basically

00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:19,710
my little excel sheet has the history of

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,960
the changes so I can keep track of them

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,799
and I think this is the coolest thing

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,509
you guys probably don't but the point

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,280
here is that I'm showing this because

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,049
whether you're one of you guys like a

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,150
dev who can whip up an app like this in

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,090
like half an hour or you're a newbie

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,460
that wants to and that you know takes

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:43,530
three months to build some sort of very

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:46,200
easy front-end web app we should all

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,439
have kind of a space where we can

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,570
actually have our our apps running on a

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,189
server so let me just get this

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,590
presentation going and that's what I'm

00:01:53,189 --> 00:02:00,840
gonna talk about there we go

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:04,290
so that's my example of my history which

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,619
I call kind of a poor person CRM but the

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,509
idea is that you know it would be what I

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,470
would like is to have a personal server

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:16,740
that hosts a bunch of front-end web apps

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,580
I have my data and my files sitting on

00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:24,510
my server right and I want this personal

00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:28,710
server to be easy to install where I can

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:31,200
have em where I can easily build apps

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,210
and install apps and run your apps and

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,450
my apps and these are not complex apps

00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:38,130
with you know really complex back-end

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,200
processes I'm just thinking about

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,480
there's a bunch of apps which just need

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,220
access to a file system and a database I

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,700
want to be able to install these really

00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,950
easily and I don't want to be locked in

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:52,650
and that's important because if I have

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,360
my personal server and I have my data

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,920
and my files you know I wonder if I'm

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,270
running it on Amazon on me I want to

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,100
move it to Google or to Heroku or

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,740
whatever and that portability becomes

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,260
important and the example is that a year

00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,720
ago I signed up for this you know to

00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,320
create a node server on on AWS and I had

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,530
this one year a free and free time

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,690
basically gotten sort of yeah a lot of a

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,250
lot of free server time and the new

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,780
Orion and I started getting billed and

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,790
literally it took me like five minutes

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,640
to take my little freezer server which I

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,860
call it and move it over to Google now

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,269
from your perspective you're like well

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,890
yeah it's easy you've just been on go

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,420
and change the DNS text records and

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,840
stuff like that and you're done and this

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:35,489
is sort of I have my own sort of URL

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,860
Salman FF com

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,110
so from your perspective that's easy but

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,180
if you think about it from a kind of a

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,090
more of a newbie consumer perspective

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,980
where people have their own apps that's

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,989
like the total opposite of kind of the

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,280
model that's on the web today right I'm

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:51,360
all on the web today you're kind of

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,310
there you have nothing you're no

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,720
portability the services are the web

00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,420
services are out there and they have

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,500
your data locked up and a lot of people

00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,090
are talking about this because of

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,440
Facebook and I'm not saying these

00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,850
services are bad you know these are

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,100
wonderful services but I'm just saying

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,709
it'd be nice if we had our own servers

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,600
where we had our own data and we had our

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,370
own apps and we could actually sort of

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,519
move things wherever we wanted and we

00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:18,630
had full control over our apps our data

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,370
or files so how do we get there

00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,479
obviously you actually have a person was

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,660
already gonna have to build it on node

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,740
right because notice so cool and because

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,820
most importantly because it's

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,100
multi-platform

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,150
so you can run it on multiple different

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,490
service providers you can have just

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,040
local hosted and you can have it on and

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,660
on your own sort of server at home or in

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,370
the office so that's that's really for

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,560
me the great advantage of notice sort of

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,900
the multi-platform and so you can

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,340
basically host it anywhere you need a

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,140
database I work mostly with MongoDB

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,190
again partly because it's open source

00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,630
and you can have it in different places

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,570
but really you do want to kind of have

00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:54,570
it be you'd want your server to be

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:55,740
database agnostic effectively because

00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,570
you don't want necessarily to have

00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,130
complex or you want to sacrifice the

00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,340
complexity of the data rates operations

00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,990
for and the portability and that's

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,510
that's key and then you want a file

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,600
system and you know whether it's s 3 or

00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,710
Dropbox or what-have-you and Dropbox is

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,910
an interesting one especially for

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,250
newbies you guys probably have never

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:18,600
used Dropbox it's kind of a files file

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:20,280
system on your back-end and again from a

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,690
newbies perspective even if you have all

00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,490
of these and the idea is that you know

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,830
is it possible for a newbie to have all

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,010
of these set up really easily even if

00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:30,150
you have all of these you still need

00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,770
something which I call middleware which

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:33,960
I started build with just called you

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,810
know freezer which is basically kind of

00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,250
a middleware for allowing you to just

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,920
build your front-end app and just say

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:44,400
for example you know upload file or

00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:46,110
write to DB and then everything is taken

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,520
care of whether you're running on s3 or

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,530
on Dropbox or whether you're running on

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,810
 or another database you want that

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,490
to be abstracted right you don't want to

00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,690
deal with that complexity I mean you

00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,030
guys want to deal with that complexity

00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,490
but I'm talking about kind of newbies or

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,880
hobby is sort of having their own their

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:05,100
own servers so also my criteria for

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,170
choosing the best back-end is probably a

00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,630
little bit different from the way you

00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:11,970
guys would look at it to some extent or

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:15,030
you guys being developers within a

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:18,480
server corporate context but perhaps not

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:21,990
as obvious so you know looking for a

00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:24,720
friendly UI you know no CLI is you know

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,950
sort of all click click click you don't

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,410
want lock in and talked about that

00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,550
that's really important and you want to

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,250
fit here sort of you're thinking about

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:35,520
consumers and sort of hobbyists

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,740
effectively and what happens at a lot of

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,300
these as you guys know a lot of these

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,380
services are really geared towards

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,630
preferred

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,130
like you and not necessarily for

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,720
hobbyists so they had a lot of

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,610
complexity and they're looking for you

00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,080
to give you a free tier and then charge

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,150
it 200 bucks a month which is nothing

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:54,240
for a company but for a person it tends

00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:56,340
to be a lot and so these services are

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,780
geared to that audience and not for a

00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,100
personal server yeah so you have to kind

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,570
of hack your way around it effectively

00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,450
but it to get a personal server that's

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,280
easy to install and what I like to say

00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,680
is like you know my in the ideal world

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,780
the the server should be as easy to

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,370
install as you signing up for github or

00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:16,590
for Dropbox right that's kind of the

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:18,210
goal and the ideal so you want some

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,000
features like HTTPS if you're putting

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,650
your own sort of your own you know

00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,240
important data on there what have you

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:26,790
and you want custom domain so like you

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,190
know - Salman ffs not com so when I

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:32,130
switch switch servers that domain

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,840
remains there and and and my the URLs

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,780
that I may have are still the same URLs

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,090
effectively so I kind of went through a

00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:46,920
bunch of the different services that

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:49,770
offer node etc - - to everyone and

00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,690
especially if the way and try to judge

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,080
them by the that criteria the criteria

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:57,570
of this is for somebody who wants this

00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:00,930
to run as easily as setting up setting

00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:02,910
up github or or Dropbox so the most

00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,840
interesting for me is openshift which is

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,030
run by Red Hat's

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,650
which is really within six clicks you

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,990
can have a note server run you like you

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,940
sign up you click you know sort of the

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:15,150
starter you open console you name your

00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:17,700
project you create project you browse

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,380
the catalog openshift sort of combines

00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,770
nodejs and mongodb so you have that

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,810
option you click on it and you sort of

00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,760
point it to a github repository of your

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,930
account server you express etc or your

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,099
freezer as I call my little server and

00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,810
you go to next and create and you have

00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,130
your note server and that I find is

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:38,250
amazing because it's almost like a

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,419
consumer experience you have to do

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,979
another few clicks like if you want

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,479
things like HTTPS and things like that

00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,760
but really with things you know like six

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,420
to nine clicks and two text boxes you

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,550
have a node server running one of the

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,430
problems I find with OpenShift is that

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,230
it's actually sort of it works in theory

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,730
but I think

00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,760
like a lot of these services are really

00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:01,180
geared towards not the personal server

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,410
but really towards the professional

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,360
person who wants to have a server so a

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,150
lot of times actually this the

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,560
nodes combination runs into resource

00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,480
constraints and they're trying to sort

00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,980
of push back and prioritize other

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,780
constraints we have to kind of redeploy

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,400
I could get into some some technical

00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,080
issues around redeploying the server to

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,120
get it running but I'm showing this to

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,980
you this because the interface is so and

00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,880
I don't know how many people have used

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,920
OpenShift here no the interface is very

00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,730
very consumer friendly and if actually

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,160
you and one of the interesting things

00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,540
about it is that so for you know a lot

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,400
of these things are running off darker

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,140
right now you reboot darker and you lose

00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,090
effectively your environment if you just

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,710
have a server running there and you need

00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:44,690
a way to actually have persistent that

00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,070
environment variables effectively if

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,660
you're doing it this way where you're

00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:50,390
sort of pointing to a public repository

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,740
to grab the server code in fact until

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,270
like six months ago when they weren't on

00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,490
docker they provided this amazing

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:58,610
experience where literally within the

00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,680
same sort of workflow within two minutes

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:03,170
you had your server running with a file

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,490
system and a database and with these

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,710
persistent valuable so you could do

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,930
whatever you wanted with it and for me

00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:11,360
that was like that was amazing and then

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,500
they phased out of it one of the darker

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,750
because it was much cooler and much

00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:17,450
better oriented towards their corporate

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,950
customers but for the new reason and for

00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,320
the hobbyist there's there's other

00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:26,060
alternatives and Heroku is a great one

00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:30,350
as well you basically you know have a

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:32,240
few clicks you create the app you give a

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,650
name to the app and what Heroku doesn't

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,760
give you a few options but one of the

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:37,490
things that it does is that it allows

00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:42,980
you to actually use draw box in order to

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:45,980
get get your server files deployed onto

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,410
their servers and so here basically you

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:52,700
have you know Heroku on your Dropbox on

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:54,360
your on your on your on your Mac or PC

00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,529
and on

00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:02,399
and in the cloud it creates this sort of

00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:03,839
like Heroku folder and puts the name of

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,959
your application and then you can put

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,519
whatever note files you want in there or

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,430
JavaScript files you want in there for

00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,350
it to rock to deploy the server and you

00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:15,749
just basically press deploy and you're

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,059
done and though again in this case the

00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:19,170
server and shuts down every once in a

00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:22,740
while because they're limiting free

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:24,629
resources effectively and and so you

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,160
kind of like you need to sort of copy

00:11:24,629 --> 00:11:27,480
the environment variables in there

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,439
effectively so that you can actually

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,850
have a persistent persistent environment

00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:34,019
where you're not sort of resetting

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,249
everything and every time the thing

00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,430
restarts which is basically you know

00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:39,870
every every two hours or so but it's

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,579
still you have a server and like in like

00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,680
you know nine clicks or what-have-you

00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:45,629
which I find amazing but it's only a

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,220
server there's no database and the

00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:52,199
easiest database setup that I've seen

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:56,029
 setup that I've seen is M lab

00:11:52,199 --> 00:12:00,149
which again is incredibly user-friendly

00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:01,860
and again six clicks and a name and you

00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:03,600
know you choose Amazon again it's a

00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,490
sandbox environments or not talking

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,600
about huge robustness though even like

00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:10,100
I've had a couple of hundred megabyte

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,779
but megabytes running on my on my server

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,480
on em labs and haven't had any problems

00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,429
and you know in the past year or so so

00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,749
it is pretty robust so they obviously

00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:20,309
they would like you to go beyond the

00:12:18,749 --> 00:12:24,059
beyond the free tier which is which is

00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:25,920
fine and you just press Continue you you

00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:28,980
give it a name and you submit order and

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:33,029
you have and you have a database running

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,339
you define your user and and a password

00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:39,870
and basically you get a URI to

00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:41,819
which you can then as easily as that you

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:44,069
have a URI which you then you can put in

00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:46,319
your whatever server software in order

00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:48,480
to be able to access that that database

00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:51,059
so you have a sort of Heroku and you

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,259
have your database and what you need is

00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:57,779
is a filesystem and actually Dropbox is

00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:59,249
quite amazing because if you go to the

00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,050
Dropbox of developers you're actually

00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:02,639
again you know four clicks and you

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:04,110
generate an access token again that

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,569
access token is something that you can

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,460
put in your your server software

00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:11,750
effective

00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:15,880
to get your environment running so again

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:19,160
all of this is for me the easiest way to

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:23,029
to get to running a full server file

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:25,820
system and database without having a CLI

00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:30,830
and without having a complex process to

00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:32,330
get things running thank there's an

00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:34,880
easier way actually to get a file system

00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:36,470
and I'll get to that but you know sort

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,080
of going back to my list tree so you

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:41,209
know I mean again I don't know I'm sure

00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:46,339
you guys use you know Google Cloud or

00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:49,190
Atlas or AWS here a lot right yes I

00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:50,630
imagine and you know I mean a double

00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,089
this is great and so is Google Cloud

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:56,060
again I think the criteria that I've

00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:58,610
kind of used to judge these is to say

00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,670
well how can we get to a personal server

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:03,800
that you can run up within a few clicks

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:05,570
and have apps running with Anik a few

00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,580
clicks so basically I mean in my

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,260
experience again MongoDB Atlas which is

00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,120
which is great and robust really as

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,860
geared towards is really pushing you

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,339
towards sort of the corporate user and

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:22,850
not the hobbyist as as this presentation

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:24,770
is you know looking for effectively an

00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,810
database we talked about this as a new

00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:30,290
being and sort of there are newbies out

00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,820
there I find the AWS elastic beanstalk

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,050
to be incredibly user-friendly as well

00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,339
because you have a user interface it's

00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:38,120
kind of upload the code and it deploys

00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:41,060
it for you and again with it within a UI

00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,529
which is web-based and is not complex

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,510
again that's sort of the criteria for

00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:50,839
getting this running so you have your

00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:54,320
personal server so sort of back to this

00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:56,450
anyway the idea is you know having a

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,779
bunch of apps running on our server our

00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:02,300
own servers with a database where you

00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:04,190
can keep our data and a file system work

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:08,570
and keep our files obviously running off

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:10,730
of node and sort of talked about the

00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,550
services for running node and database

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,410
in the file system with a very easy

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:17,930
interface and then the question is sort

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,220
of zero is there you know you need

00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,120
something else in the middle which is

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,790
the middleware

00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,410
and basically a front-end NPI which

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,710
allows you to again right say you know

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:29,630
write this data point and for it to

00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,550
abstract the way what data base you have

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:34,430
in the backend or what file system you

00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:36,529
have and then up so you have the sort of

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,250
the FSDB connection you want to be able

00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:41,540
to manage the the app installations

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,770
manage the users and this is a personal

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,120
server but you want to have like you

00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:48,620
know friends or family within that

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:50,510
within that environment and sort of

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,510
manage the permissions I think the idea

00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,610
of having your own personal server with

00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,260
your data on there with your apps and

00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:00,110
data on there is be good because you

00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,750
want that data to be free for you to

00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:05,450
have other apps interact with it so I

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:08,420
may have so for example I build this

00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,550
little sort of browser plugin which is

00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,410
which I called view log which basically

00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:15,230
sort of logs all your data and the idea

00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,790
is you know Google and your telco

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,589
provider and everybody seems to follow

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,360
you and know every website you've ever

00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:22,670
been to but the only person who doesn't

00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,500
have that data is you right so you might

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,630
as well have it and put it on your own

00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,010
server so if you're gonna do that then

00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,610
maybe you're gonna have an app that

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,620
interacts with that data and does

00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,450
something with it right so you want to

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,730
sort of permission that so that these

00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,830
apps can interact and and access your

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:44,029
data but within your environment not

00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:47,709
within the environment of a of somebody

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:50,529
else's servers and that's the concept of

00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:55,070
concept of a personal personal server

00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:57,620
and once you do that so this is where

00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,690
you know you're in the computer wouldn't

00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:04,569
even cooperate to start so forget about

00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:07,689
doing a demo right because everything is

00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:12,679
so basically you know I took you through

00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:15,980
we're going to try this so basically if

00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:21,589
you've gone through sort of setting up m

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:26,059
lab and setting up setting up your

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:27,470
freezer server on on Heroku for example

00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:29,900
as this is the case so you get this sort

00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:32,710
of you know you get your I'm not live

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,740
which is a code word for it to crash

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,120
Heroku app comm and then you say okay

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,740
well there's no there's no server

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,480
there's no database or there's no file

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,940
system so what we're going to do is

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,309
we're going to have an external database

00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,570
and I've just this I had prefilled this

00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:51,970
before before it crashed

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:55,330
but basically you take the URI from M

00:17:51,970 --> 00:18:01,240
lab and you basically fill in the

00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:04,059
various little things here and hopefully

00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,800
I didn't make any typos and basically

00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:08,309
you've set up your database for your

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,750
external file system actually sort of

00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:12,370
you can also instead of going to develop

00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,620
Dropbox on developers you can actually

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,470
just have it o off effectively so

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:26,830
basically you you or you authenticate

00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:33,450
the server and and in your Dropbox

00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:33,450
basically you can have a just allow this

00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:40,360
right basically I've now gotten an

00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:42,280
access token and the idea is just you

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,000
know Salman FF my server just acting as

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:47,410
a as a as an OAuth provider and anybody

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,790
else can actually provide that so the

00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,650
idea is not to lock in but they actually

00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:53,230
have anybody be able to provide an OAuth

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:58,750
so that you can actually now have within

00:18:53,230 --> 00:19:01,150
your so within your Dropbox right you

00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:03,870
now have apps basically you have a

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:06,190
freezer app which you can work with

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,350
because you just thought that and under

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:10,600
Heroku you have this l not live which

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:13,179
has your system right and then you just

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,630
call sort of put in a past name and

00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:18,400
password and you said you know sort of

00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,200
the Dropbox access token is there and

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,610
you set parameters and your server

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,890
should be running if the world

00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:27,250
cooperates right and you launch freezer

00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:30,700
and so basically with the screenshots

00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:33,400
that I showed you and and this sort of

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,440
simple process for create having your

00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:39,010
own for having the the environment

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:42,070
valuables become persistent you have a a

00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:45,390
server and what do you do with this

00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:45,390
server so

00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:55,180
we're just gonna I'm just gonna do a

00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:57,880
little demo here where you know so apps

00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:01,620
are basically in a JavaScript HTML CSS

00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:06,640
files right so if you want to create a

00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:13,140
an app basically you can go to let's go

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:18,430
to downloads I'm gonna create a hello

00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:21,070
right oops I'm gonna create a new folder

00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:27,820
called that and then I'm gonna create an

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:32,590
index.html right and I'm gonna create a

00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:40,300
little dip here say hello and I'm gonna

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:43,060
name it ID equals hello so basically and

00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:45,370
this becomes an app and if I go to

00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:50,640
downloads all I need to do is to zip

00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:54,880
this up and back on my freezer server I

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:58,360
can go here and just say okay so I have

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:03,970
I'm gonna take this file and upload it

00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:06,280
and that becomes my app so that's your

00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:09,490
app is now installed on Heroku

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:11,590
effectively and you have your hello

00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,510
hello world and what's cool about that

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:17,830
actually because you have this Dropbox

00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:20,470
back-end effectively again for making

00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:23,380
things simple now under L not live sorry

00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:25,660
under freezer you actually under user

00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:29,800
Allah your user apps you actually have

00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:32,800
your index.html so your your your server

00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:35,050
environment is replicated on via Dropbox

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,560
on your desktop effectively right and if

00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:43,270
I can do one more thing I'm just gonna

00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:44,830
actually so the other cool thing about

00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:49,030
doing these apps is actually you can

00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:50,950
have a electron app which one's the runs

00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:53,020
the same code so this is my note-taking

00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:55,960
app that I have on my on my freezer

00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,830
server so I'm not gonna like try to type

00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:03,220
this out lie

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:08,650
so basically obviously any app like

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:13,660
index.html you can have an sorry I can

00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:17,220
go to my Dropbox apps and I go to my

00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:23,050
user apps here and in here just to index

00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:24,640
Jas and I copy a piece of this code

00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,380
basically just you know this is the it

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,070
sort of the abstraction or the API that

00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:32,110
says hey write to the database right and

00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:34,120
then just query the database so it

00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:36,610
should be that simple for a newbie who

00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,060
just set up a server in 15 minutes just

00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,120
right

00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:44,890
everything else is abstracted and now

00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:46,980
that I put it on my Dropbox even though

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:54,100
I'm live here

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:56,080
right basically it's just writing for

00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,450
the beta base and querying back all the

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,680
results showing that again trying to

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:04,810
make it really easy to have an

00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,370
environment where a newbie or a non

00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,140
techie can have their own servers can

00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:10,180
upload their own apps whatever that app

00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,970
is and and build their own apps

00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,410
effectively so around that there's also

00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,560
like I said permissioning so different

00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:22,720
apps can can access each other's data

00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:30,220
with your permission and if I just go to

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:33,700
my little conclusions page so so you

00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:36,580
know the the question for me it was you

00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,890
know is it easy enough to set up a

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,960
standard kind of consumer server

00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:43,540
consumer-oriented or new be oriented

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,310
server and no not really but we're

00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:47,890
pretty damn close and that is quite

00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:49,990
amazing that the server with your

00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,760
database and and file system can be set

00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,920
up basically through the web with a few

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,190
clicks right and a couple of copies and

00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,690
pastes and if we have that one why not

00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,950
have a common middleware something like

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:03,140
freezer freezer you know I'm like a

00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,090
yes you know it's not it's a personal

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:09,020
project it's not widely tested I'm in

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:11,240
serious need of your your work there to

00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:14,330
test this and it's it's not elegant code

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,730
for sure and it's not really robust but

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:19,250
it's kind of a start or maybe a concept

00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,050
or a start of a concept to say hey and

00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,540
there is this model out there where we

00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:26,060
all have our personal servers just like

00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:29,120
we have our Mac's or pcs and we have our

00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:32,000
apps on there and we own and control

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,010
that data we are uncontrolled our apps

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,010
and we can do whatever we like with them

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,819
