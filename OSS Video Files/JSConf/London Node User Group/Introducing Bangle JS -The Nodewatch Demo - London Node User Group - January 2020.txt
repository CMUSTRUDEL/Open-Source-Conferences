The world’s first hackable open source JavaScript-powered and TensorFlow-powered smartwatch

Nodewatch/ Bangle.js was introduced as the conference badge at Nodeconf EU in November. A Kickstarter that followed was swiftly funded. I received my watch from NearForm in the post the other day - and I don't know what to do with it yet - but this is too good not to share for a quick lightning demo.
