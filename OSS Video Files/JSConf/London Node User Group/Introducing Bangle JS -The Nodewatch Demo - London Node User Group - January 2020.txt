Description: 
	Bangle.js/ Nodewatch demo ⌚︎
Adam Davis

The world’s first hackable open source JavaScript-powered and TensorFlow-powered smartwatch

Nodewatch/ Bangle.js was introduced as the conference badge at Nodeconf EU in November. A Kickstarter that followed was swiftly funded. I received my watch from NearForm in the post the other day - and I don't know what to do with it yet - but this is too good not to share for a quick lightning demo.

Adam aka admataz is a core LNUG organiser, a hacker, and a software developer at NearForm

quick round how many of you have a

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,649
SmartWatch just hands in the air right

00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:11,179
not that many I was expecting more how

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:13,830
many of you the three of you have

00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:14,700
actually written anything that runs on

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,890
your wrist

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,350
yeah view you just consume that can

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,820
consume the same the same apps and so I

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,960
presume having not written anything for

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,960
it you didn't write it in JavaScript

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,619
will do it which was my follow-up

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,640
question

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:35,010
so anyway introducing JavaScript on your

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,010
wrists or the bangle jeaious has anyone

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,879
heard of this show of hands okay okay

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,950
I'm going to give you a bit of an

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,460
introduction to what this is and why it

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,469
is super super cool the follow up is at

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,910
words law who hasn't heard of that words

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,180
law right

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,920
after Jeff Atwood I think was behind

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,180
Stack Overflow and a bunch of other

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,399
things coding horror and he said in a

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,649
blog post any application that can be

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,539
written in JavaScript will eventually be

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,129
written in JavaScript and today we're

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,750
going to have evidence that anything

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,030
that can be written in JavaScript will

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,310
be written in JavaScript right so

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,500
introducing the bangle dais so what what

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,880
is this thing that I'm talking about

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,400
bangle dais is Pete a bit of is a new

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,670
product that was kick-started by the

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,680
Pete the guy behind s Purina

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,340
which is a sort of hardware hacking plot

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,909
for platform and it was launched at last

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,979
year's node confit you as the first the

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:36,869
world's first hackable open-source

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,840
JavaScript powered and tensorflow

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,100
powered SmartWatch okay so there's a lot

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,579
there's a lot of buzzwords in there it's

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,960
gonna get a lot of Google let's let's

00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:49,979
let's deconstruct it a little bit and

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,920
see what it is it's the world's first

00:01:49,979 --> 00:02:00,210
well it was lost at node con for you

00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:03,210
last year as a project between the the s

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:08,479
purina people and the node sorry near

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:12,900
forms research newly formed research

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,860
organ of the company and node Kampf has

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,180
got a history

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,410
interesting conference badges how many

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,440
people have been to node conf in the

00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:24,720
last three years okay it's right it runs

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,740
in Ireland and you may have picked up a

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,320
pretty a pretty nice electronic

00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:33,600
conference badge if you were there and

00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,960
in previous years I'll come back to that

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,250
one

00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,690
they will look pretty much like

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,760
conference badges with the screen on

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:42,720
them and then they've decided this year

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:45,330
to to up the ante a bit and make the

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,740
conference badge a SmartWatch and there

00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,209
a couple of motivations behind this and

00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,030
we'll go back to this original statement

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:52,680
the the world's first hackable

00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:56,100
open-source JavaScript powered intensive

00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,630
flow I would SmartWatch so the the the

00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,820
world's first I mean I think a lot of

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,010
the smartwatches you have out there that

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,480
you can purchase evidence by the people

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,340
who own them don't really get into

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,600
hacking them it's it's this is the first

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,580
that you can actually buy something that

00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,110
looks as good as this as as wearable as

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,270
this but actually you can you can write

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,500
to it yourself it's open-source and

00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:15,120
that's an important part of it because

00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,709
this is your data that's going onto this

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,660
device here so there's an important sort

00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,910
of health aspect if you're tracking your

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,590
health data it's you own it you can do

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,209
it with it what you want you're not

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,799
being fed something or you know feeding

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,549
your data or somewhere else it's up to

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,230
you

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:29,400
JavaScript power that's great that's

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,459
really accessible to all of us

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,660
especially as no developers or as

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:36,000
JavaScript developers or JavaScript

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:39,269
developers you can we we have access you

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,620
have technology that is accessible for

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,360
us to do things on this watch and I'm

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,280
going to run through a couple of demos

00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,010
to show what it's capable of doing and

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,470
then the real sort of cherry on top

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,690
here's the tensor flow powered part of

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,459
it and tensor flow is a library from

00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:57,630
Google that allows you to do machine

00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:59,280
learning and to manage the processes of

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,540
machine machine learning I don't know a

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,950
lot about it they're probably people in

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,320
the room that could talk more to what

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,840
that is but tensorflow Lite is something

00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,880
that will run on small micro micro

00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,380
controller devices and this and that's

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,079
what's been packaged into this little

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,360
thing here so note come for you it was

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,970
launched it came in a nice little box

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,530
apparently and it was a continuation of

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:25,650
something and a growth of an idea the

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,120
hardware itself any sort of electronics

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,660
buffs in the in the house that this

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,050
means any

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:34,200
thing to okay a Nordic semiconductor SSC

00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:35,220
with Bluetooth le 4.2 there's an

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,270
accelerometer you know what an

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,520
accelerometer does

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,380
okay it measures measures movement a

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,080
three axis compass tells you whether

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,550
you're facing north or not a heart rate

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,540
monitor that's pretty handy if you want

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:52,470
to measure your heart rate and some

00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:55,110
flash memory an LCD screen which if you

00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,270
can see from there looks like that it's

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,630
called it's full color it's 240 by 240

00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,250
pixels it's actually got to touch to

00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,480
zones of touch on it so those are extra

00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:09,360
buttons that you can use and there is a

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,920
core GPS units as well which allows you

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,840
to track your location so this is quite

00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,430
this is quite a powerful little thing oh

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,740
it's got a buzzer as well so if you can

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,060
tell you give you alerts you want to

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,230
find out more there's a link there node

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,840
watch dot dev tells you more s Perino's

00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,430
the software that basically runs this

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,870
Gordon Williams is the the genius behind

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,030
this is every way has anyone played with

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,340
this Perino before like as anyone played

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:34,560
with Arduino before okay it's saying

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:36,660
it's similar idea but it's it compiled

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,220
your JavaScript down to something that

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,820
will run on a little microcontroller

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,160
which is really again it's nice for us

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,620
especially as JavaScript developers I

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,390
really urge you to look at s Purina and

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,400
if you're interested in doing anything

00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:54,120
outside of the four corners of your

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,680
cloud portal then you might want to do

00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:57,419
something that you know runs in the

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,070
corner of your room a little device that

00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:01,290
measures the temperature or measures the

00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,900
light or you know it just responds with

00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:05,580
a sound when you get a tweet mention or

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,380
something who knows there are all sorts

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,840
of things you can do and the an s

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:13,080
Perino's a growing platform and it's

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,540
often been crowdfunded of small devices

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,580
that you can plug in through USB or

00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,919
control contact or make communication

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,660
with through bluetooth if you're a

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,320
hacker you should you should get

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:28,410
yourself interested and involved with

00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,750
that I'll go into the software more but

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:32,430
I want to also just as part of the demo

00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,470
but also want to just have a quick look

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,260
at what people are doing on the on the

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,300
watch here's a QR code maybe it's some

00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,960
way of of you being able to share a link

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,560
to your website to allow people to

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,669
scan that in show them you'll show them

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,389
your watch

00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:52,240
here's someone's used the GPS capability

00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:53,889
to track their route I think it's a

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,919
predefined route that they've uploaded

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:58,419
to the uploaded to the watch and allowed

00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:01,330
them to check the progress along that

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:06,570
route here's a game you might recognize

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:08,680
it it also runs on the watch and so

00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,960
they're also a whole lot of apps and

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,520
again being open-source more than just

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,130
owning your own data it allows a lot of

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:21,699
people to contribute apps and to extend

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:23,620
the the ecosystem so I'm going to

00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:24,940
quickly let's let's quickly visit the

00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,199
App Store and then we can have a look at

00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,210
what kind of things people have been

00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:30,940
making everything from the bootloader

00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:35,289
that allows that runs the core software

00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:36,820
and allows you to allows you to do the

00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,830
things that bangle jeaious does is

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:43,180
available here

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:45,190
they're various various apps here in

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:49,139
different categories clocks games tools

00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:51,490
widgets and stuff stuff around Bluetooth

00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,430
let's have a look at let's have a look

00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:57,130
at a simple one to start off with and

00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:00,010
and and you can demonstrate what esperan

00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:02,470
is capable of doing so we'll look at a

00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:07,150
clock for instance just the straight

00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:15,190
forward which is the clock I'd like to

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:16,509
look at any of these clocks will do take

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,930
your pick

00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:22,840
simple clock let's look at that one so

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:25,210
we we can s purina also has an emulator

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:28,360
and a web-based IDE that allows you to

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:33,339
edit the JavaScript code so that's that

00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:36,849
okay so here we have some JavaScript

00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:41,279
code on the right-hand side which allows

00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:43,120
you to write the functionality around

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,220
display of a clock and you might

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,660
recognize if you this kind of language

00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:50,910
if you've written anything with canvas

00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:53,680
and on the Dom it's very similar and

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,590
here is the display of the clocks here

00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:01,250
so

00:08:54,590 --> 00:09:06,500
for instance I've got a version of my

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:09,650
own Elmo clock which I've managed to

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:12,350
customize the colors to and have my own

00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,400
shape to the clock face and this is

00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,470
something I'm working on and maybe I'll

00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,560
have a little node based clock face on

00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:23,210
my on my on my wrist when I've finished

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,190
there so to give an example we could

00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:30,130
change the colors and exchange it from

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,130
green to something else wherever done it

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:41,630
so simple RGB so instead of green let's

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:44,810
make it all red just for a simple thing

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:46,550
we upload it and it's changed a color

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,780
there so it's it's very it's very

00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,520
straightforward but this is a bit this

00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,410
is a very powerful idea that you can

00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,110
actually just edit everything in in your

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,580
browser and play around with it before

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,080
you've even got access to the watch

00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,790
because it's not available yet you can

00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,810
you can purchase one but it's it won't

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,220
be sent to you for another few weeks

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,930
because they're still making them this

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,850
is a b2 Edition that's all very well

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,260
there let's have a look a couple look at

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,920
a couple of the other sort of more

00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:17,240
interesting apps for instance what would

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:21,620
life be without a party parrot on your

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:24,280
wrist so if you if you're heading out

00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,840
[Applause]

00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,760
but what I really I'm interested in

00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,000
doing here is showing you some of the

00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:33,230
more advanced stuff that it can do and

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,300
unfortunately we don't have a GP I can't

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,790
get a GPS in here so I'm going to show

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,580
you some of the gesture-based stuff that

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,230
produces machine learning ok so again

00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:47,060
there's an example that's using the

00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:49,790
emulator let's talk about tensorflow so

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:53,240
does anybody everyone kind of know how

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:55,540
this works conceptually we couldn't you

00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,530
need to collect some sort of fuzzy and

00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,100
imprecise data based on the

00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:03,290
accelerometer right and what we're

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,910
without without the precision we don't

00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,470
really know what our gesture means but

00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,480
with machine learning and a lot of data

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,449
we can train a model

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,089
helps us actually define what the

00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:16,490
different hand gestures could be right

00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:19,250
so I'm gonna I'm gonna try and give me a

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:24,410
second while I try and connect my watch

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:27,740
to the emulator not the emulator the

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:29,120
actual IDE and let's see if we can get

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,850
some gestures going here and I can show

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,959
you what that looks like and let's go to

00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:37,730
the ID not that one not that one okay

00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:39,290
here all right this is something

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,699
unloaded earlier and this is there's an

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,250
article which I'll link to in the in the

00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:49,220
night in the slides there that would

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:51,290
would show you how to do this and I've

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,660
just followed the instructions there so

00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:57,800
I'm going to set my watch to connectable

00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,540
I'm going to try and share this with you

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,829
and we're gonna get a chance as well so

00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,730
this actually take this out of full

00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:07,730
screen mode and I'm not sure this is

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:10,100
gonna allow me just can you see me there

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:12,560
okay so there's my watch and it's got a

00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,560
menu unfortunately I can't share this I

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,260
can't share Conran zoom on it so but

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:20,839
I've got a set too but the Bluetooth on

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:23,750
so ideally what we should be able to do

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:28,639
now is connect to it with web Bluetooth

00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:31,339
and of course we're going to run into

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:37,850
glitches because it's telling me it

00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:42,819
can't find the device okay there it is

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,819
Bengal jeaious okay so I'm gonna pair it

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,870
okay so

00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:50,660
when you got your bangle paired you can

00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:53,950
do all sorts of stuff with it you can on

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,950
the left-hand side of your you know

00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:01,760
interface you have some you can write

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:05,800
JavaScript here that can actually you

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,800
won't hear it but or feel it but I will

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:11,720
that's that will run immediately on the

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,060
device right so it's in it sent via buzz

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,680
there let's see if I do a beep if you

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:29,870
don't all listen very carefully

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:31,690
I could try here better so if you do the

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,410
front you may have heard it

00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,850
alright but I'm gonna show you something

00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,620
a little more a little more meaningful

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,910
in there let's actually see if I can

00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:43,610
connect to it from I don't have it

00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,870
running anymore so what we'll do is

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,220
we'll get this gesture thing going and

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,320
then we'll see you it see what comes out

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:53,450
of that so this is a little function

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:56,140
that that that basically defines it

00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:59,210
captures what you're doing with your

00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:01,130
with your seller ometer and then spits

00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:04,070
it out to something that can be charted

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:06,590
so I'm gonna upload this to the device

00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:12,140
by clicking this here

00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:15,290
and it's loaded and now what should

00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:18,980
happen I want to join demo this to you

00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:21,950
with the camera it's if I shake my hand

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,630
around it should give okay it's given me

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:26,120
a gesture with something with some data

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:28,430
there and it's also if you have a look

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,870
here I can find much mean it's drawn

00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:35,930
that's just drawn me so we could do we

00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:39,200
could repeat that say so say my gesture

00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:43,140
is Pete Townsend right ok

00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,640
and each time you do it it's going to be

00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,860
slightly different and each time we do

00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,350
it it's gonna give me a little chart

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,470
just to say that give me an idea of what

00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:55,290
it's done and the idea is you would take

00:14:52,470 --> 00:15:01,590
all this gesture data and go and plug it

00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:07,790
in to now I had this running earlier in

00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:13,050
somewhere like a collab where you could

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:17,760
add this to the to the set of data that

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:19,530
your model can learn from so that's the

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,230
basics of what's happening what what

00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:26,930
then happens is you re upload the the

00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:29,550
model to your phone I mean to your wrist

00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,230
using the same interface and you can

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:33,540
define your own gestures or you can

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:36,000
define your own data based your own

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,530
based on the tensor flow using the

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,710
tensor in the built-in tensor flow

00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:45,540
capabilities and tensor flow light is

00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:47,280
very much in a technology in development

00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,870
it's there were a lot of hack there's a

00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,339
lot of happiness around it I don't know

00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,930
if anyone else has tried it around here

00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,980
I have not yet actually got into the

00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,550
depths of it but everything I've read

00:15:52,980 --> 00:16:03,000
about it sounds like an interesting

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:05,370
journey so that is the basics this is

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,920
there's a very good article in the near

00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:14,070
forum blog that covers how they did this

00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:16,980
and this is a sort of a this is one of

00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:19,740
the outcomes they had from all the did

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,530
world similar exercise that we've just

00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:25,500
been going through and charted that data

00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:27,780
to show the difference between claps and

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:32,910
a random movement or a swipe left or

00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:36,120
right or up and down that is about it

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:38,070
but if you want I can go back to the s

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,620
Perino and sort of show some more of the

00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,820
demo or if you're anyone wants to come

00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,430
up and have a look and I can show you

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,430
the watch in closer but that's about it

00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:55,380
[Applause]

00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,389
okay let's let's check it out because

00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:02,550
that's what that's that's worth doing

00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:06,000
it's it's around 50 quid so if we just

00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:08,790
go to okay so you can pre-order now if

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,559
you go to bangle Jay's calm and click

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:13,549
pre-order now they'll take you to the

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:16,470
Esprit know shop 69 pounds so yeah so I

00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:19,140
I've been cheap at the price I mean come

00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:22,919
on what are you gonna pay for an Apple

00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,240
watch you know similar it's so I mean so

00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,390
it's not as feature full as that but

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,760
it's it's better in other ways I backed

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:33,360
it on Kickstarter and I think I paid 100

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,070
quid and I'm getting two of them so and

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,330
I've got this one near forum were kind

00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,360
enough to send me one because of their

00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:42,000
involvement and you know I work for them

00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:44,250
so yeah I would urge you all to go to

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,210
bangle jeaious there's a there is a

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:50,160
growing amount of information on forums

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,630
and discussions going on and as you can

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,040
see on the store there's a lot of stuff

00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,299
going on there where people are

00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,900
uploading there's a there's a github

00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:59,250
repo where you can add your app to put

00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,679
in a pull request and they'll be added

00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,510
to the to the to the loader there and

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,590
anyone can load then load and contribute

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:08,850
or test your test your app yeah any

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,150
other any other questions about the

00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,150
bangle

00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:19,460
I've not run out of battery on it yet I

00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:22,100
mean in terms of like my everyday usage

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,600
I've been told if you switch off GPS and

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,910
you don't refresh the screen too often

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,700
use it just as a regular watch it'll

00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:30,260
last about a week if you if you if

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,730
you're outputting graphics all the time

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:33,860
and using GPS at last about three hours

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,270
so depending on really depending really

00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,650
what you're doing and then they have all

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,780
the measurements I mean if you ask

00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,400
Gordon Williams on Esper you know he

00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,410
responds quite quickly to questions like

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,970
that because he knows he knows the

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:54,830
technology behind it so the forums are

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:57,170
very informative that sort of way well

00:18:54,830 --> 00:19:00,560
it's off there's pretty good

00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:03,110
documentation of the s Perino sort of

00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,360
flavor of JavaScript so to speak it is

00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,130
all JavaScript so you get sits in terms

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,040
of package management you can use a lot

00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,510
of your regular JavaScript methods of

00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,370
loading packages and things but there's

00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,140
a there's a let's have a look and see if

00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:18,680
we can go to the reference quickly so I

00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:20,540
mean it's it's not pretty but there

00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,740
there's a there's a this is the bangle

00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,740
reference and all the sort of the

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,750
Global's just you know there's a there's

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,750
regular sort of JavaScript stuff as well

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:33,340
as sort of Esprit know specific stuff

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,340
and then bangle specific stuff as well

00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:42,350
well I mean there's their limitations to

00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:45,860
the to the flash memory available on the

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:47,900
device but other than that I think what

00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,220
the limitations you ran into possibly

00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,320
are around performance if you're doing

00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,150
heavy calculations things will be slower

00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:56,660
than you'd expect them to be I need you

00:19:53,150 --> 00:20:00,640
expect that from from you from something

00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,640
this size and that doesn't heat up

00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:07,779
I'm not doomed

00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:10,869
somebody's apparently got create react

00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:13,589
up sort of like going so it's kind of

00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:13,589
doom in a sense

00:20:15,609 --> 00:20:24,759
cool I know what he did was he came up

00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:28,330
with a framework to because react can be

00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:30,249
treated as a sort of ads agnostic in

00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,929
terms of where renders so rendering to

00:20:30,249 --> 00:20:33,940
this using a sort of similar sort of

00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:45,700
react Lang like JSX type language I

00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:48,940
actually looked at it yeah because it

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,589
runs on an eight more native everything

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,969
gets companies to be compiled down by

00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:53,440
Esprit no though so there's a sort of

00:20:51,969 --> 00:20:54,669
there is a limitation you can't used any

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,399
sort of any JavaScript

00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:59,589
yeah the IDE is a little more strict in

00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:01,599
terms of semicolons it expects a

00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:02,499
semicolon if you end on a comic I'll

00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,269
comment or something

00:21:02,499 --> 00:21:06,309
I'm just we're having a look at the kind

00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:09,309
of the apps that we have here I mean

00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:10,989
you've got like I mean asteroids is like

00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:16,349
a perfect example of something that is

00:21:10,989 --> 00:21:16,349
certainly dead simple but you know is I

00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:23,670
mean the gameplay is probably not as fun

00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:26,220
as actually writing the game but

00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:27,540
but you know the idea being you know you

00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,600
can do this sort of stuff

00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:31,740
if it's running on on your phone you

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,510
know you get the sound effects and I

00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,010
mean on on your watch it's get the sound

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,930
effects and things but you know this is

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:41,550
the kind of fun stuff you can do apart

00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:43,470
from the sort of I mean the other quite

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,590
nice thing is a sort of is the health

00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:48,210
like the health aspect to it so let's

00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:52,500
see if my heart rates gone up while I've

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:57,270
been giving this talk and it's again

00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:59,720
it's got no heart rate okay seven beats

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:02,370
per minute that's not good is it

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:08,040
thirty seven oh it's it's it's going up

00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:13,500
oh no you can't see there again so okay

00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:18,960
it's evened out no someone's actually

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:21,270
visualized I visualize my heartbeat so

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,760
you know there's stuff like that and I

00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,800
think I think as the ecosystem grows

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,420
there's going to be more connectivity

00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,620
because at the moment what I found

00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,570
frustrating was like oh I'm a no

00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,330
developer when I like connect you know

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:36,390
web feeds to it now whenever I get

00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:38,070
gather information as I'm you know

00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,360
walking around the house about my heart

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:42,750
rate and you know you have to have some

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,460
sort of and and and the there is still a

00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:48,720
lot of development that needs to happen

00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:50,550
in terms of say you know a Bluetooth

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,050
based web server that will allow you to

00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,430
collect the data you need from your

00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:55,620
watch in order for it to be meaningful

00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,600
because you can't store it all on here I

00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,760
can't go for a run and collect all the

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,320
data I need for GPS tracking you know

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,820
for longer than a certain amount because

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,650
it'll just run out of space it doesn't

00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:08,850
quite have the same sort of capabilities

00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:11,880
of an that that you'd expect from you

00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:14,430
know a commercial equivalent but it's

00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,190
it's it's you know for what it is it's

00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,750
it's it's pretty it's it's pretty good

00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,940
it's a great start

00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,230
yeah I don't know I mean I think we'll

00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,670
leave the rest of the pub later and I

00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:27,060
can I can show it show some you know the

00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:29,940
pub and yeah okay I'll switch off talk

00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:32,040
mode now and get into competition mode

00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:35,750
because we have to move on with the hell

00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,750
