this isn't anything to do with mode I'm

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:14,730
really I'm really sorry but it is about

00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:19,590
automation with Apple shortcuts I'm

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:21,689
sorry is anyone who here is iOS I'm

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:27,750
hoping there's more than like what okay

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:30,150
that's enough cool so I had a problem

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,099
the problem was I want to read blog

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,110
posts but I don't want to read them

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,940
right now and I don't want to read them

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,969
on my mobile what I really want to do is

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:44,030
read them tomorrow at 10:30 and get a

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:48,690
notification to say like read this thing

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:51,320
my specification was it needed to be in

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:56,280
the native share sheets on iOS which is

00:00:51,320 --> 00:01:00,510
this thing here because that's really

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,059
just handy so I thought of some

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,670
solutions I thought of building a

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,710
progressive web app but that wasn't

00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,170
gonna work because it doesn't go in the

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,930
native share sheet unfortunately so I

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,150
thought alright I'll build a native app

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:17,970
but I don't know anything about building

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,340
a native app maybe like react native you

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,320
know I wasn't gonna do that because it

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,530
would just be a blank screen that just

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,060
goes into the share sheet all the other

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,930
thing was just not care about it but I

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,640
wanted it so I cared about it

00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:38,220
so the solution I came up with was yes

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:43,020
remind me later this is an apple

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:46,979
shortcut and it looks like this which

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:51,659
obviously you can't read so I've done

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:55,439
this with like cropping this is coding

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,020
in on your phone and it's really really

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,549
cool

00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:03,149
this is got quite a lot in it but I've

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:09,840
got a sort of reduced case that does the

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:12,000
same sort of thing so we have these

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,769
three steps it essentially does what

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,719
what the long before did

00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:20,700
with a few things missing so what is in

00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:24,239
here

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:27,260
the first thing up here is we run

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,620
another shortcut and that shortcut is a

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:33,450
slack horse token which is this shortcut

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,989
it's just another shortcut and it just

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:39,560
outputs some text that's it so it runs

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:42,750
that oh whoops

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,939
it runs that and then the next thing is

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:50,790
it creates a URL that's it and that's

00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:52,560
from this slack API then it uses see

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,049
where it's got one shortcut in the

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,650
authorization header that is the

00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:07,919
response of that slakoth token shortcut

00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:10,829
this creates a curl request and oh hey

00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,659
yeah that's that I wrote these slides

00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:14,480
about an hour ago so I don't really know

00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:17,879
what order they're in

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,790
and then I'm piping the response of that

00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:24,479
into this other shortcut which is parse

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,400
letter slap response powers like

00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,879
response it's just another shortcut and

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,979
what does it do it gets a dictionary

00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,760
from input which is like creating an

00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:38,129
object so this like API returns Jason so

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,019
it creates an object I get the key okay

00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:43,470
outlet which is a boon in that slack

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,599
returns weirdly it seems to convert it

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:50,519
into number which is weird

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:52,620
but if the value is 0 I show us a show a

00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:58,159
result something went wrong otherwise I

00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,159
show result done which looks like that

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,549
what was the other stuff in that long

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,340
one it was this which is like a guard

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:12,359
clause if I didn't get any arguments

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:18,090
just exit and I had this which gives you

00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:19,949
a list of options and and takes takes a

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,739
response and this was something I was

00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:25,940
sending to slack

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:29,590
I want to do a quick demo this may not

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:31,970
work at all but bear with me

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:38,449
I'm really sorry you weren't expecting

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:45,130
this were you okay please work please

00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:48,800
work don't do this

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:52,550
does anyone get like the USB port where

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,750
it like just keeps starting to connect

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,150
and then not connect and they're not

00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:04,270
connect oh gosh something's gone weird

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:08,530
okay right can I do this full screen

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:14,270
okay so I'm here on the Financial Times

00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:17,320
website this micron froze down on bricks

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:22,190
it delay article looks very interesting

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:25,039
so I'm gonna share that and you can see

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:29,720
shortcuts appears here so I'll click on

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:32,270
that remind me later and it runs through

00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,240
all of this I'm just gonna do it in one

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:40,690
second it's gone off it's made of us

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:43,690
it's making requests it's done and then

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,690
hopefully

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,189
or maybe this like hides notifications

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:01,180
boom

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,139
okay so then slap what has reminded me

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:07,719
in one second and it says you asked me

00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:09,580
to remind you to read this article so

00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:11,830
then the next day at work I have it set

00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,599
up at 10:30 so next day at work I get a

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,030
notification from slack but with all the

00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:16,360
blog posts that I asked it to remind me

00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:18,520
later

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,669
this took about 45 minutes using

00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,740
shortcuts it's really really fun it's

00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:26,139
some of the most fun coding I've ever

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,000
done and it is coding it's as legit

00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:34,000
there's so many things you can do in

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:37,590
there it's crazy that was the demo it

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,500
went well and done thank you very much

00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,500
