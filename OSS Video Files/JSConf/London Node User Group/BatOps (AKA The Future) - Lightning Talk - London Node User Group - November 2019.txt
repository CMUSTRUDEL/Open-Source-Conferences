	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,200
okay so chats it was super champion like

00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,630
CFC alright but serve abilities come a

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,490
long way since then and we think we've

00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,080
invented like the next generation of

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:18,600
this so we're about to present it

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:21,300
seen yesterday yeah be prepared to be

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,039
floored by bat ops also known as the

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:29,550
future I really hope so this all started

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,740
with the blessing buzz and what is the

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,020
blessing that you may ask I really hope

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,570
that Google slides animation doesn't

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,700
fail me now so it all started with this

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,629
little mean we don't know who you are

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,570
scary licious but thank you and this is

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:48,000
the northern ghost bats which is this

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,770
adorably grumpy little bat and a google

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,640
image search is well worth your while

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:57,660
because it's freaking amazing so we

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,309
decided that we would not really sure

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,410
how the idea came about I think a lot of

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,170
alcohol was involved and but we decided

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:08,549
that we would create a sort of a visual

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:12,240
signal when a positive event happened so

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,280
I guess to explain history we hook up

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,979
shop inventory systems with Google and

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,430
we decided that we create a sort of a

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,960
literal bat signal whenever whenever a

00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,939
shop signed up to our service so we

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,950
decided that we would have a little bat

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,390
that would glow with flashing lights

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,659
just as like a little fun little

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,720
positive reminder that this magical

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,270
thing had happened so we started on our

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:41,579
adventure the materials that we would

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:45,420
need one stuffed bat exhibit a we found

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:48,030
a lovely lady in Ukraine on Etsy who

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,740
made these beautiful handcrafted bats

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,750
that we then very quickly realized we

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,500
were going to have to tear apart and put

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:58,170
LEDs in we would need a Raspberry Pi

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,570
we found we decided to use the Raspberry

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,939
Pi zero because it's a very small bar

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,829
3pi and we can be able to hook up Wi-Fi

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:08,190
so Wi-Fi enabled they make it like that

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:11,670
now we also needed some color changing

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:13,010
LED for makeup at glow some resistors so

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,230
that we didn't burn every

00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,510
and oh and some jumper jerky which is

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,980
just little wires that you plug in we

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,829
have see needed a power source and it

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,450
turned it out turned out that we needed

00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:25,549
many miles of electrical tape it seemed

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:28,370
when you're like taping together fiddly

00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:39,409
little bits of wires it feels like it's

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:42,590
a million miles one of the Ryman TV

00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:44,870
earlier when something happens it's all

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,849
based on one variable table plate one

00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:52,299
very compact leisurely day it seemed

00:02:46,849 --> 00:03:11,060
hockey and kind of just our works we

00:02:52,299 --> 00:03:11,599
read how many when it's happens it's

00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,549
frequent

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,609
I can't take credit for this name and

00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:19,040
echolocation my colleague came up with

00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:21,799
this idea and so this is the program we

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,870
had to put on the pie itself so we had

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:28,940
to go into the deep dark world of Python

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:30,019
a so first step was we had to write a

00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,629
little function that would trigger the

00:03:30,019 --> 00:03:34,879
LEDs so we used a little library that

00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,019
would like just work with the pins if

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,040
you've ever seen a Raspberry Pi or

00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:39,109
something similar there are little pins

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,840
you plug into and you can program those

00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:45,500
with Python that we then had a second

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,230
function that would check the

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,569
aforementioned bat ops API to see if

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:53,090
there was anything new and if there's

00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:54,530
anything new how many new things there

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,199
were so it'd be like a little total

00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,859
never say oh it's greater than zero my

00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:03,079
time to shine literally and then we had

00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:04,579
a system D which to be fair I don't

00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,109
fully understand my wonderful colleague

00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:09,319
who understands Linux a lot better than

00:04:06,109 --> 00:04:12,169
I do manage to get that running so every

00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:15,620
10 seconds it basically echo locates

00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:18,560
pings out to the API to see if an event

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:21,979
has happened and if it has it does a

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,500
little flash bill disclaimer this is not

00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:27,139
the most efficient method getting a

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,990
Raspberry Pi to ping every 10 seconds

00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:32,300
yeah it was the only way we could really

00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,860
think of to do it without setting up so

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,030
you can set up like port forwarding if

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,610
you want to kind of like hook up your

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,380
router but honestly if anyone has a

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:44,050
better way we would love to hear about

00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:45,889
it at the end at the end promise okay

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,389
here was another beautiful photo

00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:48,199
seriously I love this holder so much to

00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:59,020
look at his face

00:04:48,199 --> 00:05:02,449
great okay and this is the finish so

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,820
yeah every time a shop signs up this

00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:07,910
this this was taken at night in the

00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,590
daylight it's a little less obvious we

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,780
kind of just all just quickly look I

00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,280
look over just like is it working and

00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,539
you can kind of just see like a little

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,430
little flash going on

00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:18,500
but it's kind of a like a sweet little

00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,940
positive reminder so like something

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,020
positive has happened it like helps the

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,190
growth of the company and we like look

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,770
over and there's like a little flashing

00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:32,599
baton it's just cute and ice why did we

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:37,099
do it why why don't we do it but also

00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:39,889
it's fun to realize how probably still

00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:42,560
okay it pulls quite frequently and the

00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:44,900
pass however long this thing was they go

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,139
cause a month to a new week maybe we

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,050
type in a week you're called 265,000

00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:53,000
times a week and it's gonna be fine

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:56,120
across estimation because there's any

00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,500
wonder a mass or sense so if he wants to

00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,990
point something will serve as you can

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:05,000
see de Larroque ceases it's basically

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:07,610
break yes and it's box joy it was very

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,639
fun and unfortunately the Drake has been

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,960
given away but there was the thrill of

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,150
potentially burning the building down

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,650
when we went home for the weekend the

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,870
first couple of nights we left it

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,250
switched off overnight just in case and

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,169
then we just forgot for a week and we

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:26,720
were like oh still plugged in and we're

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:27,750
still here so it's all good thank you

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:35,459
for listening to us ramble

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:35,459
