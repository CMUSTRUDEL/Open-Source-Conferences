You've heard of GraphQL. But what kind of problems can it solve? This is the story of why we chose GraphQL to power the Vogue and GQ websites, and how it helped us get the data we needed for our frontend. You'll learn about some ways in which GraphQL can improve your application, and understand how you might implement it.

About Pusher Sessions:

We're bringing the meetup to you. With Sessions, you can watch recordings of top-notch talks from developer meetups -- wherever and whenever you want.

Meetups are a great way to learn from our peers and to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. As developers ourselves, we at Pusher wanted to bring this great content to more people... So we built Sessions. On Sessions, you can watch talks that interest you and subscribe to be notified when new content gets added.

If you run a meetup and want to get involved, kindly get in touch.
