okay so this is a talk about house you

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:05,549
know using GIS in 2019

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,519
I might speed up a bit because the

00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,800
region this was a half an hour talk so

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,759
just throw things at me if I go over ten

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,980
minutes so this talk is inspired in a

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,590
blog post everything in February which

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,400
got my popular I went to a few podcasts

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:26,130
talk about it got lots of emails and it

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,900
was a really nice experience and I

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,630
wanted to talk about this since then

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:33,780
because I want to answer two of the most

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,739
common questions I get when I say that I

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:41,070
don't tend to use do ice and 2019

00:00:36,739 --> 00:00:44,399
they're up why and how and as you asked

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:48,420
me earlier there's also oh my god

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,160
why it's also reasonably common so you

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,559
know I think I should start with this

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,210
one because you know it might sound

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,309
weird for someone to come up here and

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,840
say like or you know you should develop

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,289
software in this way that people used to

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,320
do it I don't know in the 80s 70s for 95

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,309
so I don't know

00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,729
especially when we got so many amazing

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,530
GUI is out there right amazing but it's

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:14,159
a click on you know dragging the mouse

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,750
around amazing and this might you know

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,390
can you imagine like when people came up

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,310
with books and then someone Majid was

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:25,590
like oh yeah I actually quite like my

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:27,299
papyrus it's very nice isn't it and now

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:30,140
you might think oh no one would ever say

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:35,009
that right who pays this kind of things

00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,509
people do say things like that so now

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,729
it's how can use a clock the time of the

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,490
talk where I read the amazing comments

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,810
that I got on that post in Hockey News

00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,390
I'm gonna start with one of my favorites

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,689
in which someone quotes a passage of

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,700
that post which says using the terminal

00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,600
at least make super efficient with the

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,399
lowest common denominator of tools and

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,790
then they go on to ask a very deep

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,060
philosophical question why even use a

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,299
computer there aren't rocks and sticks

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,209
in different law or common denominator

00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:11,250
makes sense right the pious argument

00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:12,390
there's also this one this is a

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,190
Starcraft

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,520
where if you developers are limited by

00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,350
their paying Troopa to DIY and then

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,780
there's this other person which has very

00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,700
how can you comment saying even your

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,860
terminal emulator is a GUI app itself

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,150
don't say you're not using GI apps

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,020
unless you put our command line

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:33,960
interface directly I know right clicking

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:37,560
I turn when I put my Mac it's like hard

00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:43,260
came to it but I have a vinta too

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:45,300
so I have some some credibility right so

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,220
how take alert right that's actually

00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,850
time to start a talk because I just have

00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:54,570
two minutes I need to say this gee why

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,610
is there a bloat we're so used to have

00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,170
25 minutes to explain and make this a

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,080
more newest argument here just have five

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,989
I'll do my best and that's because

00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,400
that's not because GUI is people

00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:07,950
designed you ice to be brought right

00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,870
it's because designing GUIs by nature

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,550
makes them become blowdry because when

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,870
you're developing a GUI you need to

00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,820
think of all the things that people are

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,799
going to do in advance and you need to

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,450
make those features built-in into what

00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,560
you're developing so you need to think

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,900
too much you need to make too many

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,820
assumptions which makes GYC end up

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,410
becoming bloatware because also they're

00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,850
very integrate hard to integrate with

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,590
other software so you have to make too

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,440
much assumptions they become to make and

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,900
therefore they become bloated it's like

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,269
old-school Microsoft programs right so

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,010
Word Excel PowerPoint and other

00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,019
Microsoft programs they have Internet

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,260
one might say promiscuous knowledge of

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,000
each other's internals and in UNIX one

00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,910
tries to design programs to operate not

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,459
with each other but with programs as yet

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,560
on tada and that's why when you see lies

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,239
there or not load because you're only

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,100
concerned with doing one thing and doing

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,010
it well because you have universal

00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,049
interface to make then communicate so

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,430
you have tax streams and what you should

00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,230
do is you should write programs to help

00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,090
text reams because those are universal

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:08,549
interfaces so you don't make many

00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:11,910
assumptions and therefore C lis are

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:13,470
small you are more concerned about

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,910
writing programs that do one thing and

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,459
that do well because they can integrate

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,530
other programs to to those Universal

00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,630
interfaces and you're also more

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,919
concerned about writing problems that

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,070
work together instead of writing

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,550
programs that

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,740
do everything so CL eyes are good

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,110
because CL eyes means we have less

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,240
suffer just the best thing you can have

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,340
right let's off 4 means less time fixing

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,950
things less time debugging things and

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,540
less time thinking about them write less

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:42,730
software is great and in fact there's

00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,500
only one thing but in less software and

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:49,420
the only thing better than less software

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:52,980
is having no software at all right sorry

00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:56,350
I know that's our job ok I'm sorry

00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,000
so why I don't like do I so I think you

00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,380
guys are limiting because in the same

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,640
way that their creators need to think of

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,350
everything that you're going to need to

00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,240
do in advance you end up becoming

00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,420
limited by what they thought you were

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,650
going to do so basically if they didn't

00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:10,450
think of one of your needs in advance

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,000
you probably can't do it or you're gonna

00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,710
have a very hard time doing it we're

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,980
also not scalable when you do things

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,330
multiple times in Gy you don't become

00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,560
necessarily a lot faster in it or a lot

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,750
better in it or you don't discover

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,190
usually better ways of doing it but when

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,600
you see allies there's always something

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,130
that you can change to make it more

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,140
efficient you can find other program to

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,390
combine with that you can have a

00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,650
workflow that's more adaptable and that

00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,270
suits your needs and the skills better

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,820
with your skills and how much time you

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:39,130
spend doing things they're also hard to

00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,020
integrate you know saving files opening

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,360
them in a little program or the kind of

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:44,500
stuff it's just very annoying because

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,620
they cannot communicate with other

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,690
programs and they're also hard to

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,910
automate because you know if you're

00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:55,210
writing script guess what you know using

00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,040
CLI and they're also not portable if you

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,230
need to do that in a CI environment or

00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,600
if you're SSH into a machine you know if

00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:05,860
you're like I know if your life depends

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,570
on it you will probably have to wait for

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,600
something to download open it you know

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,060
all the kind of stuff but there's things

00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,370
that G wise are good for you should use

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,470
you ice but you should use G wise when

00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:19,300
you need you guys I don't think anyone

00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:23,590
here thought about using Photoshop as a

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:26,980
CLI today ok good not don't do it that's

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:28,510
not what I'm advocating for ok so you

00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,850
guys are good for things like

00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,850
discoverability like no repetitive tasks

00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,410
like dealing with multimedia and those

00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,090
things like they're like for example

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,689
using Photoshop using Photoshop makes

00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,099
sense because it

00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,919
no obstructions match what you're trying

00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,330
to do right so discoverability is that

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,009
really important for us are we really

00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,169
trying to discover new features as we do

00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:48,549
things we usually approach tasks with a

00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:50,199
going mind and we know what we're going

00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:51,639
to do so actually clicking around

00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,349
discovering things or playing while the

00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,739
parameters it's not really something we

00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:58,629
do a lot is it no repetitive tasks well

00:06:56,739 --> 00:07:01,599
now you might think well I don't do a

00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:04,629
batch of tasks but your tests might not

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,479
be repetitive in their intent but

00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:08,979
they're repetitive in their nature right

00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,319
so everyone needs to move files around

00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:13,179
needs to transform some data needs to

00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,469
convert things needs to I don't know run

00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:16,749
some regular expressions that kind of

00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:18,069
stuff so there are a bunch of tests that

00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:20,639
you can become quicker and that you can

00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:22,509
scale much better if you use CL ice also

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,429
multimedia okay this is questionable

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,860
many people do with like videos or

00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:28,839
front-end development you know I don't

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,619
use a text-based browser I do use you

00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:34,389
know Chrome it's fine

00:07:31,619 --> 00:07:36,459
so yeah Joo is a bloater but they're

00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:40,809
bloater for what we do not for every

00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:44,289
single task right so now I explained it

00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:45,429
so using cell eyes is actually about

00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:46,989
speaking the same language as your

00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:49,539
machine having more shared abstractions

00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:51,399
more precise vocabulary and making it

00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:53,169
things less magic so that you know

00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:55,149
what's happening behind the scenes right

00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:56,679
so that's my problem with IDs when you

00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:58,839
click buttons and they do too much and

00:07:56,679 --> 00:08:00,189
when something fails you like it's very

00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,949
hard to figure out what's happening

00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:04,389
so when you see lies you more in touch

00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,829
with what's actually happening you know

00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:08,050
what's behind her and you're speaking

00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:11,289
the same language you know why things

00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:15,550
are the way they are and what vocabulary

00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:18,669
is used so okay I don't know how much

00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:22,449
time I have okay I'll just keep going

00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:24,939
out well so how do I do it right so

00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:27,610
these are the tools I use so zosh Tmax

00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:30,729
and even this is like the most basic

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:34,089
starter pack you can have so start from

00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:36,069
a slash so I rush zosh is just a shell

00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,719
so it's just another program so you know

00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:40,180
in the same way that bash is a program

00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:43,240
or a sages program or fish is a program

00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:46,540
it's also thing an animal but like

00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:49,790
they're just ways of interacting with an

00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:52,040
operating system services so

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:53,570
basically it's very important to

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,830
differentiate these things what's the

00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,110
terminal what's the terminal emulator

00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,150
and what's the shell so a terminal is

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,190
the actual terminal the physical thing

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,370
the thing that people how can you set or

00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,810
you're not doing this and then there's a

00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,100
terminal emulator which emulates the

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,580
real thing that's why it's called an

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,650
emulator my case I use I turn I heard

00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,910
the Mac's native terminals quite good

00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:20,000
these days so by all means have a go

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:21,860
also and Z and swash is the shell so is

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,270
the program that is run within the

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,530
terminal emulator which provides you

00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:29,330
access to the operating system services

00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:31,220
so it looks something like this so

00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:34,490
there's a keyboard providing input to

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:37,430
your emulator which passes that to a TTY

00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:38,930
driver to the programs so I'm not going

00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,730
to go into streams now because I just

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:43,100
have two minutes

00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:46,250
but why do I do it well you can try

00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,970
using /bin slash sh and you can just

00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,190
feel the difference

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,750
so I quite like slosh auto-completion

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,620
features is very easy to navigate around

00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:58,490
very customizable lots of plugins is

00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:00,290
very very nice so for managing my /

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,440
configuration my plugins and stuff I

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,580
tend to use oh my gosh so again I'm

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,350
going to go too deep into this but

00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,420
basically just makes it very easy to get

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:11,240
started and to get your creation working

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:15,020
plain to your stuff on github just go

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:17,450
there you'll find lots of good info Tmax

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,800
which is a terminal which Flexer which

00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,830
is a fancy name for something that

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,650
divides the terminal into multiple panes

00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:26,120
so it looks kinda like this so it gives

00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,950
you the nice bottom bar in the end

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,550
allows you to persist sessions and

00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:33,440
organize the workflow more consistently

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,580
so to max work something like this so

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,140
you have a server which stores your

00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:38,930
sessions which means you can attach and

00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,370
detach whenever you want so when I go

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,660
home I have a session for the things I'm

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,480
working at home I have a session for the

00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:46,280
things I'm working at the office or I

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,540
for my team blog post and I'm solid

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,070
actually creating a session just for

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,200
that and have an environment and stuff

00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:54,950
inside a session you can have multiple

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,840
panes or tabs and inside paino tab you

00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:58,910
can have a window which is the actual

00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,540
thingy I'm not going to go into all

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,030
these plugins

00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,970
don't worry all these slides gonna be

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:07,280
online

00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:12,330
and now my favorite part him oh nice

00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:16,710
hey where are my fingers yeah and I

00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:18,540
school okay so this is my text editor of

00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,880
choice it's hard because it's different

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,940
and it's better because it's different

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,250
so yes the learning curve is a bit steep

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:28,380
but it's definitely worth it I might be

00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,900
biased to say it but it's just so nice I

00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,700
actually use any of em more these days

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,310
so new fame is just a conjugation

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,350
extension of them it has better support

00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:39,360
for synchronous tests and allows you to

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:41,070
try scripting Lua if you try to write

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,110
v-mail before you know how important

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:48,090
this is and now white matters so people

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,320
say like oh okay but actually most of

00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,240
the time are not writing code and that's

00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,770
absolutely correct but this is actually

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,170
not really about writing code faster

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,700
it's about writing thoughts faster so

00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,510
you don't have to keep them like in your

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,980
head and keep juggling and it's about

00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:04,230
adjusting juries so you don't have to do

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,280
many repetitive tasks because when

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,600
you're writing code when you have this

00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,920
idea and you want to put it down want to

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,390
put down as fast as possible so you

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,570
don't have to keep thinking about it and

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:15,540
as fast as like if you can put it down

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,830
faster you actually make your like make

00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,260
the code resemble your thoughts much

00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:21,300
better and it's also about economics

00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,560
right no one likes to keep moving their

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,970
heads in the mouse and it's just so much

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,830
more comfortable to have every single

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:29,220
thing that you want to do and the reach

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,330
of your fingers so how to become pro I'm

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,640
not gonna go deep into this because

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,900
there's many steps but vinter is really

00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,150
good so if you have a few spare minutes

00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:38,010
5 or 10 minutes just open vintage err is

00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:41,460
an interactive tutorial which allows you

00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:42,990
to add text file using mean comments do

00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,820
things the vim way learn the vanilla

00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,140
comments don't try to use too many

00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,870
plugins otherwise you're going to be

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:51,080
trapped into them or you might just end

00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,280
up with a bloated VMRC

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,530
always ask yourself if there's a better

00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:59,990
way to do this because in FEM 99% of the

00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:59,990
cases there is

00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:10,010
debatable okay okay so next thing resist

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,660
the urge to quit which is not very hard

00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,699
cuz no one how no house knows how to do

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:17,860
it anyway but I'm going to teach you

00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:20,720
today so how do you quit crazy just cute

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:21,949
right and when things don't work you

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,149
just because you know sometimes you're

00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:25,760
gonna do this and fume is gonna say like

00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:27,829
oh you cannot quit then you you have to

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,260
do choices you can quit and you can like

00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:31,639
you know you can scream with it like

00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,500
this and then it's gonna quit or you

00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,649
could just stick to it and learn because

00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,420
you don't know how to you how to quit

00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:40,360
the employments that I use so these are

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:43,220
the ones I consider to be essential

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,010
so no tree is quite good for visualizing

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,519
file structures and also it's very easy

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:52,070
to actually have a visual representation

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,660
of how your files are nested because

00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:55,190
sometimes if you just have text that

00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,300
might be a bit we just see and that's

00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,660
one of the places where visual

00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:02,870
representations come in handy fzf which

00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:05,120
is just a finder so fzf is just for you

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,430
to allow to allow each find files by

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,290
their names very quickly and match so if

00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:12,500
you write mark up this makes things very

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:15,319
easy and very quick IO which is not beer

00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:17,329
it's a synchronous link to an angel

00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:19,910
so it basically allows you to have

00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:21,350
different linking mechanisms running for

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,660
different languages whom have to style

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,339
one zillion plugins so if you do like

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,260
JavaScript you can just have es lint

00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:29,510
running true a lor preacher whenever

00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,980
it's a files and things like that new

00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,740
make which is what allows you to run

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,569
tasks synchronously and the biggest

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,290
advantage of any of them and also

00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:41,959
language specific plugins so you know

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,100
just if using go just is like it's

00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:44,959
forego if you use JavaScript just

00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,880
playing slow JavaScript a script and so

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,639
on there's also wonder I forgot to put

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,610
here which is you complete me so

00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:55,100
basically it's a plugin which ones like

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,870
language service which you can ask for

00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,850
suggestions and stuff for completion and

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,790
for getting permission both types and

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:04,250
the kind of stuff it's quite nice so

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:05,630
general tips and references be careful

00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,220
with your dot files you know make them

00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,569
pre put them on github share them with

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,449
other people because many times you

00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:13,040
discover better ways of doing things try

00:15:11,449 --> 00:15:16,220
to do more using less

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,440
don't use lots of plugins usually the

00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:20,089
programs that you already know have

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,220
options or different ways for you to do

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:24,889
things so just try to do more using less

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,870
learn one to get a time so these things

00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:29,209
take quite a lot of time to get used to

00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:32,420
you're not gonna you know go out here

00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:33,500
today and like learn everything automate

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,490
everything that you can't I think this

00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,160
one's pretty self-explanatory

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,569
do nothing scripts which are acquiring I

00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,730
said year so basically just create a

00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:42,259
script which gives you instructions

00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,579
printed instructions for what you need
