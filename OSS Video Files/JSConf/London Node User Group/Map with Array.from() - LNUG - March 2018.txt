so I sort of have to kind of small hot

00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:10,320
tips today the first one I'm just going

00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,420
to show because I want to use it in the

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,389
next bit so I'm just going to show you

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:19,949
it it's not really no things more like a

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:24,960
dev tools thing document query selector

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:29,580
all yeah in chrome dev tools you can use

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:33,270
dollar dollar and then brackets and then

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,730
your selector so image get all the image

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,190
type can everyone see this yeah just

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,320
about geometer I'm going to pull it up a

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:47,219
little bit more still got the brand in

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:49,469
there so you know so dollar dollar is an

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,829
alias for document query selector rule

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,120
which is pretty cool

00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:56,789
but that's sort of a side note and I

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,789
found out that you can do sort of an

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:03,899
extra thing with a raid up from so a

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,600
rate up from basically takes an iterable

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,830
as its first argument and creates an

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,860
array from it so you can give it like a

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:14,250
set which is really useful for getting

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,830
the unique values out of an array or for

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,350
example a node list which is what this

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,420
is I'm pointing at my screen view this

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,810
this is a node list

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,009
it is iterable but it's not an array

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,729
although it looks like it because it has

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:41,479
the squawk it's but you can do array dot

00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:45,180
from getting a little teaser there image

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:47,700
tag ground this is this is an actual

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,950
rate but it's not a node list so you can

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,420
map over this and you can filter and

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,880
things like that you can't do those

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:59,009
things on a node list but something I

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,119
found out was that with a rate up from

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,810
you can actually give it a second

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,759
dogging which is a function and it's

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:09,000
essentially a map function so when it

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,690
creates the array it also uses that

00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,440
function to not over the

00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:16,270
the elements so for example if you

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,830
wanted to get all the if you wanted to

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:24,880
get all the links in the way oh I'm

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,560
doing live coding right there's four

00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,880
hundred and fifty nine links on the FDA

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,480
homepage that's cool right

00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,770
[Music]

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:38,500
right so I've created an array and I

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:44,740
could do like dot map right

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:48,040
X I love X X dot H ref I think and it

00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:50,020
would give me all the links or I could

00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,530
instead of doing this I could just pass

00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:56,850
it back to pass that as the second

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,080
argument to our rate up from did do

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,060
hatre this is an arrow function for

00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,380
anyone that doesn't know sort of new new

00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,340
ish couple years that does the same

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,880
thing

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,260
I see give a function as the second

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,600
argument to write up from and it will

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,630
map over as it creates the array which a

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,590
little bit more performant I believe

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,760
certainly feel dealing with really big

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,580
raise

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,340
that's really there's your two things

00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:29,200
your dollar dollar document selectable

00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:31,330
kind of nice and that positive function

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,030
second I've already set it up set it

00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,920
again third time fourth time thought son

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:38,800
is that that's all I've got

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,860
I work at the FTE we're hiring if you

00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,460
want to chat to me afterwards please do

00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:47,199
thank you

00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:47,199
