Colourful paint dripping all over Harpa Concert and Conference Hall's outer walls, vandalism without consequences.

How we turned Harpa's giant led lit façade into an interactive collaborative artwork and what we learned. What kind of problems does it bring to open up a shared canvas for anyone to interact with?

hello welcome my name is Alton Hill and

00:00:05,629 --> 00:00:11,240
we have worked together on a few

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:15,240
interactive installations and yeah like

00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:19,439
was introduced we are the art - oh stop

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:23,039
Billy it's somewhat like our band name

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:31,080
or something yeah I mean search talking

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:34,440
English I'm gonna begin by telling you a

00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,410
little bit about myself I have a

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,530
bachelor's degree in computer science a

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,690
PS in CS or a degree in

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,399
counter-strike like I like to call it

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:50,489
and I work as a freelance audio and an

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:55,199
art programmer but also to my fair share

00:00:50,489 --> 00:01:00,449
of websites and whatnots my second job

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:02,820
is as a musician I compose music and I

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:05,040
also am in a band called seeker which

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,840
you should totally check out if you

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,450
haven't already and then I also

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,400
collaborate with other musicians

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:15,950
currently with all our art nerds on a

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:20,549
new generative robotic piano project

00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,689
some of my work is most notably the POC

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,700
Apollo

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:31,710
it's a generative music piece and it's

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:35,610
written in JavaScript it uses the photos

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:39,000
taking during the moon landings back in

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:43,229
the 60s and 70s as an input to a musical

00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,869
engine and creates a sort of soundscapes

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,570
for the images so you can flick through

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:51,329
the images in a random order and listen

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:56,250
to ambient music that is being generated

00:01:51,329 --> 00:02:00,710
in the browser and another project is

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,000
the infinite string quartet which is

00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:05,549
modular string quartet written by my

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,500
brother Wilbur Alto who is a composer

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:12,150
and we created like a interactive

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,530
version of it that runs in the browser

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,440
and you can

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,270
selects modules or clips from the string

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,370
quartet and arrange them in a 3d space

00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:23,540
around you and create your very own

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:26,940
version you can play for hours and

00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:32,040
creating creepy string quartet music

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:34,380
with this and yet then the project I'm

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,090
working on with only here we are

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:42,000
contemplating how to make it sound more

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:45,320
like a flower now artists and yeah there

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,320
is being released very soon

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,390
I am foolish I am a merely a developer I

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,380
also have a ph degree but no joke about

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:58,200
it I work for the local contracting

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,330
company called Kirk and I'm also going

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,010
to use the opportunity to talk about

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:06,620
some of my projects since I have this

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:10,709
platform one recent one I did this is a

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,750
weakened Chrome extension whoo so it

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,150
basically takes all non-vegan words

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:19,830
meaty words and replace them here we

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:27,080
have bacon and that gets replaced to

00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:30,209
Kermit's wife of 40 years then recently

00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,640
just earlier this month we did me and

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:37,290
Hunter we did another heart pop project

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:40,320
using the facade outside this was done

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:43,709
for the foundation go rat and this

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:47,070
basically a giant heart projected over a

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:51,720
deck where the input is users heart beat

00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:55,200
heart rate yeah so let's talk about

00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,400
paint splatter it's an interactive

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,450
installation where you can participate

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,570
on your phone and the simplest way to

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:06,930
describe it is that it's a giant shared

00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:10,140
digital canvas made out of Harper's huge

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,750
led facade and anyone with access to

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,870
Internet and a smart device or a

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,780
computer can interact with this canvas

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,850
by splashing virtual paint on it which

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:24,320
then trips straight down or sideways

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,849
depending on wind direction and force

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,580
take it away third

00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:31,590
so when you're creating interactive art

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:35,129
it's really important that the user

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:37,050
input is simple and rewarding in this

00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:40,199
piece we utilize the fact that most

00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:44,009
people like vandalizing especially

00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:46,879
without many consequences so anonymously

00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:49,919
splashing paint on Iceland's most

00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:53,729
expensive building seemed like a pretty

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,879
rewarding and simple way to be an outlet

00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:59,009
for that kind of behavior for the first

00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,830
few days we had thousands of visits both

00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:04,550
from people all over the world and some

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:08,069
people standing out sight and the storm

00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:10,199
splashing for hours the reason why it

00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:12,539
became so popular is how interactivities

00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,909
the fact that by pressing a small area

00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:17,099
on your phone results in a giant blob

00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:18,840
visible to all participants from all

00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:22,229
over the world it's the key to making

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,569
this all work it's also pretty visibly

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:26,819
pleasing on the props of a well-defined

00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:29,460
look and the user input is greatly

00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,620
limited this way we could avoid making

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,800
this look like a giant shared Microsoft

00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,990
Paint document we could also avoid

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:44,240
mankind's most drawn figure on any

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:49,139
shared platform the phallic symbol and

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,960
how we pissed this thing the design

00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:53,879
process was very straightforward it just

00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:58,800
started with conceptual sketches on

00:05:53,879 --> 00:06:01,319
paper like all good ideas start and the

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,569
whole concept was then thoroughly

00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,479
determined before we started coding

00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:09,330
anything so that helped us really keep

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:15,270
things in scope and we did one thing

00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:20,490
well I believe next step was doing some

00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:26,370
web mock-ups just to get our gist of how

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:32,449
the animation would look like and I'm

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:32,449
going to show you a code pan I did here

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:44,259
no this is this is my home this is where

00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:48,130
I lived I used to keep this on my screen

00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:53,300
yeah here this here's the first like

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:56,720
some how crappy interactive and with

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,240
input parameters what would leak yeah

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,630
just to get our sense of the rendering

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,120
and and main obstacles this took like 30

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:09,460
minutes to do so and and it was so good

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,460
to have this with the project proposal

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:18,500
okay back to the presentation the

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,900
biggest unknown factor in the whole

00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,150
project was how to render stuff on the

00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,400
light facade of harpa but fortunately it

00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:29,270
had been done before so it just got

00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:33,530
access to some node.js rendering server

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:37,180
code written by Owen Hindley which we

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:42,080
could fork and adapt to our tests and

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:44,389
the networking part was also pretty

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,289
straightforward we just used socket IO

00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:51,080
and set up a small up on an Heroku

00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:54,050
instance that handles all the events to

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,599
and from users like you press and make a

00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,780
plop and it sense the event to all

00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:02,870
connected participants and it also

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:06,020
contains some rudimentary game logic and

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:12,139
input sanitizing and even throttling

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:16,180
like you would to so yeah when we said

00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:18,470
hola we faced some real-world problems

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:20,630
since the render server had to be

00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,599
located in the basement with the rest of

00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:27,500
the lab controllers that meant we had to

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:30,500
go up and down up and down endlessly in

00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:34,430
our feedback loop and this is a video of

00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:37,399
one of those times but it was a great

00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:40,430
physical exercise good contrast and we

00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:43,610
also got the lost few times like there

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,970
are thousands of it's half price like

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,510
Hogwarts School

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,830
it's almost always changing and I think

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,280
there are a lot of people like stuck

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,230
down there

00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:58,230
yeah probably is like a small population

00:08:52,230 --> 00:09:00,840
by now yeah and since this was already

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:04,800
online we wanted to allow more people to

00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:07,980
participate so we decided to set up a

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,960
live stream and with a very limited

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,410
budget to be part of the phone and we

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:17,210
kind of duct taped it to the ceiling of

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:19,380
the hotel lobby next across from ARPA

00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:21,660
this worked out great we got a lot of

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,700
traction on at it but pretty soon people

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,020
started complaining about the tourist

00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:29,690
bus that was always blocking the view

00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:32,520
like every half hour or so and also the

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:34,290
staff at the hotel they weren't that

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,760
pleased through this unidentified phone

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:39,930
that at some point was maybe possibly

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,180
broadcasting their conversations through

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:47,610
the internet and we also encountered

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,430
some problems with deploying the renter

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:53,130
server here in Harper because we had to

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,020
connect our computer to six unmarked

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:57,750
Ethernet cables through a selection of

00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:01,380
routers and adapters which had to be in

00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:03,720
done in correct order for it to work it

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,510
was most definitely not a very atomic

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,600
deployment process and first almost like

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:13,860
programming the ENIAC or or making punch

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,390
card programs so yes we had already we

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:22,050
had also become like our small TV

00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:24,960
station yes we had to fulfill our duties

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:27,930
as a 24/7 live TV station

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:31,320
did you already mention the the main

00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,680
complaint from the reddit users what's

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,170
that

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,880
so there was a tourist I saw her purse

00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:43,080
yeah you're not even listening to me and

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:48,630
then we got spammed it was bound to

00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:51,420
happen somebody found a way to

00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:54,710
circumvent the rate-limiting Oh No and

00:10:51,420 --> 00:11:00,010
why am I even telling you this all

00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:06,370
programmers sent and JavaScript

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:07,600
and then we got like properly hacked now

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,740
this is actually a very funny story

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,780
because somebody found a way to override

00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:17,830
our color scheme we had like a very

00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:20,440
limited color scheme you could not draw

00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:22,990
black for instance so you could not like

00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,400
clear the screen or or or something like

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,790
that but somebody found a way to

00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:31,480
override it and was suddenly able to

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:33,250
draw arbitrary buffers of images by just

00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,380
swatting paint very fast with the for

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,570
loop and we knew this was a possibility

00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:41,110
from the start but didn't have the

00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:43,770
resources to prevent it and except for

00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:47,310
some basic rate limiting and

00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:51,430
exponentially increasing pack of periods

00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:57,280
but this was actually a very fun

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:59,860
challenge and war was upon us Iceland is

00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:03,040
very small and the company communities

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,880
here are even smaller and the proof for

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:10,030
that is that I just got on messenger and

00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,190
guessed who the hacker was and this was

00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:15,880
not a penny before the hacker started

00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,420
writing his name on the facade and I was

00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,610
right

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,220
the hacker was my former computer game

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,970
programming teacher at the University

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:27,670
and he is also a programmer at CCP and

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:30,450
the only person in Iceland I knew that

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:35,560
would be able to do such a thing and

00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:38,290
invest the time to do it properly so we

00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,390
could immediately recognize his way of

00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,300
doing the hacking because it was very

00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:45,670
professionally done we approached him

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,590
and after a few hours of negotiations he

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:50,050
surrendered and told us all about how he

00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:53,740
did it and he even sent us all the code

00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:58,750
and a lot of comments on our code which

00:12:53,740 --> 00:13:00,850
was very hard to read so he was able to

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:03,460
like draw arbitrary buffers with paint

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:07,260
and this is from his coat various like

00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:10,650
neatly organized his name in a proper

00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,650
two-dimensional array

00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:16,910
he wrote the whole rendering service

00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:19,730
that was running on his computer that's

00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:23,209
pumped our server with paint blob events

00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:26,660
and enabled him to do this so he was

00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:29,180
like rendering on a rendering server on

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:34,370
a rendering server because we all like

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:37,939
rendering servers right but we made it

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:41,930
harder for him we just increased the

00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:45,980
race rate limiting a bit and added some

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:48,529
extra throttling and without degrading

00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:53,839
the experience of the normal non

00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:59,139
spamming user and this fight was ongoing

00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:02,959
throughout the duration of the display

00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:08,059
he also was able to avoid because the

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:11,230
paint leaks and if you draw something it

00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:14,389
won't stay there forever because it gets

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:17,300
the paint leaks and somebody else paints

00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:22,939
over it but he added the skewing factor

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:26,149
he could tune to his taste too yet to be

00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:34,930
able to create like very straight images

00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:39,019
and then we added random noise to it to

00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:43,519
decrease the resolution of what this

00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:45,620
hacker was able to draw and this is

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,000
still in the code you see it if you if

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:53,230
you press the half power if you if you

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,480
splat paint you can see that it

00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,670
dominates enter like yeah it doesn't

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:04,670
come exactly in the center of where you

00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:06,259
clicked and also it's totally on concept

00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:11,410
because it's plotting paint like with

00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:11,410
with some paint plot that's very

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,220
unprecedent

00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:21,889
if you spend some time in Iceland you

00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,470
quickly learn that the weather here is

00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:26,209
quite unpredictable

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,390
and when we did this the first time

00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:31,430
which was in 2016 there was basically a

00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:35,120
crazy storm throughout the whole time it

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:36,770
was up and that was a great way to show

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,050
off the feature that you know we were

00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:43,910
using the wind force and wind direction

00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:45,440
to to render so we just looked on the

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,320
bright side there weren't a lot of

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,220
people like outside trying a lot more

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,399
people on the Internet

00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:55,100
but the year after we set it up again

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,130
and the weather was way better

00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:01,690
just nice weather and almost no wind at

00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:03,830
all which proved problematic because

00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:07,070
every time there was absolutely no wind

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,720
our renters are requests because we were

00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:13,399
somewhere in our calculations we were

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:16,040
tape dividing by a zero and for the

00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:18,080
first time this happened me and doctor

00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,940
we were gonna be on live television and

00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,450
this happened like five minutes before

00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:26,839
that happened and as you can see in this

00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:28,490
picture here's the mayor in 2016 lots of

00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:32,570
wind you can see his hair it's it's

00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:35,360
crazy and 2017 this is like a frozen

00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:36,709
under server absolutely no end and me

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,130
and alt or somewhere in the back having

00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:42,230
a panic attack but we somehow got

00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,120
through the interview with like

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,880
demonstrating how this worked without it

00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,730
actually working at all and nobody

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:54,680
seemed to notice which is a pretty good

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:58,820
thing yes we learnt a few lessons

00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:02,170
through this whole process first being

00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:05,000
that we should avoid at any means any

00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:09,140
ribbon-cutting ceremonies by politicians

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,350
with like huge scissors especially when

00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,910
it's on live television secondly you

00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:16,339
should always allow for the weather even

00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,230
when you're writing code even if it has

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,020
nothing to do with well as we should you

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,750
should do it especially here in Iceland

00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,569
and it's always fun when your work is

00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:30,920
worth hacking at least when it's not

00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:35,790
done maliciously and yeah while it well

00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:38,640
it's entertaining this

00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:41,850
Pease revolves around the concept of

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,930
vandalism and that everybody gets their

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:48,000
say everybody can participate so

00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:52,410
programmers with the programming skills

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,720
they can of course participate but if

00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,960
you intend to do so please behave

00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:05,820
yourselves we don't have the money to

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:10,560
fight you so thank you so much for

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:18,470
listening and the piece is accessible at

00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:23,750
paint j/s Khan is or just paint dot is

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:26,970
it's been a pleasure talking here and we

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:35,790
would like to know if any of you had any

00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:41,270
questions we are happy to answer yeah

00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:41,270
the question there yeah

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,710
the insights of how many users and how

00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:58,080
many user apps at the same time have

00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:59,250
used this the night when it went live on

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,880
reddit

00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:05,070
we got like I think 7,000 hits over a

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,420
short period of time and that was after

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:11,400
we set up the live streaming cam so even

00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,740
if you were abroad you could splat paint

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,780
and see a live stream of it actually

00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:21,810
happening yeah for some reason that

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:24,660
wasn't like a huge spike at one point it

00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:27,420
was like pretty even I don't know why

00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:30,180
yeah and the log file from the server

00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:36,810
was around 300 megabytes if that tells

00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:52,680
you anything any more questions

00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:55,920
oh yeah yeah we did one a couple of

00:19:52,680 --> 00:20:00,930
weeks ago which we told you about

00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:04,620
briefly it saw we connected a heart rate

00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:07,800
sensor to heart animation on front of

00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:10,260
Harper so you could come up to the

00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:13,680
second floor and make it sense your

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:19,580
heartbeat and then rayful's would form

00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:19,580
that planted nicely on the light facade

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:28,190
yeah and we allowed for zero but no one

00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,190
had zero heart rate

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:43,850
sorry no I was I was thinking on the

00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:45,710
webcam was taken down because the hotel

00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:48,499
manager thought we were spying on some

00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:51,350
guests yeah hotel and our friend needed

00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:56,509
this phone back as well yeah poor guy

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:59,350
did you want to like follow us we'll

00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:59,350
take care of it

00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:09,649
just ask away if you have any questions

00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:13,369
I think that's what what is it what is

00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:16,519
the timeout is like two seconds four

00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:20,809
seconds eight seconds what okay

00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:23,210
there's a line that silly TCP joke sorry

00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:23,480
I'm very sorry thank you so much for

00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:30,579
listening
