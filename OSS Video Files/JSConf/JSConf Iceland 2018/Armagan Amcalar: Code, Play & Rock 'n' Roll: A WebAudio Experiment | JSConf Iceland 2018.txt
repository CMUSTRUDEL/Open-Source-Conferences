The speaker hits the “stage” with a guitar, playing memorable rock tunes using a web browser as an amplifier. This talk is about pushing the limits of what a web browser can do, and goes over pedalboard.js, an open source JavaScript framework for building real-time guitar effects in the browser.

Demonstrating both code and music, talking a little bit about math and signal processing, the speaker paints a picture of the current state of the web and how capable it is as a platform. He then goes on to present a way to make a collaborative music session using pedalboard.js over WebRTC, so people can play along with friends in real-time even if they are miles away.
