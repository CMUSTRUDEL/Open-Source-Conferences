Can you write a program to create art? Code can create procedural content for games, but it can also create 3D printable objects, patterns for fabric, or Twitterbots that post code-created comic strips. Kate has produced all of these and more (and is known for outreach and education about generativity) and will demonstrate practical techniques behind generating emergent surprising and artistic worlds with Javascript, Canvas, and SVG.

yeah so I'm galaxy Kate you can find me

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,049
at pretty much anything at galaxy Kate's

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:10,740
a comb I've got a total dumpster fire of

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,750
a github repo also at galaxy Kate the

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,340
slides for this talk are going to be I'm

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,529
gonna go pretty fast so the slides for

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,350
this talk are at Galaxy heat comm slash

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,550
PDFs I'll show a lot of random apps that

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,590
I've made and those are at galaxy

00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,390
kake-dot-com such apps and you can just

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,330
find a bunch of stuff of mine at galaxy

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,670
Kade calm so a little bit about me I did

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,430
five years on spore in Sim City if you

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,850
ever played Spore I did the planets I'm

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,149
now six years into a PhD in generative

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,469
games and creativity tools of all types

00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:44,460
this is at the expressive intelligence

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,660
studio at UC set UC Santa Cruz also can

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,370
I make a pitch to the conference

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,780
organizers to have decaf because I had

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,140
caffeinated this morning and we're all

00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,980
gonna be the worst for it

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,199
life is hard for the chemically

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,149
sensitive I've done some contracting on

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,489
chatbots for the Google home and I

00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,079
released that open source as the battery

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:02,670
finite state machine platform if any of

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,439
y'all saw the really excellent finite

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:06,360
state machine talk clearly this morning

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,010
here's another take on it yeah I made

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,960
tracery a language for generative BOTS

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,990
that currently runs about six thousand

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,479
active BOTS which is pretty exciting and

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,369
yeah I make generative art BOTS games

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,750
art tools and more and I like to teach

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:22,259
other people how to do it so you know

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,210
here's a projected head that I've done I

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,420
really like the leap motion and leap

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:28,829
motion works I've done procedural dance

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,100
generation

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,780
here are some generated butterflies this

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,270
is a little generated train travel

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,710
through Europe game and then this is

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:43,200
just some flowers doing attractive

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:44,880
things yeah so my talk today is about

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,960
generative art but like why should I

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,850
bring this to a JavaScript conference

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,710
it's because a lot of my favorite

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:51,689
generative art pieces both my own and of

00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,759
others they're interactive there are

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,770
things that people can touch and play

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,750
with and this is true of a lot of

00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,670
interesting generative stuff we've we've

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,920
all worked with generative art if you've

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,979
used a pottery wheel it sort of

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,270
mechanically assisted creativity

00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:08,700
everything from spire graphs to mitting

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,599
can kind of fall into this category you

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:14,480
may have feelings when you see this

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,859
if denied we use kid pecks as a kid now

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,209
not so many people and what if it was an

00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:19,609
American thing but this is like a

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:22,909
generative creativity tool from the very

00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:25,180
late 80s that got me started on this but

00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:27,499
you can generate pretty much anything

00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,180
I've made tools for people but I've also

00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:31,189
gotten to see a lot of people making

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:33,950
interesting things everything from music

00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:38,359
to poetry Industrial Design generative

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,950
cocktail recipes so these are the top

00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:41,780
one is a poet there's a pottery

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,419
generator there's a necklace generator

00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,349
and a music generator at the bottom but

00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:46,639
you can generate things like

00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:47,959
tensegrities architecture which is a

00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,810
form of architecture that couldn't exist

00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,709
before computers could help us generate

00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,239
it this is some work by a group called

00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:59,269
nervous system and they do generative

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,709
dresses and generative necklaces but

00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:02,120
these are all interactive prototypes you

00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:03,680
can actually change how the necklace

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:07,699
looks before you get it 3d printed and

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,730
sent to you you can generate here we go

00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:12,739
these are two projects by NASA to do

00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,560
procedurally generated stuff with

00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:17,750
genetic algorithms so if you represent a

00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,599
radio antenna as a bent piece of metal

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,389
you can represent that as a string of

00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:24,680
DNA for each radio antenna decide how

00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:26,389
well it's going to perform how the

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,099
successful ones have lots of babies and

00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:30,709
those babies have babies and are judged

00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:32,000
and they got their best-ever radio

00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:33,139
antenna off of that which looks like a

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,479
BET paper clip but it's a very

00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:37,009
specifically bent paper clip later on

00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,419
they use that same method to figure out

00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:40,400
how to make a tensegrities ball walk

00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:43,159
this is something that no human could

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,409
program but it was you know the the ball

00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,879
that wobbled the best got to have many

00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:48,109
babies and then it's babies had babies

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,790
and eventually you get something that's

00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:55,459
sort of lurches here is a hot rod that

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:56,900
is procedurally generated the chassis is

00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:59,900
something that no human would design but

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,159
a machine could design it there's tools

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,040
like grasshopper 3d that make

00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,479
interesting pair of metric models you

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,060
can kind of 3d print these out in

00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:09,259
interesting ways there's a woman named

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,439
Bathsheba Grossman who's actually in

00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:13,759
Santa Cruz where I am he does

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,949
mathematical 3d generated models that

00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,370
are 3d printed out sometimes quite large

00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:20,690
as art pieces you can generate things

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,430
with particles so these are strange

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,639
attractors which are imaginary swarms of

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:27,520
particles orbiting

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,830
strange way some sort of gravitational

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,659
body and then you can map their trails

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,969
on to 3d geometry and print those out

00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:35,710
you can print things using grammars so

00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:37,659
the grammars are a way of recursively

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,090
sticking objects to other objects so

00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:42,069
this is a bot that rolls Thingiverse

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,569
which is a 3d printing sight grabs

00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:46,120
objects glues them together and then

00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:49,389
reuploads them as art the community is

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,090
very confused as to whether that's a

00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:54,370
good thing or a bad thing I use a lot of

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,930
parametric particle based generations so

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,650
these are fabric generators that I've

00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:02,169
made and these are all in canvas

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:05,139
processing your canvas some of them are

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:08,110
SVG oh I did put little symbols of the

00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:10,569
technology that I used for all the ones

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,889
that are mine I uploaded these to a

00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:15,099
website and you can now buy them as

00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:19,150
t-shirts I made a version of this that

00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:21,039
generates the fabric patterns and then

00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,870
prints it out on spoon flour so I'm

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,409
currently wearing a Java Script made

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:30,909
skirt one of the swags I have our Java

00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:33,520
Script made scarves so yeah there's that

00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:34,990
skirt you know for you can of course

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,120
generate all sorts of things you can

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:42,189
generate animations games textures all

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,089
sorts of things for games so here's one

00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:47,020
of the creatures that I made when I

00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:48,610
worked on spore but then the the skins

00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,770
of the creatures you have this 3d model

00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,419
and you want a texture in some way you

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,919
can procedurally unwrap that creature

00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,029
even if it's a dynamic creature that the

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,919
user is made that you've never seen

00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:59,289
before you can unwrap it into you this

00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:00,580
sort of skin here and then the way we

00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:02,020
texture these creatures was actually

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,639
with particles where if you imagine you

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,520
have a white horse but you want a zebra

00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,710
you spawn black paintballs on top of it

00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,240
drop them on top of the horse they stick

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,560
to the back of it they roll down getting

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,360
smaller and smaller as they go and you

00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,300
get this sort of stripe pattern but then

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,560
if you put like a VW minibus or any sort

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,639
of object underneath that and run the

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,860
same script you'll get something that

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,449
has like zebra stripes even though you

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,149
didn't know you wanted the universe

00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:26,500
stripes before there's lots of video

00:06:25,149 --> 00:06:28,689
games that do procedural content

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:30,060
generation I don't think any of these

00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:34,120
are in JavaScript I think they're on

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:36,129
Java or Java like s-- but yeah these all

00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,380
do procedurally generated levels so you

00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:40,300
can kind of if you have a game Java

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:43,090
you can make infinite levels to run

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,240
through you can generate stories so this

00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:49,060
is minecraft not minecraft sorry Dwarf

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,230
Fortress which simulates years and years

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:56,440
of geology sociology ecology to simulate

00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:57,670
3000 like 10000 years of dwarvish

00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,480
history and then it puts you in the

00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:01,870
middle of it you can kind of

00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,950
procedurally excavate as gameplay the

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,590
history of this world

00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:10,210
you can even generate game rules so this

00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:12,270
is work out of I believe NYU that

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,250
generates an adventure game dynamically

00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:17,650
this one is generated game levels this

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,380
is a project called refraction and it

00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,180
uses procedural generation not just to

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,740
design the levels but actually verify

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,620
that the levels are unbreakable by

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,480
players and then you can design games

00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:32,190
themselves this is Yahveh this was also

00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:34,540
a genetic algorithm that could design

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,860
systems of rules kind of like go where

00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,150
it's like one piece can move like this

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,400
and you capture another piece like this

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:40,720
and the game board looks like this

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400
generated thousands of those generated

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,990
the players for them have the players

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,160
play the games and then pick the ones

00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,380
that the players made the most

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:49,330
interesting decisions and then they

00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:51,730
produce that game gave it a generative

00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,400
name and sell it in stores so you can

00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:56,380
generate pretty much anything a common

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,540
phrase or a common sort of theme with

00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:59,770
PCG talks is often oh wow

00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,530
you can save so much time and money

00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,940
generating things and you don't have to

00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,540
hire artists anymore won't that be great

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:11,970
this actually doesn't work that great

00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:14,230
you won't get robot artists but instead

00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,360
you can have art that's made from user

00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,950
input so you can have like in Spore we

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,900
had the users creating these complex

00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:23,290
creatures and then we could dynamically

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:25,360
like on a millisecond level skin them

00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,590
texture that animate them and so the

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,290
player just feels like they're making

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,910
like magical clay and that's something

00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:32,560
that no you can never have an artist

00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,360
sitting there modeling those you know

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,440
millisecond by millisecond a second you

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,440
can have art that the computer and the

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,849
users make together and you can have art

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,800
that just goes on forever and ever and

00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,479
ever I make a lot of Twitter BOTS and

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,010
the Twitter bots if you set a Twitter

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,260
bot to posting and the service never

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:51,070
goes down it'll just keep producing

00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,820
content every n seconds you can even

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,560
have an arts

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,600
bass that you can explore mathematically

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,260
I won't go too far into this but these

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,960
bots made scarves are actually made with

00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,700
roughly a hundred sliders from zero to

00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,250
one so each one has kind of a different

00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,260
position of sliders you can imagine that

00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:10,660
those are vectors in a tent in a hundred

00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:12,340
dimensional space and so if I have this

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,660
scarf over here in this scarf over here

00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,360
I can mathematically say what is this

00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,610
scarf directly in the middle of those so

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:23,110
you can do interesting like interactions

00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:25,690
with that and yeah ways to interact with

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:27,070
a generator there's a lot of different

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,410
ways these are a couple of bots that are

00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:32,650
running on my actually the sorting hat

00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,030
bot isn't running on my technology but

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,950
these are bots that respond to people

00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,800
that add them on Twitter so what do you

00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:41,650
do with in with a JavaScript generator

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,150
well you can have it talk to people so

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:46,630
the one at the bottom left is like my

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,950
bad comic generator and if you add it it

00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,620
will make a little comic and say hey I

00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,090
made you this done since and Dragons is

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:56,020
an IKEA theme done just in the Dragons

00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:57,870
bot and you can tweet at it to have a

00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,890
little Dungeons and Dragons adventure

00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,240
there's lots of other really interesting

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,760
ways to interact with them everything

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,030
from you know I'm going to use my camera

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,590
like my can't like my face is input so

00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,380
the one on the bottom right is Apple the

00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,790
one on the bottom left is me I'm doing a

00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,740
particle simulation that kind of draws

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,360
these interesting rainbow things this

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,370
from interaction is really interesting

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,730
because you get people kind of having

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,350
this mask that moves and they start to

00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,580
move their heads and body is in really

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,050
interesting way so if you've ever

00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,050
studied you'd like masks or dance or

00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,510
costume theory you can get people to

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:34,300
move differently when you generate stuff

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:36,970
around them the one on the top left is

00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,080
somebody who used tracery to generate

00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:44,400
code and then that code ran through a

00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,690
dynamic Creator of texture and of

00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,300
animation and sound and they use this to

00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,950
like do a rave in London

00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,570
the one in the upper right is like kind

00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,100
of you have a gesture so the user has

00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,510
made some sort of gesture and you're

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,460
doing something with that gesture so

00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,480
that one actually is the one in the top

00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,850
right and bottom left are both running

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,370
in JavaScript so the one on the top

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,600
right is this is a commission from a 3d

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,649
printing company and they wanted

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,999
something so it's that

00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:09,009
anybody could draw a pennant that could

00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,540
be 3d printed out so this is basically

00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:12,970
like if you take one thing away from

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:16,089
this talk it's that symmetry is like the

00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,189
MSG of generative art if you have

00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:22,029
something bad just put symmetry on it

00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:23,379
and suddenly it looks a lot better so

00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:25,929
yeah you can generate anything like

00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:27,279
geometry sound texture texts recipes you

00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:28,990
can use it for any reason you can make

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,759
generators so I know a lot of the people

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:33,879
in this room or like at this conference

00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:36,879
might be like doing very fairly serious

00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:39,550
like div pushing for large enterprise

00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,350
solutions but you can also just go home

00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,889
and make a Twitter bot in like five

00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,420
minutes

00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:44,679
you can make something for an arts

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,379
festival you can make something to amuse

00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:49,959
yourself you can make something that has

00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:52,360
a political aim or you can do it for fun

00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,399
or for fashion but yeah so how do you do

00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,040
it so second half of this talk let's

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,990
talk about making a generator these are

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,990
two art BOTS the one on the left is from

00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,639
the 1700s and it uses cams to

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,740
mechanically draw images it's actually

00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:07,480
programmable where you can like set the

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,970
cogs in certain ways that it like writes

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,589
text the one on the right is the

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,749
watercolor bought from evil mad

00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:15,939
scientist labs where you draw in a

00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:20,230
window and then it like has the robot

00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:23,949
draw it for you with watercolors so yeah

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,179
these are two different things there's a

00:12:23,949 --> 00:12:26,589
phrase we used to use on Spore which is

00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:29,610
called an artist in a box so you're

00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:31,839
making your generator is trying to be

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,370
like trying to have the mind of an

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,379
artist but you're putting it in a box

00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,639
and sending see user whether or not you

00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,439
know on Spore that was actually a shiny

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,939
plastic disc but now you know you're

00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:43,540
creating something that's gonna run on a

00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:45,819
server so the idea is kind of what are

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,220
the virtues of your artist this depends

00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:50,110
on what you're making this talk is

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,069
always hard to give because I as I've

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,689
just said you can make pretty much

00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:54,699
anything so what does it mean to be a

00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:56,290
good architect what does it mean to be a

00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:58,689
good storyteller on Twitter what does it

00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,579
mean to like be good at having a

00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:02,079
conversation with somebody so you

00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:03,699
basically once you figure out those

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,189
constraints about what must and must not

00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:08,379
happen and use those to build your

00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:09,459
generator I have more about that in this

00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:11,499
blog post so you want to build a

00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:14,949
generator so yeah how do we actually

00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:17,199
build it so I have this thought I've

00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:20,090
built probably at least a hundred

00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:21,440
various art generators of various

00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,900
and out of all this I've realized that

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,450
generativity is a pipeline so up here

00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,560
are two fairly odd projects these are

00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,000
not mine

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,010
but they're both out of Design Studios

00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,260
in Europe the well and they're both

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,880
taking brain waves and turning them into

00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,740
furniture so you start with brain waves

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,930
and you're going to furniture and they

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,450
take very different paths to this so

00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:43,700
what the one on the left you are put

00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:46,160
under an MRI scanner or a brain wave

00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,890
scanner of some sort and told to think

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:54,140
about different kinds of furniture

00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:56,540
orange blue solid like not solid round

00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:57,830
sharp and it measures your brain waves

00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,390
and then it like generates a piece of

00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,560
furniture based on that and they've made

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:04,640
that guy that piece of furniture and he

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,410
hates it and so it's art the one on the

00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,140
right is it actually measures your brain

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,580
waves as the waves and then it stacks up

00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,600
those waves and makes a piece of

00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,370
furniture out of it but you're supposed

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,570
to think of the world weird comfortable

00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:19,670
as it does so like two inputs two very

00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,010
like two inputs to outputs that are the

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:25,010
same but the paths through them are very

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,950
different so yeah you have some inputs

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,270
and some outputs I made so I make a lot

00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,340
of free tools and I open sourced them

00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,500
all this is the deck of cards that I

00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,930
made to help people think through how to

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,300
make generators and they're called the

00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:40,010
General Munoz and you can print them out

00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:42,830
I have some decks of cards with me but I

00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:45,830
actually they're already promised to

00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,960
people but ask me tomorrow we show you

00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,490
one and the idea is you have some inputs

00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,640
so the ones with the blue stripe at the

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:54,710
top are inputs so here's the Kinect and

00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,360
this is basically the pipeline of data

00:14:54,710 --> 00:15:00,110
like you can never turn data into other

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:03,050
data without like putting an algorithm

00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:04,850
on it so this was why is it really hard

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:07,640
to design for the leap motion versus

00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,290
like the DDR pad and a lot of video

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,260
games take events and States as their

00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,720
input so like the sort of little beads

00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,250
on a string are events and States so a

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,950
gamepad will create events in states

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:21,140
like I'm holding down a trigger or I'm

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:22,760
pressing a button and games are really

00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,320
good at taking those as inputs so if I

00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,960
have a gamepad I can make a game no

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,490
problem if I have a like rock band

00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,960
guitar that's producing events in States

00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,960
and oh boy I can totally make a game out

00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:36,410
of that if I have a Kinect it's actually

00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:38,930
like a mesh of vertices so like there's

00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:40,610
a bunch of vertices sort of floating in

00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:43,130
space well how am I going to convert

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:44,930
those into you button presses that my

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,310
videogame needs well you kind of have to

00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:48,980
have the detect gestures one so it's

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,709
like okay I'm gonna turn this set of

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,029
vector data into press button a and I'm

00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:56,209
gonna turn this set of vector data into

00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:58,339
press button maybe I wanted to do a

00:15:56,209 --> 00:16:00,830
project that had kind of a different

00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:02,089
approach to that so this is a project I

00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,660
did called idle hands for an Arts

00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:04,670
Festival

00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,279
this takes sleep motion data which is

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,200
vector data and then runs a Voronoi

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,300
algorithm on it which takes vector data

00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,060
and turns it into triangles and that was

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,279
pretty much all I did this had my best

00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,779
ever review which was from somebody who

00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:20,540
was fairly chemically altered he thought

00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:21,980
his hands were stuck in the screen not

00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:24,770
in a bad way just in a way that he had

00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:27,140
to like sit with for a while so this is

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,550
kind of the general knows these are two

00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:32,060
different ways of documented on Jenna

00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:33,830
Rama knows but yeah like basically you

00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,149
get the particle data you run it for one

00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,649
hour you diagram you triangulate the

00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:39,410
regions you draw the polygons and you

00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:41,270
projected on a screen so this is kind of

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,880
ways to think of how data wants to

00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,100
transform into other data so yeah it's

00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,480
kind of a pipeline but I want to show

00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,180
you the Lego bricks that you're going to

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:53,540
use in the pipeline this is basically

00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,740
the like tools you can use section if

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,170
you've ever wanted to generate something

00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,580
and these are kind of the big ones that

00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,830
they fall into

00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,420
so there's grammars which is one of my

00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:04,579
favorites this is like you're making

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,929
things out of other things I have this

00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:08,209
language called tracery that I made

00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:10,850
which is basically like writing in JSON

00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:12,470
these recruits recursive recipes because

00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:14,480
it's JSON which is fairly safe somebody

00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,300
actually made a node bot or like a node

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,250
service that host these JSON files and

00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,420
post them to Twitter periodically this

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,490
is the one that's currently running six

00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,319
thousand BOTS this is one the earliest

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,760
ones is hipster cocktails and you can

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,520
kind of see the recipe for making a

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:32,990
hipster cocktail you know it's got a

00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:35,420
name it's got you know combine some

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:41,110
liquid with some other liquid put in

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:43,100
something and maybe make like yeah

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,450
somebody also figured out that because

00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,370
it's generated text

00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:50,059
what's a kind of recursive text

00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:52,130
SVG HTML and so because I like fun

00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:53,390
JavaScript things I just been learning

00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:57,080
JavaScript at that point and my online

00:17:53,390 --> 00:18:01,130
editor had used HTML in jQuery to fill

00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,570
in my divs instead of txt text and so

00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:04,610
everything you put in would be parsed as

00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:06,080
actual HTML and so if somebody you

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,260
figured out that you could do SVG with

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,160
that and then suddenly we had art bots

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,660
so yeah these are a couple of things

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,180
that I've made with tracery and SVG

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:17,600
these are some art generators spaceship

00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,890
generators I made a taiko ytt outfit

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,429
generator because he wears really out

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,990
awesome outfits you can also do tiles

00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:25,520
which is the idea that like if I have

00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,590
something that is split up into even

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,730
sections and I can kind of put things

00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,950
into this section if you've ever played

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:32,420
Settlers of Catan where you have like

00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,880
this grid and you're putting tiles

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,040
randomly on it that's kind of using tile

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,179
based things but Diablo was one of the

00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,830
first games that kind of use this for

00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:41,480
map generation and you can totally not

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,410
see that those are Maps up there but

00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,840
there are maps that somebody is

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:48,800
documented this is one of the oldest

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,840
ones this is an example of using tile

00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:54,080
based music so this is not only

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:56,990
generation generativity from 1700 it's

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,670
IP infringement from the 1700s this is

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,920
not actually by Mozart but it the

00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,780
publisher said it was and this is called

00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,640
vais music and so you roll some dice and

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:06,860
then you pick out the measure and you

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,890
like put a bunch of measures together so

00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:12,050
it's like I mean if music is kind of a

00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:15,250
grid of measures then you can just like

00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:17,630
paste in the tiles of new measures

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:19,130
parametric is another one that I use a

00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:21,530
lot this is basically the idea that you

00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:24,320
have a lot of sliders as seen up above

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:27,260
so this is a flower generator that uses

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,780
32 different sliders and I can do all

00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:31,820
sorts of fun stuff like I can actually

00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,309
control this with music or I can control

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,080
it with hand gestures or I can have the

00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:37,670
the user navigate it in different ways

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,750
so the one at the bottom is you're just

00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,010
picking the flower that you like the

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,790
best and you're sort of procedurally

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:45,230
evolving them there's kind of a whole

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,390
class of ones that are like geometric

00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:50,860
transformations this is something like

00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:53,120
you've got a curve you play okay cool so

00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,940
the user has made some sort of gesture

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,370
either with your hand or with a mouth

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,710
mouth mouth or with whatever input

00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,610
you've got

00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,799
you could do it with a mouth that would

00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,269
be interesting and then you're gonna

00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:07,190
take that curve and do something

00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:08,690
interesting along it so a lot of these

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:10,700
techniques are kind of like you have

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,669
some input I want you to exaggerate and

00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:16,100
riff on that input in some way so the

00:20:13,669 --> 00:20:18,799
one at the top is IO brush you can use a

00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,360
webcam to sort of slurp up images and

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,789
then you can paint them along a curve

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,190
that's about maybe 12 years old by now

00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:27,200
but at the bottom is tilt brush which

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,179
you're drawing curves in 3d and then

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,710
they've got all sorts of like a whole

00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:32,480
library of interesting stuff that you

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:33,950
can do along that curve like glitter

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,590
effects and particle effects and

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:39,259
animations and like sort of different

00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:42,320
stuff here a couple of works that I've

00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:45,679
done in curves these the one at the top

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,179
is how I generated any scarves using

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,009
these curves and making interesting SVG

00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,149
along them the one at the bottom is

00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,649
actually a lick motion thing where you

00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:54,440
can draw with your hands and then it

00:20:51,649 --> 00:21:00,200
makes kind of interesting living curves

00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:02,210
out of it yeah let's see oh here we go

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,070
here's one that like takes curves and

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,419
draws floral patterns along am i I

00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,649
really don't know what I'm doing with a

00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:09,259
lot of these like I just kind of

00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:10,909
decorate the curves and then figure out

00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:12,440
an interesting form of interaction for

00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:15,259
them I don't know how to interact with

00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,149
the flowers yet but here's a really good

00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:20,539
example of using that this is actually a

00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:22,190
gallery piece come on play here we go

00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:24,740
this is called the treachery of

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,590
sanctuary by Chris milk and you would

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,960
have these sort of monolithic mirror

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,850
projections and as you extend your arm

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,470
it takes the geometry of your arm and

00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,600
extends it out into wings so this is

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,070
taking like a small scrap of geometry

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,860
and making it something bigger and more

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,360
expressive this is great cuz like you

00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:43,129
don't need to be taught how to do this

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,120
it's just continuously like shifting

00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:48,590
what your arm means distribution this is

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,990
a really common one this is just like I

00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:54,169
have a bunch of stuff and I want to

00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,879
scatter it around so you can think of

00:21:54,169 --> 00:21:56,899
how things are scattered in nature so

00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:58,370
like go outside and look at the lava

00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,750
fields and like see how rocks are

00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:03,019
clustered around other rocks and then

00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:04,519
the moss is clustered around those there

00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:06,919
are really interesting things to do with

00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,139
generativity in distribution in like

00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:10,610
alternate reality games so if you have

00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:12,830
something like Pokemon go how are the

00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:13,620
monsters scattered around the world like

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,080
what logics are you

00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,309
using for that you could have what they

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,420
do which is like where there's more foot

00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:20,970
traffic we're gonna scatter more

00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,380
monsters you could say like in every

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,150
piece of land that was taken by Native

00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,130
them taken from Native Americans like

00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,690
before 1900 we're going to put the

00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,640
monsters there and you're going to

00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:32,730
actually like see where the landscape

00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:35,670
was defined so you can like make

00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:36,900
different choices about distribution you

00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,550
know where do you want to put things in

00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:40,140
your world is it where there's more

00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:42,000
pollution less pollution more people

00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:45,360
less people more to car traffic less car

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,620
traffic particles in simulation I do a

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,260
lot of stuff with particles just because

00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,590
it's like it's my personal favorite tool

00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,400
so the the body's up there actually

00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,770
particles that are being pushed around

00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,200
by the music so imagine like you created

00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,400
dance because you have a little sentient

00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,070
Tribble on your wrist and every time it

00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,830
hears a bass beat it does that and like

00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,450
you'd do another one like and then you

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:07,530
would apply those to your hips so you

00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:10,050
can kind of like create little dances

00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:11,700
out of that the one on the bottom left

00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:13,500
is Boyd's flocking which is like how you

00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,690
create flocks of things that stay

00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,640
together what can you do with that well

00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,230
you can leave trails behind it so these

00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,150
are actually little particles that are

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:23,520
zooming around with their little physics

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,750
pushes and I'm leaving trade trails

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,990
behind them and that creates these kind

00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:29,190
of interesting 3d flowers I really

00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,660
wanted to mention machine learning just

00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:32,820
because like what do you do with machine

00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:34,740
learning well it's another part of the

00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:36,150
pipeline so remember how I talked about

00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,890
we're turning curves into other things

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:40,230
this is you tell the user to draw a

00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:41,490
couple of curves and then you are going

00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,410
to run a little machine learning thing

00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,110
on it that for every pixel tries to make

00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:47,400
it look as much like a cat as possible

00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,410
and just kind of iterative like for this

00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,660
patch of pixels how do I like sort of

00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:54,090
wobble the pixels such that they look as

00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:58,320
much like a cat as possible so this is

00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:59,820
like procedural cat wobbling to generate

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,380
that sort of thing you can use it for

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:03,720
more serious stuff this is Alex Hoffman

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,260
dard who's got a start-up now which is

00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,550
trying to do artistic stuff with

00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:11,550
interactive machine learning where you

00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:13,650
can like color in sort of mspaint style

00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:15,270
and then it will just like it with the

00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:18,809
cats waggle the pixels until it looks as

00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:20,309
much like it thinks Monet should look so

00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:21,780
yeah like a little bit I wanted to talk

00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:23,940
a little bit at least about JavaScript

00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,440
because it's got a lot of features that

00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,130
are really well suited for generativity

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,520
I used to do processing

00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,990
then our about 2012 I got contracted to

00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,090
teach a class in JavaScript so then I

00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:36,010
had to learn JavaScript and then I got

00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:38,020
into processing yes and that was just a

00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,540
huge life changer because I love the

00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:44,590
functional programming stuff so you can

00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:46,720
like new maps and filters and reduces so

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:49,570
it's all like it's a pipeline sort of

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,860
thing actually works with kind of

00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:55,360
different options in in JavaScript where

00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,890
like you know you might have a user

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,690
gesture and you're gonna turn that into

00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,670
curves and then you're going to turn

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,550
those curves into like different stamped

00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:05,020
shapes or styled curves in some way you

00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:07,030
might have particles doing like a

00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,030
particle physics simulation you can turn

00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:11,710
those into curves or into stamped shapes

00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:13,300
any one of those might turn into u3 dot

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,970
J's models or they might turn it through

00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:18,310
like p5 canvas stuff or SVG you might

00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:21,580
take that p5 canvas thing and turn it

00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:23,190
into a PNG that you're using in 3GS so

00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,780
here's like some physics sim that's

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,580
pushing particles around and turning

00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:29,470
them into curves

00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:31,660
here's physics that are like

00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:34,330
procedurally on kinking the curves that

00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:37,000
the particles are making and then here's

00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:39,090
something where this project I did a 3GS

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,290
butterfly simulator and I'm using

00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,760
process I'm using particles and

00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,140
processing to draw the wings that I'm

00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:47,050
rendering to canvas that I'm sending

00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,360
over to 3GS as my textures so you can

00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:50,380
really set up these wild chains there's

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,660
a whole bunch of different generative

00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,850
libraries everything from dance rjs to

00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,990
take music and give you numbers and if

00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:56,770
you have those numbers what are you

00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,140
gonna do with those numbers

00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:01,210
I don't know generate something Voronoi

00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,700
I've made these like libraries called

00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:06,910
tracery and battery but you know you've

00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:09,760
got s e-g canvas 3GS processing all

00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:11,410
different ways to output art and then I

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,030
really like how you can get different

00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:15,160
interfaces so you can make stuff with

00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:17,350
Twitter data you can make stuff with big

00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:20,050
data ap is something that I didn't

00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:22,390
mention here is like visualization is a

00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:23,620
form of generative art you are taking

00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:26,050
some data you are running some

00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:28,890
interesting tools on it pop you know

00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:30,940
grammars or parameters or whatever and

00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:32,020
you're getting some interesting art out

00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,400
of it

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,350
I like the leap motion even though it's

00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,670
kind of on the downturn now it's like

00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:38,410
unpopular because nobody could figure

00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,270
out what to do with it

00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:41,739
you can do mouse gestures you can do 3d

00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,659
printing API

00:26:41,739 --> 00:26:46,419
I don't know what people are gonna do

00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:49,360
with augmented reality but if you've got

00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:51,009
like I'm gonna scan this room and do

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,739
some augmented reality and stuff in it

00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:55,090
I'm gonna need generative art to figure

00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:56,230
out like what do I do with the table

00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:59,009
what do I do with the table that's got

00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:01,119
like that arrangement of glasses on it

00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:02,860
you know if I wanted to wait a

00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,080
generative garden over this entire thing

00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:07,090
there are processes I just showed you

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,070
that I could use to simulate interesting

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,499
garden stuff but I could never have an

00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,820
artist sit here and like dynamically

00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:15,100
figure out what everything is going to

00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,690
be on every table and then 3d printing

00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,070
api's which are fun but spoon flower

00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,470
which is the fabric printing one that I

00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,909
did no longer has a direct API you can

00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:24,039
still upload stuff to it but like you

00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:28,480
can't have it dynamically respond to

00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:32,919
users actions oh yeah and that's the kid

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,259
using my idle hands thing so yeah in

00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:37,899
conclusion javascript has a lot of good

00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:40,149
features it has libraries plays well

00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:41,590
with unusual interfaces you can make

00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:43,720
something that makes something it's not

00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:46,210
hard to build these things what are the

00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,759
swags that I brought with me is I made a

00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:51,159
bot and my bot makes art buttons or

00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:52,509
sorry stickers so if you've ever made an

00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:54,220
art bot or something that makes what you

00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:56,139
consider art come up to me and you can

00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,119
totally get one of those stickers if you

00:27:56,139 --> 00:27:59,590
haven't come up to me later and I will

00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:00,820
show you how to use tracery and in five

00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:04,200
minutes you will have an art bot and

00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:04,200
then a sticker so yeah

00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,050
