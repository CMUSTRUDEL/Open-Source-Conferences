Reviewing a pull request can feel like a chore. If done poorly, PR reviews can mean a few hours of attempting to understand both the problem and the solution, then checking that the result matches the design. Sure, many of us have the luxury of walking to our coworker’s desk and getting a walk through. But what if the other dev isn’t free? What if they live in another time zone? What if you need a project manager or designer to look at your work, and they don’t have a local setup or much dev experience?

In this session, we’ll go over some tips and technologies to make your pull request process a bit smoother. We’ll discuss:
- Writing clear issues/stories to build a good foundation
- Tools you can use for reviewing work with remote coworkers
- Keeping design reviews from turning into blockers
- Adding testing instructions to your PR description
- Leaving positive feedback so no one goes home grumpy

it's my mic on somebody give me a thumbs

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,040
up if you can hear me because I can't

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,160
hear okay great um that works really

00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:14,190
well because I can't see you anyway so

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,350
the first letter on this repository link

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:19,260
here is a tea I will share it again I

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,300
also tweeted it out my name is Katherine

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,430
mean I work at a company called spark

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,510
box I'm a full-stack developer or

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:28,140
whatever that means

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,510
I use she/her pronouns spark box is a

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,969
little web shop in Ohio we have about 40

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,420
people I spend most of my time working

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,059
on an enterprise level design system you

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,680
can ask me about later so today I'm

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,940
going to share with you a few tools and

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,710
techniques to make your pull request

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,320
more effective and more collaborative

00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,480
because of time I hope to do a quick

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,820
summary of a few tools and you can

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,039
google them later after the event most

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,500
of these tools are not github exclusive

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,789
so I've met people from git lab and

00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,760
bitbucket here and I know there's at

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,859
least one github person so hopefully

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,860
like you still find something even if

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,290
github is not your main technology to

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,470
start I should share a bit about context

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,020
and how SPARC box does code reviews we

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,060
steer north store nearly all of our code

00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,060
on github we do have one bitbucket

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,710
client now that's kind of new we use

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,920
shared repositories dedicated to

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,930
whatever engagement we're working on

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,210
developers have whenever developers have

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,579
new code to add to the project they ask

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,970
another developer for a code review via

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,670
pull request I've come up with six sort

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,189
of rules that spark box adheres to while

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,799
using github and I will just say that I

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,079
came up with these rules for the spark

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,740
box process so I do not represent the

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,570
thoughts and ideas of my employer yes

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,850
rule number one is no one merges their

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,729
own code spark box likes to avoid the

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,770
concept of a developer island where one

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,200
developer is writing emerging all of the

00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,939
code for a piece of a website last year

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,829
we had a cot lion who wanted an

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,390
additional full-time developer for a

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:06,180
side project but they would be the only

00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,590
developer on that project we offered

00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,989
instead to developers at half time

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,560
having a reviewer is that important to

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:15,800
us the second rule is

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,880
is never pushed directly to master

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,580
pushing directly to master is the

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:23,489
easiest way to break everything

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,080
requiring code review re reinforces the

00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:29,160
quality that we've come to value as a

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,800
company third rule if you're working

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,599
with you I get a design review at work

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,120
box we have a position called a front

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,700
end designer on every project we design

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,650
this special designer often will write

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,470
front-end code so they may do some CSS

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,630
but not every company has designers who

00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:48,390
know how to code and nor should they but

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,480
that's probably a different talk rule

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,580
number four if you are working on copy

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,680
get a get a copy review at spark box

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,410
this is usually the project manager or

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,130
the client themselves we have an

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,540
integrated development process so the

00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,390
clients usually have access to the

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,180
repositories we're working on rule

00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:12,720
number five is never ever push directly

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,599
to master again unless you messed up

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,790
which if you did find a buddy to pair

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,560
with which leads me to rule number six

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:24,000
which is these rules are more like

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,859
guidelines and I made them up but if you

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,959
follow these six rules it ensures that

00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:30,359
we follow the basic spark mark spree

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,819
Creed which is working together for a

00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:35,010
web built right if every piece of code

00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:35,340
has at least two people contributing to

00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,900
it

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,380
we often catch mistakes before they

00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:43,019
happen so all of that is context for

00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,790
about what I'm about to talk about it

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,799
may be different for you and your

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,660
company it's just how we like to work so

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,970
I'm not telling you how you should do

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,359
code reviews some challenges of

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,970
collaboration are getting a PR review

00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:58,410
from a non coder or getting a PR review

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,780
from someone who's in a different time

00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,190
zone currently I am five hours separate

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,350
from most of my team and nine hours

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,500
separated from the rest it's not that

00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:09,980
easy working with developers who may be

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:15,359
only doing reviews on your project or

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:18,959
working with people who are assigned

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:24,900
directly to PR review and nothing else

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:26,669
so how do we improve these things so I'm

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,260
going to give you six steps I think I

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:31,220
guess I like

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:34,250
number six tip number one is write good

00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:36,440
stories to ensure good pull requests we

00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,780
have to write good issues at spark box

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,510
we often use and hub github projects

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,000
your our Trello to organize engagements

00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:46,280
usually with something like scrum which

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,280
involves creating stories which is

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,740
usually a github issue representing a

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,660
bite-sized chunk of work so let's hope

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,180
these pictures were great all right

00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,400
story should include the requirements of

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:01,400
the work and potentially a solution if

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,050
you have one in mind story or issue

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,270
doesn't need to be overly complicated

00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,370
but it should be easy to understand a

00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,530
well-written story makes for a clear

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,500
requirements when it comes time to do a

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:15,260
PR and this leads you to my very first

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,550
tool recommendation the only one then is

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,450
github exclusive but I'm sure there's

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,390
something similar on the other

00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,610
technologies just for reference in the

00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,950
photo this is my coworker Austin who is

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,630
a project manager explaining that

00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,920
there's this footer it's not great so

00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,640
maybe we can use some of these other

00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:34,820
colors instead so github issue and

00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,100
github issue templates and PR templates

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,260
allow you to add a markdown file to your

00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,180
root directory to outline the issue

00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,510
process I'll show you this link again in

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,330
a minute this is an issue template

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:54,830
here's my markdown it's included

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:56,570
directly in my project in addition to

00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:58,310
adding the template file to the root of

00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,730
your project you can also include it via

00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,320
github directory PR templates are also a

00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,640
thing that can go in this directory they

00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,010
work the same way but have a different

00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:11,390
file name and they come up when you do a

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:13,100
PR instead of an issue so here is the

00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,690
issue template on github when I click

00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,220
the new issue button the text field

00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:18,410
populates with the contents of the

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,630
template file and then these example

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,100
files are stored in the repo I linked at

00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,310
the beginning and I tweet it out and

00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:28,910
I'll link at the end I think if you want

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,620
to take a closer look talk with your

00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,380
project team to decide what you should

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,870
put into a template mine is just an

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,490
example it's very flat example but a

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,350
checklist is usually nice you can go

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,689
through and click things off so there's

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:45,860
that link again I'll give you about

00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:49,849
thirty seconds three seconds two seconds

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,330
alright tip number two is get the basics

00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:52,009
right

00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,569
a good way to frustrate your pull

00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:57,860
request reviewer is to send them

00:06:53,569 --> 00:07:01,610
something with absolutely no context you

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,580
could respond in kind these are real

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,979
real PRS people from my co-workers the

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,289
great uhm but a few extra minutes to

00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:11,930
write a thoughtful PR description can go

00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:18,050
a long way toward easing the work of the

00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:20,210
reviewer we try to include a quick

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:24,379
summary of the work being done usually

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:26,779
matching your commit descriptions linked

00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:28,039
to any github issues or stories

00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,800
especially use it if you're using

00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:34,129
something like Zen hub or JIRA for agile

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,050
a link or screenshot of the original

00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:38,120
design work if you're working on UI as a

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,159
developer I love screenshots in addition

00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,379
to design files because I don't have to

00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:45,379
open up Zeppelin every single time I'm

00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:47,150
looking at something to build and

00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:49,520
step-by-step testing instructions

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,339
including how to run the linter or how

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,710
to run the tests how to navigate to any

00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:57,680
new work how specifically your new work

00:07:54,710 --> 00:08:00,229
is meant to function so here's that PR

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,110
example again this is from my other

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:08,240
co-worker Bryan he's had a number of

00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:10,370
these tips they should be written in the

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,770
context of the developer reviewing the

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,979
work for example a PR to a developer

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:17,210
who's only doing review or QA may look

00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:21,349
completely different to the one who

00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:24,520
wrote the build process alright next tip

00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:27,770
enhance your pull request with gifts

00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:29,569
this is my favorite gift because it's

00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:34,159
cat and the cat is coding oh my name is

00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:38,779
cat and I'm a coder so it's me I hope

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:40,159
you like that joke it's my only one so

00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:42,740
what if a gift can be more than a quick

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,529
laughs gifts are awesome for showing nav

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,209
functionality transitions hover effects

00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:49,100
animation - pretty much any visual

00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:52,010
aspect of your work where a front-end

00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,050
shop can you tell gifts are especially

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,350
useful for getting a design review of an

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,270
anime

00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:01,010
or hover from someone who may not have a

00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:03,320
site running locally here is my tool for

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,780
this one it's called record it there's

00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,700
the link it's record it co record it is

00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,260
a screencasting service that lets you

00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,650
save your finished recording as a gif

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:15,440
and even gives you a hosted link an

00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:18,440
example use case is foundry which is a

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,210
spark box blog the CMS that this foundry

00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,670
is built upon is a really big deal to

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,560
set up it may take a full day especially

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,240
if it's for a designer a project manager

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,970
who's just trying to review one or two

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,310
lines of code or comic content by

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,050
including a gif you may give the

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:34,340
necessary context and allow everyone to

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,190
feel a little confident in what they are

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:40,850
approving so this is just a gif I made

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:42,200
of some functionality so here's the link

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,690
to record it again

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,450
a downside to record it is that it

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,760
doesn't currently support HTTPS which

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:53,150
means as you may know that it can't be

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,150
embedded directly into a PR on github it

00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,500
can still be sent as a slack link or

00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:00,200
just an email or whatever

00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:03,800
an alternative I've recently discovered

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,390
gift box if Fox is a native app it

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,130
creates gifts and you can drop them into

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,830
github to host them just like you would

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,560
an image hosting on github gives you the

00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,330
full security of your repository so

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,930
you're not violating your security

00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:20,350
policies it does cost $5 wow this one's

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,350
really off

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,640
include it is included in set app if

00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:28,130
you're a set app subscriber and I think

00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,750
this one only works on Mac but there are

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,620
lots of giving tools out there it's sort

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:37,010
of the thought that counts all right the

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:39,920
next one is enhancing your pull requests

00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,750
with video an important aspect of a

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,700
complicated PR is the ability to walk

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,920
someone through your code in the current

00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:47,570
age devs are often distributed or remote

00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,910
we work in different time zones and have

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,890
busy schedules sometimes it is nearly

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:55,540
impossible to schedule the 30 minutes to

00:10:51,890 --> 00:11:00,110
step through your PR here's the tool

00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:03,200
it's go video by video vidyard this used

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:05,150
to be called viewed it they changed it

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,230
right after I wrote my talks so I had to

00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,900
change it

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:11,090
and go video is a Chrome extension they

00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,800
also have a native app because not

00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:17,990
everyone is a fan of Chrome hello and

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:19,760
was it last go video lets a user record

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,010
their screen their face and their voice

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,630
all at once

00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:26,150
specifically we used a video project

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,850
like this on engagement where the main

00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:30,920
reviewer me was not dedicated to the

00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,930
project full time because I was not

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,550
available for stand-ups I didn't have a

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,780
direct hand in building the website and

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,760
I wasn't really familiar with the

00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:41,090
changes being reviewed the dev had to

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,920
explain every change for every PR go

00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:44,720
video is one of my new favorite ways to

00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,460
start a code review I've made you a

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,640
video instead of showing you how it's

00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:52,280
done hopefully works I keep meaning to

00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,790
rerecord this but people tell me that

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,380
awkwardness is endearing so just just go

00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,870
with it

00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:03,110
hey there github purse this is go video

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:05,540
by viddy art as you can see it records

00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:09,140
my entire screen plus a little me down

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:11,060
in the corner over here hello but I

00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,790
think is super friendly and great for

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:17,270
doing video walkthroughs of pull

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:21,230
requests here you can see that I am on a

00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:23,960
pull request and I can go into my file

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:27,200
changes I can look at the code I can

00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,870
explain hey this class adds 3 M of

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,140
padding bottom to our smart box homepage

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:35,330
it hopefully fixes an issue I hope you

00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:39,200
like it please merge it obviously I did

00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:41,180
merge it because this is me and then

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,840
when you are done recording your video

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:47,240
you can go on to a screen one shows up

00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,820
like this you can see that you can

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,610
change your title like cat is super

00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:56,060
great at videos you should try it

00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:59,090
sometime it's not that great just

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:00,800
kidding that's a bad joke so you can

00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:03,500
change your thumbnail sort of scrub

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,670
through contacts and when you're done

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:10,310
you get a link right here that link is

00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:13,220
HTTP so you can embed it directly into

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:15,410
your floor requests and whoever wants to

00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:17,570
review your code gets a nice friendly

00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:21,310
walk through and it doesn't matter about

00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,310
time zones or anything fun like that

00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:32,150
all right never again thanks that's

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:34,970
really encouraging so here's the link

00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:37,160
again depending on the size of your PR a

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,110
walk-through video only adds about five

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,330
or ten minutes total to our set-up time

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,130
but it can potentially save the 30 to 60

00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:47,390
minutes it might take to explain your PR

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:50,180
via slack or email I'm sorry or

00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,410
scheduling a zoom meeting this is

00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,960
especially useful when pairing

00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:55,880
developers who have different schedules

00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,990
for who a remote or who are not as

00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,830
familiar with the engagement you're

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:02,180
working on all right two more tips

00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:05,210
there's another give valuable feedback

00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,760
sketch sketch is a free app we're going

00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,530
directly into the tool here sketch is a

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,270
free app from Evernote it's probably my

00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:14,060
favorite thing on all of these slides it

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,220
is loved by spark box for everything

00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,960
from full-page decomps to quick design

00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:23,960
edits to making memes of your coworkers

00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:26,000
I use it daily here is an example I just

00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,339
made this up sketch provides elegant

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,410
markup tools for drawing boxes adding

00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:32,750
arrows and highlighting any necessary

00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:35,420
changes you can just take a screenshot

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,980
and have at it that shift command for on

00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,300
a Mac it took me a really long time to

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,630
learn that so now you don't have to

00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,010
pretend you didn't know so here are some

00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:46,370
real-world examples I pulled these

00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:49,150
directly out of slack just didn't go

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:53,420
through them oh that one doesn't work

00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:56,890
here's some muscles this is the best

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,890
joke in my slides and it's not even mine

00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,410
all right so that's sketched by Evernote

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,510
you can just Google sketch you don't to

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,490
remember this whole link sketch works

00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,320
well in the opposite direction I've

00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,480
recorded it's an easy way for designers

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,240
to communicate desired changes with

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,790
developers say make this bigger reduce

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,440
the space here delete this link sketch

00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:24,470
provides visual feedback for visual

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:26,900
thinkers all right last one one last way

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,660
to make your PRS friendlier is to be

00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,370
friendly spot via github comments it's

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,350
no way to collaborate and let's face it

00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,830
we know communication is very difficult

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,230
in tag

00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:40,400
it doesn't communicate tone that's why

00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:42,050
we invented emoji a co-worker of mine

00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,440
Brian the one who wrote the really

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:47,480
awesome PR earlier also wrote an article

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,290
about this topic it's called stop giving

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,720
depressing code reviews the idea is to

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,670
give as much possible positive code

00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,860
feedback as you do correction it's

00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:59,810
really hard especially if you're an INTJ

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,040
like me you just go through and see all

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:04,060
the negative and you don't offer any

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,850
positive comments you can do it

00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:11,840
so this is a picture Brian he knows I'm

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,950
including it instead of really going to

00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,630
this topic I'm going to read you this

00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,690
quote it says giving positive feedback

00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:19,010
is an easy habit to adopt you're already

00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,080
reading through the lines of code

00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,390
looking for issues it doesn't take much

00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,580
night it doesn't take much time to throw

00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:28,670
in a nice or it looks great you see

00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:30,110
something awesome say it so the link to

00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:32,210
the full article is there but a few

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,740
positive comments make a huge difference

00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,210
in the overall tone of your review

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,310
whether you're speaking with diviner

00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,650
designers developers other team

00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:45,470
contributors clients which are really

00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:47,210
important so yeah be nice and that's

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,920
that's what I have hopefully at least

00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,330
one of these tools can make the PR

00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,510
experience more accessible for your

00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:55,610
entire team and not just the developers

00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,990
with healthy dose of empathy we can

00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,120
improve the way our co-workers review

00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,430
the code we write and as a result we

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,770
create smoother workflows increase both

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,449
speed and communication and make better

00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,040
websites if you want to hear more about

00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:09,020
spark box or the design system I'm

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,780
building please come find me I have

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:14,089
decals and some business cards it look

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:18,270
like ninja stars up here at the front

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:20,330
desk and that's it

00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,330
