hi my name is Burke and I love user

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,490
interface

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:07,639
I've always loved user interface I

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,650
remember staring at the glory that was

00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,690
compact tab works while I played this

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,059
game called the incredible machine and

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,580
listen to the Tears for Fears greatest

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,500
hits album now don't judge me I was

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,930
listening to mad world way before that

00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,580
Donnie Darko in that creepy rabbit movie

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,680
that's an old and obscure reference you

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,539
may not get that that's okay what I'm

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,640
trying to say is it's not you it's me

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,140
that's Costanza would say that's another

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,989
old and obscure reference you know what

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,700
forget all that let's move on I got my

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,350
first computer when I was in the

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,879
military actually I was in boot camp and

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:40,680
they pay you in boot camp but you can't

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,050
spend the money you know because you're

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,730
doing push-ups and stuff and so after I

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,079
got out of boot camp my dad encouraged

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,520
me to buy a computer so I got my first

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,760
computer oh you can see this ledger here

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,010
which was a compact HP Pavilion it

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,890
looked just like this and it came with

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:59,430
Windows 98 all my sounds aren't working

00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,039
yeah there we go

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,379
and I loved Windows 98 I spent so much

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,119
time just changing the themes the

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,100
different themes looking at the icons

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,659
and the text I mean each theme was

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,540
better than the previous theme it was

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,700
incredible it was so good and if only I

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,610
had known then if only I had known what

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:22,920
was coming if only I had known about

00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:24,119
Windows XP okay this was do you believe

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,729
in love at first sight does love at

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,320
first sight exist no of course it does

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,060
it no be ridiculous love is a very

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,030
complex human emotion but let me tell

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,400
you what does exist infatuation and I

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,740
was infatuated with Windows XP I mean

00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,960
the curves on the Start menu the blues

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,530
and the greens the way the windows are

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,299
layered in space it was beautiful I know

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,740
it's weird but I wasn't that socially

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,149
popular so I had a lot of time to sit

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,009
around and do weird things like stare at

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,930
an operating system and then this

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,750
spawned a big hacker community and a lot

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,979
of tools to ask in Windows XP and when

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,689
you can do that obviously you want to

00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:59,759
make it look like OS 10 that's the first

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:04,500
thing you do so this one goes out to

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,240
startup now as much as I love UI I'm not

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,039
a designer as much as I want to be a

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,959
designer I am NOT a designer he's a

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,209
designer I'm not a designer now what I

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,410
can do is assemble building blocks so if

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,450
you give me

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,520
lighters and dropdowns and modal windows

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,050
then I can build you UI and I used to

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,510
work for this company called kendo UI

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,060
and so I've been fortunate to be a part

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,590
of some great UI products but you

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,400
wouldn't hire me to build a website for

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,650
you ok

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,000
unless you were my mom otherwise you're

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,390
not gonna hire me to do that that would

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,400
be subpar results and so what I've

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,800
realized through all of my time working

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,130
with UI is that really the best user

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,870
experience is is no UI at all so let me

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,120
talk about that for a second UI is kind

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,640
of a middleman it's a conversation it's

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,370
pre-canned and it's it has boundaries

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,350
right so we try to code for the simplest

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,170
possible scenario to get a user through

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:58,290
the process or all the processes in the

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:00,210
world right and this is so this we could

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,860
improve upon this UX probably a little

00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,750
bit now there's been some great feats of

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,850
UX genius I'm still a fan of

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,500
skeuomorphic design if a baby can pick

00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,350
up and use an iPad without any training

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,300
you know that's kind of an amazing thing

00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,830
now that said the reason why we have UI

00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,140
in these wonderful buttons and sliders

00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:21,320
is because historically we haven't been

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:23,880
able to talk to computers until now

00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,950
natural language processing is the field

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,959
of computing that deals with not just

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,230
speech recognition but extracting a

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,250
user's intent from what they just said

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,900
you may be familiar with this in a

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,230
couple different forms we have Alexa

00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,150
Cortana Siri and Google home or ok

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,030
Google or Google assistant or whatever

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,050
the heck you call that thing a lot of

00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,030
people have these I'm gonna give you

00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,350
three examples of how I think no UI is

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,720
better than a UI

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,300
the first one is creating reminders so I

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,190
can say hey Siri remind me to email my

00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,989
mom and that experience is way better

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,820
than going in to the reminders app and

00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,920
doing this no matter how beautiful the

00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,709
reminders app is it will never be as

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,840
easy as me just saying do it another one

00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,510
is home automation here's an example of

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,010
me turning lights on and off with an

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,750
well actually here's the app that you do

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,400
it with so here's me turning lights on

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:17,239
and off with the app very nice and now

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,239
here's me doing it

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:33,279
Alexa turn off the lights in the master

00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:36,520
bedroom now watch this okay Alexa can

00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:41,620
you turn on the bedroom turn on the

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:43,060
master bedroom lights and that is

00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,919
natural language processing right I

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,300
completely botched that command seven

00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,860
different ways and it still was able to

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,210
pick it up and do it you know what's

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,039
even better is if you have a nest

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:54,069
thermostat you can lay in bed and

00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,960
control the temperature with your voice

00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:57,550
and now that I've said that sounds

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,219
really pathetic you know what never mind

00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,750
I don't ever do that the last example

00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:04,840
I'd like to give you as a service called

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:07,210
digit digit is a remarkable little

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,590
service that saves for you using machine

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,659
learning based on your spending patterns

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,250
and it will give you savings updates I

00:05:10,659 --> 00:05:14,979
blurred this out so you don't get too

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:17,020
depressed by my low balance and the

00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:19,360
whole interface is conversational so it

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,669
has an app now but before all you did

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,830
was chat with it to save to withdraw and

00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:24,939
it was pretty resilient at understanding

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,879
my commands I didn't have to know what

00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:29,199
to say I just said it and I thought that

00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:32,159
that was quite remarkable so the

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:37,629
question now is is UI as we know it dead

00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:39,520
the answer is no no absolutely not there

00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:41,770
are accessibility concerns you wouldn't

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,909
want to activate take photos with your

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,229
voice you wouldn't want to scroll

00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,879
through pictures with your voice right

00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:48,399
like scroll up scroll down scroll that

00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:50,800
that's not a good user experience but it

00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,629
does give us a chance to rethink some of

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,639
the ways that we build UI is that maybe

00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,469
we don't need to build a UI and instead

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,060
what we need to build is something

00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:59,430
that's more conversational in nature

00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,719
that uses natural language processing

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,419
because that's now available to all of

00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:05,289
us and if I'm gonna end a little bit

00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:07,240
early ooh

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:09,729
several seconds early you can check out

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,319
the Luas project here this is a

00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:12,669
completely free tool it's a visual

00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,830
interface you can build and then as long

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,960
as you know how to make an AJAX call you

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,659
can add natural language processing to

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,729
your applications and or build a bot or

00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:25,789
a conversational UI thank you so much

00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:25,789
