This talk aims at covering the CSS Houdini spec and its amalgamation with JavaScript.

CSS Houdini is a W3C effort to define lower-level CSS APIs for developers to understand, recreate, and extend high level CSS authoring features.

This talk will focus on current ideas (being discussed by the CSS Houdini working group), finalised specifications, future plans for development of CSS Houdini and how it will change the way we use JavaScript APIs to create rich user experiences.
