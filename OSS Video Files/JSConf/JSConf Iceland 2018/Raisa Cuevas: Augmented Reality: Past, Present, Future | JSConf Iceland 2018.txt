Big brands across various industries are starting to realize the potential of augmented reality (AR) for innovation in marketing and in product. But with AR's history dating back to 1968, why has it suddenly become the next big thing? This talk will dive into the rich history of AR to help us understand and appreciate where the technology is now. You will learn some tools to build with AR today, and understand how the technology will open up creative possibilities for our future.

all right so first of all let's get the

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,969
sunscreen first of all I just want to

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,289
say I'm a little bit embarrassed about

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:18,029
my outfit that I'm not as handsome as

00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:20,369
Florida over here or Vanessa in the

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,859
other room the truth is I brought a

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,289
really nice stylish shirt to wear today

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,730
but my hotel room didn't have an iron I

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:28,560
called him at seven in the morning and

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,449
they took way too long to bring it up so

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,640
I just thought like you know I was

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,170
actually panicking this morning called

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,460
my boyfriend and I was like I don't have

00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,989
anything else to wear just the trekking

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,129
gear for this weekend and like maybe

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,070
I'll just go onstage and look like a

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,510
mountaineer so he was like it's okay

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,430
it's a Developer Conference and I was

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,930
like that's right I'm gonna just be

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,239
myself and be comfortable and be really

00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,329
cozy like a mountaineer talking about

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,949
augmented reality so let me just

00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,559
introduce myself my name is race' and

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:58,109
I'm a creative engineer at Google my

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,550
team one day was looking for ways to use

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,649
augmented reality in one of our

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,510
marketing campaigns so I took the

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,210
liberty of just doing the research on my

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,710
own seeing what's possible and naturally

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,460
I just started digging out into the

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,570
history got really excited about the

00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,119
many many years that it has gone back

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,130
and wanted to share with my team to help

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,259
them appreciate what it is today and of

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,820
course do my actual job of reporting

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:30,950
back what's possible today and in the

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:33,450
future so what is possible in the future

00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,189
actually and before I start I want to

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,619
just make a really quick disclaimer that

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,570
I'm all this research all this research

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,850
I did was on my own it's all public

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,710
knowledge and with that being said I'm

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,329
speaking on behalf of myself and not on

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,479
behalf of my company or any of the

00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,159
organizations I'm a part of so let's

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,979
step back into history all the way back

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,950
into 1901 this was a time before

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,649
airplanes before traditional color

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,509
photography that we know and nearly a

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,719
decade before the world's the first

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,939
talking motion picture yet before all of

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,890
these technological advancements we had

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:11,009
a visionary author called L frank Baum

00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:13,770
who you see up here and he envisioned a

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:15,840
world in a novel that he wrote called

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,520
master key he wrote about a world where

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,390
one could put on a pair of spectacles

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,710
and the people that he would look at it

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,870
would overlay a character over their

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,280
head and this this device was called a

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,680
character marker so basically he's

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,780
looking around and can judge a person on

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,090
a single look so this was these were

00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,150
some really deep sci-fi thoughts back in

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,430
1901 such like I can't even imagine how

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,810
he could have came up with this idea and

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,060
if the name rings a bell he's author of

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,240
The Wizard of Oz so maybe it's not so

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:49,290
surprising after all then fast forward

00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:52,080
to 1968 we a lot has happened in this

00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:55,200
time America has built the first 747

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,840
we've orbited the moon from Apollo 8 and

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,960
at the same time we have the world's

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,760
first head mounted display this was

00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,970
developed by of Harvard professor called

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,650
Ivan Sutherland and this display that

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,720
you see here it was so heavy it has to

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,770
be mounted from the ceiling and there's

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,090
this funny video on YouTube where you

00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,010
can see him like spinning around and all

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,950
he's seeing is this really simple wire

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:20,250
cube so after all this hard work you saw

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:22,050
this visionary cube in space and this

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,390
was a really important precursor to a

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,100
art because as you'll see there's been

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,850
so many advancements with head mounted

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:34,020
displays these days and now looking at

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:36,209
2018 we have the rocket orbiting into

00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,510
space with the car that's now somewhere

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:41,610
out there floating but at the same time

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,709
we also have all of these advancements

00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,720
in augmented reality everyone is talking

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,959
about when it's going to be the next big

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,130
thing for the past few years

00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,480
technologists and investors alike or

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,060
speculating on when this is going to

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,650
really blow up so what is happening

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,530
after all of these years you see that

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:01,800
there's rich history of over a century

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:06,150
ago that dates back on mentioned reality

00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:09,270
since at least 1901 so if you look at

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:11,700
this chart from Google Trends in case

00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:14,400
you haven't used it before the y-axis is

00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,830
the search interest from 0 to 100 and on

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,320
the x-axis we have time so I'm I did a

00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,209
search back until the past two and a

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,490
half years to see how interested people

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,590
were in augmented reality and as you can

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,930
see there's some interesting activity

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,009
going on here

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,780
suddenly in the summer of 2016 we see a

00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:35,600
huge peak and people are curious about

00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:38,330
this mysterious AR thing that they've

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,180
just sort of and this is when Pokemon go

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,740
is released so all of a sudden we have

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,419
people using this cool new app and

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,850
wondering like whoa what is augmented

00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:49,580
reality and I want what else is possible

00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:53,750
with this thing this opened up this was

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:56,449
probably the most popular AR application

00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,759
although as we'll see it's not fully AR

00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:02,270
capable and they're working on that

00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:04,430
application fully AR pokemon go soon but

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,490
this really opened people consumers eyes

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:11,330
into the possibilities of AR and really

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:14,000
showed the potential for its scale then

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:17,419
later in more recent years around the

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,190
fall of 2017 we have another peak that's

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:22,580
starting to rise and although it's not

00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:24,229
as high as pokemon go this was from AR

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,030
core and era kit which were announced

00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:27,590
roughly around the same time and these

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,949
are developer kits that will allow

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:34,240
people to build experiences such as

00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:38,180
Pokemon go and much easier and much more

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,340
streamlined way so it's a quick

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,500
definition air core is a platform for

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,620
building augmented reality apps on

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Android and AR kit is Apple's version

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:52,940
for building AR apps on iOS looking back

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,580
a few more years this is as far back as

00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,169
you can go on Google Trends from 2004

00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,960
you see that there's actually some

00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:02,210
activity going on people are actually

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,970
interested and aware of augmented

00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:07,550
reality especially around 2009 so that

00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,979
was almost 10 years ago and why does it

00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,080
seem like it's such a new thing now this

00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:15,830
is when AR tool kit was released for web

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,570
it's an open-source toolkit I guess if

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,440
you want to compare it to AR core and AR

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:25,639
kit this allowed developers to build

00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:27,979
web-based applications so this was

00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:29,960
actually the output would be flash based

00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:32,150
so this is one of the reasons why it

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,520
didn't really take on because users have

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:36,320
to install a plug-in and then they kind

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,830
of have to like use their webcam in a

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,820
weird way that it doesn't feel natural

00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,440
compared to a mobile device

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,270
where you can take it around with you

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,030
and it makes more sense to like kind of

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:51,500
point at what you want to project your

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:53,780
AR object onto so this really shows it

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,930
state the documentation of AR toolkit or

00:06:53,780 --> 00:07:01,010
this publication about it describes what

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,930
AR toolkit is it shows a our toolkit in

00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:06,440
action and as you can see it's marker

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:09,440
based so they have this code where it

00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,050
will project the the object from the

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,050
code and then in the documentation you

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:16,670
can also see that it's using Windows XP

00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:21,230
and telling you how to use a webcam on

00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:22,880
your computer then later in 2009 we have

00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:26,710
the introduction of augmented reality

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:30,380
into the real world so Esquire post

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:32,150
Esquire published this issue it was an

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,100
augmented reality special and on the

00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:36,230
front cover you had this QR code that

00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:39,290
you could scan and then something

00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:41,260
magical happens Robert Downey Downey jr.

00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,760
comes out of the screen and starts like

00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,320
acknowledging you and then there was

00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,360
also as you saw in the previous screen

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,090
there's there were 12 pages of a our

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,090
content and lots of publications we're

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:56,480
talking about it and it was really

00:07:52,090 --> 00:08:00,050
becoming more noticeable to consumers so

00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:03,650
fast forwarding to today we have back in

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,420
2012 Google Hangouts filters which is

00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,090
actually long before snapchat which many

00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,820
people don't know snapchats world lenses

00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:13,340
we have a huge advancement of

00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:16,210
head-mounted displays like the microsoft

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:19,870
hololens and then of course pokemon goes

00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:23,840
very well known and the IKEA went of

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:27,170
Ikea like he is a furniture app from

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,790
Apple's Apple Store so what's making

00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,160
this possible today is that we have much

00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,719
more powerful devices much more powerful

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,479
browsers that will hopefully soon be

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,580
capable of a our developers are more

00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,039
well equipped with toolkits like AR core

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,289
and air kit and hopefully future support

00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,590
on the web will help to bring this

00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:47,990
technology to the masses so let's go

00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:53,050
back to basis and basics and talk about

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:53,050
what defines augmented reality apps

00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,700
so air Corrigan is the software

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,460
developer kit that allows developers to

00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:03,830
use these defining air features in AR in

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:06,440
Android applications and these defining

00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,150
features include motion tracking which

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,680
allows the device to understand and

00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,290
track its position relative to the real

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,180
world so a scare coat you can place into

00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:15,529
the world and move around and it looks

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,410
like it's stationary just like these

00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:20,779
people next to it and environmental

00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,510
understanding so that the device can

00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:24,470
detect the size and location of

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,660
previously it was only horizontal

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,750
surfaces but now with the release of AR

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:31,130
core 1.0 you can also place it on

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,339
textured surfaces and there was this

00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:37,690
cool demo of placing things on the snow

00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:40,010
like around the tree it's pretty cool

00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,630
and then lighten estimation which allows

00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:43,600
the device to estimate the lighting

00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,529
conditions and this really helps bring

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,230
objects to life because even the

00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:52,130
subtleties like shadows and brightness

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:58,250
can really make an object in in the real

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:59,900
world look real so previously we have we

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,850
had a platformer called tango which

00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:05,270
allowed augmented reality on these

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:07,160
really powerful devices but as these

00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,660
were very specialized we decided we

00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,140
wanted to bring this to the masses and

00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,839
that's when we really focus our efforts

00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:17,360
from late last year on a our core which

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,779
will make it make augmented reality

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,700
possible on more Android devices so that

00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:24,320
is a huge challenge but also a really

00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,600
big opportunity the fact that there are

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,970
two billion plus active devices out

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:32,110
there running on Android and each of

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:34,790
these has their own unique hardware

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:37,370
requirements and hardware specs that we

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,959
have to make sure align and provide the

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,839
same high quality experience that we

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,640
want all users to have so currently with

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,560
the most recent release it works on 100

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,240
million devices which includes 13 unique

00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,270
models that you see here and we're

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:54,170
working with partners to make sure that

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:56,540
more devices can support this and going

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,940
back to AR kits this is a software

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,970
developer kit allowing developers to use

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,040
the same essential features in iOS 11

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,010
the way to describe it it's it's very

00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:10,940
similar to the three basic

00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:13,880
features that that Eric or suggest those

00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:17,170
are basically essential AR features not

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:20,180
AR core like there there's they can be

00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:24,320
described for any element to the reality

00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:27,410
out and their device compatibility is

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,960
all most recent Apple devices so with a

00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:32,390
nine plus a nine chip we're above

00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:35,180
running iOS 11 and up so that includes

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:39,170
iPhone 6s setup and some of the newer

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,630
iPads so let's talk about building for

00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,370
web because all of this air core and air

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,080
kit allows you to build native apps but

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,030
this is a j/s conference so you guys are

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,480
probably bored thinking about building

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:54,410
an F we want to build for web so let's

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,010
see what's possible air core currently

00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:59,930
has an experiment where they're

00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,250
exploring the possibilities of web

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,900
support which would be awesome because

00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,240
it will lower the barrier to entry and

00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:09,530
people can build apps and release them

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:11,870
to out to the web so this is like a pre

00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:13,670
standards experimentation just trying to

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,430
see what's explore what's possible and

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,520
it's basically a wrapper of chromium and

00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:22,580
it's extending web VR features so that

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:26,240
it's really scalable and allows for

00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:28,040
fallbacks and across multiple devices so

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,990
they have this cool demo called article

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,550
which you can download on github

00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,610
just npm install all the dependencies

00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:39,710
and run it on the web pack server and

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:41,690
it's super easy and just to explain air

00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,940
core for web is not one single entity

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:48,020
it's basically you're building a web app

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:50,420
with a our capabilities you're using JSI

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:52,430
Ares to build the 3d objects and then

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,020
you are running it on this experimental

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,460
browser that's supposed to emulate what

00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,410
the web standards might look like and

00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,210
currently they have experimental

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,910
browsers that work on both Android and

00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,860
iOS so they're called err where they are

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:10,760
on air core and web a are on air kit

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:14,420
respectively and most of the examples on

00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:16,490
the web a are for air core demos are

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,890
built with three Jas it's a really

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,540
popular 3d modeling library that's been

00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:22,670
used since 2010

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,070
some of Google's projects have used it

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,320
including the poly library this

00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,680
educational experience experience called

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,180
inter land and all of these other cool

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,760
Google and on Google experiments that

00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,610
you see here and it allows you to create

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,650
3d shapes animations complex scenes and

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:41,930
gives you some tools to make this a lot

00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:45,080
easier for you because as you'll find 3d

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,100
modeling concepts are really hard so

00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,980
this is one of the tools that it

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:53,090
provides it's an in-browser kind of

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:54,110
shape editor or scene editor and it

00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:56,930
allows you to control all these

00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:59,930
different parameters and it's a really

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,280
good way to kind of start learning 3d

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,930
modeling and especially if you haven't

00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,030
been paying attention in math class like

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:07,580
I did you have to relearn kind of UV

00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:09,680
mapping and vectors and matrix

00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,290
multiplication and it really sometimes

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,790
it's a little bit overwhelming but with

00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,520
tools like this it becomes a lot easier

00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:20,330
and if you get good you can make some

00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:22,370
crazy 3d shapes like this but if you are

00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:25,810
having trouble with 3d modeling you can

00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,740
also download some models on poly and

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:31,010
find all these different kinds of

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:32,300
cheeseburgers anything like just

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,620
basically search for the term and you'll

00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,770
find different items that are tagged

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:38,060
with that description and if you really

00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,400
like these cheeseburgers you can just

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,000
put it all together start throwing them

00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,810
in the air

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:49,250
and then that's your AR app so just to

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,740
just to highlight what's possible with

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:53,570
three days this is one of the apps that

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,550
my team has built called Qibla finder

00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,920
and it helps people find the direction

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:01,460
of Qibla which is the direction of

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,620
prayer during Ramadan and basically we

00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,390
use three J s but they are core and AIRC

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,580
it were not yet available and this was

00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:10,160
also a web app so we kind of had to get

00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:15,700
creative and this is basically just

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:19,550
using WebRTC to use the camera and

00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:22,280
navigation api's and basically it's

00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:25,130
projecting this into space rather than

00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:27,680
as we've learned as an essential AR

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:30,350
feature it doesn't allow you to kind of

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,670
place it onto a detected surface so it's

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,800
it's a kind of like faux AR but it

00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,270
um I guess you can compare it to

00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,640
pokemons go where you're not really

00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:43,750
placing the you're not really throwing

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:45,400
the pokeball onto the the Pokemon that's

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,680
it's not on the floor it's kind of just

00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,510
like sometimes it's floating around so

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,600
that's kind of one distinction of what's

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:55,300
possible with three J s and how we need

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,300
to bridge the gap so to bridge those

00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,730
gaps there is a library called three rjs

00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:04,090
which kind of detects the device

00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:06,610
compatibility and enables the AR Web

00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:09,550
utilities by interfacing with the web VR

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,560
extension that is exposed by the

00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,570
experimental browsers so that's what's

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:18,040
allowing you to throw things onto

00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:19,390
surfaces and detect it with precision so

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,340
putting it all together you can create

00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:24,940
some really useful apps like for example

00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,950
this living room modeling there's some

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,510
really useful things you can do for

00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,040
consumers to make this really widely

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:32,920
adopted and especially if it's available

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:35,590
for the web then people can just reach

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,960
these experiment experiences from a link

00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:43,030
and access them if their device is

00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:44,800
compatible so again the web AR on-air

00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,330
core implementation is just an

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,180
exploration right now to explore what's

00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:51,130
possible and what might be potential web

00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,800
standards but there are also a lot more

00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,930
web implementations for example Mozilla

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,910
has their web X our standards proposal

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:00,520
which there's a lot of commonalities

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,230
between the different pre standards

00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,390
proposals right now so that's a good

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:05,830
sign that things are starting to align

00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,320
and hopefully we have some standards

00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:11,050
soon there's also the Argonne browser

00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,820
and Argonne jeaious and I think one of

00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:16,180
the most popular ones might be the

00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:18,640
marker based a rjs and if you recognize

00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,590
the markers from my earlier slides it's

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:25,630
because it's based on a our tool kit so

00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:27,370
it goes way back so with all of these

00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,380
standards that are not really fully in

00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:31,450
place why should we care about it now

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,920
like what if it changes and stressing

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:36,940
you guys out to learn all these new

00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:39,010
things but as you know with 3d modeling

00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,480
it's it's a really big concept to grasp

00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,400
and if you start learning it now like

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,260
there's a lot to catch up on people are

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,270
already using 3GS and have been 3d

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,530
modeling for decades so it's really good

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,450
if you're interested in it now and

00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,340
you should start equipping yourself with

00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,260
the basic knowledge to get started and

00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,180
people are already building really cool

00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:58,210
stuff right now

00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:01,600
so some sources of inspiration there's

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:04,090
some AR core specific examples on this

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,100
is AR core calm there's also an AR kit

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,790
version at the bottom there and one of

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:12,040
my personal favorites is this one from

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:14,530
Jericho / AR experiments which just

00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,270
features some of Google's I mean not

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,490
biased or anything but some of Google's

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,380
AR experiments but one of the reasons

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,540
why I love it so much is that half of

00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,370
the experiments on there were created by

00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,410
women so that's really awesome to show

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:30,580
that representation in the web XR

00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:32,530
community and going back to Ivan

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,300
Sutherland the Harvard professor who

00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,950
created the first headband to display

00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,510
he said that the screen is a window

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,550
through which one sees a virtual world

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:42,280
and the challenge is to make that world

00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:44,650
look real act real sound real and feel

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,960
real so with all these technological

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,100
advancements in the past century or so I

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,910
think we're we're getting really close

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:54,550
to that and although we might not be

00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:56,800
close to these know really complex head

00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:58,360
not to displays I can control an armored

00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,190
suit or anything I think it's really

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,530
exciting that we can we're getting

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,270
really close to building web-based AR

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,950
applications because that's is what's

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,080
really gonna make AR become more

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,200
widespread so thank you guys for

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,200
listening

00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,650
