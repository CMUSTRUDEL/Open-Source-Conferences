1 in 5 Americans are living with a mental illness such as depression, bipolar, anxiety, or ADHD. As a community, the single most damaging thing we can do is perpetuate the stigma against mental disorders. This talk will begin with an overview of key statistics about mental wellness, followed by the efforts of the non-profit organization Open Sourcing Mental Illness to gather more data about mental health in the tech industry, and conclude with the bulk of the talk focusing on ideas and strategies for making our tech workplaces more accommodating and inclusive.

can you all hear me okay all right oh

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:11,250
cool so my name is Nora Casper again I'm

00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,719
here from Washington DC and my talk is

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,820
called empathy as a service supporting

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,560
mental health in the tech workplace and

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,210
I'm actually gonna save most of my self

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,800
introduction for the second part of the

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,810
talk I first want to cover some of the

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,160
statistics and definitions and things

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,390
like that related to mental health and

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,640
mental illness to make sure that we're

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,529
all kind of on the same page here

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,960
then I'll go more into my own story and

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,369
why this is so important to me but then

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,920
the bulk of the talk is really going to

00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,920
be focused on things all of us can do in

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,530
our own workplaces and our own lives

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,910
common sense action-oriented things that

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,250
we can all put into action to support

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,750
mental health better and then there's a

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,879
short section on the end on things that

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,829
we all have to do together or

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,480
essentially it's it's more difficult and

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,260
more aspirational but still needs to be

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,510
done so first what are we talking about

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,030
so if there's anything that I want you

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,160
all to walk away from here with it's

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,049
this statistic it's that one in five

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,840
adults are living with mental illness at

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,220
any given time that's a huge number in

00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,360
fact it basically means that mental

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,460
illness is one of the most prevalent

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,200
chronic health conditions but if you

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,540
think about it we really don't ever talk

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,830
about it

00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,689
and to be clear when I say mental

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,900
illness I'm talking about any one of

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,250
these when some of these may you may

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,470
have heard of before some of these you

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,270
may not have another thing is there's

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,829
this phenomenon called comorbidities

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,630
which means that when you have one of

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,000
these illnesses it also often makes you

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,770
more prone to develop another illness so

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,990
for example depression and anxiety often

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,570
go together depression and substance use

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:43,020
disorder ADHD and anxiety often go

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,450
together etc to that I wanted to kind of

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,200
point out specifically our autism

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,210
spectrum disorders and burnout so autism

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,060
spectrum disorders are kind of part of

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,549
this bigger umbrella term of mental

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,020
disorders but they're often accompanied

00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,820
by other things like learning

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:03,780
disabilities sometimes also physical

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,189
health issues and so they often require

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,590
their own kinds of treatments and

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,959
interventions etc so organizations that

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,480
focus on activism around mental health

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,750
often focus either on some of the rest

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,120
of these like depression and

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,710
xiety or autism spectrum disorder

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,950
specifically just because there was

00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,480
required more specialized treatments and

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,030
so I'm not going to talk too much about

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,530
autism spectrum disorders today because

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,150
the organization that I work with is

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,590
focused more on the other kinds of

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,420
mental illnesses but there's still quite

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,650
a bit of overlap and a lot of what I'm

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,230
going to talk about is still relevant

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,550
for autism as well and then obviously

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,830
we're gonna be talking a lot about the

00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,740
workplace so I wanted to call out the

00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:44,620
idea of burnout especially in the United

00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,300
States were where I come from when the

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,270
idea of burnout was introduced in the

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,860
1970s there was quite a bit of pushback

00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,300
people said you know that's silly the

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,940
whole idea that you can get sick from

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,070
working too much so I did some research

00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,350
and looked into you know where are we at

00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,300
in 2018 what does the research nowadays

00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,830
say and most psychologists actually

00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,050
agreed that burnout is actually

00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,640
depression they did a lot of studies

00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,930
that show that at the end of the day on

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,640
when they control for all kinds of

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,550
factors the symptoms are essentially the

00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,140
same but it is essentially depression

00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,970
with a very specific cause which is

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,400
prolonged stress from working too much

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,510
so it's fine to continue to refer to it

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,000
as burnout we don't have to say

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,799
depression necessarily but I just

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,330
figured since we're gonna be talking

00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,060
about the workplace that's an important

00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:30,250
thing to know about but a big problem

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,200
with mental illness is that there's

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:34,000
often kind of preconceived notions about

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,190
what that means so if I say mental

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,239
illness to a random stranger chances are

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:40,900
they're gonna think of something like

00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:43,150
schizophrenia but in fact depression in

00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,040
particular is one of the most common

00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,220
mental illnesses and it's at least 13

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,959
times more prevalent than schizophrenia

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,790
another big problem is there's lots of

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,450
misunderstandings about things like the

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:57,489
symptoms of depression so we often

00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,160
associated with things like feelings of

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:02,620
sadness emptiness loss of interest and

00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,019
pleasure in normal activities and

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,790
tiredness and lack of energy but there's

00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:08,500
actually a whole spectrum of emotions

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,060
that's possible when you're suffering

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,860
from depression so it can also include

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,900
things like angry outbursts and

00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,730
irritability any kind of sleep

00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,340
disturbances which can be insomnia or

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:20,019
sleeping too much any kind of changes in

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,270
appetite and anxiety agitation or

00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,010
restlessness and in fact one thing that

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,510
they're finding recently is that when

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,550
women experience depression they're much

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,110
more likely to experience the

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,129
of sadness and emptiness and loss of

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,199
interest and pleasure in normal

00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:33,460
activities whereas one men experience

00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,740
depression they're much more likely to

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,360
have symptoms like the angry outbursts

00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,879
and irritability and anxiety agitation

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,680
and restlessness and so because we don't

00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,840
often associate those with depression

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,500
men are more likely to not even realize

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,789
that they're suffering from depression

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,319
another problem with the depression in

00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:52,449
particular is that we tend to shame

00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,780
people for feeling this way and a lot of

00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:57,220
people with depression or often say that

00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,259
they'll hear things like I can't believe

00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:02,319
you are feeling sad when kids in Africa

00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:03,520
are starving and there's a report to

00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,870
this that does its rounds on the

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,250
internet every couple of months that I

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,110
think is really powerful that says

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,490
telling someone not to be sad because

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,780
others have it worse is like telling

00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:14,860
people they can't be happy because

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:17,229
others have it better another really

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,940
great illustration of the stigma against

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,099
mental illness is from this webcomic

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,449
called robot hugs

00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,340
it's called helpful advice and the

00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,960
subtitle here is a physical illness were

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,430
treated like mental illness so just in

00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,620
case you can't read the captions I'll

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:31,000
read them out loud on the left it says I

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,319
get that you have food poisoning at all

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,930
but you have to at least make an effort

00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,190
on the right you just need to change

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,440
your frame of mind then you'll feel

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,030
better

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,729
have you tried you know not having the

00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,259
flu I don't think it's healthy that you

00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:44,889
have to take medication every day just

00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:46,569
to feel normal

00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,930
don't you worry that it's changing you

00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:50,770
from who you really are it's like you're

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,229
not even trying

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,699
and while lying in bed obviously isn't

00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:58,360
helping you you need to try something

00:05:54,699 --> 00:05:59,740
else and all of the stigma and all of

00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,020
the shame is a really big problem

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,870
because even in high-income countries

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,800
like Iceland and the United States

00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,539
anywhere from thirty five to fifty

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,020
percent of people with mental disorders

00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:12,729
do not receive any kind of treatment and

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,830
that's a problem because for example

00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:18,550
with severe depression 15 percent of

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,719
people end up dying by suicide so when

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,130
the stakes are so high you would think

00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:22,560
that people would speak up but the

00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:25,180
reason they don't is because of fear

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,289
things like fear of dismissal fear of

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,389
being taken out of promotion

00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:30,460
consideration fear of being taken off

00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:32,979
high value projects and contracts fear

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,210
of reduced hours for hourly workers fear

00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:36,550
of being asked to take unpaid medical

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,279
leave and just in general of fear being

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,960
treated differently and another problem

00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,759
in the workplace and

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,020
in western countries is that we have

00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:45,580
this idea of you should leave your

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,650
personal life at home when you come to

00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,270
work but that doesn't work when you have

00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,729
mental illness you can't just shut off

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,349
your depression for eight hours a day

00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:54,550
come to work work productively and then

00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:57,250
come home and deal with your depression

00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,660
again for better or worse it's a part of

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,250
you and we have to do a better job of

00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:04,449
accepting people as their whole selves

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:06,130
so now I'll talk a little bit about

00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,050
myself and why I speak up about this and

00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,639
I legitimately get asked this question a

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:12,190
lot because I am a software engineer

00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,810
just like all of you I'm not a mental

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,759
health professional I've taken one

00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:19,030
psychology class in my entire life I

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,280
actually went to art school twice I also

00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,720
identify as mentally healthy and that

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,039
makes me a little bit unusual because

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,419
there are others who speak up about this

00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:26,740
topic and they usually do so because

00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:30,070
they are living with mental illness

00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,949
themselves but the reason why I speak up

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,840
is because of her this is my best friend

00:07:32,949 --> 00:07:36,520
me she and I met about seven years ago

00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,130
when we were both living in New York

00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,380
City at the time she had just moved

00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,389
there from Seattle she had studied

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,340
biochemical and her parents really

00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:46,750
wanted her to go to medical school but

00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,190
she was interested in designing

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,900
technology and she convinced this

00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,099
company to give her a web development

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:55,960
fellowship where she could basically

00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:58,780
learn the tools of the job on the job so

00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,120
she she and I headed off immediately he

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,310
became really close and she was doing

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,659
really well at work and after about a

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,699
year and a half in New York City she

00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:09,099
realized that the next best thing that

00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:10,810
she could do to advance her career was

00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:13,659
to move to San Francisco and work at a

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,919
startup so obviously I was sad to see

00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,349
her go but thanks to modern technology

00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:20,199
we kept in touch and still talked all

00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:22,719
the time but when she got to San

00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,000
Francisco her imposter syndrome started

00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:26,979
becoming more of a problem coming from

00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,219
kind of a non-traditional background in

00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:31,630
tech and that was an issue because she

00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:35,050
had been living most of her adult life

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:37,209
with bipolar disorder but we thought she

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,010
was doing okay we thought she was doing

00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:42,729
better and so it kind of took us all by

00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:46,480
surprise when September 2 in September

00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:47,800
2016 she took her own life so all of

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,180
this is still really difficult for me to

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,820
talk about so if you really want to know

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,179
more about this I wrote a very long blog

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,589
post about this on medium last year

00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:57,910
but after all of this happened and after

00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:00,040
I had a little bit of time to kind of

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,899
process this I realized that I really

00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,850
wanted to turn my grief into action I

00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:05,739
didn't want to just sit back and and

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:08,139
just continue to let this happen to

00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:09,189
people like me and so I started

00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:10,809
volunteering with this organization

00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:12,850
called open sourcing mental illness

00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:15,910
which was founded by this guy in the

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,920
right ed Fink ler he had been part of

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,199
the PHP conference speaker circuit for a

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,600
number of years and about four or five

00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:24,610
years ago he started speaking up about

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,769
his own experiences living with

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,179
generalized anxiety disorder in ADHD and

00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:31,480
how that affected his life as a

00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:33,100
developer and his career in tech and his

00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,899
talk actually resonated with a lot of

00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,579
people and so they finally decided to

00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:38,860
form a whole organization around it

00:09:36,579 --> 00:09:41,319
which is now an official 501 C 3

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,299
non-profit in the United States called

00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:46,689
open sourcing mental illness or Oh SMI

00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:48,759
and so awareness campaigns are a really

00:09:46,689 --> 00:09:51,279
big part of what OS mi does but we also

00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,720
have a research arm we put out the

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,769
survey every year called the mental

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,929
health and tech survey where we

00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:58,420
basically ask any and all of you who are

00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,829
working in the tech industry to answer

00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,720
these questions that allow us to gauge

00:09:59,829 --> 00:10:04,990
what the attitudes are towards mental

00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,490
health in tech and every year will

00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,769
change up the questions a little bit but

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,959
there's always kind of a variation of

00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:12,850
this one question which shows us that we

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,009
still have a lot of work to do it's

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,600
really to two variations of one question

00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:18,040
it's do you think that discussing a

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,290
physical health issue with your employer

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,519
would have negative consequences and do

00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,689
you think that discussing a mental

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,879
health issue with your employer would

00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:26,529
have negative consequences and so you

00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,559
can see on the left for the physical

00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:32,470
health question the nose make up pretty

00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:33,730
much 75% of all the responses but on the

00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,559
right for the mental health questions

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,749
the esses and the maybes make up about

00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:39,519
two-thirds of the pie that's a pretty

00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:42,699
striking difference and shows that we

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,069
still have a lot of work to you so I've

00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:46,419
been involved with OMI for almost a year

00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:48,129
and a half now and I would say that my

00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:49,869
biggest contribution in this community

00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:51,339
as someone who is mentally healthy has

00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:54,249
been to sit back and listen to people

00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:55,899
like IDI tell their stories and to try

00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:57,399
to empathize and think about what people

00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:59,799
like me can do and there have been times

00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:02,139
when that's legit illegitimate lis been

00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:04,899
tough but there was a quote that Ed used

00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:06,189
in one of his talks that I thought was

00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,860
really powerful and that really kind of

00:11:06,189 --> 00:11:08,660
opened my eye

00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,640
- what how I really needed to approach

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,390
this which was I could do so many

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,040
awesome things

00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:16,310
if only my own head didn't get in the

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,480
way and the first time I heard this I

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,700
just really stopped me in my tracks

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,530
because I realized my ability to do my

00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:24,350
job as a software engineer rests solely

00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,180
in my head I don't need muscles I'm not

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,650
a construction worker I really just get

00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,120
to go to work every day and take for

00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:31,490
granted that my brain is gonna do

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,850
everything that I tell it to do but

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:36,740
people like Edie can't do that and so I

00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,200
started kind of thinking about you know

00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,030
what if what if this is how I felt as I

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,250
went about my day how would that change

00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:45,500
things or how much would my environment

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,890
have to change in order to accommodate

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:51,080
this better and so that kind of led me

00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:54,050
down this path of thinking more about

00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,400
what can the rest of us do and so they

00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:57,080
got started with that I started just

00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,970
kind of characterizing the tech industry

00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,380
and thinking about what some of the the

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:02,750
unique kind of challenges and

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,070
characteristics are so things like the

00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,410
work is challenging is stressful

00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,990
our jobs are highly collaborative many

00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:10,550
of us have relocated for a job most of

00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,770
us work remotely at least part of the

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,420
time we're often expected to be

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,160
available outside work hours

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,230
someone needs to fix things when they

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,060
break overnight and there is a very hon

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,160
fit heavy emphasis on drinking culture

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:24,500
and so I started thinking about

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,030
relocation in particular because as I

00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,450
had mentioned my friend knee had

00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:31,100
relocated twice in order to work in tech

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,380
and one of her friends mentioned at the

00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,940
funeral that she had mentioned to them

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,130
recently that she kind of regretted not

00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,560
going back to Seattle where her family

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,360
was and so I was thinking about this a

00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,740
lot and thinking you know it can't be

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,230
all bad there have to be legit

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,150
legitimate reasons why we really

00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,440
relocate um so I just kind of started

00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,700
approaching it from that angle of

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,590
thinking about like what are the pros

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,240
and cons so on the positive side it

00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,320
makes that much easier to feel like

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,760
you're a part of the team and helping

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,280
towards the mission if you're on site

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,750
with everyone else or in these case it

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,340
can bring you closer to a community of

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,280
practitioners in your field compared to

00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,720
where you currently are but on the

00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,100
negative side it takes someone away from

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,780
the existing support structures that

00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,100
they've already built up like the

00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,140
therapists that they're seeing or the

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,400
friend whose house they can come to at

00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,310
1:00 in the morning because you really

00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,420
just need to have a good cry also moving

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,340
is generally always going to be

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,649
stressful and making new friends as an

00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,940
adult is surprisingly hard

00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:26,730
so I started thinking about solutions

00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:28,920
and I promise I'm going to focus more on

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:30,450
pragmatic ones but this one this first

00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,550
one is a little bit more aspirational

00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:34,019
but I very strongly believe that as a

00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,490
community we need to stop saying that

00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,560
the best way to succeed in tech is to

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,149
relocate to Silicon Valley that may have

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,920
been true about 15 years ago but I think

00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:43,170
things like remote work have come a long

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,620
way we need to become a lot more

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,120
accepting of alternative choices if you

00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,399
are a manager take another look at your

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,490
hiring practices and see whether hiring

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:55,410
remote first employees is an option and

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,730
finally if that's not an option if

00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,980
someone does have to relocate to join

00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,589
your company make sure that you focus on

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,970
helping introduce that colleagues to

00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:05,220
organizations and events in the area

00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:06,480
after hours essentially ways for them to

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,350
start building up those support

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,700
structures again so I mentioned remote

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,130
work as a positive and I think in

00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,390
general it is very positive for mental

00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,149
health and people struggling with mental

00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:20,970
illness for example it often leads to

00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,380
more flexible hours and that in turn is

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,480
good because it makes it much easier to

00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,950
attend daytime therapy appointments it

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,720
turns out that therapists like to work

00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:29,610
9:00 to 5:00 Monday to Friday like all

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,839
of the rest of us so if you want to

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,209
start seeing a therapist you're going to

00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:35,190
have to do that during the work day and

00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:37,350
so a lot of people that I've talked to

00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:39,060
have said working from home on the day

00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,410
that you see your therapist it's just so

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,930
much easier because you can just kind of

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,750
duck out with everyone knowing that

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,160
you're going somewhere else for similar

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,680
reasons that can also make it easier to

00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,779
stick to medication regimens it's often

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,520
easier to take breaks and in general

00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:56,279
it's more quiet and peaceful than being

00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,290
in the office but on the negative side

00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:00,180
there is a sense of isolation that sits

00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,740
in if especially if you're working from

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,230
home a hundred percent of the time and

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,790
I've had a couple of friends recently

00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,620
who I've started working completely

00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,699
remotely and it's always been

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,170
interesting because the first couple

00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:12,149
months of this kind there's this kind of

00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,520
honeymoon phase where like they're like

00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:16,529
this is amazing how why have I not been

00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:19,140
doing this my entire life I love working

00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:21,240
in my pajamas this is great but then

00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,130
after about two months that honeymoon

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,320
phase kind of wears off and the sense of

00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,760
isolation sets in and they start

00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,050
complaining that they're feeling lonely

00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,240
they're missing the watercooler

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:34,710
conversations the connections with their

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,750
their colleagues etc and along those

00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,800
Lions in general working remotely can

00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,030
make it harder to build strong

00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,010
relationships with your co-workers

00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,810
especially if you're the only one who's

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,850
remote and everyone else is on site

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,200
together and even if you're not

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,610
struggling with mental illness but you

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,170
just want to be a good supportive

00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:51,000
colleague it can make it harder to tell

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,980
if everyone's doing okay if you're

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,800
mostly just communicating by slack and

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,060
the occasional Skype call and it can

00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,530
also make it challenging to maintain a

00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,360
work-life balance especially if you're

00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:02,520
truly working from home and your home is

00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,020
your office I've heard from a lot of

00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,520
people that they just have difficulty

00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,350
saying okay it's five o'clock I'm not

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,820
gonna respond to work emails and slack

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:13,440
anymore so some of the solutions

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:17,100
co-working spaces I think are excellent

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,480
and really undervalued and I think one

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,950
of the biggest barriers to people trying

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,960
it out is that there is often an

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,390
initiation fee or a monthly fee that you

00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,280
have to pay so a good solution for this

00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,870
is to have the company at the very least

00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,550
pay for the first month so that that

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,650
person will be more likely to try it and

00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:32,880
see if it's for them and to be clear

00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,230
this is not something that you have to

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,730
do every day I've heard from a lot of

00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:38,070
people that even if they just go into a

00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,450
co-working space once a week it's still

00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,910
helpful and makes them feel less

00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,680
isolated

00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,390
also make sure you occasionally fly in

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,800
remote employees or hold company-wide

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,480
off sites to make sure like everyone

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,850
feels like they're part of the team and

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,980
they're getting a chance to bond

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,690
and finally there's just so much

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,400
research happening around remote work

00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,050
culture and how to make it better that

00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,670
there's so many resources that you can

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,130
leverage there's whole conferences

00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,690
around this now so just look into kind

00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:05,940
of what the latest kind of state of the

00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,320
art around remote work is try some

00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,690
things with your team if you find that

00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,010
you're still struggling and see if it

00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,510
works for you and if not try something

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:16,950
else there's there's just so many things

00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:18,480
to try so the first time that I was

00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,860
going to give this talk one of the

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,959
things that surprised me the most was

00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,580
someone came back and said so what about

00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,890
open-plan offices what are you planning

00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:28,860
to say about that and I actually had not

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:30,690
planned on saying anything at all but so

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,360
I figured okay this is a good question

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,310
so let me do some research so on the

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,230
positive side they are more conducive to

00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,550
collaboration kratom creative

00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,620
problem-solving between multiple

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,420
employees people having more organic

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,560
conversations that lead to solutions

00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,840
that no one had thought of on their own

00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,400
etc I used to think that that's why

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,390
everyone did it but it turns out that

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,710
it's actually

00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,360
because it's just easier to construct

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:55,590
offices that way because of things like

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:57,330
building fire codes it could also can

00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,950
increase a sense of team unity or

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,330
camaraderie but I really want to

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,800
emphasize the can here because if

00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:03,060
there's already friction on the team

00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,600
then it can actually increase it

00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,890
resentment instead but on the negative

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,900
side the number one complaint about

00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:12,930
open-plan offices is the noise and how

00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,580
it reduces productivity from a mental

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,800
health perspective I think the biggest

00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,900
concern is the lack of privacy when I

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,670
talked about remote work before when I

00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,620
said you know working from home makes it

00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,840
easier to duck out in the afternoon for

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,400
your like therapy appointments this is

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,860
kind of the exact opposite right you're

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,180
working very closely with everyone so if

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,440
you need to duck out for the therapy

00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,410
appointment everyone's going to know

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,510
about it people also have cited an

00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,940
increased sense of stress and there's

00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,770
also increased peer pressure and this is

00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,630
a problem for mental health because I

00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:44,040
think it's quite off it happens quite

00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,900
often to us as developers where

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,400
sometimes we just get stuck and we

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,470
realized that the absolute best thing

00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,210
that we can do for ourselves is just to

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,010
take a break for maybe like 20 minutes

00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:55,140
go take a walk around the block do

00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,000
something completely different but what

00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,440
often happens in open-plan offices is

00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,940
you look around and everyone else has

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,070
bent over their desks and they look

00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,720
productive and what happens in that case

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,000
is you talk yourself out of taking that

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,440
break and that's actually the worst

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,320
possible thing that you can do for

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,600
yourself in that moment and finally

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,130
open-plan offices are are also highly

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,820
conducive to the spread of physical

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:19,950
disease like the cold the flu etc so

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,540
again I'm focusing on pragmatic

00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,070
solutions so I love to come up here and

00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,290
say we should not have open-plan offices

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,120
anymore but I think the vast majority of

00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:30,210
us are not in the position to make that

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,220
call so then the next easiest and best

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,680
thing to do is to make sure that

00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,960
everyone is allowed to work remotely or

00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,100
if they are already maybe increase the

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,250
number of days per week or per month

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,900
when they can do so also regardless

00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,700
always urge your employees to work from

00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,110
home when they're sick don't have them

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,350
bring the cold or the flu into the

00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:51,900
office maybe try setting aside small

00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:54,240
meeting spaces for quiet work I work in

00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:56,160
a pretty big office and I think for

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,510
those of us with big offices one thing

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,980
that happens is there's always that one

00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,560
conference room that's actually too

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,470
small to have a productive meeting in so

00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,929
maybe just that

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,429
one aside for people to check out for

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:08,260
like an hour if they realize that they

00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:09,640
just need a bit of quiet time in the

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:13,380
afternoon where they can get some

00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:15,340
productive work done also have the

00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,870
company provide noise cancelling

00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,760
headphones this is often the easiest

00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:20,950
solution that everyone turns to first

00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,630
and it does work pretty effectively and

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,309
then finally encourage employees to

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,010
decorate their workspace and this might

00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:30,490
sound on the surface like it has nothing

00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:32,470
to do with improving offices and

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,950
productivity at all but the research has

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:37,809
actually says the out the opposite

00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,580
there was a 2014 study done in Sweden

00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:42,220
where they tested out different office

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,690
configurations and they had their the

00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,190
people who worked in them basically rate

00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,380
how these office configurations made

00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,390
them feel and the one that was rated the

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,270
worst interestingly enough especially

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,830
among men was the open-plan Flex office

00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:56,350
which is an open plan office where no

00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,270
one has their own desk and there was a

00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,740
2010 study done that was done in the UK

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,510
where they compared people who had

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,860
decorated and personalized the workspace

00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,390
and people who hadn't and they found

00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,980
that the people who had decorated their

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,380
workspaces were actually one-third more

00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:12,490
productive so as silly as it sounds

00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:14,860
these life hacks actually work and then

00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:17,380
alcohol tech events so this is kind of a

00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,850
controversial one but let me go through

00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,520
the kind of positives and negatives

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,020
first so one or two drinks can make it

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,580
easier for some introverts and those

00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,049
with social anxiety to socialize with

00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,200
their peers and I'm guilty of this

00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:30,850
myself and the next one is a bit of a

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,409
positive negative but if you don't offer

00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,360
alcohol than those who want to drink

00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:36,429
will go to a bar instead of staying to

00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,049
mingle with others at your event so

00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:39,370
conferences like this one that's often

00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:41,049
the reason why they say they have

00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,900
alcohol they want everyone to stay here

00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,770
and and kind of socialize and network

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,090
because that's the whole point of why

00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:49,840
we're doing we're having conferences

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:51,549
like this but on the negative side it

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,400
makes non-drinkers feel unwelcome in

00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:56,350
general and if you're a recovering

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,789
alcoholic then you're definitely going

00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,370
to feel threatened by the kind of event

00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:04,450
where alcohol is flowing three flowing

00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:06,039
freely and to be clear alcoholism is

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:09,130
substance use disorder is a mental

00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:10,750
illness and in general Frio alcoholic

00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,980
drinking culture are so pervasive that

00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,600
they're probably more functioning

00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,600
alcoholics and tectum were even aware of

00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:21,290
so some of the solutions i personnaly a

00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,850
mountain of dual saying no one should

00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:25,520
ever have alcohol attack events again I

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,170
think there's like intermediate steps

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,300
that we can try in the meantime one

00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:30,800
thing that some places have tried that

00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,940
actually work pretty well are for

00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,430
example making sure that you always

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,750
offer nice alternatives things like the

00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:38,240
fancy sodas that come in the glass

00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,560
bottles or even mocktails to make sure

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,570
that nong drinkers feel like they're

00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,280
included I've heard from several non

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,470
drinkers that often the biggest insult

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,300
to them is to get to the after-party and

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:48,860
everyone else is getting like customized

00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,320
cocktails and they just get some like

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,810
lukewarm sodas where they have to like

00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,210
fill their own ice so make sure that

00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:57,860
you're treating everyone equally also

00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:59,120
put a limit on the number of free drinks

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,310
that you give out use some kind of

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,990
ticket or token system and people

00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,370
usually do this for budget reasons but

00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,690
it ends up working out well for health

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,490
reasons as well because the way it

00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,680
usually works is you'll get like two

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:12,080
free drink tickets and after that it

00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,610
turns into a cash bar but what that

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,200
leads to is someone will have their two

00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,610
free drinks and they'll be thinking

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,860
about do I want to take out my wallet to

00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:20,300
pay for that third drink and what often

00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,160
happens then is that they'll realize

00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,870
actually I have a pretty good buzz going

00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,030
and maybe I don't need that third drink

00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,380
so then they're not getting drunk and

00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:31,220
you don't have to deal with those kinds

00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,840
of health consequences also always make

00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,820
sure that you have activities other than

00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,190
drinking it turns out that there's a

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,530
pretty big overlap between developers

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,910
and people who like playing board games

00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,140
so you would think that more tech events

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:45,290
would have things like a board game

00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:47,060
night if you're having a recurring

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,310
series of events like a weekly company

00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,410
happy hour or a monthly meetup maybe

00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,330
just try alternating dry and written on

00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:54,920
dry events so don't cut out the alcohol

00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,410
completely but you don't have to do it

00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,940
every single time

00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:01,880
and then finally add workplace wellness

00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,200
programs on substance abuse I think

00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,120
these are the kind of thing where most

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,040
of us will roll our eyes at them when

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,440
they happen but research has shown that

00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,000
they're actually relatively effective it

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,010
turns out that most of us just need that

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,860
periodic reminder that there are serious

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:19,990
consequences to drinking too much and

00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:22,550
that reinforcement is just very helpful

00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:24,500
for managers and tech leads and senior

00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,660
devs I think overall the biggest piece

00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,120
of advice is just to lead by example on

00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,750
things like not micromanaging leaving

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,670
the office on

00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,010
I'm taking regular vacations yourself

00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:36,470
not sending our answering emails at 2:00

00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,940
a.m. if possible being receptive to

00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,740
feedback on your own performance in

00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,360
addition giving people feedback on their

00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,950
performance and being a good listener

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,780
and really the only thing that I would

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,460
say that's kind of unique to to mental

00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,410
health is that you should try to be more

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,330
open to talking about your own health or

00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,640
mental health or maybe something that

00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:54,800
happened in your family because it turns

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,440
out that really your number-one goal

00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,450
should be for your employees or your

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,010
reports to come to you and say hey look

00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:03,440
I'm struggling with this issue I might

00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,960
need an accommodation that sort of thing

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,860
but people are not gonna do that if you

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,540
haven't been a little bit more

00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,090
vulnerable and open about some things

00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,920
that you yourself have struggled with so

00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:14,450
it sounds really counterintuitive I feel

00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,950
like most of us by the time that we get

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:19,280
to like that senior level we feel like

00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:21,290
we should be like completely invincible

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,920
but actually being vulnerable is

00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:27,380
probably one of your best assets some

00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,610
other action items for managers make

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,690
sure your employees understand their

00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:32,390
benefits and what mental health

00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,040
treatments are covered revisit your

00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,540
hiring practices with an eye to mental

00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,030
illness and neurodiversity and I'll talk

00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:40,550
more about neurodiversity in a minute

00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:41,990
make sure employees feel valued in our

00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,360
own projects that they find fulfilling

00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:45,740
and empowering and this might sound on

00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,120
the surface like it has nothing at all

00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,920
to do with mental health but I would say

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,110
like this is the single biggest takeaway

00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,280
for me and my time with osm eye and

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:54,110
listening to other people tell their

00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,700
stories is that I've noticed a trend

00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,830
that when people are saying like I feel

00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,210
like my depression is starting to come

00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,760
back I feel like my symptoms are getting

00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:03,890
worse it's often accompanied by change

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,870
at work at work so they got put on a

00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:07,250
different project they feel like they're

00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:09,710
not getting as many opportunities to

00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:12,590
give feedback or make changes in the

00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:14,180
process the management is just not being

00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:17,390
transparent about why they're doing this

00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,880
etc etc so making sure people that

00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,320
making sure people feel valued and are

00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,920
feeling fulfilled is actually really

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:27,140
important for mental wellness as well

00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,520
get the oh so my handbooks they are on

00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,310
the OS and my website but you can also

00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,980
get them directly from lean pub two of

00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,720
them deal with the Americans with

00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,700
Disabilities Act so they're probably

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,230
only relevant if you're in the US but

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,730
the third one talks about how to start a

00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,440
mental wellness program in your

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,820
workplace and that would be a great one

00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,220
for everyone here to check

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:49,130
and then finally consider offering the

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,510
Mental Health First Aid training so

00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:52,130
Mental Health First Aid is this

00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:56,270
international program that was started

00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:58,310
in Australia and is available in all of

00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:00,290
these countries in Europe the US and

00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:04,100
Canada I believe in India and Nepal as

00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:05,690
well it's either 8 hours or 12 hours and

00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,220
the whole focus of it is to basically

00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:08,930
teach you how to respond if you

00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,240
encounter someone having a mental health

00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:13,490
crisis and I've heard from many people

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,980
that they they found it very useful as a

00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:19,340
sort of empathy training essentially as

00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:21,080
well so if you're trying to find sort of

00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:24,380
the most effective way to really truly

00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:26,150
get everyone to to respond to mental

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,670
health better in your company this is

00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:31,580
probably the best thing that you can do

00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:32,990
and can sometimes be challenging to

00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,610
actually attend the training there

00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,530
they're often kind of limited and where

00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:38,390
and when they're given if you're based

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,650
in Iceland obviously it's not even one

00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:42,080
of the countries on the list but what

00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:44,450
you can do is actually bring in a

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,950
trainer to give the training on-site and

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,720
that's a great way it's often even

00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:50,000
cheaper than just having one person

00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,170
attend the training by themselves so

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,880
that's a great way to make sure that all

00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,620
of your employees get trained or

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:59,330
everyone on the management team got

00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:01,130
trained etc so finally I'll spend just a

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,480
couple of minutes talking about the

00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,970
stuff that we all have to do together

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,350
where everyone has to do their part the

00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,370
first really big thing is making sure

00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:09,100
that we're always supporting

00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:11,450
marginalized people in the tech industry

00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,370
and this is important because chronic

00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,950
harassment bullying and microaggressions

00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,360
can lead to depression exacerbate eating

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:19,700
disorders and cause or worsen

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,470
other mental illnesses and people are

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,120
often surprised when I mentioned eating

00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:25,130
disorders in the context of tech they're

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,160
like well we're not models we're not

00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:30,260
actresses how why does it matter how you

00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,490
look but it turns out that even in tech

00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,670
women are still judged by their

00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:36,350
appearance in sort of the Silicon Valley

00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:38,360
startup culture in particular I've heard

00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,680
a lot of stories about women being told

00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,720
things like oh you only got this

00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,160
interview because you're pretty and so

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,650
if you're already suffering with issues

00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,590
of body image and eating disorders this

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,030
is just gonna make it worse and in

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,800
general people from marginalized groups

00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,540
often feel like they have to over

00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,460
perform because there's this whole myth

00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,810
of the bar having to be lowered in order

00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,440
to allow them into tech in the first

00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,600
place

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,950
and so that over-performing leads to

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:05,210
increased stress and a much greater

00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:07,220
likelihood of burnout we also need to

00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:08,810
fully embrace neuro diversity so neuro

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,880
diversity is this idea that mental

00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:12,800
disorders like ADHD and autism in

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,560
particular are the result of natural

00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,670
variations of the human genome they said

00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,260
that people with these kinds of

00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:21,230
differences do not need to be cured they

00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:23,030
need help and accommodation instead so

00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:24,920
to be clear the strongest proponents of

00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,660
neuro diversity say that we should

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,450
actually stop looking for a cure for

00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,830
autism altogether I think that's a

00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,390
little bit controversial and I think

00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,460
it's probably worth it to keep looking

00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,500
for a cure for autism but I also

00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,630
recognize that even if we do find a cure

00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:39,920
it's probably only going to help the

00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,840
people who aren't born yet

00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,400
chances are it's not going to help

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,140
anyone who is living with autism right

00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,180
now which means there are multiple

00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,460
generations of people with autism who

00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,050
deserve to live healthy happy productive

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,600
lives and be contributing members to

00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:54,680
society and it's in our own interest as

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,780
well because some of our greatest

00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:59,660
inventions are treated to people with

00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:01,010
atypical neurology at Sinclair himself

00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,600
has this quote he likes to use in his

00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:05,240
talks where he says mental illness gives

00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,280
me super powers he talks about how his

00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,960
ADHD in particular allows him to make

00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:11,690
connections faster than a lot of other

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,860
people and understand whole systems see

00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,340
solutions that they hadn't thought of

00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,290
before

00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,910
and there was this article in the

00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,830
Harvard Business Review from last May

00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,690
called neurodiversity as a competitive

00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:23,390
advantage where they actually found the

00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:25,100
same thing they found that people with

00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:29,230
autism who are working at companies like

00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:31,430
IBM and hewlett-packard were actually

00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,830
incredibly productive thinking of

00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:35,180
solutions no what a thought of etc and

00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,800
the biggest barrier was actually

00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,420
bringing them into the companies in the

00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,160
first place they had to essentially

00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,960
change up their interview process to

00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:46,820
allow these people to enter these kinds

00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:48,290
of companies and so finally some of the

00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,390
things we can only change as a culture

00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:52,550
the whole idea of working ourselves to

00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:55,420
death the over emphasis on hard work and

00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:58,880
stigma against vacation and things like

00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:01,850
the best programmers always code on the

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,470
holidays that kind of idea the need to

00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:06,680
always be available by phone or email

00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:08,510
I go to Iceland to speak at a conference

00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,190
like this and I always feel pressured to

00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,850
tell everyone how to reach me in case of

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,679
an emergency

00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:15,080
and that shouldn't need to be the case

00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:16,070
the peer pressure caused by social media

00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,779
there have been some studies done

00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:20,179
recently about Facebook in particular

00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:23,000
and they found that people suffering

00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:24,590
from depression struggle with using

00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,880
Facebook because everyone just posts

00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,250
about the good things that happen in

00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,590
their lives and so seeing everyone else

00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,940
seemingly happy with their weddings and

00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,559
their babies that cetera just makes them

00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,350
feel worse and even more down on

00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:37,909
themselves I mentioned this before but

00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:39,590
the belief that you must be in Silicon

00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:41,210
Valley to succeed I don't think that's

00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,980
true and 2018 anymore

00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:44,659
the stigma against talking about our

00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:47,539
feelings and finally the idea that

00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:49,429
engineers don't have empathy and this

00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:51,259
was kind of a new thing for me maybe

00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:53,090
because I went to art school but I was

00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:54,830
talking to a woman who had started her

00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,659
own business and she was saying that she

00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,100
brought in this consultant who said you

00:31:56,659 --> 00:31:59,299
can never use the word empathy around

00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,000
your end engineers because they all

00:31:59,299 --> 00:32:03,289
believe that they don't have it and so

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,240
that was incredibly strange to me

00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:06,980
because empathy is something that we all

00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,440
have the capacity for we just have to

00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,210
choose to exercise it and there was a

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,639
quote that the same woman used in a talk

00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:15,470
that she gave that I thought was really

00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:17,809
powerful that was empathy is the

00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:19,309
antidote to shame and she actually

00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:20,960
mentioned this in the context of the

00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:22,429
shame and blame culture of tech but I

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,379
think it's very true for mental illness

00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:26,269
as well where the shame here really is

00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:29,000
the stigma against mental illness and so

00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:30,470
empathy is the antidote and that all

00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
brings me back to you the title of my

00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,440
talk empathy as a service

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,080
hopefully you figured out by now that

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,799
this is kind of in jest there is no app

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,659
for this

00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,700
we can't deploy it to the cloud we can't

00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:42,470
automate it away this is something that

00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,169
we all have the capacity for and we have

00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:47,389
to choose to exercise it as a service to

00:32:45,169 --> 00:32:49,460
each other and if you're struggling with

00:32:47,389 --> 00:32:51,409
how to do this I just bring you back to

00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,360
the quote from Ed's talk that really

00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:54,679
helped me which was I could do so many

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,649
awesome things if only my own head

00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:59,299
didn't get in the way and so I have a

00:32:57,649 --> 00:33:00,620
list of resources that will be in my

00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:02,509
slides I'm not going to go through these

00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,830
but feel free to ask me if you want to

00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:07,220
know more about what any of these are

00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:09,710
for and feel free to reach out any time

00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,750
with thoughts questions etc I mean I

00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:13,370
always told people like even if like six

00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,679
months from now you're like man I really

00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:18,710
want to talk about this my proverbial

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,570
door is always open so please come talk

00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:22,279
to me and then finally before I forget I

00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:23,570
do have os and my stickers so I'll come

00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,020
talk to me afterwards if you want one of

00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,850
those

00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:31,540
so thank you very much

00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:31,540
