yeah hi hi hi Jessica my sling so as

00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,230
florida has introduced my dear

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:14,120
co-presenter is gonna be bailiff for

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,800
today and you should you could see them

00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,680
holding yesterday's beer which they

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,400
enjoyed very much so we're gonna be

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,740
talking about 2560 bites is out to be a

00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,740
enough for i mean if you don't get that

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,900
if you don't get this reference you

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,540
probably are pretty old or you just

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,700
watch a lot of memes on the internet so

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,920
my name is foggy which is the short for

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,660
each transposon skier from hungary or at

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,850
least is still rent an apartment there i

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:47,910
work basically doing devrel and a bunch

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,440
of other new technologies i'm a missile

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,420
attack speaker i've worked with the

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,660
missile devrel team doing the same thing

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,550
and i'm doing a bunch of JavaScript or

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,770
microcontroller stuff and hardware in

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,320
general so i'm a member of the castle

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,449
project which is basically what brought

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,860
me into hardware in the first place like

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,880
you're free years ago when this thing

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,979
went on one of the the crowdfunding

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,960
campaigns i ordered one and i started

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,270
playing around with that and did my

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,330
first presentation in budapest is a and

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,670
i JavaScript or microcontrollers and you

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,590
know basically he convincing people that

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,330
you know running JavaScript on a

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,340
microcontroller might actually be a good

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,759
idea or at least not being a terrible

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,909
idea

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,350
so why would that be I'm not sure this

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,409
talk is gonna sell it to you but

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,140
actually one of the creators john mckay

00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:39,060
is giving you talk has given a talk last

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,790
year rebels talking about the whole

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,799
journey of the tehsil team there's a

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,479
reading list you should read up on this

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,460
it's it's fascinating how they use

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,229
javascript and not really use javascript

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,090
or a microcontroller and there are other

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,939
devices like yes pro you know that you

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,799
see on this screen this is like the

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,229
thing that you see is an USB connector

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:02,939
so this is literally a ton by size and

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:04,829
you can program this with javascript it

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,770
had a very strange javascript compiler

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,810
like javascript engine running on it and

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,120
something didn't think that was a that

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,480
was okay so they set out you to bring

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,629
javascript properly on

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,840
my controllers to be honest like yes

00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:21,849
purino has has improved a lot since so

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,790
aspirin has also very capable chipped

00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:27,090
and by now but but Samsung came up with

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:31,959
and eventually open sources Jerry script

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:34,870
which is you know it powers a lot of

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:37,599
devices you can program for example BBC

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,299
micro bits on it so it's a pretty pretty

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,730
interesting stuff happening and I forgot

00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:46,840
to set this up so let me just set

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:53,260
hopefully yeah yep

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:55,989
no not yet okay that's not good not

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:59,650
working technical difficulties I guess

00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:13,299
alright we'll see if we can get this to

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:16,750
work now you're talking

00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:19,329
alrighty so let's talk about a bunch of

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:23,200
more interesting stuff like JavaScript

00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:25,209
overt IOT just two years ago here and on

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,910
this very stage maybe in this exact

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,709
stage Babel announced that they are

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,930
actually running JavaScript on their

00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,000
pebble watches and they actually didn't

00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,639
stop until they could get script running

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,400
as fast and there's battery efficient as

00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,349
they could run Java C code on the

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,440
microcontroller so you can see she

00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:46,870
wanted fertilized of codes versus 39

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,680
lines of JavaScript app over indeed the

00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:52,299
UI of a SmartWatch and when they want

00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,150
defunct last year they actually bought

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,310
got bought out by Fitbit and my watch is

00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,109
actually running JavaScript on the UI so

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:03,069
you can actually create apps and stuff

00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:04,660
for your watch on a JavaScript but we

00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:07,180
need to get smaller like these are

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,620
pretty capable motive chips so how about

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,720
putting JavaScript and D or

00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,780
microcontroller like this have you ever

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,669
played with Arduinos before this is a

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:19,030
8-bit processor this is an order you

00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:21,430
know micro it literally has two thousand

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:26,170
and five hundred sixty bytes of memory

00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:28,900
it has it holds 30k of Flash

00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:31,630
and you can do stuff like put space

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,490
invaders on it how well there are a

00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:36,370
bunch of ways usually you use the

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,340
Arduino IDE and some C or C++ to code

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,010
that I created a small project that that

00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,840
you can do this with JavaScript it

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,570
actually turns your JavaScript into C++

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,310
it's a good thing and he just mentioned

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,380
flow it actually uses flow in the

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,090
backend to infer your types and stuff I

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,120
don't have time to explain it but if you

00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,040
want to just come up to me and try it

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,540
yourself and because that's all the

00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,920
games that you're gonna be making or

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,410
they're going to be just JavaScript you

00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,170
can just put them onto the web and play

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,540
them and after you play them you can

00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,630
compile them and put them on T devices

00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:13,080
like this one so this is a JavaScript

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,580
game running on a microcontroller

00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,970
compiled for a microcontroller hardware

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:22,330
that has a 8 bit 16 megahertz processor

00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:24,400
and you know if that's not enough you

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,830
know you can use this one which is

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,160
literally a tiny arcade that's the name

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:33,130
it's a tiny arcade box that you could

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,140
play with why would you why is that

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,060
interesting because this is just the web

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,060
this is just JavaScript and chemistry of

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,670
writing and you can check that because I

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,380
have some links up if you go to this on

00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,600
with your computer or your laptop

00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,460
actually you can play the exact same

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,080
game that is get that gets compiled down

00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,300
to the microcontroller and the gaming

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,210
devices we have space invaders if you're

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:58,030
into that kind of stuff and we also have

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,440
a workshop so if your Icelandic or if

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,690
you're gonna be driving around the

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,030
island for next week just drop by

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,790
Reykjavik University next Saturday and

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,220
we're actually gonna do a whole workshop

00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:11,050
we are creators of these devices

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,090
actually were kind enough to provide us

00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,130
with a bunch of devices so you can't

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,870
actually play with JavaScript kid games

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:19,000
and put them onto a microcontroller and

00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,560
play around with those and next Saturday

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,660
there is a link in there as well

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,200
and if you want to talk to you about

00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:29,200
these kind of stuff at me at Twitter at

00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,970
SL softworks or follow at cloud boy for

00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,160
the new stuff all of this is open source

00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:35,590
most of this is built on nodejs and

00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,870
javascript so the whole server and hold

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:41,560
is all based in JavaScript so you can

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:44,110
contribute if you if you want you and

00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,150
all the slides are online at Todd does

00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,150
like that is yes that's a nice landing

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:51,250
domain right / place let's chase convice

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:53,139
land so thank you very much

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,570
there's a reading list and links if you

00:06:53,139 --> 00:07:01,779
want to know more about these topics

00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,779
