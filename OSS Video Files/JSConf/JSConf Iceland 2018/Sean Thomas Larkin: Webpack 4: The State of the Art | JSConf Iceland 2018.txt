Webpack 4 is closely drawing near to its final release! But what does that mean to you? Join me as not only I help break down everything we’ve accomplished this year, but also look forward to what we have in store for you in the future. Join me as we’ll talk about what it means to represent the #0CJS (Zero Config JS) movement, what it means to put developers first, and how we aim to embody the term Legato: to perform in a smooth, flowing, manner without gaps.

Join me as I breakdown why this update, more then any that have come before, is the most groundbreaking set of changes for the future of webpack and our ecosystem!
