hi-yah I'm Lawrence and I'm actually a

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,150
teacher at the University of Applied

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:11,130
Sciences in Amsterdam but that's not

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:15,420
what I'm here to talk to you about today

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:21,300
I'm also volunteer at a refugee code

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:22,949
school called pack your future and well

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,019
I can tell you what hack your future is

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,670
but it's actually been done better in

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,029
this video so I'll show you show you a

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,029
short clip

00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:37,120
[Music]

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,850
haiji future is an initiative it's an

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,890
organization that especially for

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,199
refugees that come to the Netherlands I

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,590
think it's mostly Syria but it's from

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,050
other places as well people who have

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,170
left their countries involuntarily to

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,940
pick up a new skill hopefully so hack

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,630
your future teaches them computer

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,640
programming web development CSS and HTML

00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,760
and you learn the basic about it and

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:21,689
then JavaScript of course and help them

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:23,460
to find jobs these are people who had

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,650
some unfortunate circumstances perhaps

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,450
and are trying to do something good for

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,439
themselves and for the world I'm proud

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,759
of myself that I could learn it all so

00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,890
this actually tells you a bit about what

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,470
hack your future is but not so much

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,390
about why hack your future is so IQ

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,079
future was founded by a couple of people

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:46,619
who thought well there's a growing group

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,390
of refugees coming to our country and

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,310
they'll actually have a lot of trouble

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,960
entering the job market because they

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,659
won't have the right backgrounds they'll

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,579
have some language barriers maybe there

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,579
are some discrimination issues going on

00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,649
so how can we prevent these people from

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,740
becoming marginalized in our society so

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,390
it it funded hack your future because

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,220
they decided well what's what's the best

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,379
way to actually empower people and the

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,090
best way to get them jobs well one of

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:12,740
the best ways currently is to teach them

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,750
what if

00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,050
skills because there's a lot of demand

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,390
for web development skills and it allows

00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:23,720
you to go into various different paths

00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:26,660
as you all know so we thought well how

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,300
can we do that we came up with an idea

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:32,570
of of setting up a volunteer program

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:35,270
where volunteers teach refugees every

00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:38,270
Sunday for about four hours we have

00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:40,160
interactive sessions with them and then

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,350
they spend about 20 hours working on

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,110
homework assignments and they hand in

00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,550
their homework on get up and we interact

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,920
with them through slack throughout the

00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:51,980
week so they actually have some support

00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,090
for the whole week we teach some basic

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,590
skills first we start off with HTML CSS

00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,180
because they have virtually no technical

00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,820
skills coming in and that's like a

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,490
really easy way to enter this field and

00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:07,910
then we spent nine weeks on the basics

00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,920
of programming through JavaScript which

00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,470
I had a lot of pleasure and teaching

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,270
them they're super motivated so it goes

00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:19,340
a lot faster actually doing with my

00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:21,050
students at the University and after at

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,700
the end of those six months they work on

00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:24,860
a project and they actually develop

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,350
something themselves they often choose

00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,530
to develop something that will benefit

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:33,020
other refugees which is really awesome

00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:35,810
and alongside that program we also teach

00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:39,050
some seminars on how to conduct yourself

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:42,860
and job interviews how to make a good

00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:45,950
LinkedIn profile well you know basic

00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:47,960
skills that you might also want and

00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,940
things that are quite different in in

00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:53,810
the Netherlands as opposed to for

00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:57,320
instance Syria so yeah that's that's the

00:03:53,810 --> 00:04:00,260
way that we that we set it up so what

00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,990
have we achieved well we have about 55

00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:06,590
students that have found jobs at

00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:10,310
companies such as KPMG booking.com and

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:12,770
KLM I guess that's the the main thing

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:15,290
that we've achieved but we also have an

00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,330
an active network of students mentors

00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,580
and alumni there are 200 people strong

00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:21,410
they're all in one select group they

00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,810
help each other out with anything from

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:26,990
[Music]

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:29,090
finding good companies to apply it

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:33,380
- how to cycle through the snow in the

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:36,229
Netherlands when winter comes and we've

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,360
also achieved 100% uptime for the past

00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:41,830
two years and honestly who can really

00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,630
say that about any program we're running

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:49,099
we also have some new chapters in

00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:52,819
Copenhagen London Annamma so people have

00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:55,069
started copying our projects and

00:04:52,819 --> 00:05:00,470
hopefully we've achieved part of at

00:04:55,069 --> 00:05:02,509
least a better future so I also have a

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,169
quote it's not by Steve Jobs it's

00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:08,979
bye-bye jack one of her students he says

00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:12,560
that his main takeaways from the program

00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:14,599
were to how to think like a programmer

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,810
how to work in a team and most

00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:19,490
importantly that people can still treat

00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,550
him for the for the person that he are

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:25,699
he that he is and not the way that he

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,470
might be seen which i think is very

00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:30,020
important thing for these students

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,060
coming to us because as soon as they

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,949
enter our doors they they stop being a

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,409
refugee and they start being a students

00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:38,060
and we just treat them like that and we

00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:39,830
don't really talk about their

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,750
backgrounds at all we just treat them as

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:45,590
students and we say this is your

00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:47,389
homework you have to deliver on it we

00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,669
will be supportive and try to help you

00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:54,800
with any issue but well you have to

00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:56,900
deliver so actually the point of this

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,840
talk is not to tell you how awesome it

00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:02,060
is that I work at this program that I

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,940
volunteer or how good this program is I

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,610
actually want all of you to start

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,789
copying this idea and to set up a hack

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:12,310
your future of your own because I think

00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:15,650
it's one of the best ways to empower

00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:18,560
people so how can you do that well you

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:22,069
need a couple of ingredients first of a

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,319
convenient location it's important that

00:06:22,069 --> 00:06:26,630
people can actually reach your your

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,729
location and and a lot of these people

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:31,969
will be in camps and they might not have

00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,889
a lot of money or means of

00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:36,110
transportation so it's important that

00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:37,610
you find a good location secondly you'll

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,560
need some laptops they don't need to be

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,639
state-of-the-art actually it's better if

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,379
developers don't have

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:47,150
state-of-the-art laptop so they learn

00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:49,819
how to develop for for all people you'll

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,770
need a program director or better yet a

00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:53,599
team of people who are prepared to think

00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:57,110
about the hard challenges that you might

00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:00,439
face to get everybody together we can

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,479
help you bit with with that you'll need

00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:04,389
mentors and this seems like it might be

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,249
difficult to find people to volunteer

00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:09,409
especially on a Sunday as we do but

00:07:07,249 --> 00:07:11,469
we've actually found that there is an

00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:14,569
abundance of mentors people are really

00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:16,099
happy to help there are people from

00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:19,009
universities there's people from

00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:20,599
companies there's people from well any

00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:23,840
place you can think of a lot of people

00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:25,819
with diverse backgrounds like to help

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,060
out as well so we have a very diverse

00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:30,529
group of mentors helping out and

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:34,039
students of course this is the most

00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:35,750
important parts might not be as easy as

00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:39,469
finding the mentors because you need to

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:41,599
find people that have basic English

00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:44,180
skills first that's like that's our

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,400
minimum requirement but we also want

00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,199
them to be very motivated so we actually

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,779
have them do a little test before

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,610
they're allowed to join our program and

00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:54,169
it's about learning a skill on your own

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,000
so they have to prove that they can do

00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,939
that within a certain amount of time and

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,180
it's a task that really anybody can

00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:04,580
complete as long as they're motivated I

00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,949
guess a lot of people will ask well how

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,020
do you get financial supports you don't

00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:11,389
need that much money it's nice if some

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,020
companies help out and donate old

00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:17,060
laptops it's nice if the municipality

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,509
helps out with the rent a bit or get

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,889
your location but ultimately this is

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:24,649
definitely something that you can

00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:26,149
overcome you'd be surprised at how many

00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:29,089
people want to help if you have a good

00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:31,819
idea of course you also need a

00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:33,260
curriculum this is something that can be

00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:36,169
very difficult to set up but we've

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:38,479
already done it for you so I'll show you

00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:40,880
a link on our curriculum it's just

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,320
something on github it's just a list of

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,120
topics that we think is good to talk

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,290
about but of course you can set up your

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,630
own way of doing it so how would you do

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,250
this well just like Jess Kampf you can

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,530
just say like well I think this is a

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:57,110
great idea I want to do this in my city

00:08:54,530 --> 00:09:00,350
so I'm just gonna basically fork the the

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,540
projects which you can do from github

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,250
hack your future and then if you want to

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:07,310
know how to get started you can just go

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:09,290
to start code school and there will be

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,780
lots of tips there there will be lots of

00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:14,360
documents there will be like a setup for

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,670
