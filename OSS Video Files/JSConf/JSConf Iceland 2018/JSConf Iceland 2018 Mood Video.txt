	00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:05,520
so this is actually my first time

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,589
speaking and a full conference lot

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,170
there's also a couple other first time

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,090
speakers and we kind of band together to

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,910
make sure that we supported each other

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,190
and I think it's the perfect place to be

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,320
able to have my first big conference

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,420
experience this is my first time in

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,660
Iceland I've been blown away so far

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,920
everybody is so nice and it's so

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,439
relaxing here

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,720
the views are to die for one of the most

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,399
amazing things about Jess comp Iceland

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,050
is that you know accessibility inclusion

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,270
and diversity are first class citizens

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,520
and they're not something that they have

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,950
to try to do it just that's how it is

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,050
that's the culture of this conference

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,210
and even other J's conferences as well

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,239
but specifically the one in Iceland ajs

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,500
Club Iceland is just a really wonderful

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,750

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,699

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:00,350
