"Works for me." The words spoken to dismiss a thousand bugs. "Can't Reproduce." Issue closed. "You're getting worked up over nothing." "It was just a joke." "I worked just as hard to get here." "It didn't bother me." Problem dismissed.

"Works for me" is a natural reaction when confronted with cultural issues that don't impact us directly. It's a statement that isn't innacurate, but is wildly incomplete. We have to learn to see past our own experiences and see and accept the experiences of others.

This talk will dive into how and why dismissal of culture concerns happens in the tech community, and how we can combat it with knowledge and empathy.

Hey yeah thanks everyone

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,299
uh yeah so my name's Bryan Hughes

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,580
Technical Evangelist at Microsoft like

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,349
Vanessa said you can find me at neveri

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,509
us on Twitter github and basically

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,150
everywhere else and so today I'm gonna

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,279
talk about basically like privilege and

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,100
tech and kind of really boiling that

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,660
down and looking at how that works and

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,100
kind of what we can do about it now a

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,650
question you might be asking yourself

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,570
though before I get into that is why me

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,519
why am I actually here talking to you

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,969
about this today you know especially as

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,950
someone who is pretty privileged you

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:38,820
know it's a good question to ask and I

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,950
think two key reasons one is that well

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,600
I'm bisexual and I'm an atheist and I

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,539
was also born and raised in multiple

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,489
places in Texas which is one of the most

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,620
conservative places in the entire United

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:50,899
States one of the cities I lived in was

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,039
actually ranked as the second most

00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:55,530
conservative city in the entire country

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,210
so I let you piece together what that

00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,670
was like growing up it was not pleasant

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,050
let's just say a little more recently

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,030
though I was involved in the node.js

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,040
project for about two years where I

00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,500
focus specifically on diversity and

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,270
inclusivity and the project I helped to

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,189
found the inclusivity working group

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,650
which was the first group that kind of

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,960
was working on culture and then later on

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,640
as we kind of restructured some things I

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,170
helped to found the community committee

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,479
which is the current group that is

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,060
responsible for culture in the project

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,590
as well as a number of other things so I

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,720
like to think that I've learned a few

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:32,130
things along the way throughout all this

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,990
process right so privilege this is a

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,110
topic that gets in a word that gets

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,390
thrown around quite a bit and sometimes

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,670
the ingenuously sometimes in less

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,810
tenuous ways shall we say and I think

00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,450
there's a lot of misconceptions about

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,189
what it is and what it represents so

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,720
want to spend some time boiling that

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,009
down it just really talking about what

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,310
it actually means in the way it

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,950
manifests itself and I'm gonna do so by

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,630
making analogies with bug reports

00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,710
actually because I think they're as it

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,100
turns out are actually quite a few

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,329
similarities so this is a problem that

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,399
we tend to have a lot let's say we've

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:07,590
got a user they're using you know our

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,660
product or say or managing an open

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,520
source project and so these users are

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,160
using our library so they try and use

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,480
this thing and they run into problems

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,490
they get a cryptic error message when

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,500
they try to log in to a site maybe the

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,900
library is crashing on startup you know

00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,280
whatever it is something got in the way

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,610
a bud got in the way of the user being

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,810
able to use our product and so you know

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,030
this is bad enough that they go and they

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,890
file a support issue or they open an

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,510
issue on github and they say hey I'm

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,180
trying to use your thing and it's not

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,950
working so you is the engineer you know

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,810
you pick up this bug and you go and you

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,460
try to reproduce it so you know you

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,010
follow the same steps they did to get to

00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,410
it and well it just works for you

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,600
right you can't reproduce this bug at

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,270
all it works on your machine so mark the

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,090
bug as closed can't reproduce and move

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,590
on we've all been there I have certainly

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,720
done that a number of times in my

00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,480
engineering career so far but there's

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,500
like two sort of simultaneous truths

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,750
that I think are important to keep in

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,410
mind the first one is that it's true it

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,420
worked

00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,760
for you like you know it worked on our

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,530
machines and so you know we are not

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,870
encountering that bug ourselves like

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,670
that is absolutely true the other thing

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,100
that is also true at the same time is

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,740
that this user that was using the

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:22,110
library or product or whatever did

00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,660
encounter that bug like that bug exists

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,180
right even if we can't reproduce it that

00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:30,240
bug still exists and the reason this

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,890
typically happens is because the context

00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,209
of the user like the technical context

00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,190
of the user is different than the

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,709
technical context of you you know we

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,470
typically tend to develop on really you

00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:42,120
know new fast MacBook Pros or something

00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,730
similar to that like we have powerful

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,150
machines that are new we also typically

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,380
have very fast internet access and a lot

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,190
of times users don't necessarily have

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,920
that you know they might have a

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:56,160
ten-year-old Dell running yo Windows 7

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,260
that is like heavily locked down and

00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,000
perhaps they have really poor internet

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,440
speeds or very intermittent internet you

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,560
know there's these differences in

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,510
context this technical context that

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,980
caused the user to encounter the bug and

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,220
we didn't you know it could have been

00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,050
say a race condition in our code but

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,640
this race condition was only exposed

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,700
whenever the performance was slow enough

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,680
for the network was slow enough and so

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:21,419
it was like the bug absolutely exists in

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,100
the code regardless of whether or not we

00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:26,400
encountered it and the difference is

00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,750
that context and that's basically what

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,670
privileges in a

00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,860
in a nutshell it's the case where we

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,470
exist in a context in the broader world

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,420
you know we live in the country we lived

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:38,340
and we had the parents that we had with

00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,520
their financial situation you know we

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,960
are the gender we are they are the

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,340
ethnicity we are we are the sexual

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,590
orientation we are and so on and so

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,170
forth so like we all exist within these

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,750
contexts and there's a lot of bugs in

00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:54,240
society you know bugs that trace back

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,820
thousands and thousands of years and so

00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,030
depending on the context that we live in

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:02,040
we may or may not encounter these bugs

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,630
in society and that's what privilege is

00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,340
is when we exist in a context that

00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,710
allows us to sidestep this bug

00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,930
oftentimes without us even realizing

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,000
that we have done that and one thing I

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,860
would note is there is nothing you know

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,020
there's not a value judgment that I'm

00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,040
placing on the person here just like you

00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,960
know we don't judge the value of a

00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,660
person based on whether their employer

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,250
issued them a new MacBook Pro or an old

00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,590
dell laptop like that doesn't say

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,150
anything about the person but that is

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:31,770
the context and that is how they view

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:33,330
the world at the same time so speaking

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:35,130
of contacts a lot of times like as

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:36,930
engineers we don't know what the users

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,210
context is at least not fully you know

00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,650
the user files this bug you know we

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,330
hopefully will figure out you know what

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,500
browser they're running on you know for

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,090
really lucky we'll figure out which

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,010
browser version in which operating

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,080
system and we oftentimes don't know the

00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,310
rest we don't know what their ISP is we

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,990
especially don't know what their

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,850
networking conditions were at the time

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,340
of that bug and sometimes there's even

00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,990
things that could contribute to the bug

00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,360
that we don't even know are things that

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,860
could contribute to a bug a really good

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,360
example actually ran into one last week

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,280
when I was doing some technical work I

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,930
was working with Asher file storage

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,030
which is a way of storing files in the

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,229
cloud pretty straightforward I was

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,760
following the documentation and I'm

00:06:10,229 --> 00:06:14,340
trying to connect to the service to

00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,169
upload some files and I just couldn't

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,270
connect I was trying everything reading

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:20,040
the documentation following the steps in

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,840
the azure documentation and what

00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,190
should've work just was not working for

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,360
me

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,850
turns out it was actually a problem with

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,340
my ISP they were blocking port 445

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,260
outbound and I didn't even realize that

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,729
like I didn't even think to think about

00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,050
that problem and I spent about a day on

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:36,510
it until I realized what was going on

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,370
and so a lot of times you know it's not

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,650
that we just that we don't know the

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,460
users context but we don't know the

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,169
things

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,319
that we don't know that are contributing

00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:49,319
to the bug so that's basically what this

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,210
concept of unconscious biases so in

00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,250
society there's a lot of times a lot of

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,520
things that affect certain groups of

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:58,199
people that we don't even think or we

00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,789
aren't even aware of that is an actual

00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,190
problem

00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:03,930
I think perhaps a good example of this

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,970
is if we there have been some studies

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,889
that have shown in meetings you know men

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,770
tend to talk a lot more than women do

00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:12,090
and sort of the intuitive reaction that

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:14,310
a lot of us men will have is that Oh

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,509
women should just speak up more but

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,830
there's a whole bunch of other things

00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:18,539
that actually play into it a lot of

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,400
societal dynamics that make that a lot

00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:22,289
more complicated and the things that you

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,910
know we as men are just not aware of you

00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:25,889
know we're unconscious to this and

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,599
because we're not aware of them we end

00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,360
up having these biases that come into

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,310
play now like I said this is unconscious

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,139
if we're not doing this on purpose at

00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:38,789
all but it is still there so another

00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,280
thing that we tend to see a lot is that

00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:43,139
a lot of small bugs can add up to really

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,490
big frustrations you know I think we've

00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,080
all used these services you know we

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,970
start we log in for the first time we

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,949
might encounter a small bug along the

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,500
way say we log in it goes through a

00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:53,880
redirect flow from off and that redirect

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,740
just like stalls in the middle for some

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,110
reason you know we may not know why but

00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,729
it just it sticks and so you know we

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,710
have to go up manually hit that refresh

00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:04,259
button and then it loads and goes along

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,030
its merry way that's a bug it's not a

00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,110
very big one it's a small detail you

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,449
know it didn't get in the way of us

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,280
using our product well that's just kind

00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:12,509
of annoying but then we logged it then

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,639
once we're in we start encountering a

00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:16,620
lot more of these little things you know

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,419
maybe there's a label that's just kind

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,889
of cutting off screen a little bit or

00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,539
maybe there's a button that you had to

00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:23,430
click on twice before it'll actually

00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,930
activate you know once again every

00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,500
single one of these bugs is a low

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:30,659
priority bug but when added up together

00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,310
they add up to a really big frustrating

00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:33,539
application you know we tend to say that

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,669
these kind of applications like oh that

00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,099
is so buggy I hate this app you know

00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,779
it's not we don't approach this as like

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,250
oh yeah there's a bunch of little things

00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:44,880
but overall the app is great no that's

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,589
not how our brains actually work you

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,329
know that each of those bugs sort of

00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:50,040
they they're not even just like a linear

00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,940
additive thing they kind of multiply

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,339
against each other

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,710
and it becomes a really serious issue

00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:57,440
and you know we end up lose

00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,760
users and things like that so that's

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,010
basically what the concept of

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,200
microaggressions is so what

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:05,150
microaggression is something where

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,400
someone will do something to an

00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:09,110
underprivileged person that just kind of

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,120
adds up to a little bit I think a

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,070
classic example of this is whenever we

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,640
use the word guys to refer to all

00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:19,640
developers like viewed in a vacuum this

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,810
is not that big of a deal yeah you know

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,000
there's definitely much worse things

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,860
that a lot of people have to face you

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,990
know such as like wage disparity and

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,340
discrimination things like that so in

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,050
the grand scheme of things saying guys

00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,530
isn't that big of a deal when viewed in

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,170
a vacuum

00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:33,620
but the thing is it doesn't exist in a

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,470
vacuum

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,060
it exists in this broader context you

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,520
know it is one of those you know little

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,080
bugs that adds up to a really bad

00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,330
application you know it's death by a

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,320
thousand paper cuts and so you know I

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,750
think it's really important that we

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,640
remember that you know these little

00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,500
things do matter even if they don't seem

00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,620
like a big deal because in aggregate

00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,330
it's just a further reminder that you

00:09:54,620 --> 00:10:01,010
know underprivileged people are in fact

00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:03,830
underprivileged so another thing that we

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,180
tend to see a lot especially you know if

00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,070
you've done a lot of open source work

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,960
you'll see this is that users rarely

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,820
report bugs it was something I'm

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,460
actually guilty of myself I was even

00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,050
chatting with Anna last night about this

00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,520
you know we encounter a bug we get kind

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,400
of frustrated by it but we just move

00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:21,320
along you know we could take the time

00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,600
out of our day to open an issue on

00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,060
github or file an issue with the support

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,770
team but we usually don't and because

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,480
our time is valuable and so we're always

00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:32,990
doing these little judgment calls in our

00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:35,090
head of should I invest my time to see

00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,250
that someone else fixes the problem by

00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,470
reporting this issue or bug and the

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,450
answer is almost always now sometimes

00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,670
it's yes but it's almost always no so

00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,500
when we look at what is being reported

00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,300
you know we have to remember that this

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,700
is sort of a represent a small

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,160
representation of much bigger problems

00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:56,090
that you know this is a fraction of the

00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,710
actual bugs users encounter and we see

00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:01,160
the same thing when we're talking about

00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:03,590
culture issues as well and so is the way

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,300
I tend to say it is like when we see an

00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:08,240
underprivileged person who is calling

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,550
out bad behavior this is never

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,880
the first offense it's the first Hill

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:17,149
worth dying on so well when I say that

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,680
I'm basically saying that someone goes

00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:20,630
public writes a blog post let's say

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,700
condemning a company for certain bad

00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:25,040
behavior there's oftentimes this

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,390
instinctual reaction that you know

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,360
people working on the company tend to

00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:30,890
have and that's to dismiss it we say

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,750
like okay well that person had a problem

00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,700
but well it's because of yada yada

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,260
whatever reasons that come up and most

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,600
important let's say and no one else

00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:40,640
complained you know we say like well

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,970
okay so you know this career person was

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,500
complaining about homophobia and company

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,820
but yo there's all these other creepy

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,770
people and they didn't say anything

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,560
therefore it should be fine but that's

00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:52,910
not how it actually works what was going

00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,430
on with those individuals with those

00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:57,260
other queer folks is that you know we

00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,510
were doing that analysis in our head and

00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,060
being like is it worth it to call this

00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,520
out is it worth the lost time in

00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,500
productivity perhaps even you know loss

00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,510
of respect loss of job even in some

00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,640
cases that go along with it and a lot of

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,440
times the answer is actually no like you

00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:16,490
know I certainly see stuff on a pretty

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:17,839
regular basis that you know it makes me

00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:20,300
uncomfortable it makes me feel isolated

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:22,910
and singled out as a queer person in a

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,160
mostly straight world but I ignore it I

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,380
don't call it out I just kind of go on

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,980
my way because you know I'll analyze the

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,970
situation and realize it's not worth it

00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,380
and so it's important to realize that

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,630
when we see someone who is calling

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:37,490
something out it's not just that this is

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,529
a thing that happened it's that a thing

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,180
that happened that was bad enough that

00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:43,790
it crossed this threshold where it

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,990
became worth it to call it out so

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,860
there's a numbers game there's an

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:50,480
aggregate game going on here so that's

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,579
kind of a couple of the core concepts

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,649
that go into you like why we have a lot

00:12:52,579 --> 00:12:58,100
of the disparities that we have in tech

00:12:54,649 --> 00:13:00,860
and in societies and as a whole but what

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,480
do we do about it there's a lot of

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,890
different things we can do and so I'm

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,329
gonna focus on a very specific aspect

00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,970
and this is what we can do as

00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:10,160
individuals there's entire conversations

00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,810
we had about what large organizations

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,149
and companies can do but that's a

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:18,050
different talk and the big thing we can

00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:20,660
do is to develop empathy and so empathy

00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,070
is a word that gets thrown around a lot

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,510
and it can mean a lot of

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,900
different things depending on context

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:29,420
but in short empathy is whenever we can

00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,490
emotionally relate to another person you

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,340
know we are technically it is we are

00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:36,040
feeling what another person is feeling

00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:38,420
and it's having that shared experience

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,580
now in practice you know no one will

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,660
ever feel exactly what another person is

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,420
feeling but you know we'd get a rough

00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,040
idea it's about you know kind of bonding

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,050
together and creating a shared

00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,970
experience even though we are different

00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:53,870
we exist in different contexts within

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:56,030
the world and so a way that I like to

00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,370
think about it is that we have you know

00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:01,070
the privileges that we have and every

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,170
single person has some privilege in some

00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:05,690
form or fashion every single person in

00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:07,130
this room does have privilege and once

00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,320
again like I said earlier this is not a

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:11,480
value judgment on you as an individual

00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,520
like having privilege in and of itself

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,070
is not a bad thing it's just a state of

00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,680
being what matters is what we do with

00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,900
that and how we act on that that's what

00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,030
really matters

00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:25,370
but so everyone has privilege and it

00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,830
forms this way that we view the world it

00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:29,840
colors every interaction we have in

00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:31,460
everything we see and so I like to think

00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,530
of it it's like a lens it's like looking

00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:36,110
through a pair of binoculars you know we

00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:38,600
can see one little thing really really

00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,700
well but we can't see everything that

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,580
exists beside it you know we're missing

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,890
most of the world but we have a lot of

00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:49,340
insight into this one small part that we

00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,690
can see and everyone's lens is different

00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,460
just like everyone's privilege is

00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,510
different so the way everyone sees the

00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,720
world is different we are seeing

00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:59,050
different things and there actually can

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,310
be I think a lot of power in that

00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,560
because if we can really develop our

00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,510
empathy then we this is how we create

00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,490
this lens to someone else like the lens

00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,320
we have is to the lens we have there's

00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,020
nothing we can really do to change that

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,670
innately but we can talk to someone else

00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,050
who has a different lens we can form a

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,330
relationship with them we can create a

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:20,150
bond with them so that we can together

00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,650
hopefully create a fuller picture of

00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:26,330
what's going on we can start to see the

00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:28,220
world in 360 degrees and so the thing

00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,050
about empathy some people do think all

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,150
right it's often expressed at least that

00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,910
empathy is just a natural trait we have

00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,930
either you have it or you don't there

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,700
can be some true

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,430
to that but empathy is also a skill that

00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,380
can be nurtured it's a skill that can be

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,990
developed and grown and I think I'm

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,190
actually a pretty good example of this

00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:48,110
in the past when I was a lot younger I

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,460
really was did not have very much

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:51,230
empathy and I wasn't very good at

00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,790
expressing that but it's something I've

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,770
been working at you know pretty hard

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,200
over the last I don't 10 years or so

00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,690
maybe 7 years something like that and

00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,920
I'm by no means perfect of course but

00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,330
you know I have certainly made a lot of

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,300
progress and I think this is something

00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:07,010
we all can do and there's a lot of

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:10,820
different ways that we can really work

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:12,290
on training our empathy as well way too

00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,779
much to go over into a talk here but I'm

00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,890
gonna give three specific tips you know

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,959
like if there's anything that you can

00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:21,440
remember about how to kind of work on

00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:23,060
your empathy it's these three things the

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,890
first thing is to listen to you and

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:27,410
believe marginalize people whenever they

00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,820
say that there's an issue you know like

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:30,709
I said we all have a different lens we

00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,110
and we exist in these different context

00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:35,120
so whenever someone else is saying that

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,170
you know there's a problem you know at

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,910
our company we have a culture problem

00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,910
this company on our team and it's

00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:43,430
project our first reaction shouldn't be

00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,630
to say like oh that's not a problem I'm

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,220
not experiencing that I mean

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:48,320
unfortunately this is what we often do

00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,760
though this is how our brains work this

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,980
is how human beings are just kind of

00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,320
wired we always Center ourselves and

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,150
everything we do because we are the only

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,910
person where we have a complete

00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:01,220
understanding of our own experiences so

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:03,260
our first reaction typically is to say

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:06,110
well I don't have that problem therefore

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,339
it's not a problem but that's not how it

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,079
works because we exist in these

00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:10,400
different contexts and sometimes we

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,300
encounter these societal bugs and

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,209
sometimes we don't

00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,699
based on that context so what we should

00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:19,069
do instead is to start by recognizing

00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:21,470
that this person exists in a different

00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:24,679
context I may not be experiencing that

00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,510
issue myself but they are and so that

00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:28,400
issue does exist you know just like

00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:30,679
whenever a user reports a bug our first

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,990
reaction should be to believe the user

00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,309
that the bug exists you know and then we

00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,190
could do some investigation and figure

00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:38,410
out how together we can actually try to

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,940
make things better

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:43,850
so yeah just try to really work on that

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,260
innate reaction to say oh that's not a

00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:47,720
problem because I'm not experiencing it

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,070
and replace that instead with oh that's

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,850
interesting and it's like oh I see

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,559
you're experiencing

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:53,240
this or you're telling me that tell me

00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:54,380
more about that because I don't

00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,990
experience that and I don't quite

00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:01,669
understand what's going on so listen and

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:03,500
believe first the next bit of advice I

00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:05,390
have is to put your ego aside because

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,850
really it's not about you as an

00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:09,799
individual you know these bugs that we

00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:12,230
have in society have existed for

00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:14,120
thousands of years you know there is

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:16,130
basically the whole of human history

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,260
that has led to a lot of the societal

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,750
issues that we have now like this is not

00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:24,530
about the individual this really is

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:27,370
about systemic issues you know systemic

00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:29,929
issues means it's a bug in the system so

00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,880
you know whenever you know a person of

00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:35,600
color is calling out white people for

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,760
racism as an example you know this isn't

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,830
like we are criticizing you know John

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,539
Smith specifically this is saying like

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:44,780
there are these - semuc issues that

00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:48,260
pervade all of society that's some when

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:49,820
we hear that you know try to not feel

00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,580
personally attacked because it's not a

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:54,320
personal attack you know unless you're

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:55,520
someone who is say on the shitty medium

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,620
in list or something like that in that

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,210
case okay maybe it is about you but

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,860
assuming you're not an like that

00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:03,169
which I hope none of you are then

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:06,710
realize that this is much bigger than

00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:08,630
any individual so try not to get

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,250
defensive it once again it's human

00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:12,320
nature to get defensive when someone is

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,610
criticizing us but you know just like

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,159
whenever we're working on a pull request

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:18,200
like a really good skill as an engineer

00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:19,850
when we get critical feedback in a pull

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,980
request is not to get angry at the

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:24,380
person who gave us that feedback but

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:26,659
instead to go fix our code you know and

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,000
update our pull request exact same thing

00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:30,530
here really is we're getting feedback

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,870
and then we want to work on this

00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:38,360
together to improve things and finally

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:41,809
the last tip I have is to actively work

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,159
to create inclusive teams so the thing

00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:45,350
about creating like inclusive and

00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,480
diverse teams is that they don't happen

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,429
on their own they take work like it

00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,230
takes work to get different types of

00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:52,940
people together you know we have network

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:56,299
effects you know we tend to typically

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,850
know people who are mostly like us so if

00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:00,350
we want to bring in people to our team

00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:03,470
that are not like us you know we have to

00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,640
work a little harder at it and it's

00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,309
just about getting people there it's

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,799
also making sure that people stay as

00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:11,299
well and so you know not only do we have

00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:13,280
to reach out to more people to build

00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:14,690
these better teams we have to work on

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,880
our culture you know just like creating

00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,620
a really good culture around a pool

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,960
request takes working and we have to get

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,010
over that defensiveness and instead you

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,360
know work towards you know more of a

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,330
common good we have to do that when

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,010
we're creating inclusive teams as well

00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,750
and that's also another topic where that

00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:32,030
would take me a couple of talks to

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,350
really go through but just you know I'll

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,610
say it takes work there's a lot of

00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,429
resources out there as well where you

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:39,080
can figure out how to do that and we

00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:41,500
really want to do this because we are so

00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:43,880
much stronger together than we are apart

00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,650
there's been a lot of studies that have

00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,990
come out that have shown that when you

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:50,390
control for other variables more diverse

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,340
teams will always outperform less

00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:54,620
diverse teams like there's a very very

00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,059
strong correlation there and so you know

00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,740
when we talk about building inclusive

00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:59,659
and diverse teams you know we're not

00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,700
just doing this for the sake of a metric

00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:03,049
or the sake of some statistics we want

00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,260
to do this because it makes things

00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:07,940
better genuinely better and you know

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,320
when we kind of think about on this it

00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,340
actually makes a lot of sense

00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,010
you know especially when we take this

00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:15,049
lens view of the world you know we're

00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:16,400
trying to solve problems and a lot of

00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:18,409
the problems that we're trying to solve

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:22,610
with our products and our province or

00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:24,620
projects are hard problems and in order

00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,150
to fix a problem in order to solve a

00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,760
problem we first have to understand it

00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:31,460
and so we gain a better understanding of

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,990
any given problem if we can get people

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,429
who view those problems in different

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,470
ways you know they have these different

00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:38,750
lenses in different ways of looking at

00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:41,419
things so we get more diverse teams in

00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:43,159
place we solve problems faster and we

00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:45,799
solve them more completely because we

00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:47,270
have a better understanding and I'm not

00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:48,530
saying this is easy you know it's not

00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:50,390
just you get a more diverse team than

00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,580
its unicorns and rainbows it is hard

00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:54,200
because we get these more diverse teams

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,289
that means our ideas are going to be

00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,830
challenged more not less but that's a

00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:00,590
good thing

00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,690
I mean having our ideas be challenged is

00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,820
not easy it's tough you know once again

00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:07,490
we get defensive and reactive we don't

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:09,020
like people saying that we're wrong but

00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,850
that's actually kind of the point though

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,289
is that you know when people are saying

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,429
well I don't think this is right you

00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:16,039
know and we're saying the same thing

00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:17,420
back we're all challenging each other we

00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,920
get rid of the bad idea

00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,530
as quickly and we'd get to those good

00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,000
ideas a lot faster we create better

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:25,400
products we create more well-rounded

00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,200
products and things like that but this

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,750
is also even more than just a business

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,770
case you know when we create these more

00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,780
diverse teams you know we're bringing

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:35,000
more people to the table we're uplifting

00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:37,640
all of society and not just a single

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,220
segment in it I think there's all these

00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,330
kinds of network effects that we get

00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:43,700
whenever we're just bringing more people

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,370
into the fold and you know as we've seen

00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,200
there's oftentimes a lack of talent in

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:50,810
engineering you know it's hard to find

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,030
people to fill roles we need more people

00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,560
and if we can start reaching out to more

00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:56,870
people to fill those roles that need to

00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,640
be filled not only are we getting the

00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:02,240
people we need we're able to build

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,950
better products and at the same time and

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,570
we're just we're helping out a lot of

00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:07,400
these individuals too we're addressing a

00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:10,070
lot of these systemic issues that we

00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,230
have Asus's in society so hopefully we

00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:13,940
can get to a point someday where we

00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:18,200
actually are working on fixing these

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:19,880
bugs and society and there's a lot of

00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,440
ways to do that like I said before if

00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,150
you want to learn more Mozilla has an

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,710
inclusion lounge that's going on there's

00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:27,320
a panel discussion going on right after

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,640
this in fact and I'm gonna be there and

00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,730
with that I want to thank you all for

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,730
listening

00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,830
