Yes, it’s still experimental, but you can build a peer-to-peer real-time connection using WebRTC - a connection that shares audio, video, files in a fast, highly secure, decentralized manner.

In this talk, we will cover how to open up a peer connection using JavaScript, and how to transmit data via a data channel.

We will demystify the underlying technologies of the WebRTC protocols (STUN and TURN for example) and show you that it’s possible to store files in a safe, highly secure and decentralized way.
