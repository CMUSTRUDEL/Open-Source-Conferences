In 98’ I made my first webpage, which leveraged JavaScript to annoy visitors with blinking text animations. In 2017 I developed a film entirely in JS, which debuted in the Tribeca Film Festival. You can do so much with the browser today: Procedural art, interactive VR, physical simulation, real-time multiplayer games - and that’s just the tip of the iceberg. In this talk I want to take you a step further beyond sites and Web Apps. Perhaps your next project could push the envelope of the web as we know it?

hi Leon yeah okay cool

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:11,639
how's everyone doing how amazing is Jase

00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:15,470
conf Iceland so far yeah okay stop I

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:20,480
have a talk to make so let me start with

00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:25,800
confession I less than three JavaScript

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:29,340
JavaScript is amazing and weird and pure

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,009
and awesome and strange javascript is

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,100
the only language I know of where you

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,809
take your code run it through an igloo

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,260
fire on it to then run it through a

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,660
predefined and I mean we've created an

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,420
ecosystem that allows people to

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,280
contribute so much that now we

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,940
constantly complain when people

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,800
contribute things and javascript is

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:59,070
everywhere so my browser runs JavaScript

00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,260
my server runs JavaScript my TV runs

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,390
JavaScript my washing machine

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,030
well that doesn't run JavaScript that

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,400
probably runs C++ but only because you

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,490
need pointers and memory management when

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,340
you're handling soft fabrics and and

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:17,360
according to some TV shows JavaScript

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:22,580
can even run weapons guidance systems

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:24,900
well only if you're using jQuery that is

00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,909
like if they haven't uploaded the code

00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:33,060
to github so I didn't test it yet but it

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:36,180
looks legit so we just is is you know

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:39,689
it's ubiquitous everyone uses it and you

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,189
can you know do everything with it but

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:43,110
you don't have to trust me like you

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,899
don't have to trust what I'm saying you

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,460
can trust this book from 2003 literally

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,649
titled how to do everything with

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,920
JavaScript and this book teaches you

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:58,710
amazing things like version one point X

00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:04,500
or version 2.0 new stuff okay

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:07,140
so javascript does a lot of things but

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,330
I'm here to show you maybe things that

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,810
you weren't we thought weren't possible

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,709
of JavaScript or kind of off the beaten

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,110
path

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,840
the cool thing about web technologies is

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,959
that they allow all of our ideas the

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:31,680
good and interesting ones as well as the

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:36,000
dumb and silly ones okay so my name is

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:39,359
at offer v I come from you from Tel Aviv

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:48,030
Israel where the spoken language is loud

00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:50,940
Hebrew and you might not notice but my

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:54,690
name offer in Hebrew means fun you know

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:58,019
like Bambi not sure why I just told you

00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:01,739
that does seem important at a time I'm a

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:04,739
designer a musician I'm sometimes a

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,659
gamer and it turns out that javascript

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,829
is really good for all of these things

00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:13,530
so that makes me a developer in my day

00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:16,109
to day work at a company called echo as

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,230
a creative developer what exactly is a

00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:22,340
creative developer according to some

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:25,290
definitions those being my definition

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,799
that means someone who works with other

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,560
creative people like film maker game

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,470
makers musicians designers to do all

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,980
sorts of cool interactive things on the

00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,349
web and I want to start by telling you a

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,989
little story about myself and how I got

00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:46,079
into web development so the year was

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,690
like 97 or 98 and I was 15 years old and

00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:53,099
I was spending a weekend over at my

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:57,120
grandfather's and it is there that I

00:03:53,099 --> 00:04:00,239
found a book about HTML and that book

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,209
was mesmerizing I remember working hours

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,519
of notepad and then Netscape for like

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:09,150
trying to to figure out like what this

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,519
thing does and I read about this amazing

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:15,900
technology called links I allow you to

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,060
connect one web page to the other web

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,329
page and that seemed amazing like that

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,099
seemed but the problem is it didn't work

00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,710
so well for me like I didn't know what

00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:26,960
was the problem like I I knew I did

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,050
something wrong but what was

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,900
like water song and then it hit me after

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,930
a few hours you see it's not called a

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,449
Herff element it's called a RIF element

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:41,780
cuz that makes so much more sense you

00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:42,830
know riff and not hurt anyone you

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,639
understand why I didn't have a

00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:49,759
girlfriend until date is funny what fast

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,240
forward a few weeks later and my I had

00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,699
my first website up on Geo CDs does

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,840
anyone remember Geocities yeah I don't

00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:01,500
care it looked kind of something like

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,410
this

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:11,860
[Music]

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:13,330
actually it looked more like this and

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,420
you know you're laughing at this because

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,160
it's you know it's hilarious but we

00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,490
didn't have fancy technology back then

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,130
we didn't have CSS and the cloud or any

00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,010
idea what we were doing we had to build

00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:32,350
our websites with nested tables I mean

00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:34,720
these kinds of nested tables and long

00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:37,420
not long after like I honed my skills I

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:42,130
worked on making websites in the early

00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:44,590
or late 90s that is and I finally as a

00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:47,770
teenager was able to make some pocket

00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:50,170
money by making websites for companies

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,930
so like one of the first websites I've

00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:56,230
ever made an actual company paid me

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:59,110
actual money for this thing and I don't

00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:01,120
know it looks like this like maybe shoe

00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,840
shaped sidebars were all the rage back

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,220
then but uh the funny thing about this

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,980
is that it actually has a button that

00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:12,430
allows you to turn off JavaScript how

00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,840
that's an amazing feature but okay

00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,950
enough about me and my sense of

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:21,280
nostalgia nostalgia let's talk about

00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:23,350
JavaScript so what is javascript jscript

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,410
allows us to add functionality to

00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:28,600
websites so turn them from static things

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,750
to interactive experiences so take a

00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,660
look at this simple phone input number

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:38,680
phone number and put for example so you

00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,360
know it's style 9 through CSS but this

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,730
has a slight issue because like if you

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,460
want to use this you need to like point

00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,900
your mouse at the input and then you

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:51,160
know use the keyboard to input your

00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:53,170
numbers and like that's just inefficient

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,390
that's inconvenient you'd say like maybe

00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,950
we can add buttons so that you don't

00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,080
have to use the keyboard if you don't

00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:02,110
want to so okay that's really easily

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,660
solve JavaScript let's advance there

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:07,210
problem solves like now the user can

00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,000
just click on that bounty which is his

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:11,830
or hers phone number and we're done and

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,600
I know what you're thinking like this

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,840
isn't this is a joke this is an

00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,940
inefficient method of inputting numbers

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,830
so yeah I know I hear you let's fix that

00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:25,210
that let's make this more efficient with

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:28,540
JavaScript there we're done and and I

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,130
know where it's like where we're already

00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,260
we're already there

00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:35,050
but we can continue improving this I

00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:38,740
mean JavaScript gives us so much power

00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:41,800
and strength we can make this just

00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:47,940
better for all of us all of our users we

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:51,310
can just you know you can endless so I

00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:54,280
studied design at the Bezalel Academy of

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,650
Art and Design in Jerusalem which is one

00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,320
of the best design schools in Israel

00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,110
with one of the worst design logos in

00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:05,979
Israel like I don't know what they were

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:08,470
thinking it's like I can't even okay so

00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:12,040
when I when I studied there I came to

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:14,880
realize just how amazing would it be if

00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,100
we can connect technology and art and

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,860
what technologies allow us to do that so

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:24,550
check out this example from mental oh

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:29,169
yeah and here we see using canvas and

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:32,620
JavaScript an interactive generative

00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:35,740
artwork where every time you click you

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:39,130
get something completely new so every

00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:42,880
user that but that just plays with it

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:45,670
gets his or her own artwork how amazing

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:49,240
is that and that's JavaScript I mean

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,890
this just you know just code just just

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,570
script and this creates these amazing

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,780
patterns but you can take this a step

00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:59,500
further you can transform this into 3d

00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:01,990
for example so this one from the Google

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:06,550
later arts team generates does

00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:08,530
generative machines via 3GS and WebGL

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:10,900
and JavaScript so every time you click

00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:13,470
generate you get this new machine this

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:17,170
beautiful thing that is generated from

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:20,370
seemingly randomness or another example

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:22,959
would be this example where you have

00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,540
procedurally generated all tiny

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,820
airplanes so every time you click on the

00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,400
next button you get this new flying

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,930
machine and that's that's super cool if

00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,600
you want

00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:36,730
learn more about generating things I

00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,590
should I definitely recommend you to

00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,170
take a time machine and go back into

00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:43,180
Kate captains talk yesterday and if you

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:49,240
don't have that then when the talks are

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:51,040
up you should check that so these are

00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,320
all personal experiences so you see them

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,930
on your computer on your own personal

00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,530
monitor but just script can do so much

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:01,620
more it can go out of your personal

00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:05,710
monitor and turn into a public thing so

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:08,410
this by this work by marpie a Polish

00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:11,860
base polish-born SAN francisco-based a

00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:15,250
digital artist lets users play and

00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:18,550
generate 3d objects and worlds using the

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:21,820
3GS and the HTC vive so this is an

00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:26,320
public and art piece in a public public

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:27,910
space and users can then take the things

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,760
that they did and print them in their 3d

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:33,960
printer and you can even go bigger than

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,670
that so there is a country somewhere

00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,160
closer than North Pole or so I've heard

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,230
called Iceland and there they have

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:43,660
sometimes they do a conference where you

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,210
can actually paint on the building where

00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:48,370
the conference at if you ever get a

00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:55,930
chance I definitely recommend going to

00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:59,800
that conference but but but art is a

00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:02,950
really good way to to learn and

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,690
understand things it's it's a service a

00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:10,210
good way to and the learning tool so

00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:12,910
this is a project like a self project I

00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,380
made while I was studying design and I

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,830
was really obsessed with the idea of

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,750
evolution so evolution has a really hard

00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:25,350
concept to understand and visualize

00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:28,000
because you have like mutation and and

00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,740
survival of the fittest and time and

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,030
generations so I thought like maybe I

00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:33,910
can create something that will help me

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:36,160
understand it so I did this little coat

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,740
pan with just you know canvas and

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,960
JavaScript and this has digital

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,880
creatures with very simple rules big

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,259
creatures eat little creatures little

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,819
creatures eat food

00:11:44,259 --> 00:11:47,979
those creatures run away from Bigfoot

00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:53,199
creatures and then you get this like

00:11:47,979 --> 00:11:55,239
from simple rules this amazing system

00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:58,329
which it's kind of like a virtual

00:11:55,239 --> 00:12:01,569
aquarium that you can look at and all

00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:04,179
these emerging patterns arise and it's

00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:07,089
just mesmerizing it's just you know

00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:10,539
simple JavaScript so I thought okay how

00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:13,600
can we take that a step further and I

00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:16,389
turned this into 3d you know because 3d

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,739
are it's always nicer but the cool thing

00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:19,809
about that is the web is all about

00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:22,179
sharing so you can share your experience

00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:24,639
with someone else so I thought about if

00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:26,709
I have my aquarium and you have yours

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,279
what would happen if these two

00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:32,799
ecosystems would were to meet so if I

00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:34,869
have my creatures and I open a portal up

00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,879
to your browser where you have your

00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:39,759
creatures well how would the two

00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:42,549
ecosystems interact which well one of

00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,589
them completely obliterate the others

00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:45,970
will new creatures arise like that's

00:12:44,589 --> 00:12:47,739
super cool that's something you can do

00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,410
just by typing javascript and hitting

00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:52,600
refresh a lot of the times how amazing

00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:55,509
is that but there are different ways to

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,749
do learning so one of these is machine

00:12:55,509 --> 00:13:01,059
learning and JavaScript also allows you

00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:02,829
to do that so Jeff's - it might not be

00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:05,679
like the first thing you think of when

00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:08,919
you think about like machine learning

00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:11,470
but turns out that's the possibility so

00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:15,069
deep learning GIS is a machine learning

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:17,199
like library in JavaScript and I'm gonna

00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:19,149
show you an example here and the way it

00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:22,480
works is that I'm gonna play a little

00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:25,419
melody and then via machine learning

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,699
we're gonna hear another melody that's

00:13:25,419 --> 00:13:30,119
based on what I just played so I just

00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:30,119
write this out

00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:44,420
I didn't say it's gonna be a good melody

00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:47,629
just that it's kind of work okay and if

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:50,359
we're on topic of music music videos so

00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:52,519
I remember again as a kid watching being

00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:54,769
glued to the screen watching MTV and

00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,970
which one and those all were passive

00:13:54,769 --> 00:14:03,679
experiences but the web allows us to be

00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:06,889
interactive so this is kind of an three

00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:09,679
dreams of black where you have 2d

00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:11,540
animation 3d animation whatever the

00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,569
other points the mouse like the stream

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:18,079
of animals run around on the building

00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:20,959
and that way every user gets his or hers

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,319
own personal experience and it doesn't

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:26,720
end there

00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:30,919
so this video clip for 4-acre decades

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,869
fire reflector uses WebGL and shaders so

00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:34,660
wherever you point the mouse like

00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:40,519
there's an image manipulation there and

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:43,699
also some 3d where the the dancer in the

00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:47,029
video has this 3d thing overlaid on top

00:14:43,699 --> 00:14:50,480
of her which you can play super cool

00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:54,049
stuff and I mean the options are endless

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,480
this video by real estate is an actual

00:14:54,049 --> 00:14:59,089
like canvas that you can paint on to you

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,189
like here I tried to tame the sky blue

00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:03,139
this is really hard when the video keeps

00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:04,910
moving but you know it gives you

00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:06,980
something to play with for your you're

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,449
creating art on top of someone else's AR

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:13,040
and this is something that's only

00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:14,389
possible due to web technology the next

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,799
project is something I'm really proud of

00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:17,989
is something I did at work

00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:20,509
this is the official video for Bob

00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:22,100
Dylan's like a rolling stone so what

00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:25,309
happens here is you have sixteen

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,709
different channels of video and in each

00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:31,189
different Channel the characters in the

00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:34,879
video are lip-syncing to Bob Dylan Dylan

00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:37,309
and song and then the user can pick

00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:40,999
which channels watch so instead of

00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:44,299
watching one music video you're like

00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:46,730
kind of creating your own personal music

00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:47,750
video and again this is like web video

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,850
it's just

00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,680
you know what could video player in

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,040
JavaScript and there are challenges here

00:15:51,680 --> 00:16:03,560
but it's just pointing your browser

00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:04,970
somewhere and seeing this pull so okay

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:11,569
you can clap it's okay that's one of the

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:13,970
things we do one of the ultimate forms

00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:16,519
of interactive entertainment is video

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:19,819
games subjects really close and dear to

00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:22,579
my heart and video games come in all

00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:24,620
forms and sizes especially on the web so

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:28,519
video games can be something really

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:30,620
small like this mini game and the

00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,980
website for the magicians a sci-fi TV

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:36,379
show where they use canvas and HTML and

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:39,410
some video to create some engagement

00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:41,779
while you're watching while you're

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:44,569
interacting with the website or a video

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:47,449
game can be like a 2d thing this is a

00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:50,029
game I made to teach kids concepts in

00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:55,100
evolution have I mentioned that I like

00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:57,110
okay nevermind this was done with 2d

00:16:55,100 --> 00:17:01,129
library called phaser which is based on

00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:03,470
a renderer called pixie but you know

00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:06,949
again you can let take this to 3d so

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:08,780
this is an actual 3d pinball game

00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:11,209
running in the browser and the

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,370
interesting thing here is that there's

00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:14,990
physics involved there's a library

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,569
called p2 physics in the background

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,059
actually doing the calculations so you

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:22,250
have physical simulation again running

00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:24,230
in the browser but everything that we

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,049
just saw is a single-player experience

00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:29,120
so it's just you sitting in front of

00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:32,780
your computer or mobile or whatever

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,429
playing but the web again is all about

00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:38,350
connecting people it's all about sharing

00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:41,120
so the natural step from this is

00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:44,470
multiplayer games players that have many

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:47,059
players this one called Wanderers IO by

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:49,820
game developer and designer called

00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:52,190
resinar gives you control over a tribe

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:56,600
and then you fight other tribes for

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:58,669
resources for land and that's super cool

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,200
I mean games are usually written things

00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:02,970
like C and C++ to be close to the

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,210
mell or whatever but then you have to

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:08,669
download drivers and update your

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,649
graphics card and you know all these

00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:13,289
things but what if you just point out

00:18:10,649 --> 00:18:14,850
your browser to webpage and just play

00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:18,240
with someone else without having to

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:21,750
download anything so that is what I had

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,750
in mind when I wrote this library Lance

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,700
would you can find Lance DG and Lance is

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,610
a kind of a server and a client that

00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,460
allows people to create their own video

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,960
games online video games web video games

00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,929
without having to worry about writing

00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,370
net code or synchronization or all the

00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:41,070
ugly stuff that I had to pull my hair

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:44,340
over to do and what can you do with

00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,880
Lance so this is a game that I made with

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,630
Lance

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,639
it's called sprocket league and it has

00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:54,149
nothing to do with any other game with a

00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:57,059
similar name but in this game each

00:18:54,149 --> 00:19:00,960
player controls a car and these car

00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:05,100
these cars actually play soccer and you

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,380
you this runs with 3d physics engine

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,110
running on the server on the client and

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:14,360
again this is all web technologies this

00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:16,289
is all stuff then you can do with just

00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,409
notepad you shouldn't do this with

00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:21,950
notepad but you can if you want to okay

00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:25,260
another really cool technology that

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:28,350
that's up and coming but also out there

00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:32,610
is web assembly or its precursor ASM

00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:35,789
which essentially asks you to take other

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:38,370
languages like C or C++ or could be

00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:41,070
anything and compel them to binary that

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:43,289
the browser can understand and then you

00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:47,100
have the browser running something

00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:50,010
that's far more effective at computation

00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,470
so what does this help us with an

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,820
example we'll be porting the entire

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:58,260
unreal game engine which is like a

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,940
serious thing web a game engine and run

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,519
it in the browser using WebGL so what

00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,380
you're seeing here is not JavaScript it

00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,510
wasn't written in JavaScript but it runs

00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,519
in the browser and JavaScript can

00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,260
interface with this and web assembling

00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:12,919
is going to be gratefull a lot of things

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:15,149
that are computationally expensive like

00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:17,609
audio manipulations video

00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:21,450
filters everything that needs some juice

00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:23,719
powering it but I am excited about a lot

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:27,599
of things that have to do

00:20:23,719 --> 00:20:31,229
Bertrand and running in browser so what

00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:34,979
if and bear with me what if you could

00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:36,629
run windows 3.11 in the browser how

00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:39,839
amazing would that be so you could just

00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:43,460
like open up paint and do something or

00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:47,549
you can like open up so later you could

00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:49,259
completely completely reimagine how was

00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:53,969
it when you were sitting in your mom's

00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:56,909
basement in the 90s and this gets us to

00:20:53,969 --> 00:20:59,909
their next technology which is what

00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:02,039
virtual reality or what we are so maybe

00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:03,769
you've heard about this but a way to

00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:07,440
learn about subjects that I don't know

00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:10,440
is to a way that I like is to look at

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,080
stock photos of that specific thing so

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,539
if we look at stock photos of web we are

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:18,749
we can learn all sorts of things like

00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:20,879
for example what VR is kind of taking a

00:21:18,749 --> 00:21:24,029
stroll up in nature and maybe we have

00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:26,999
rainbows coming out of your crotch or

00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:30,389
maybe what we are is sometimes being

00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:31,679
attacked by really old phones or or

00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:34,049
maybe you don't need to put anything

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,999
like you maybe you not need to put VR

00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:37,799
goggles to be in what we are maybe you

00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:40,349
just need to take headphones and then

00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:43,429
put them on your eyes and pointed

00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:46,679
something and that works just as well

00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:48,599
but we are and what we are specifically

00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:53,190
is all about putting you inside a

00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:57,330
virtual world so in this example you're

00:21:53,190 --> 00:22:02,070
in this musical landscape we have we

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:03,960
have sound yeah okay and and we have

00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,880
these

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:09,700
cute tiny creatures where everyone does

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,660
has its own little sound and you can

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:17,520
kind of play around with them in this

00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:22,330
thing but virtual reality is a

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:24,040
oftentimes product of 3d models and like

00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,910
something that's completely virtual and

00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:30,610
at work I did something really cool it's

00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:33,370
this project called broken night which

00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:35,740
is a film a live-action film which

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:38,860
showed in the Tribeca Film Festival last

00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:42,010
year starring Emily Mortimer and the

00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:44,200
idea here is that you're inside this

00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:46,480
film you can control it so the plot for

00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,950
this without too many spoilers is that

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,420
there is this couple and they had an

00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,450
argument and they they're coming back

00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:57,190
home and then there's an intruder in the

00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:59,320
house and you get to live that moment so

00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:02,980
you have like for example the two

00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:07,060
characters the man in the woman and she

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:13,590
takes the gun and then as a viewer you

00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:16,000
see the pass and wherever you look

00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:18,100
that's where the story is going to take

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,260
place so does the guy get the guns as

00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,800
the girl get the gun you get to choose

00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:26,140
and then you actually sync this

00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,510
interactive video this story that you

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:32,740
would prefer to see so the story is not

00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:36,400
linear it's completely interactive cool

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:40,060
right this leads us to our next thing

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:45,250
which is web augmented reality or as I

00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:47,380
like to call it web are and if virtual

00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:49,930
reality is all about putting you in the

00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,490
virtual space augmented reality is all

00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:54,100
about taking the virtual space and

00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:56,500
putting it in the real space in the real

00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:59,680
world so this example from Disney

00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,050
research allows you to take like a

00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,390
tablet and point it at a kid's coloring

00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:08,530
book and whatever the kid draws like

00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:11,980
comes into life in 3d so recent

00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:14,800
developments in AR allow you to actually

00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,300
do that or at least potentially do that

00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,470
in the browser and there was a talk

00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,690
about this by race

00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:23,320
yesterday also suggest that you check

00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:25,750
that out so we talked about web PR and

00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,370
we talked about where they are and today

00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:30,009
there is a new buzzword that if you

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:34,860
combine these two technologies it is now

00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:36,700
called web X R or web extended reality

00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,820
and I know

00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:45,460
Mozilla is pushing hard on a standard

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:47,259
that to progress this forward and I know

00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,899
I'm joking but this is like super cool

00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:53,169
stuff so the last last thing we're going

00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:57,159
to talk about as the physical web or the

00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:59,860
internet of thing is and there are a lot

00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:02,769
of interesting stuff going on there so

00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:07,259
one of these is no BOTS which is a

00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:12,669
movement that aims to get JavaScript on

00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:15,879
actual robots so for example if you have

00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:19,690
a robot and you have node and if your

00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:22,840
computer is in Spanish then you can

00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:25,929
actually control the robot via

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:30,269
JavaScript and that's pretty cool to

00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:35,049
Mai's or or you can do something more

00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:39,159
you know something better you can make a

00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:42,490
cat remote control so all you need to do

00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:44,470
in order to get that as needed Arduino

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,539
and you need the johnny-five JavaScript

00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:51,850
library and you also probably need a cat

00:25:46,539 --> 00:25:54,580
that's a requirement or how about

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:57,850
controlling and drone from your browser

00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,860
on your phone so this is done via web

00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:01,889
Bluetooth so this example from Peter

00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,179
Shaughnessy shows how he's using

00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:07,480
javascript in his browser on his phone

00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:09,850
to connect to a drone and just fly it so

00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,210
there's no app you didn't down Lenny

00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:17,169
have to do this just like JavaScript API

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:20,200
and this works today on mobile chrome

00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:23,049
and also on Samsung internet which turns

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,110
out is a browser but super super cool

00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:30,460
that you can do that so everything that

00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:31,419
I just showed you is is out there in the

00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,239
wild you can just

00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:34,959
use that right now what what does the

00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:38,039
future hold

00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:41,320
what does what's coming up next so

00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:46,299
according to West world an HBO sci-fi

00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:49,629
show about AI robots that run a theme

00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:53,499
park these AI robots are written using

00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:56,320
react so I saw Dan dance talk yesterday

00:26:53,499 --> 00:26:58,320
he didn't say anything about robots but

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,559
maybe that's like in the next version I

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,649
don't know

00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:05,320
hopefully yeah fingers crossed but other

00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:06,669
upcoming technologies web USB that

00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:11,619
allows you to connect peripherals

00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:13,479
directly to the browser web NFC for near

00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:17,229
field communications from the browser or

00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:21,549
web mini for the music people among us

00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:23,919
and I want to end with something that

00:27:21,549 --> 00:27:26,919
gives you a little perspective this was

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:30,549
the first web server ever that Tim

00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:33,009
berners-lee used in CERN and it

00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:33,969
literally had a sticker that says this

00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:38,109
is the Internet

00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:41,589
don't power it down and this was the

00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:44,349
first website that was used but then it

00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:47,559
showed and you know what a what a way

00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:49,899
we've done from that day to what we can

00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:53,259
do today with web technologies I mean

00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:55,059
that started there and we we are you

00:27:53,259 --> 00:27:57,009
know four hundred people who are

00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:58,869
passionate about web technologies coming

00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,639
together to meeting Iceland to talk

00:27:58,869 --> 00:28:03,099
about this thing that we're so

00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:06,659
passionate about how amazing is that so

00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:09,700
I'm gonna leave you with a parting gift

00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:13,209
something an idea that might again not

00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:19,769
be the best but it's definitely not the

00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:19,769
worst and that is JavaScript dance party

00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:33,479
[Music]

00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:42,520
okay thank you so much

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:44,320
right before before before you leave and

00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:47,530
before you leave him before I really

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,690
wish this stage my way my friend under

00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:53,230
significant other - and I have to show

00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:55,510
that I had more fun than she than her

00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:59,140
yeah so I'm gonna take a selfie of

00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:01,120
myself with you and you're going to make

00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:03,910
it appear as if you've had the time of

00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,010
your life in this talk and then I am

00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:09,820
going to win because winning is

00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:12,580
important in marriage okay okay ready

00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:20,100
