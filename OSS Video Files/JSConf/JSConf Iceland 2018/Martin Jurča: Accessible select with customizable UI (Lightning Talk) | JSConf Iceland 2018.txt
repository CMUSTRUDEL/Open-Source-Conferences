hi okay this is working great welcome to

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,880
my presentation about accessible

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,440
customizable select my name is Martin

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,500
your cha or you can call me macho

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,199
whichever you like and I work as a

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,800
front-end developer for the system that

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:26,160
sees at a Czech company now let me

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,830
address the elephant in the room why

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,040
another JavaScript select after all

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,120
isn't it the first rule of Eric's

00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,719
accessibility that we should always use

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,329
the native select whenever possible true

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,390
however the native thought is very hard

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,340
to style using CSS this forces us to

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,829
create our own custom implementations

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,070
and we need to re-implement the

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:51,870
accessibility into it as well and I'm

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,600
not talking just about high enough

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,960
contrast and large enough funds what I

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,059
mean is supporting properly assistive

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,199
technologies such as the screen readers

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,450
used by visually impaired and since this

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,729
is obviously a hard problem there must

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,130
be plenty of existing solutions that are

00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:16,320
out there well I have looked into them I

00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:19,110
have reviewed and tested various

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,869
existing solutions provided by various

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,280
companies also various techniques that

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:25,159
are recommended to anyone needs to

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,710
implement their own select element

00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,020
unfortunately there were some issues for

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,420
example the implementation provided by

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,960
Google as part of the polymer project is

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,150
not compatible with jaws and this quirky

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,200
when used with voice-over screen readers

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:45,930
so how can we use such a solution

00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,990
we cannot on the other hand there's

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,680
implementation by jQuery UI which is

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,590
buggy with plenty of screen readers and

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,659
remains completely silent when used with

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,399
voiceover so how can we use such a

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:04,530
solution we cannot to make things worse

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,270
we were actually looking for a solution

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,489
that could be integrated into any

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,180
project regardless of its front-end

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,310
technology but of course accessibility

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,000
was the top

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,319
one priority and what do I mean we were

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,450
looking for a solution that works

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,989
regardless of the operating system the

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:26,930
user may be using with slide reservation

00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:29,000
so when it comes to Linux since it's a

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:32,390
port for assistive technologies it's not

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,400
as great as it could be next we of

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,130
course must support all the common

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,400
commonly used browsers including

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:42,230
Internet Explorer 11 though it is

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,540
favorable if the technologies used by

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:49,040
the solution would be poly fillable for

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:51,650
up to i8 as hinted before support for

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,769
all major screen readers are used around

00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,959
the world is a must and of course we

00:02:54,769 --> 00:02:59,510
cannot you cannot forget about the

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,500
myriad of keyboard shortcuts that are

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,630
supported by the native select element

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,849
don't worry we don't have to consider

00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:10,099
all of these combinations of all these

00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:12,380
technologies equally since there are

00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:14,870
some combinations that are recommended

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,540
by the providers and vendors of these

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,390
assistive technologies it doesn't mean

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:23,930
we can ignore the rest we just need to

00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:25,280
make sure that these work really well on

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,200
the other hand there are some

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,900
combinations that are just not

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,350
compatible at all for example the jaws

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,690
screen reader is incompatible with the

00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:39,890
edge browser I'm told this is being

00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:43,250
fixed anyway all of this has took us on

00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:46,010
a several months of a journey in which

00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,170
we were testing and prototyping and we

00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,660
made quite a couple of findings for

00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:53,079
example the accessibility support in

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,880
browsers could still be improved and

00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:59,090
support for Aria which is used to make

00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,560
our websites more accessible and is

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,500
implemented by the assistive

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,859
technologies not the browser's is

00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,720
implemented inconsistently

00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:11,600
this leads to situations where you are

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,450
prototyping and testing a solution it

00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,100
seems to work fine in one which one

00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,079
assistive technology then you start

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,600
testing it with another and things

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,580
completely break apart after a moment

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,570
you'll begin to feel like Alice in the

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:33,790
Wonderland things just don't make

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:36,370
since this is me right here anyway there

00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,620
are some positive sites about this for

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,860
example once you put accessibility into

00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:44,080
the mix the Android and iOS platform are

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:47,140
pretty much the same this simplifies

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,440
things throughout all of this I've been

00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:53,440
reminded of a quote by Steve Jobs yes

00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,470
he's had more handsome than me great

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,360
things are never done by one person in

00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:01,540
business they are done by a team of

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,150
people similarly to achieve great

00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,190
accessibility we cannot rely on just a

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,900
single technique we will need to find a

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,620
combination of techniques that will work

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:17,500
well together well have we find found

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:20,500
such a solution I'm happy to tell you

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,260
that indeed we have a we were able to

00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:26,320
design a solution that adapts and works

00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,360
very well with all the compatible

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,890
combinations of these major technologies

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:35,140
the project itself is MIT licensed

00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:37,030
open-source available at github where

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,000
you will find a more detailed project

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,550
information a current documentation and

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,530
how you may integrate this into any of

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,960
your projects regardless of the

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,640
technology you may be using thank you

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,120
and I wish you and I stay here in

00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,120
Iceland

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,940
