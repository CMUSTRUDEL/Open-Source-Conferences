Around 10 years ago, we had to reinvent the web to cope with tiny, touchable screens. In many ways we had to rethink the definition of a web application. These revisions yielded powerful new features like push notifications, and (usable) offline support.

With the rise of Voice Assistants [1], it's time to rethink the web once again. I would like to propose a new protocol for how voice assistants can interact with websites. The hope is to provide a viable alternative to the current "app store" model of the leading voice ecosystems. Instead, what if websites could advertise services that are voice enhanced, allowing voice assistance to find and interact more naturally with web content? To illustrate the idea, I will compare the use case of booking an airline ticket using a screen reader vs. a website enhanced with VoiceHTML.

Michael Henretty - VoiceHTML - Speech Recognition as a Progressive Enhancement.

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,310
Alright.

00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,310
Cool, thanks, everyone for showing up today.

00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:11,250
I appreciate your coming out and hearing about voice.

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,349
I work for Mozilla.

00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:13,860
I'm a web engineer.

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,800
These days, I work on Open Innovation, and I will talk about that in a second.

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,170
The project I'm working on is called Common Voice, which is Mozilla's initiative to crowd

00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,750
source a large set of data voices to be used in speech technology.

00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,070
We're trying to solve the data problem for machine learning and voice.

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,220
We're currently working on multiple languages meaning languages other than English.

00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:41,930
If you're interested in collecting speech data for your language, reach out to me.

00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,750
I have some contact info there.

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:55,620
Today, we're going to talk about voice HTML, the web and app stores.

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,250
We're going to do a brief history of the web, and then get into my VoiceHTML proposal, like

00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:06,490
I promised, and then a case study on booking a flight with VoiceHTML.

00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,930
I will try to get into Q&A if we have time for that.

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,400
Disclaimers.

00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,070
I hate doing them but I will need to this time.

00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:26,270
If you read the pitch, the pitch that I gave you was more of click bait to get people here

00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,530
interested in voice and interested in the internet.

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,979
I made some bold statements there that I'm going to propose a new protocol and propose

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,909
a case study on the protocol.

00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:37,900
It might not be the protocol you might think.

00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,369
This is not a technical talk.

00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:42,560
I'm not going to release a library or an API.

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,229
This is going to be more about trust.

00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:50,659
I hope that you will bear with me as we talk about this today, because this is maybe a

00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,260
little different than what you're expecting.

00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,320
I hope it will be good.

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,780
VoiceHTML.

00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:03,759
So, around the end of 2016, I had finished my last very successful project at Mozilla

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,200
called Firefox OS - you might have heard of it!

00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,810
I moved over to the Open Innovation team.

00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,860
What I was doing was trying to what Open Innovation team does is reach out to other teams within

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:22,750
Mozilla and get them to be more successful by embracing open practices.

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:31,670
I was working on a project called Dynotank which is an ideas contest.

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:38,700
Pretty much anybody who was interested in Dynotank can submit ideas to Dynotank and

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,690
then we have a team of executives who you would pitch to if we like your idea, and then

00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,020
the top ideas get selected to be worked on.

00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,620
For working on it be we would do a week of a design-thinking design sprint.

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,459
We would have about eight different people from all sorts of different walks of life

00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:01,180
and skill sets, and we would investigate the problem and see if we can build anything there.

00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,709
One of those ideas was querying the voice-enabled internet.

00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,920
How can the internet and voice play well together?

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:17,390
One of the concepts that came out of the design sprint - you can see it here a bit, was VoiceHTML.

00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:24,680
That text says, "Voice analogy of HTML allows simple authoring of apps that can understand

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,840
speech and speak."

00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,190
Everyone loved this idea.

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,920
It had by far the most votes.

00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,390
Those little blue dots are votes.

00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,930
We really wanted to explore this.

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:43,670
What I would like to do is explore the topic of VoiceHTML by exploring what the web is,

00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,709
so we're going to do like a brief history here.

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,019
Okay.

00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:52,470
So let's start with the web.

00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:53,489
Why do we like it?

00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:54,840
Why is it so great?

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,459
Why would anybody want to use the web over competing models which we will talk about

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:00,459
in a second?

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:06,459
As a developer, the apps you make are easy to make, they're cross-platform, you don't

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:12,360
have to worry about gatekeepers, there's no revenue-sharing model or no approval process.

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,599
As a user, we love the web.

00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,380
That's what we use on desktop.

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:19,900
Your computers are now basically browsers with a couple of other apps.

00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,119
The reason we like it is work flow.

00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:28,570
We have multiple tabs open, we have email, calendar, looking up concert tickets while

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:35,900
Wikipedia-ing things and it is seamless and quick to get things done.

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,039
We love that we don't have to install.

00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,029
And these last two points are really important.

00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:45,949
We will talk about them and focus on them today.

00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:48,509
There's an established trust model for the internet.

00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:50,080
We know how to trust it.

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,759
We put our credit card information in there, and our social security tax ID in there, so

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,759
we trust it.

00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,180
It's taken as while to get there, and I would like to explore that a little bit.

00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,729
We have choice: there's a ton of choice on the internet.

00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:09,000
I can choose the device that I'm using - I can use a desktop, a phone, I can use any

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,210
number of IOT devices.

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,129
You can choose what browser, what sites you're using.

00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:18,689
The choice is really paramount to what the web is.

00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:23,599
Okay, but, the web is not the only model that is extremely successful right now.

00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:28,430
There are other models out there, and I think we need to examine a little bit.

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:32,970
Because, with all these great things, why would anyone choose anything different?

00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,669
Let's look at it.

00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,839
App stores: that's the other big model, right?

00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,089
An app store, love it or hate it, they're extremely successful, and actually pretty

00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:43,099
nice.

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:49,909
Let's talk about why they're nice: as a developer, the SDK and the IPA moves fast.

00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,289
There's no consensus needed.

00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:56,270
A single group of people can decide and a lot of people follow suit.

00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,080
That's good as a developer because things move very quickly.

00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,930
I don't know if any of you are iOS developers but you get a lot of updates and it's very

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,930
exciting.

00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,919
Next, you have a direct channel to your users.

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,059
You know exactly where they are because there's only one place they can be.

00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:13,649
It's not like the web.

00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:19,599
Then performance: you can optimise specifically for your platform much easier than this kind

00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:24,569
of cross-platform that we love about the web.

00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:27,110
As a user now, why do users like app stores?

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,330
There's an easy trust model.

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:33,589
I can trust that app store and everything that comes out of that app store, I can trust.

00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:41,159
The other day, I had to make a meme picture I sent to my family, and I went and downloaded

00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,669
five apps from the app store.

00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:46,099
I didn't care or worry about it, I just did it.

00:06:46,099 --> 00:06:51,919
Whether or not that's a good thing, it is nice as a user not to have to think about

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,840
what I'm visiting and what I'm doing.

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,749
Also, the content is curated and tailored more me, and also for the store.

00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:04,209
I generally like the stuff that comes up, the stuff that surfaced to the top of the

00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:05,209
app store, of app stores.

00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:06,209
Then of course performance.

00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:07,209
I love performance.

00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:11,759
The web is great, it's moving along, but it doesn't hold a candle to a native app.

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,460
If you're making a video game, which I used to do in a former life, you wouldn't do the

00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,460
web, unfortunately.

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,460
You wouldn't use HTML/5.

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:28,530
You can, but you're getting difficulty getting to the same level as an app, as an app is

00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,530
with default.

00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:32,770
There is a third value pool that we need to talk about: the owner of that place.

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,560
There is no owner of the web.

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,169
There are owners of app stores, and, of course, they love it because they get 30 per cent.

00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,159
That's their standard cut.

00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:44,979
Also, they get to control the experience for their users.

00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:47,089
They need to show exactly what they see.

00:07:47,089 --> 00:07:49,650
They can limit competition.

00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,699
If you compete with a business model of someone who owns an app store, they're not going to

00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:56,050
let you into that app store.

00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,469
This is really important.

00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:03,469
So we've talked a little bit about the difference between Web and app stores.

00:08:03,469 --> 00:08:09,360
Let's talk about where this competition came from, and we're going to take a journey back

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
in time.

00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,149
We will start with 2007.

00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:14,529
Steve Jobs.

00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:19,629
Let me just say it: we went native third-party applications on the iPhone.

00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:25,919
You may not remember, before this time, before he said this, the web was dominant on mobile.

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:26,919
Even on iPhone.

00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,659
The iPhone existed before the app store.

00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:36,769
There were a lot of reasons why the web was a great killer app for phones especially because

00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,300
of Steve Jobs, actually.

00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,432
He added a lot of these features you see here - GPS and maps, he did that, actually.

00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:44,432
He made it really good.

00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:46,240
You can make phone calls.

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,709
If you see a phone number, you can make a phone call.

00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,399
You can add things to your home screen, like book marking to your home screen.

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,680
That was a new concept.

00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,139
And then this pinch-to-zoom double tap, it was a way to use desktop web pages on your

00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,139
phone.

00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,870
At the time, there were other phones that were smartphones that had the web, and they

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,850
weren't a great experience.

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,750
In the early days, Steve Jobs was really bullish about the mobile web.

00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:17,230
When he released the iPhone, he said this: what is the developer story?

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,670
We've got the web, baby.

00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,620
We've got Safari, the best mobile browser out there.

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,350
He had a reason to be optimistic.

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,139
It had a great SDK and tooling already.

00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,139
You already had documentation.

00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:36,000
You already had this vast distribution platform, you had content discovery figured out.

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,899
So it's a no-brainer.

00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:41,410
Then he beat all of the existing browsers that were out there.

00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,430
Look at the Blackberry versus his phone.

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,889
This was a similar time.

00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:50,920
He had touch versus scroll wheel, double-touch, bigger screens and incredible performance.

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,980
For a while, the web was the killer app on the phones.

00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:58,480
How long was that?

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:06,540
Let's look: June 2007, he said, 2.0 applications, and then, October 2007, native app store.

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,620
That's about three months where the web was amazing on phones.

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,750
But it was a great time.

00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,250
But however, the iPhone was not the first smartphone.

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,720
There were other phones that were around before the iPhone, and the web was a killer app.

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,069
You had the world's knowledge in your pocket.

00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:29,689
You had transactions; you had vast communities discussing various niche topics.

00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:31,910
You had to have it on your phone.

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,910
Why wasn't it a killer app?

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,420
We have to look at that?

00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:41,139
We have to go back to 1995, the boom of the internet, this is where everything happened.

00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:42,139
One year.

00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:43,139
It is amazing.

00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,939
We had JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, all released 1.0, that year.

00:10:47,939 --> 00:11:01,829
Internet explorer, Opera, Amazon, the first Wiki web, the first WYSIWYG editor for HTML,

00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,170
and then the first computer wiretaps.

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:05,930
That's pretty important.

00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,509
Phones were rudimentary at this time but they had the web.

00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:14,329
You can see over here there is in Nokia, the first phone that had internet capabilities

00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,379
on, email check and map functionality.

00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:21,180
It was a huge boon for phones.

00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,610
Why is this good?

00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,220
The web had trust figured out.

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,240
I could put my credit card in the web at this time.

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
I could make payments.

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,290
Amazon was around, or Amazon became around because of that.

00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,709
Then discovery.

00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:38,990
Discovery is a really important and difficult concept when you're trying to make a distribution

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,990
platform.

00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,269
The web did it really well.

00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:45,589
Let's say I wanted to look up my favourite move, You've Got Mail.

00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:47,100
How would I do that?

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,050
I would search for it.

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:55,279
If we talk about search and where it came from, there's only one company we ever need

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:59,010
to talk about, right?

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,779
Infoseek!

00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:07,009
The year before, Infoseek came round and revolutionised search.

00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:16,689
They did real time search updates, and they did cost-per-click ads which changed the game,

00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:20,319
and behavioural targeting which also changed the game.

00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,089
They also did pop-ups.

00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:25,790
Unfortunately, Google came around about three years later and crushed them.

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:30,040
And, for a number of reasons, we won't talk about it, and I don't even know all those

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,899
reasons, but this had a lasting effect on the internet.

00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:40,920
Later, this site would break up, become go.com, and Baidu came out of this knowledge, and

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,190
it had a huge effect on the internet.

00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,829
Search.

00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:50,019
What did people do before search?

00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,100
How did they find content?

00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,829
Let's look.

00:12:53,829 --> 00:12:55,279
It's stuff like this.

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,120
Directories, and portals.

00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,529
All these links grouped together.

00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:04,660
This was the original vision of the internet - link the document content.

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,589
It was great because you could find things that you were looking for and you had a quick

00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:11,779
search type-thing but this is not the search as we know it today.

00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:16,259
You literally crawled the internet to find what you were looking for.

00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:20,589
People loved it, although, at the time, nobody would put their credit card into this.

00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:25,759
So the trust on the internet didn't come overnight.

00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:33,139
So, is this little thing here, is this the killer app for phones in 1992 when this was

00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:34,139
around?

00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,139
No.

00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:36,649
Phones were the killer of the internet back then.

00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,529
You picked this thing up, and it would kill whatever you were downloading at that time.

00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:44,959
The phones and the internet didn't play together in the early days.

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,160
A lot of that had to do with the trust.

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,411
There wasn't any trust established with how you might transact on the internet.

00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:54,050
It was a shared document for.

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,430
Why is that important?

00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,910
Why is the shared document store even anything worth talking about?

00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,230
Let's go back one more step, last step.

00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,319
This is Tim Berners-Lee.

00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:09,810
This was his executive summary of the World Wide Web.

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:14,810
He said this project was started with a philosophy that as much academic information should be

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,209
freely available to anyone no matter where they are in the world.

00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:20,209
This is the idea.

00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:24,640
He wasn't thinking about payments; he wasn't thinking about discovery.

00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,750
He was thinking that information should be spread to everyone.

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:34,480
So, I think that, if we talk about what we like about the internet, and how voice should

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,990
work on the internet, I really like this as a kind of visionary piece.

00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,800
Okay.

00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,930
So now we've taken a brief history of the internet, just random one, actually.

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,339
I'm supposed to propose a new protocol of voice, right?

00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,610
That's what I came here to do.

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,050
I would like to do that.

00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:59,579
I'm going to do that but I need a moment to talk about something first.

00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:00,579
And that is trust.

00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:04,481
So, if you will just trust me for a minute, we're going to do some pictures, and we're

00:15:04,481 --> 00:15:09,990
going to talk about how trust works on the internet, or with technology in general.

00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,040
Let's start with Tim Berners-Lee, 1991, no internet.

00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:20,420
In the early days, this was, this might have been the computer that TBL himself was using.

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,670
It's six for us to understand and easy for us to trust.

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,509
You see this brief case here with money?

00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:31,600
This is a metaphor, and it what it relates to is personal data.

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,250
I like to put money in data because it's intrinsically linked.

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:46,120
Money isn't the only reason why you should - let's say that money - let's start with

00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
money.

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,379
If you have money, you want to protect it in this brief case, so you need to put it

00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:51,379
somewhere safe.

00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:55,829
You can see there is this blue hazy cloud around the brief case.

00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,309
That blue hazy cloud represents trust.

00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:02,310
Think time you have money, you need to trust where it is, right?

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:10,079
We are going to use the blue cloud to talk about how these different models work, right?

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,209
We had this computer, right?

00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:17,379
You had your spreadsheet, your tax information, maybe finance and bank records, and games.

00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:19,800
But where would you get those games?

00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,910
How would you install an app in this time?

00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,360
Let's do another diagram.

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,529
So this is how we would do it: you would physically I get in your car probably with your family,

00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:36,860
you would go to a store, brick and mortar app store, and you would purchase it, and

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,740
you would be very happy, and you would come home.

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,829
You will notice that there is a trust cloud around this store.

00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:47,230
That's pretty important here because the software you buy from them, you better had trust there,

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,490
right, because you're about to install it on your computer.

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,639
However, the nice thing was, and the reason we trusted it was because we knew how stores

00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,119
worked, we understood that trust model, and we got our computer and the software from

00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:01,110
the same place, and we got our computer fixed from the same place.

00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:06,490
There was a little bit of conflict of interest there, but we could trust that.

00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:11,480
We thought they were experts, and all this software that surfaced, we assumed that's

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,350
the software that was out there.

00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:17,260
We didn't think there was stuff outside of this.

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,029
This is easy for us to understand.

00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:24,220
You notice, and this is something that is pretty important, is, for both of these trust

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,610
clouds, you also have a choice.

00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:32,899
You can choice to go to Micro Center or other store, choose to use IBM, Apple, any number

00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:35,620
of computers back in the day.

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,620
You had a choice.

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,270
Without this choice, there's really not trust.

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,970
The trust is an active thing, at least to me.

00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:48,040
If you talk about what trust is without choice, it is more like hope, because you don't have

00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,040
a choice.

00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,789
Trust is you're choosing to trust the things that you choose.

00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:54,110
Okay.

00:17:54,110 --> 00:18:03,270
Well, I just - I love this picture because it is like the feeling I had whenever I go

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,240
to Microsoft.

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,120
Or whenever I go to Micro Center.

00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,470
I knew some cool stuff was happening.

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:14,520
So let's talk about the trust model for the internet.

00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,980
This is much more complex, right?

00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,860
This is what Tim Berners-Lee had in mind.

00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,000
You notice the first thing I want to talk about - on the left here - calling it the

00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,529
user agent, and it is your browser.

00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:28,790
There's this whole new trust model that had to form around the browser.

00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,220
This is like your gatekeeper to the internet, right?

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:33,720
It's what all the information flows through.

00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,059
It is separate from the content.

00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:38,110
It is not all grouped together like this.

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,860
We had to learn about what a browser is.

00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,700
We had to learn how to trust our browsers, and, then, on the other side of this, you

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:49,090
have a bunch of websites which are all constantly under construction, constantly changing.

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,720
We had to learn to trust each of those individually or not trust them.

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,799
We understand this now, right?

00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,100
This is ten or 15 years later - 30 years later.

00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,620
We understand.

00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:02,390
We also had this middle part which we're not going to talk about but it is pretty interesting.

00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:05,929
You have like these dump trucks of information, right?

00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:09,610
That's the Information Superhighway, and, in the middle, there is this magic.

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,990
There is complexity there, there is trust.

00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:19,740
There are a lot of things to discuss: you have the ISPs, backbones, government regulation.

00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,679
But, for the normal everyday use of installing or using content, you don't think about that,

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,679
right?

00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:27,720
It's all hidden for you.

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,350
Your user agent brokers all that.

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:36,470
This is a really cool, this is a really cool breakdown because you get trust, so many granular

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:41,559
choices of trust, and then this user agent over here, it doesn't care what content you

00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:42,559
see.

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,260
It just wants to make sure what you see that content that you have a good experience while

00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,260
doing it.

00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:52,240
This is a disinterested third-party in what you're doing or using this platform for.

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,330
This is pretty important to how trust works on the internet.

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:00,140
Let's work on the app store model.

00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,570
Here's the Apple app store.

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:08,919
And despite the fact that we put this in jail, so we're trying to lead a little bit, users

00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,779
actually love this model because you have a single source of trust.

00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:18,230
You just use this software, this phone, this app store, and everything is kind of taken

00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,250
care for you, right?

00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,740
Of course, there are bad parts about being locked in.

00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:29,870
The developers there, you have to make sure that you're part of this ecosystem, but users

00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,870
love this.

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,840
This is a very popular successful model.

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,170
But it is not the way things have to work.

00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,710
Okay.

00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:42,510
Promised to talk about voice, didn't I?

00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,799
Let's talk about voice.

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,870
We don't really is have an established trust models around voice yet.

00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:48,990
We need to.

00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:55,149
We are starting to formulate one, and it's looking a lot more like the app store model,

00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:56,520
and it's looking like the internet.

00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,769
It is because it's much easier to trust the product you buy into your house but look at

00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:03,450
all these new data types.

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:09,130
Like, you have your speech, you have the type of music you listen to, you have control over

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,700
your house, and data about your house - your locks, lights, your habits.

00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,520
You have your ambient noise.

00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,510
All sorts of stuff here that is really a little bit scary, but you have to choose to trust

00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,980
all of it or nothing.

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,560
That's where it is right now.

00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,760
That's kind of just the tip of the iceberg.

00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,740
There are all these processes that go on underneath from the people who own these platforms that

00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,360
we don't know about, right?

00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:40,269
I'm a big fan of Google, Amazon, and Apple - I use their products all the time - but

00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:44,940
it is always good to be a little bit sceptical about what we are using and try to understand

00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,809
how could this data be used?

00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:52,039
How might they be using this data?

00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,799
Okay.

00:21:53,799 --> 00:22:02,559
So, I promised to propose a new API for the web.

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,860
But you've probably seen by now we've talked mostly about trust more than the web, more

00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,299
than any sort of technology.

00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:15,559
We're going to continue that but I'm going to propose a new protocol.

00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:19,120
It might not be what you think.

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,520
Okay, so, VoiceHTML: I said in my pitch a new protocol for how voice assistance could

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,620
interact with websites.

00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,570
I had better propose this right.

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,590
Any time you introduce a new protocol on the internet, you can't do it really fast, right?

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,240
I could go and have the best protocol right now, but if there is no consensus around it,

00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
nobody's going to use it.

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,669
You have to break it down into phases, and I've broken it down into four phases for you

00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:45,669
all.

00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:49,100
Bear with me as we go through this.

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,260
Phase 1, central screenreader day.

00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:58,570
What if, for once a year, all you could use the internet was using a screenreader, right?

00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:04,780
We could get all the top browsers come together and decide on a certain day, you can't use

00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,890
the internet except through a screenreader.

00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,640
[Single whoop from the audience.].

00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,120
There are a couple of reasons we want to do this.

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,480
I'm actually not a browser vendor.

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,500
I don't represent Mozilla, so I hope - I mean, I do represent them, but I don't talk about

00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,640
Firefox, I talk about voice, so I can't do this myself.

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,669
We have to do this together.

00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:31,230
The benefits here are more than getting voice better on the internet.

00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,440
We have more empathy from users than developers.

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,860
People will understand what it's like to use the web without these great kind of cool interactive

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,550
experiences that are visual interactive experiences, and then immediately, you will have better

00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,550
accessibility.

00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:50,350
What if we chose black Friday to have International Screen Reader day?

00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:55,769
People will make their sites super accessible overnight.

00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:56,850
Let's do it.

00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:01,730
Any of you who are browser vendors, talk to me.

00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,669
Step two, souped up screenreaders.

00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:06,930
We're not going to be able to take it.

00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:10,600
It's going to be too difficult for most of us.

00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,920
We are going to have to add some functionality to the screenreaders for this one day to make

00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,550
sure we can use the internet before and be at least somewhat productive.

00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,590
Where to start?

00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:27,940
We surveyed Amazon, Echo and Alexa users and home users, and said what are the features

00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,140
of the product that you would really like to use?

00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,679
I think that would be a great start for screenreaders.

00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,769
You could do email better, if you could discover new features and skills; if you could read

00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,919
and summarise news and order food.

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,840
These are internet can already do a lot of this stuff, right?

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,340
We have to make screenreaders have a better experience.

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:52,039
What convenient readers need to do is - what screenreaders need to do is track a little

00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:56,680
bit of state about you and needs to be ostensible.

00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:03,529
Then we can rely on everyone to expend, to build a really great experience in an open

00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:04,950
way.

00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,380
Okay.

00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,460
Step three: Robbie the Reader.

00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,110
Robbie is your friend.

00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,460
Robbie knows everything about you.

00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,169
He knows that you like using Go Euro for train trips.

00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:20,029
He knows that you're tracking Olympic figure skating.

00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:26,279
He lives within your phone and speakers, and he's always there for you.

00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,820
He's like your mission control, or the person in the chair who is always by the internet

00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,919
for you.

00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:33,659
He's like a co-pilot in life who can use the internet.

00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:39,550
There are a couple of things here that are aspirational, like a conversational interface,

00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:43,880
some sort of roaming profile that has your data that you can still trust, a semantic

00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:49,350
understanding of the web, and no knowledge of how to use websites, right?

00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,350
So this is interesting.

00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:55,440
Like, instead of an API that Robbie is interacting with, the browser is the API.

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,669
He's using the browser for you.

00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:01,260
Most importantly, he has your trust.

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,309
Without trust, you're not going to be doing any of the transacting you want to do on the

00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:10,250
internet with Robbie you need that trust, right?

00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,620
Final step: disappointment.

00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,890
This is not going to work for a number of reasons.

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:23,070
Screenreaders are for reading screens, not for adding some kind of personal voice assistant.

00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:27,899
Natural language understanding, conversational interfaces, they're still very, very hard.

00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:30,789
We're getting there, but it's years out.

00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,029
Speech-to-text, text-to-speech, those are still hard.

00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:37,010
That's why you only have a couple of of players in this space.

00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:42,470
Semantic understanding of the web, this is moving really fast, in academia, but we're

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:48,580
still far away, and we didn't even talk about monetisation apps, so it's going to be hard

00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,600
to do Robbie - Robbie the Reader.

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,200
The point of this is that we don't actually need any new protocols for the web.

00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,279
Web has some great APIs already.

00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:00,710
You have aria and the accessibility tree.

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:03,169
It will be great for semantic understanding.

00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:07,380
We have the web speech API, speech synthesis so it can understand your voice and talk back

00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,490
to you.

00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:16,560
We have real time communication channels like web sockets, and you have JavaScript, tying

00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,560
it all together.

00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,510
You really have a platform we need top we have so many things figured out.

00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:28,950
So let's go back to our model of the internet.

00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,389
This took us years and years before we trusted this.

00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:37,429
We learned to like this, because we learned about choice.

00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:44,559
This is still a prevailing model, despite the success of app stores.

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,200
Can we bring a similar model to the internet?

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,770
The biggest change here is you see just on the left, we have a house instead of your

00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:58,179
computer, so there's a little bit more types of data that are stored inside there, right?

00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:02,750
Then you have this little speaker which is a user agent for you.

00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,000
So right now, they're not user agent where they're vendor agents.

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,450
You buy a product, a voice product, as a representative of that company.

00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,309
Your browser actually represents you.

00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:17,940
It is supposed to be completely independent of the content you get from it, so we need

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,789
this sort of trust model and voice.

00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:26,400
The protocol that I'm proposing here is not about technology, it's about how we understand

00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,630
our products, and how we use our products, and, really, what I'm doing here today is

00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:36,580
I want to propose a question or a problem, and I want your help on it.

00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:41,299
That's why I did this click bait title because I wanted people who are architects of the

00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:44,669
internet to talk to us about it.

00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:49,289
We don't know the answer to this, and we're trying to work it out right now.

00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:55,889
The last thing that I had promised to do was compare screenreaders versus voice HTML and

00:28:55,889 --> 00:28:58,889
booking a flight.

00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:04,490
VoiceHTML is vapourware, no libraries to compare with.

00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:09,070
No matter how difficult it is to book a flight with a screenreader, and, trust me, it is

00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:16,570
very difficult, but it beats HTML because it works today.

00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:22,559
I thought it might be interesting instead to compare what we have today versus what

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,600
it was like before the internet.

00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,000
How did we book flights before the internet?

00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
How?

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,470
I didn't know.

00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:32,549
I had to ask somebody.

00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:35,009
I asked my dad!

00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,009
[Laughter].

00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:42,549
Dad said, "I would call a travel agent, and he was paid by the hotel or airline as a percentage

00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:43,549
of costs."

00:29:43,549 --> 00:29:46,330
That's a conflict of interest, right?

00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,639
So he would shop around.

00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:51,400
He would look for travel agents that were trustworthy in general.

00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,150
I wasn't even asking about trust.

00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:56,440
He brought up trust himself.

00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,130
Trust is always embedded in the things we do.

00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:04,309
You notice there is something interesting, this built-in conflict of interest.

00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:08,840
These travel agents didn't represent him, they represented the airline or hotel.

00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,519
This was a vendor agent, right?

00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:19,220
We have mechanisms in place where we can beat that model, I think.

00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,470
Okay.

00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:30,490
So, that's what I wanted to propose: how can we make a better future for how we might interact

00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:33,259
with these products of the future?

00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:35,750
Final thoughts: trust is hard, right?

00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,139
But it's important.

00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:40,250
It's what made the web successful, it's what made app stores successful, and it is what

00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,620
makes technology successful.

00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,820
The web I don't think needs any new APIs for voice - not yet.

00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,669
Maybe it will as we go along.

00:30:48,669 --> 00:30:57,000
Maybe we could extend Aria to add interaction stuff, maybe add some new APIs for open graph

00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,700
met at that tags to announce this is a vote-enabled site and you can find it on search engines.

00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,200
We can talk about that but I don't think it's the most pressing topic right now.

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:12,340
What we need, what voice needs, is a new trust model that is like the web.

00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,179
We need that user agent.

00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:21,820
So, to wrap up, my question to you, and what I would love help with, is how are we going

00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,080
to do this?

00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,580
How are we going to change our models for how we interact with these voice products?

00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,379
We are the architects of the internet.

00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:31,289
We kind of move the direction.

00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,399
We have a lot of power in how these things work.

00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:35,380
So how can we do it?

00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,640
I really don't know.

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:43,870
If you have thoughts, and ideas about any of this trust, reach out to me.

00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:47,200
This is my act information.

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,230
Also, this is our common voice project, so you can donate your voice right now.

00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:55,879
This will be a public data set, completely public domain.

00:31:55,879 --> 00:31:59,580
We make that promise to you so everything you do is benefitting the public good.

00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,780
Come and check out our website.

00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,419
The team, we have a blog, Medium blog.

00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:12,000
We talk about diversity and inclusion, open practices, we talk about voice.

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,240
So all of those things are there.

00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,769
But thank you.

00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,809
