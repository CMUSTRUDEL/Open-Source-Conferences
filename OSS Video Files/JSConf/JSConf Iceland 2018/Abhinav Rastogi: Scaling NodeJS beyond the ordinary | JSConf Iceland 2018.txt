We have been using Node as our primary web serving layer for the last 3 years at Flipkart, continuously adding more features, more properties and most importantly, more traffic onto it. This has led to the discovery of a lot of bottlenecks and a lot of late-night load tests. In this talk, I’ll be focusing on scaling a Node based web server and what kind of issues we have run into. This will include different approaches to attacking this problem like horizontal and vertical scaling. I will be taking you through the variety of resource bottlenecks you can expect to run into, like network, memory, disk and cpu. I’ll touch upon how to find these bottlenecks and what technologies you can use to solve them.
