Publication date: 2016-09-16
Playlist: JSConf Iceland 2016
Description: 
	WebGL is already widely in use for 3D graphics and image processing but could be used for much more. We'll learn how to pass arbitrary data to the GPU for parallel processing, how to get that processed data back into Javascript, and all the reasons this doesn't work even when it should.
