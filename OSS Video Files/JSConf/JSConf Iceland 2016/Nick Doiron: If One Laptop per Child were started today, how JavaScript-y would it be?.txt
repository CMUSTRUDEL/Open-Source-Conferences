Title: Nick Doiron: If One Laptop per Child were started today, how JavaScript-y would it be?
Publication date: 2016-09-20
Playlist: JSConf Iceland 2016
Description: 
	In 2005, it looked like the future of global education might be a custom laptop and OS for $100. Today you could use that money to buy two Android tablets and access eBooks, courses, and programming tutorials on the web. An OLPC hacker reflects on teaching computing in Uganda, Uruguay, and our new JavaScript world.

Thanks can you hear me all right thank

00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,770
you for coming all the way to Iceland my

00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:21,840
presentation thank you for waking up so

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,180
early this morning I mean talking about

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,300
if one laptop per child started today

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,340
how JavaScript d would it be we're a

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,439
bunch of JavaScript people we want to

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,210
kind of do a retrospective to see what

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,010
happened in the past and then maybe I'll

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,770
be able to use that to convince you that

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,200
we can do a little preview of the future

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:45,300
yet to come so they gave me a laser

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:47,430
pointer okay so I work with one laptop

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,130
per child kind of in different roles

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,750
teacher developer volunteer never got

00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,149
like a check from one laptop per child

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:57,230
proper but working for these regional

00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:00,930
organizations so I worked in uganda

00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:06,799
uruguay haiti and the marshall islands

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:09,390
out in the Pacific between 2010 and 2013

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,710
usually a couple months at a time meet

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,770
with different people go to the school

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,630
get the laptop project setup and a lot

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,850
of people when they see me they see the

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,010
laptop they ask what happened to OLPC

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,530
seemed like it was very popular very

00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,560
famous we have one of the laptops in the

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,360
crowd going around so keep it moving and

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,860
people saw it and wondered what happened

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,710
did it ever get to kids what it was it

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,479
used for does it really work to really

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,450
answer that question we have to go back

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,369
in time back to the year two thousand

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,610
five eleven years ago if you think about

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,720
it and the announcement was very major I

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,430
don't know if you would all remember

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,530
this but the announcement what they were

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,270
first starting it they have Kofi Annan

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,220
from the UN they have Nicholas

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,409
Negroponte e founder of the mem IT media

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,049
lab presenting this prototype a

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:57,630
hand-cranked hundred-dollar laptop is

00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:01,530
the goal they would only actually start

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,360
delivering laptops in 2007-2008 and at

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:05,670
the idea laptop for kids was actually

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,099
very absurd idea laptops were expensive

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,019
they're very fragile I found this

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,060
article from ZDNet that they were proud

00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:14,129
the average price of a laptop had

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,019
dropped from fourteen hundred dollars to

00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:17,250
eleven hundred dollars here comes

00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:20,040
someone saying I'm going to make a

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,660
laptop for just one hundred at the time

00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,100
if you want to get some tech for your

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,960
kid you might get this leap pad

00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,880
it has kind of some clever features

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,950
there's like a smart pen that knows the

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,370
numbers your kid is writing but not an

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,200
actual full computer the ipod looked a

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,090
little bit like this and people were

00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,860
saying why not give people an iPod it

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,290
has lots of audiobooks and lessons and

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,240
the belief was you know they partnered

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,850
with all these very free software

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,170
Richard Stallman types who said you know

00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,120
educational devices should have a

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,460
terminal it shouldn't be controlling you

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,370
you should have full access to the

00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,640
computer in some way it shouldn't just

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,080
need a device for consumption and so one

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,750
of the first criticisms that people said

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,300
right away laptop is a hundred dollars

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,640
or two hundred dollars is this an

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:09,210
effective like is going to affect

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,970
education properly by the dollar and in

00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,220
fact I'm going to say no in fact people

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,680
study this very well and they know full

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,990
well what are the most effective ways to

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,580
change education for your money and

00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,340
they're very well known very well

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,620
research the first is a deworming pills

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,030
every three to five years the kid takes

00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,950
these pills they don't get parasites

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,690
second sanitary pads for girls third bed

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,250
nets so you don't get malaria these are

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,260
very well understood if you want to

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,420
donate money to these kind of causes

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,310
please do they're very effective for a

00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,900
small amount of money and they don't

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,520
involve school at all if you think about

00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,590
it it just matters that the kids are

00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,450
healthy and going to school and not

00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,060
missing classes it makes a lot of sense

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,380
but in the world in the real world that

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,180
we live in you know people have

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,450
technology I go to these countries and

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,880
people are using smartphones already and

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:02,160
there's risk if the technology is only

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,930
developed in wealthy countries and the

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,000
technology is used worldwide that

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,930
there's a great number of people who

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,200
have no access to the economy and the

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,390
control over the devices they use and in

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,820
my experience people really want to use

00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:20,310
and learn technology like when I was in

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,620
Uganda I met a kid who was learning

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,990
Excel out of a textbook he doesn't have

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,240
a computer he's just learning you know

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,960
in the Edit menu of cut copy paste I

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,540
heard about a school in Rwanda where the

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,729
teacher has a C++ book and then the

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,660
teacher copies the program onto the

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,490
chalkboard

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,990
and the students copy the program down

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,540
their notebooks like you would never

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,520
expect those people to actually know C++

00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,310
because they're learning it in this very

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,580
convoluted way that's how high the

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,050
demand is how important is to people

00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,340
that are using this technology to learn

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,400
it and take control of it for themselves

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:59,580
so the laptop and products that followed

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,790
it is filling a very real gap and

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,510
availability to make our technology

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:08,520
world more accessible and equitable

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:11,010
going back to the laptop the first

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,910
version of it had just one gigabyte of

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,680
solid-state memory on an SD card and

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:19,280
there were no solid state hard solid 8

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,540
laptops at the time so very exciting a

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Nicholas Negroponte he does a demo where

00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,750
he tosses it a little bit like a frisbee

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,550
but he probably has like a hundred of

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:30,000
them at home I only like one here in

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:32,850
Iceland so please don't uh this screen

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,820
can go from color to like a black and

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,680
white pink kind of screen which is very

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,330
readable even in direct sunlight the

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,470
ideas like there's some outdoor schools

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,270
or maybe they're going to be able to

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,760
read it and direct sunlight a bit

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:47,280
water-resistant they only have USD and

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,860
SD card inputs there's a video online

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,110
where when it first came out where

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,570
they're typing on the keyboard as it's

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,370
like a faucet is pouring water down on

00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,110
the keyboard they're very excited to

00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:00,870
make it water resistant and they work

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,540
very hard to source the very lowest cost

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:05,250
pieces so in some cases that was a very

00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,980
poor decision there was touch pads that

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:10,410
didn't work very well they also agreed

00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,150
not to sell it outright in the United

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,580
States so they wouldn't be competing

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,550
with other laptops using the same parts

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,140
which would end up to be a problem later

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,000
so today we're kind of in a different

00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,160
environment year and a half ago I was

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,330
back in Haiti and a building they've

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,510
been destroyed in the earthquake has

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,940
been rebuilt and there's this factory in

00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:33,750
a sense called I think they call it

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,850
hence com kind of unusual name but

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,950
there's a system now where there's a

00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:40,320
chinese company will they'll do a

00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:42,090
program where they'll set up they

00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,740
manufacture the pieces in china and they

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,890
set up an assembly plant in local

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:48,270
countries so haiti north korea other

00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,129
countries you wouldn't really expect to

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,770
be manufacturing tablets

00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:55,979
control that final assembly step so

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,300
today if I were setting up a project I

00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:00,149
wouldn't go through a whole trouble of

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,330
building you know a brand new hardware

00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:05,459
from scratch instead I would say look

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,349
you can go to this office they'll give

00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:10,610
you a tablet you don't have to smuggle

00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:13,139
computers into the country anymore and

00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:15,269
it works if the screen breaks you can

00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,479
bring it back for repairs they also have

00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:19,619
some solar panels and phone chargers and

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,740
things they make a lot of really

00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:24,360
interesting stuff there another really

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,189
good idea about that came with the

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,080
laptop project was this idea of a mesh

00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:29,999
network even today this is really

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,289
difficult if someone said okay by the

00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:33,749
end of the day we need to have a mesh

00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:35,369
network with everyone's phones connected

00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:37,889
I don't know if we could do it like we

00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:40,229
were smart people but in small clusters

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:43,169
it's doable but then as it expands out

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:45,389
it's very difficult in fact the largest

00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:47,849
deployment plans say ball and org why

00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:49,800
just in this operating system that they

00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:52,529
use they just disabled mesh networking

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,669
all together but when it does work I

00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:55,740
mean you have to understand these

00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:57,689
teachers have never used Google Docs so

00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,860
it's like oh well they're typing and

00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:04,589
it's typing on someone else's computer

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:07,139
people were very excited so then finally

00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:08,699
we have the operating system many people

00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:11,759
they turn on their like what is this is

00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:14,610
this a real computer so it has linux as

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,699
fedora with the support of red hat and

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:20,639
then they added on top of this an MIT

00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:25,079
Media Lab sort of dream quest called

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,550
sugar and so the idea was I think this

00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,860
comes into play later but the idea was

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,379
they could be deploying this laptop in

00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,000
countries where people are not with very

00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:34,649
young kids who aren't literate yet or

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,870
countries where there's some countries

00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:39,360
where even some teachers aren't literate

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,459
to the full extent so they were saying

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,560
let's make an interface that's all about

00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:45,540
these colorful icons it makes kids want

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,250
to try different things and there's

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:48,930
still new releases to this there's one

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,360
laptop per child and there's a separate

00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:53,149
nonprofit called sugar labs so you can

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,470
get this as a separate deployment and

00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,939
today if I said I'm going to do an

00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,860
education project and I'm going to start

00:08:56,939 --> 00:09:00,120
by building my own operating system you

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,140
would be like Nick get out of here don't

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,730
do it but

00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,440
time Android was just a feature phone

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,110
operating system there wasn't really an

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,780
option you had to pay for stuff so the

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:13,630
idea of there being an operating system

00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:16,120
that would be easy for kids to use was

00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:18,040
important then and then now it's kind of

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,310
like oh no like you know we've made this

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,900
huge investment so MIT vision like why

00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,180
are they making the heart the laptop so

00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,100
sturdy why are they making the laptop

00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,800
have its own operating system with these

00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:32,140
colorful icons is there picturing at the

00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,990
time you know these very rural schools

00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,060
outdoors sometimes in sub-saharan Africa

00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:40,450
in Afghanistan Pakistan where this

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:42,850
picture is taken they actually did a lot

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:45,460
of talking with Gaddafi in Libya sort of

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,530
a awkward time for us politics at the

00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,630
time but they thought that Gaddafi might

00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,190
buy millions of these or maybe there

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,600
would be a state in India that would buy

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,340
a million of them and then the other

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,230
states would start competing with them

00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:58,360
but that never worked out there was

00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:00,670
never like a massive multi-million

00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,610
laptop order so instead of reaching the

00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,960
hundred-dollar laptop target they don't

00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,670
have that level of production so it's

00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,250
closer to two hundred dollars for the

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:11,950
laptop they were thinking about

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:13,780
illiteracy the there's a quote that gets

00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:16,000
used a lot about if they put a hundred

00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,770
books on 100 laptops you would have

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,740
10,000 books and that's better than we

00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:22,030
would have in our school library but you

00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,010
know like is one kid going to have all

00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:25,870
the biology textbooks and one kid can

00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,910
have all the French poetry like it

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,500
doesn't really make sense it turns out

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,110
in a real classroom environment you want

00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,180
kids doll the same book so they can read

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,950
together and write their notes and so so

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,930
not just like have each kids struggling

00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:41,500
with their own book that no one's heard

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:43,620
of and then it turned out it wasn't

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,060
about sub-saharan Africa it turned out

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:50,170
the largest participants in the project

00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:52,630
were or why and Peru I think each

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:56,860
country is bought about a million of the

00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:59,680
laptops and over over time and so each

00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,090
kid in Uruguay gets it like they can

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,310
bring it home because your neighbor's

00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:05,050
kid has 12 there's no danger of being

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,000
stolen you can take it to the post

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,950
office and get it repaired look it's a

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,750
whole national system and everyone's

00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,460
very proud of it you see the laptop was

00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,460
announced at just the right time where

00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,100
they want to roll out public Wi-Fi to

00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,019
public too

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,509
public spaces and schools across the

00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:23,240
country and they said the best way to do

00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:25,399
that is put in the schools give the kids

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,569
laptops a lot of the kids parents are

00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:30,050
using the internet for the first time

00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:32,060
using these laptops it just ended up

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:34,180
being different from how they envisioned

00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:37,160
it so it went from being a sub-saharan

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:41,389
Africa project to Latin America

00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:44,600
middle-income country project the

00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:46,519
software itself you write in Python I'll

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,130
get to that in a minute but you have

00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:51,829
sort of a custom activity structure that

00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:55,459
you zip up into a dot XO file because

00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:57,980
the laptops called XO 1 X 0 2 they did

00:11:55,459 --> 00:11:59,930
not originally include flash or mp3

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,329
encoders they said don't you know the

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:05,000
wonders of open source and open formats

00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:06,470
everyone will use audios it seems

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,459
strange now like obviously kids are

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,769
going to go to youtube and be

00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:12,230
disappointed but at the time YouTube

00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:14,990
came out 2006 they were designing it

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,449
2005 to 2007 they said you know we don't

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:22,009
want to pay the extra bit to have flash

00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:24,709
support so what kids do now is they have

00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:26,959
a separate activity or terminal thing

00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:28,670
that they can use to install flash but

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,889
it's sort of an unusual choice that

00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:33,709
ended up hampering them later when stuff

00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:35,569
like Khan Academy came out and then also

00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:37,490
like the administrators want make sure

00:12:35,569 --> 00:12:38,360
the kids are learning office apps so

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,430
they want to make sure they're using

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:44,569
word that kind of an Excel type app that

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:46,670
I helped write and presentation apps and

00:12:44,569 --> 00:12:48,860
it helps to understand why they're using

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:51,230
Python Python this is like the Golden

00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,259
Age of Python like MIT switch from

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,519
schemed using Python a lot of Java CS

00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:58,730
programs were switching the Python

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:01,279
Google hired the inventor of Python said

00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:02,990
this is the future of everything they

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,850
create a project wiki since every set

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,550
one said wiki's are a good way to

00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,990
connect people they used get you know

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,579
kind of ahead of its time but you know

00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,009
it's linux distro so they were using it

00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:14,480
and though these things about the five

00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:16,490
principles that people would probably

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,959
talk about at length I'm just going to

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:21,079
say they pretty much exist just to

00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:23,060
insist on one laptop per child like

00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:25,100
people were saying i'm going to buy 50

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,529
of them and set up a computer lab this

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,480
is unacceptable to the media lab vision

00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:31,490
because they want the kid to thing

00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,980
it's their laptop like it's their pencil

00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,899
like why would they so when it starts up

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,610
it says what's your name and then that's

00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:40,029
your name like it says Nick's photos

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,860
Nick's documents like they're very

00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:45,620
actually trying to in a software and

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,720
operating system way encourage you to

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,970
just give this to one child and then buy

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,339
another one because that's kind of their

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,010
vision for the education and I think

00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:57,829
today you see a lot of more interesting

00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:59,709
ways of handling the puter labs this is

00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:03,380
a project called keep odd where the

00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:04,970
student has a live USB so it saves all

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,360
their software and settings and files

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,829
and the only cost is one USB per child

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,480
and then the computer lab can keep

00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:14,050
running so I think this is a good way to

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,930
save your costs on the computer lab

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:19,790
anyway uh scaling up and down so or why

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,860
like I said is a national project they

00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,930
had a very liberal government they were

00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,970
very interested in this equality of

00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,519
education between the cities and the

00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,959
rural areas but you know right away

00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:32,029
people say isn't this sort of a

00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:34,730
political hand down for the party that's

00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:37,010
in power right now so there's an element

00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,779
of truth to that right I mean but people

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,370
would start criticizing is they really

00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:43,220
want computer education or do they want

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:45,380
votes but at the same time if I go to a

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,750
school in Uganda and just me the teacher

00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:49,130
and doing like a pilot project doing

00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,050
some research you'd say oh that's

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,519
impractical that will never scale we

00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,610
can't send Nick to every school in

00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,839
Uganda which is again true so it turns

00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,300
out whenever you launch your own

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,399
education project doesn't matter how you

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,410
approach it someone will tell you oh

00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:05,149
that's not how it really works but

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,610
that's how it gets started that's how it

00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:09,620
could start happening I think they also

00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,690
didn't really expect the internet to

00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:14,269
move so quickly so many people are 3g

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,310
now even going for Africa South America

00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:18,769
a lot more internet but also they just

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:21,019
never expected there to be such quality

00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:22,459
high speed internet I think Khan Academy

00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,519
one of the top countries it's used now

00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:27,850
is India so people over there are

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,190
already learning using computers and

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:34,850
they don't need to have this whole work

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,560
around getting a special device ah in

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,990
recent years this is in this interesting

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:42,050
movement towards JavaScript both in our

00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,860
real world and server-side code and also

00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,590
in this edge

00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,660
asian world so the people who worked on

00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:52,310
sugar labs have adopted a project called

00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:56,390
sugar riser this is a web-based HTML

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:58,430
java SE 205 JavaScript app and it works

00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,170
in the browser there's an Android app

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,080
and all different Android app stores

00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,340
that you can download and use the games

00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,280
unfortunately you can't like open an old

00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:09,620
Python activity file and click save as

00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,000
javascript doesn't work that way so

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,130
everything's being kind of tediously

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,290
rewritten for this but it makes sense

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,030
they're keeping this sugar ethos of like

00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,730
an interface that could be interesting

00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:23,390
and easy for kids and remaking it for

00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,400
the web the two programming environments

00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,680
they had turtle art which is like a logo

00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,330
programming and scratch have since moved

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,830
to the web as well so this kind of is

00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:32,990
all these different activities that they

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,820
gathered and put on a laptop as

00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,100
different native apps are moving towards

00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:39,950
web-based tools and I mean it makes

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,600
sense javascript is pretty cool it moves

00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,450
along with the web and the browser if

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,610
you have a computer that has a browser

00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:49,030
that updates continuously and silently

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,920
kind of like google chrome i would say

00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:53,690
device is secure and all the lessons

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,340
that you create will work on the next

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,380
device and the next device in the next

00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,720
device you can write one lesson to have

00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,910
it work on other places and that's

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,530
something that I think it took some time

00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,300
for people to realize these open

00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,610
education tools are going to get buried

00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,740
if we don't make them based on the web

00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,480
so what's going to happen next what's

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,850
gonna happen like not everyone's online

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,730
so this is a project that we set up in

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:19,670
Haiti I know it looks a little bit messy

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:21,320
but this is a solar-powered offline

00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:25,700
server there's like this thing called

00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,500
Intel nuke and so we put videos all your

00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,200
Khan Academy videos your maps and your

00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:32,720
different interactive things on there

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,550
and so you don't there's like 3G data

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,280
but it's very expensive so instead you

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,870
have everything saved on the server you

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,570
wrap it in bubble wrap you take it with

00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:44,000
you to the school you charge it you

00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:47,690
connect it to some car batteries like

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,050
this and it'll say charge and people can

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,809
access all those cool online resources

00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:56,159
this is kind of a

00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:57,659
gram of how that works so it would be

00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,730
good to have all these offline online

00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:01,740
resources that can be repeated offline

00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,330
and one of those resources that we might

00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,309
want to add is a way for people to learn

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:08,600
how to code I don't think that everyone

00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:11,129
must code I don't want it to be the s80

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:12,840
coding thing but I do think people

00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:14,669
should always have an opportunity to

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,139
learn how to code if they want to so I

00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:18,980
get this question a lot what should I

00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:21,749
teach my kid my niece my nephew and

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,980
we're not really though if you've never

00:18:21,749 --> 00:18:24,539
been asked this or ask another

00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,309
programmer this is kind of an unusual

00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:28,320
question like you would think because we

00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:31,379
know how to program we would know but

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,690
it's not so easy because I mean we're

00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:35,820
here and if you ask around you'll find a

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,799
lot of people including myself here like

00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,480
you know learn it themselves with the

00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:41,100
help of their parents they know or like

00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,179
they were like not like oh stop messing

00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,889
with the computer they're like oh let me

00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:46,049
help you I also know how to code you

00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:48,149
know so see we come a lot of us come

00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:50,519
from this position of advantage we don't

00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:52,379
really know like it's not really about

00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,580
us and how we learn how to code is like

00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:56,070
how are we gonna get all the other

00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,230
people who aren't here today all people

00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,330
who said you know I don't get this and I

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,220
don't know who to talk to or like this

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,379
really doesn't make any sense or this

00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,450
doesn't compile how do we fix that

00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:10,379
environment so that people can learn how

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:13,499
to code in a more reasonable way I met

00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:15,480
someone at UPenn and she said that she

00:19:13,499 --> 00:19:17,580
learned how to code herself she went to

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,039
school there using scratch which has the

00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,710
interactive blocks and she said it's

00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,509
like a slap in the face she said I'm

00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,519
like well I was nice to her at the time

00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:28,139
but if I went back in time and came up

00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:29,879
with this great come back and be like

00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:31,740
it's not about you like you were already

00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:33,029
learning how to code it's like when you

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,330
went to school if you learn how to read

00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:38,190
and you have to learn phonics again like

00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:39,690
it's not about you we're not sympathetic

00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,639
that you have to learn phonics again

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,799
it's about everyone else everyone should

00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,299
learn how to read and so we're going to

00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:48,659
spend time on that and make sure it

00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:49,769
works you think open-source onboarding

00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:50,909
would be the easiest way to do this you

00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:52,769
don't have to be part of a government or

00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:54,299
a company you don't have to be old

00:19:52,769 --> 00:19:56,519
enough to drive in order to participate

00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:58,049
in an open source project but it's still

00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,149
really hard to join an open source

00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:02,009
project if I send someone to get up what

00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:03,240
are they going to do there looks like oh

00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:04,200
well they should download this text

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,990
editor and they should start running a

00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,670
program and then do

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,460
get clone and there's things that people

00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:11,350
don't know yet and even the whole idea

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,440
of open source is really weird to people

00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,000
a couple weeks ago I was talking to a

00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,240
cashier at the coffee shop I'm like I'm

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,010
going to Iceland anyway and I she was

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:23,380
like are you supporting like a brand or

00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:25,510
a product I was like well well it's like

00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,240
we write the code and then we give it

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,550
away for free and then I tell a story

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,640
about it later like you know people that

00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:35,530
people are very surprised by this still

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,210
their projects but are Mary you should

00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:39,010
be more projects that just accept all

00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,300
the poll requests you can patch it up

00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,710
later just so you know we're not

00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,900
mission-critical if you want to

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:47,440
participate will merge your code and fix

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:50,230
any mistakes that come up so back to the

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,610
laptop so there's four things that were

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,710
stored on the laptop for teaching kids

00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,620
how to code turtle art which is based on

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:57,790
logo etoys which is still really

00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:01,809
interesting concept it's like each

00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:03,190
object in etoys has own coding stack so

00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:04,570
you can dry it make a little racecar do

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,240
something make another little car do

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,830
something scratch which I think many

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,650
people have seen which is also block

00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:13,720
based and then pippi which is like a

00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:15,990
Python interpreter came with some

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,970
different math games and like a photo

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:20,140
booth kind of application photo booth

00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,720
application so it's kind of interesting

00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:24,820
but none of them really like drew people

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,320
in as much as like turtle art and

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,340
there's some different schools of

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,190
thought on this some people were like

00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,170
let's keep kids using turtle art let's

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:34,540
add blocks that control robots and

00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,730
cameras and sounds and just write

00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,890
everything in blocks why ever go to text

00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,450
code so that's an interesting idea I

00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,300
don't really agree with it but it's kind

00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:45,280
of an interesting idea today there's

00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:48,100
many different paths that people are

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,450
recommending there's block based coding

00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,760
which we've been mentioning so this is

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,590
with code org and there are two things

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,120
that I like about this screenshot one of

00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,160
them is we're not just using Turtles

00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,220
anymore this is I believe this is elsa

00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:03,429
from frozen someone who knows frozen

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:06,400
tell me so like it seems weird to look

00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:08,830
at a Disney character to your your logo

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,640
program i'm pretty sure because of this

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:13,750
and they also have an r2d2 star wars 1

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,830
i'm pretty sure more people have learned

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,480
how to code using r2d2 and elsa then

00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,620
in all the years that we've been

00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,840
teaching people with coating with

00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,269
turtles like it seems like a weird

00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,980
compromise but it makes it easier for

00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:28,840
kids to say I want to do this it's a

00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,760
game has my favorite character in it

00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,860
what I also like about this is with

00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,600
blocks there's no syntax you don't have

00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,490
to worry like oh I missed a semicolon

00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,899
what I also like about this is you can

00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:41,590
translate it into different languages

00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:42,909
this is a Arabic blocks and they go from

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,559
right to left like when you switch

00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:46,960
language they change the direction of

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,460
the blocks it's very clever and they're

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,440
actually a couple of languages that come

00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:56,019
out recently kalbe which is Arabic Lisp

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,750
kind of language and pataka just came

00:22:56,019 --> 00:23:04,000
out like in the last week it's like

00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:05,260
Bengali language and scratch and Google

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,600
are kind of moving this forward they

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,470
have merged all the all the people who

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,539
are making these different block based

00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,100
coding they have like one collective now

00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:14,080
where they're going to make blocks that

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,220
work really well on tablets so that

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,100
could be really interesting in the

00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,559
future there's also this idea of maybe

00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:22,000
we could teach kids using games you need

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,620
a pretty high-end browser for this all

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,049
to work so it won't work on the laptop

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:28,029
but I'd really like if we did of

00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:29,649
something like this because it's like

00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:31,750
you have a spell book and you move the

00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:34,269
character around you fight various

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:35,860
things it's not bloody or anything don't

00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:39,279
worry like you could not going to like

00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:42,909
be traumatized unless unless they miss a

00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:45,460
semicolon then it might be charlton but

00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:46,870
then also this is a part of iOS 10

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,210
Apple's can release something called

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,559
Swift playgrounds and there's like

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,440
little character and move around this

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,510
beautiful 3d world and apple is actually

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,899
going to do coding workshops at all the

00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,580
Apple stores so it could be that in the

00:23:58,899 --> 00:24:01,899
future you're going to meet people that

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,669
learn how to code using something like

00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:06,100
this it's interesting it's a mix of

00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:07,630
Swift which is a text language and it

00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,309
has some kind of block intelligence if

00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:11,529
you look at the bottom it's not very

00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:12,760
visible but it suggests what you should

00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:15,220
type you don't even have to type the

00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,980
words you can click the suggestions and

00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,070
then it'll fill out your program because

00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:22,899
it's recommending what you should type

00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,220
there's an idea that maybe we should get

00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:26,470
rid of all the screens and have people

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,480
learn using robots this is a project

00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,919
called bow bot which came out of

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,970
something called the ten-dollar robot

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,070
challenge I think

00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,870
a bit more than ten dollars but it's got

00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:37,090
some sensors it's got motors got power

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,539
this could be really cool to learn how

00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:42,159
to code just with a physical thing I've

00:24:40,539 --> 00:24:43,780
even seen recently there's something you

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,520
can there's like you can use

00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,770
Japanese Canada to write programs now

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,690
gnarly sure how that works there's some

00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:51,850
physical blocks that you can move around

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,740
to write a code and then also the

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:55,390
Arduino if you do anything with makers

00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:59,860
stuff look up our do we know it's really

00:24:55,390 --> 00:25:01,720
good device and then I think this is a

00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:05,260
few years ago now have you seen the post

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,299
by Brett Victor worried dream where he's

00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,669
talking about what if as you were coding

00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:12,220
you saw the consequences of all your

00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:13,690
decisions like all possible futures so

00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,429
as you're writing a loop you see

00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:19,450
different things being created and

00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:21,070
uncreated so this very ambitious idea

00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,260
there's some different gifs on his site

00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,610
that explain it and the two kind of

00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,429
projects that have gone forward with

00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:30,280
this reactive programming idea one of

00:25:27,429 --> 00:25:33,580
them is khan academy they have this

00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,530
activity for kids where you write the

00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,090
program and you do different graphics

00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:41,559
and processing very similar to java

00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:43,030
script and then you have instantly see

00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:44,919
the results on the side and so you're

00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:48,400
able like change numbers and see how it

00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,900
would affect your program then there's a

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,669
pro an IDE that's going to come out

00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,530
called eve which i think is supposed to

00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:56,470
be for like grown-ups doing web

00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:58,929
development and web apps I don't have a

00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:01,030
screenshot of that it's still very under

00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:02,230
wraps but the idea is that you'll be

00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,030
able to see what your coding would

00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:06,610
change entirely how we as developers

00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:08,919
think about coding and then going back

00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:11,860
to the interface and then going back now

00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:14,890
if you're going to teach kids JavaScript

00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:17,380
or if you're going to write your brand

00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,150
new education app and JavaScript there's

00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:22,450
like three risk factors that I thought

00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:25,510
of just as doing one of them is

00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,429
JavaScript could be replaced by some

00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,500
future language to be determined you

00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:31,350
know python made a lot of sense at the

00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,850
time everyone was very excited

00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:36,730
javascript is having that moment now and

00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:39,640
is at a moment like are we at risk of

00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:41,490
that there's also a risk that javascript

00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,230
could divided into several

00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:48,830
incomprehensible warring faction

00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:50,539
mmm feel like that if you've seen some

00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,619
different versions of Java Script you

00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:54,110
might be a little bit more worried about

00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:56,899
this and then throwing in there just for

00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:59,269
fun there's risk that machine learning

00:26:56,899 --> 00:27:00,710
could redefine how we write code and

00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:02,869
what we're actually trying to write I

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:05,240
mean I've seen a lot of weird stuff done

00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:09,740
with machine learning and does anyone to

00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:11,480
openstreetmap what was it yes okay so we

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,360
always thought you know we humans would

00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,980
pour over these satellite images and map

00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,679
all the buildings of the world and all

00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:20,659
its GPS and then they started having

00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:23,299
computers look at it and they so it's

00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:25,039
just for error correction and it appears

00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:27,080
like yeah you missed one you missed this

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:28,999
one you missed this one like computer is

00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,440
like this is so easy I can find all the

00:27:28,999 --> 00:27:33,350
buildings like they're they look like

00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,730
this so it turns out all the labor

00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:36,980
intensive stuff that people have been

00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:39,049
doing and mapping turn out to be really

00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,570
easy for computers to do once they got a

00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:43,820
good training data set so I wonder as

00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:45,860
programmers if we have machine learning

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:48,679
look at front end development or like

00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,419
wireframes going into HTML I wonder how

00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:53,649
that's going to turn out in the next few

00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:57,080
years another thing I want to mention is

00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:58,909
I have this whole thing today you're

00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,559
supposed to clip it on to your baby but

00:27:58,909 --> 00:28:02,179
I got one because I poured the

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,909
Kickstarter as this thing called

00:28:02,179 --> 00:28:07,639
Starling is not a step counter it is a

00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:11,749
word counter so there's this research

00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:13,429
that kids who hear more words I get

00:28:11,749 --> 00:28:16,100
better vocabularies and do better in

00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:18,679
school so the obvious solution is to

00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:21,139
make a microphone and clip it on to your

00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:23,179
baby and it's this really cool device

00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:26,749
I'm not really sure where this is going

00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:28,669
to go but I like it because you know

00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:30,080
it's there's no screen there's no like

00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:32,179
we're going to teach the kid this or

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,009
that it's just saying like we should

00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:36,559
have metrics and sensors that let us

00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:38,419
know are the kids learning what are they

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,759
learning what should they be learning is

00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:43,100
very early stages i think if you gone

00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:45,559
into this field people would believe you

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,840
whatever it was that you said and then

00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:51,919
you would get some really interesting

00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:53,899
results um looking forward like what are

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,629
what's the if you were starting a new

00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:57,650
organization One Laptop Per child 2

00:28:56,629 --> 00:28:59,510
point 0

00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:00,920
what are you gonna do so I think you

00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:03,800
don't focus on the hardware of the

00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,720
browser you say whoever you are whatever

00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,760
computers are available to you if

00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,860
someone donates you them to you it's

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,380
fine just get me a computer with a

00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:14,240
browser on it like we really really want

00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:16,370
on top a child focused on the whole

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,350
thing from the hardware and the

00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:21,530
operating system and the education tools

00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:23,120
really just focus on some people are

00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,440
going to get kids computers with browser

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,900
some people are gonna give them the

00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,030
internet and then their resources like

00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:32,810
Khan Academy and there's a group library

00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:34,550
for all that does I books and they can

00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:37,430
set up something on the web and will

00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:38,960
work anywhere and when you do that one

00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:41,270
thing that one laptop per child messed

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,580
up is their hardware they agree not to

00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,960
sell it outright in the u.s. because

00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,370
they want to get the lowest possible

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,220
price they don't want to compete with

00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:51,170
other suppliers but if you look at Khan

00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,720
Academy they're getting a lot of funding

00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:56,060
and interest because it's used in the

00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,490
United States it just happens that it

00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:00,500
works really well in other countries so

00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:02,540
I think that's a good tactic if you make

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,340
an education library don't say this is

00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:06,710
going particularly to this kid that

00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,720
you've never met say I want your kid to

00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,460
use this in school and I want the kid on

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,520
the other side of the world to be able

00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:16,400
to log on and use this to ebooks are

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,050
still really hard if you go on Project

00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,910
Gutenberg you'll find so many millions

00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:22,220
of books but they're all very old

00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:26,090
they're like dr. Dolittle when it was

00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:28,820
racist there's like like French poetry

00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:31,600
there's they didn't make kids books a

00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:35,030
hundred years ago is the problem you

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,890
can't find good English content uh and

00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,510
then local languages try to find

00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:40,460
something in Haitian Creole there's kind

00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:42,680
of a market now but it's very difficult

00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,450
you like I have a friend who like knows

00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,650
all of the publishers and talks to them

00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:50,450
regularly because there's so few of them

00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:52,370
so that's difficult to set up ebooks in

00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:53,840
different languages and then also it

00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:55,250
turns out a lot of times they deliver

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,070
the ebooks and the kids don't read them

00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:00,770
I mean they have a computer like they're

00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:03,080
not so I think if you had some way like

00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,130
to engage kids more with the books or

00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,710
found ways to make them especially

00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:08,500
exciting or interactive in some way you

00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,910
might get an edge but I don't know

00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,270
another thing is making it available on

00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,370
Apple

00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:16,940
double server I showed that server

00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:21,080
before that can work offline Khan

00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:22,760
Academy is made offline using a separate

00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,990
nonprofit called learning equality I

00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,750
don't know if they even talk to each

00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:28,970
other officially and then things like

00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,680
co.org which has that block language

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,260
they've never considered making it

00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:34,700
offline that's just their own website so

00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,650
I think you need to look seek out

00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,120
resources that you know have an open

00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:41,210
source server somewhere that can be set

00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:43,640
up somewhere else since we're all

00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:45,890
programmers or programming environment

00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,880
technical people i think if you want to

00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:48,680
focus on computer science education

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,540
because it's something that you know

00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:53,660
that's beautiful you should go ahead and

00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:55,520
do it trying to make something that

00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:57,260
works both at school like someone can do

00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,080
like an hour of code with their kids and

00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:01,460
just that's it but then also the kids

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,560
interested in they want to go home

00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,980
there's like a self-serve like learn

00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:09,050
what you will want to learn that's it

00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,420
I'm Nick Doran if you've any questions

00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:12,950
or really cool stories you can come up

00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,480
if you haven't got a chance to play

00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,550
around with the laptop like can you

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,400
bring the laptop up later and then we'll

00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:21,590
we'll try it out i'll show it to you and

00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,970
