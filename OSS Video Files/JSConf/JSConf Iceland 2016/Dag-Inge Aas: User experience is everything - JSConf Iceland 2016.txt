Title: Dag-Inge Aas: User experience is everything - JSConf Iceland 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-16
Playlist: JSConf Iceland 2016
Description: 
	This talk will not be about a specific technology or another groundbreaking step forwards for JavaScript. Instead, it will focus on one of the most basic things we, as technologists, so often forget. Because your users, be that developers or the average human being, don't fundamentally care about how things work under the hood. All they care about is that it works, and that's it's easy to use. In this talk I will tell you a story of how I came to realise this, and some of the things I think are important for all of us to keep in mind.

alright thank you first and foremost

00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:19,310
welcome everyone it's very glad to see I

00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,700
very glad to see so many of you here

00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:25,449
today it's a great honor to be here this

00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,220
is actually my second scariest talk the

00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:29,990
scariest one I've ever had is one in

00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,739
Japan where I was live translated into

00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:38,110
Japanese with jokes being 15 seconds

00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:40,190
later it's horrible so see how this goes

00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:43,070
yeah so this talk is about user

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,479
experience rather it's about all the

00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:47,330
stuff I've learned during the last three

00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:50,210
years of building appearing from what

00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:52,699
was essentially a tech demo into what is

00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,400
like a successful product or semi

00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:57,440
successful product at least so hope it's

00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,799
going to be relevant for you as you can

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,989
learn something as well yeah as

00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,119
mentioned i am logging yeah i am tech

00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:06,950
lead in appearing and I've been sort of

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,960
around all over the code base both

00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:10,670
back-end and front-end and I'm also

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,080
doing a lot of the product developments

00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,820
and some of the marketing work as well

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,350
it's been very insightful so I always

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:22,430
have to ask how many of you are familiar

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:24,050
with appearing from before row fans all

00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,910
right so about twenty percent so that

00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:30,020
means I can go through my introduction

00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:32,180
slides basically we are a video chat

00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,920
service based in browsers and a mobile

00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:38,360
devices and we're built on something

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,310
called web RTC and we provide what is

00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,900
sort of a different user experience and

00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:45,170
a different approach to video chatting

00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:46,370
than what you may have seen before there

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,870
are a lot of sources are similar to this

00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,540
but basically what you do is equal to a

00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,159
pair of in / anything can be your name

00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:55,580
or the name of your company or the name

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,380
of your team and you send a thank you

00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,930
everyone to talk to you and once they

00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,180
click it they will appear with high

00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,250
quality audio and video we don't need to

00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,500
register no need to download anything it

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:12,040
just works this is sort of a showcase of

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:18,740
the power of the web just let this work

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:21,290
and we launched back in 2013 as the

00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,950
first sort of commercial product based

00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:23,660
on this so we

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,760
then having subtraction and learned a

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:30,560
lot about what it means to actually

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,440
build products but it all started with

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,260
the interns as many projects do so we

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,420
were once like an R&D company inside a

00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,860
large telecom operator may be doing a

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,330
lot of communication apps and every

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,940
summer we would have students from

00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,830
universities that we hired in and we

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,239
starting to do projects that were sore a

00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,190
little bit cool and like you sort of

00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:51,860
play around and learn stuff and we were

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,080
their mentors and we had this idea we

00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,700
know that vibrancy was coming we didn't

00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,349
know a lot about it other than it was

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,910
for peer-to-peer video we wanted to see

00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:05,599
what we can create with it in addition

00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:07,430
we've had a lot of problems with getting

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,739
us a nose to work I mean we spent 10

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,190
minutes every day trying to just get the

00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:14,590
damn thing to work that's very annoying

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,060
that is idea that what if it could work

00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,920
with you just sending a link to someone

00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,280
and then it just magically worked the

00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,660
link was sort of the room so this week

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,989
so we had three students and we had six

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:34,910
weeks and we have this idea and it was a

00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:36,769
very ambitious project but the dynastar

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,870
feel free to choose the technology such

00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:42,010
as how the service looked and how they

00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:45,859
worked after two weeks we have our first

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,180
demo so he assumes sort of shaking and

00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:51,260
we're very ashamed of the things that

00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:53,900
are created they showed up there in

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,569
front of like 50 people most of them

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,790
engineers and showed us something quite

00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,380
amazing actually we got our minds blown

00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,329
because they they showed off not only

00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,590
having one to one video communication

00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:06,319
where pretend made it work for groups

00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,060
and this was so good that during the

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,980
demo people typing in the URL that we

00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,280
were using and joining the chat as well

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:15,470
and this was at least in 2013 this was

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,359
yeah mind-blowing nobody had seen

00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,950
anything like this before and I worked

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,989
in chrome stable and later in firefox

00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,900
and off-brand other demos as well or

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:26,210
other browsers as well so needs to say

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,450
excitement was high and was this sort of

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,830
early demo I sort of got us into the

00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,409
idea this can actually turn into a

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,729
product so the last four remaining weeks

00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:38,159
we get them a designer and we get

00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:39,389
some some more feedback and how he can

00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:41,490
actually develop this into a product

00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:45,439
that we launched and I was the initial

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:47,999
story of how aperion actually came to

00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,009
and you can recognize a lot from the

00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:51,900
service that you saw before and to serve

00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:53,759
the day built after six weeks the video

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:56,249
layouts is mostly the same but the

00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,870
colors a bit different now and they're

00:04:56,249 --> 00:05:03,809
much more functionalities and after the

00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:05,759
intern perious was finished we decided

00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:09,899
we should just launched and this is sort

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,749
of in a telecom industry launchers are

00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:14,219
measured in millions both in amount of

00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:15,990
money you spend on how many users you

00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:18,990
reach but we decided to do something a

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,550
bit different and we were luck to do

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,499
that because during summer in Norway

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,120
there's about this four or five week

00:05:22,499 --> 00:05:27,089
period of time where all the grown-ups

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,069
are on holiday basically so nobody's

00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:31,050
there to tell you I probably shouldn't

00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:32,759
do this so you wrote a quick blog post

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,960
you posted it on hacker news and read it

00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,330
because that's how you sort of launch

00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,419
stuff back in the day or probably not as

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:42,209
well and the feedback we got was just

00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,979
amazing we got a lot of attention the

00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:46,499
same reaction that we got in that first

00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,819
initial demo and while our service

00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:50,430
struggled and there were a lot of things

00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:53,550
we should have done better and we

00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:55,139
crashed a lot people in general sort of

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,459
saw the ID and we saw that this was

00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,839
something that we should really put more

00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:02,300
focus into that gives me to the first

00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:04,860
lesson I overheard a conversation

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,020
earlier today about some guy I don't

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,629
know his name or wasn't meant to listen

00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,159
to on a conversation or anything but he

00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:13,800
wanted to launch its open-source project

00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:15,240
no no no I have to it uses require Jess

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,029
so I have to do it in something other

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,889
the other thing and it's have to redo de

00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:21,389
Pisan that kind stuff that doesn't

00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:23,249
matter you should just launched early if

00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:24,330
you aren't a little bit afraid or a

00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:27,330
little bit ashamed of what you're

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:29,999
launching you're watching too late

00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:31,770
because the best feedback looking yet is

00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:33,839
that actually someone uses your product

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,969
they love it and you get motivation from

00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,620
that and you get prioritization what

00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:40,050
should actually fix instead of just

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,370
sitting there and sort of coding away

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,870
and not really know in the direction

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,779
that you want to go in and unending up

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,490
never launching and if we haven't

00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,810
launched back then when this was so

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,200
fresh we might have never been where we

00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,170
are today

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:58,290
because we got a lot of attention from

00:06:52,170 --> 00:07:01,590
being the first mover yeah we had a

00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:03,480
rocky first few months we were a bit

00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,070
lucky to have another project shut down

00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,720
so we had a lot of engineers to sort of

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,600
pick and choose from from day one so we

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,480
set up a small team we had like three

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,880
redesigns we tried to figure out who we

00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,310
were and what do you want to be until we

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,140
finally thought that we had it we were

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:26,550
going to be the world's biggest web RTC

00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:29,730
video conferencing service yeah but that

00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,020
doesn't really work and the middle II we

00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:33,330
did get a lot of positive feedback

00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:38,040
because we were web RTC based and I was

00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:39,720
kind of cool and hip at a time and that

00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,400
gave us a lot of buzz and initial

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,940
attention another blog post i got those

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,180
users but in the end the truth was that

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,650
the average user couldn't care less

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,620
barberton see simply wasn't important to

00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:55,710
them robert c wasn't why people loved us

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,690
at least not directly because when it

00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,130
all came down to it all of these

00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,230
services work I mean skype facetime

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:03,090
hangouts a messenger they all work for

00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,980
the average user and most of the

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,510
conversations that you have are between

00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,190
people that you're already connected to

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,100
your already taking the investment of

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:14,340
downloading this application setting it

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,810
up and it just works for you so what

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,460
work is he in itself was not something

00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:22,170
that would get us users you have to go

00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:24,930
back and sort of figure out what could

00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,610
we build that was better I figure out

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,470
what was the reason prefer people

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,910
preferred us over those other much

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,040
larger services because you could see

00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,630
that we were getting users we're getting

00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:37,740
attention outside the fact that it was

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:40,610
we're about to see based so we started

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,870
looking at what people said oh we got

00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,820
customer support feedback got Twitter

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,490
messages or comments on blog posts and

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,160
the same sort of tats has now become

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:54,420
more tagline is no logins no installs

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,180
and free for update people and just

00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,850
share the link it was super easy and

00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:02,190
everyone could do it so it was really

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,910
the user experience of it all that made

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,610
the difference

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,110
we are creating something that was

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,460
easier and better than the alternatives

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,810
and have nothing to do with technology

00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:15,720
at least not directly and once we change

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:18,600
focus do that a lot of other people also

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,010
started talking about us because we

00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,180
changed our marketing massive change the

00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,360
message that we were sending with the

00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,640
product and then marketing sort of

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,990
happened for us because people when

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,580
people love your product they will

00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,920
actually share it to their friends and

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:37,260
they will be the market energy that you

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:40,020
need so user experience is what made us

00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,220
better but technology was the enabler

00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:45,750
and think that's important to remember

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,970
for a lot of other stuff as well because

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,070
the user doesn't care about technology

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,270
and this is true for whether you're

00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,910
building a product where you're building

00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,250
a library in the end nobody really cares

00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:58,530
if you're using reactor angular behind

00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:02,160
the scenes nobody cares what build

00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:04,650
system we have spending time building

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,810
the product and figuring out what the

00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:08,690
product is and how it works it's that

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,630
much more important than spending time

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:13,920
for example scaling to 200 million users

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:23,130
without you actually having a product

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:25,800
that will do that okay so people loved

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:30,330
us but they weren't coming back that was

00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,250
a sort of our second issue so we knew

00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,990
that sort of from the feedback that we

00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:37,320
got that we had something that worked

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,370
but retention was sort of low this is

00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,950
pretty common for many other

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:43,980
applications as well after all other

00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,200
services work just fine and we have this

00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,000
sort of recurring feedback to us but we

00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,460
really think your product is the future

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,920
but that doesn't really help us we need

00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:57,150
users and people now to get funding to

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,770
keep going doing this so we have to find

00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,560
ways to make a product more sticky but

00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:02,760
how do you actually do that how do you

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:07,110
find these magical ways that would

00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:10,590
actually get people to come back well we

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,900
started out small so this is a sign in

00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,810
Norwegian I'll translate for you it's

00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,700
the actual song we used around oslo

00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,460
it's basically said we will buy you

00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:23,070
coffee if you spend 15 minutes testing

00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:25,170
alternate video chat because we have

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:27,360
this problem where users are global we

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:29,040
had a lot of users everywhere and since

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,950
we didn't have user registration it was

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,870
hard to get in touch with them but when

00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,510
it comes down to it most of you users

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:38,040
are ahead of you so by just going out

00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,990
there and actually start talking to

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,210
people and trying to understand what

00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:45,480
their problems are how they use

00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:47,370
application today and sort of what they

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,100
think about your application or whatever

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:51,839
your building is very very important and

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,370
doing something small like this which

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,630
isn't perfect it's much better than not

00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:59,490
doing anything at all that's the next

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,950
lesson we sort of learned was actually

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:04,890
talk to you users because the only your

00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,810
users know what they need what they want

00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,060
what their problems are and how your

00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:12,990
product can fit in to solve those

00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:15,750
problems because creating a cool service

00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,490
is meaningless if it doesn't solve a

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,770
user problem take for example Google

00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,570
Wave which when it was launched in some

00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:24,120
of the coolest tech presentation that

00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:26,730
I've seen in my life I mean I don't know

00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,150
how many actually saw that but it's they

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:32,190
showed off live editing the deafening

00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:35,550
thing and it was just whatever google

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:37,560
docs house now they that was it but

00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:39,270
google wave in itself did not solve any

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,240
user problems i still have problems

00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:44,280
describing what google wave walls I so

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,200
can't sort of described was it a task

00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,380
manager was there a collaboration thing

00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,640
I actually don't know but I took the

00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,230
technologies that out there and put into

00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,880
other products but actually solved user

00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,880
needs like in Google Docs

00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:07,859
so I want to talk to you about two ways

00:13:04,859 --> 00:13:09,749
of getting feedback as well so there's

00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:11,189
two ways of doing research I do have

00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:14,970
quantitative data or you have

00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:17,279
qualitative data and very often I see

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:19,679
that a lot of people use quantitative

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,149
data and only that so you have metrics

00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,329
and have your funnels and you try to

00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:26,069
measure all things in your application

00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:28,499
and that's fine because metrics can tell

00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:31,679
you what the user does but it will never

00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:34,019
tell you why so take an example we can

00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,939
clearly see that we have a high

00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,949
acquisition like many people come to our

00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:40,350
page we have high activation they use

00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:43,649
our product and we can clearly see from

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,209
metrics that they don't come back but we

00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:46,619
don't know why that's where the

00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:52,709
qualitative research comes in to

00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:54,119
actually talking to people so after a

00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:56,249
while we sort of grew out to the coffee

00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:59,549
shop method and we started hitting more

00:13:56,249 --> 00:14:02,339
complex problems and that's where you

00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:04,829
set up sort of a proper user testing

00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:08,339
session and for us it was very important

00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:09,869
having include the entire team so that

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:12,379
you have different perspectives on how

00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:15,329
you solve problems so we SAT together

00:14:12,379 --> 00:14:17,669
diverse teams of designers a researcher

00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:19,889
engineer and marketing and they together

00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:21,899
worked with talking to users actually

00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:23,489
being there in the feedback creating

00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,199
these prototypes together and testing

00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:28,559
out the solution when we thought you had

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,110
something that worked that really helped

00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,110
us understand the complete picture of a

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:36,089
problem instead of just having the user

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,889
researcher go out get all the answers

00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:39,449
and then come back we sort of this is

00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:41,279
the way we have to solve it then you

00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:47,399
lose the perspective of example the

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:49,379
designer or the engineer and we make

00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,939
prototypes to show people sometimes they

00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:52,769
were on paper sometimes they were in

00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:55,350
code we did whatever made sense at the

00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:58,109
time what took the least effort for us

00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:01,439
to do so this is an example of the new

00:14:58,109 --> 00:15:03,509
room layout for mobile we tested out

00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:06,209
where we want to test out if people

00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:08,789
understood icons with the result text if

00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:10,110
they understood the interaction that we

00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:11,339
want to go and if they understood long

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,009
press and that kind of stuff so that was

00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,730
a combination of both paper prototypes

00:15:14,009 --> 00:15:21,990
and

00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:26,370
code implementation right so when you do

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:27,930
reduce your research it needs to sort of

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:31,949
be focused on a target you can't really

00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:34,380
go out there and interview everyone and

00:15:31,949 --> 00:15:35,699
I see a lot of other application and we

00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,079
did at ourselves in the beginning we

00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:39,540
wanted to make a service for everyone

00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,920
like that makes sense right we wanted to

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,839
make a service big we wanted to have

00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,560
lots of users so naturally everyone and

00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:49,529
their dog has to use us but it doesn't

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,389
really work because people have

00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:54,600
different expectations so let me show

00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:55,529
you a quick example of that so what do

00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,970
you think is the difference between

00:15:55,529 --> 00:16:01,470
these two users so the girl on the left

00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,820
she's 18 years old she goes to high

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:05,459
school in Norway and she's one of our

00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,930
teen ambassadors that is people that

00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,730
sort of talk about a product and then we

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,170
include them in in the product

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:13,230
development and teach them how to sort

00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,790
of do that kind of stuff she mostly

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:18,860
talks to her friends during class and

00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:21,750
after school about various things and

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,519
they have a different usage pattern that

00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,660
what you might expect they mute their

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,769
audio because they're in a privacy

00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,269
sensitive setting so they won't don't

00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:31,230
want a teacher or their parents to hear

00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:33,959
about what they talk with their friends

00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:36,569
they use chat a lot more and then on the

00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:39,360
right you have slang he's my boss use

00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:41,880
the sperian a lot naturally but he has

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,740
meetings so audio is very important to

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,779
him and useless meetings 121 while the

00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,899
teen years or SAS group of friends

00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:51,510
talking together so they don't expect

00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:53,430
the same thing from the service but who

00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,990
do you prioritize who do you get the

00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:58,949
most growth from who do you want to

00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,269
create the product for as our next

00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:01,529
lesson that we had we have to get a

00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,779
target market because in the beginning

00:17:01,529 --> 00:17:06,360
we didn't and then we ended up doing all

00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:08,579
these different things when we try to

00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:13,799
solve problems that have different

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:15,990
solutions for different people so we

00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,280
ended up choosing teens they have the

00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,540
new interaction we haven't seen before

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,339
so we were confident that we could

00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,770
create something that they wanted to use

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,079
that's none no other services we're

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,760
doing at the time and they have viral

00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,319
growth because they share them with the

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,630
friends who shared with the larger group

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,660
rafael

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,860
you share with a larger group of friends

00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:36,010
so we chose to implement stuff like

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:40,480
stickers bolder colors a better chat

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:42,220
instead of meeting invites booking

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,970
meetings email invites or calendar

00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:52,030
updates or stuff like call in cell phone

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:53,410
numbers or that kinda stuff but it's

00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,750
important to remember that even though

00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,730
you choose a target that does not mean

00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:01,600
that your product will only fit those

00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:06,790
people for example our business users

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:10,180
loved our new stickers because when we

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:12,250
design this we solve problems for teens

00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:15,010
but we made sure that we don't alienate

00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,630
other people as well because the

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,150
problems that resolving are often

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:21,370
fundamentally the same thing but a

00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,900
target lets us easily prioritize we can

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,760
easily say that no we're building this

00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,350
feature for teens and we're not building

00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:32,860
this because that was not priority right

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:35,080
now right then comes another problem

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,910
because once we started doing all of

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,370
this and we started getting it right

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:42,700
most of the time we started innovating

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:44,980
way too much what honestly because we

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,680
were overconfident because we had so

00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:48,970
much success we thought that we could

00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,500
change everything at once there were a

00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,620
lot of things that we hated with current

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,700
apps or things that we thought we

00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:59,470
couldn't do or things we want to change

00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:02,890
so for example we knew that we need some

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:05,320
kind of user model but our entire

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,970
tagline for the server is no login so

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,430
naturally we couldn't have anything with

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:13,600
login or how do you create a user model

00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:15,580
without logins we figure out I thought a

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,600
lot about it and figured out that yes

00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:22,270
access profile that's lot better login

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,190
than anything else we made sure that the

00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:27,970
forum was nowhere near recognizable as a

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:32,260
login form either and through user

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:34,060
testing this tested fine I mean we were

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,140
just not asking the right questions

00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:38,560
because we were showing this in

00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:41,680
isolation and most users are inclined to

00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,790
say yes when asked you get this of

00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,560
course they want to say yes if

00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:45,730
do you get this or can you make this

00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,740
work we're gonna click to do you

00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:50,500
understand what send code means they do

00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:52,120
but the expectation that I have what I

00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:58,900
want to create the user is not access

00:19:52,120 --> 00:20:04,240
profile or claim room so quick question

00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:06,820
here where do you sign up I'm looking

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,740
against you answer but the up in the top

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,030
right corner the claim room button

00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,950
that's basically where we wanted to

00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,570
click because all the other cool

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,100
features that we built we're hidden

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,080
behind that little claim room button

00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,940
there's got no way of telling you that

00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:22,330
was sort of the main action that we

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,430
wanted you to do and you sure didn't

00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,070
even see the like there was no sign up

00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:31,240
button the sort of gets people going

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:32,770
usually so a lot of people did not end

00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,020
up seeing the new stiff stuff that we

00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,670
built which means that all the retention

00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,200
mechanisms that we put in place where

00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:43,210
for ninety percent of users that were

00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:45,220
seen so I brings us to our next lesson

00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,320
keep innovations to a minimum I firmly

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,910
believe that you have innovation points

00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,410
that you get to spend for each product

00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,630
that you have and once you've done

00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:56,260
spending them then you have to do stuff

00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:59,980
by the book like because users need to

00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,690
feel familiar they need something to

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,990
compare this new experience that you're

00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:07,150
giving them this new either way of doing

00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:09,240
things to like and stuff it's something

00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,460
that they have experienced before

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,960
otherwise they're going to feel confused

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,360
or you're going to make them feel stupid

00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:18,040
because nobody wants to not get it

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,110
especially if your friends are saying oh

00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,760
man this new service is so cool and then

00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,400
they start using it and they don't get

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,230
anything and leaving your users feeling

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,640
stupid will ultimately make them leave

00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:32,980
which is not what you want so eventually

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,440
we listened and we made logging and sign

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,930
up the way it was supposed to be and we

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,490
made it a better call to action and we

00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,380
went from having two to three support

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,510
cases every day of people asking us

00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,100
where do you log in like they've managed

00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,840
to claim room but then they've sort of

00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,850
switch computers or come to a new device

00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,950
and I didn't figure out how to login

00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,570
actually because it never said login

00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:56,320
anywhere in our system we made sure of

00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:59,049
that yeah here's someone laughing

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,669
this is a serious thing with it and

00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:02,799
after we changed it we had we haven't

00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:06,929
had a single support case about it in

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,929
eight months and perhaps longer now even

00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:20,080
right it brings us to another lesson

00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:22,809
that is listen for feedback because on a

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,250
real glad sort of the mild side the

00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,929
empathy talk because a lot of the

00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,700
feedback stuff is about having empathy

00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:30,820
for users understanding and setting

00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,080
yourself in their place and understand

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:36,190
the problems that they have with what

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,600
you're trying to create so you did a lot

00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:39,700
of different things to listen feedback

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,740
the obvious choices are of course having

00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:46,419
a support email or anything like that

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:49,809
but we also had set up something we call

00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:51,700
the ambassador program which were teens

00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:54,700
that liked our product we used to go out

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,100
and have lectures in schools about

00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,419
coding or whatever and then teens that

00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,549
were interested in sort of learning more

00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:02,080
or talking to us we made them or abasa

00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:04,720
ders so then we could use them to sort

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,129
of ask hey this new thing that we're

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,049
making does this make sense to you at

00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:09,370
all or for the stickers like what

00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:12,070
sticker should be great to that kind of

00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:14,110
stuff that's also a good way to get and

00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:16,299
listen for feedback is actually finding

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:18,070
our to users are and then reaching out

00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:19,779
to them and asking hey do you actually

00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:25,179
like our product or how can we make

00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:26,799
stuff better for you but even if you do

00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:30,220
everything right we think you do

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,799
everything right the coded right may

00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,559
still break it all and this is a horror

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:37,389
story from from a time that we we had a

00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:39,340
successful feature it did what if all

00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:45,159
was supposed to do but something went

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:48,879
horribly horribly wrong so we introduced

00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:50,470
a concept we called following which is

00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:53,710
basically if you get notified when

00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:55,899
someone sends a chat message or joins

00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,970
the room or something that the intention

00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:59,919
here was that the user wanted to figure

00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,240
out or actually teens wanted to talk to

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,460
her friends and I wanted to know when

00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,570
their friends were on the service and

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,929
what they were talking about they had a

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:09,580
fear of missing out the same was true

00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:10,150
for teams they want to see if their team

00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:14,710
was

00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:16,500
in a stand-up or at a view and we tested

00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:21,370
this well in beforehand we felt that we

00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,540
really understood the problem I me of

00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:24,100
course wanted people come back some

00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,560
notifications a sort of a very obvious

00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,970
way of doing that in a future itself

00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:29,500
that was a success a lot of people

00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:31,450
actually started coming back and they

00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:35,860
used to future do IV we envisioned it

00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:37,750
and the metrics looked good but then we

00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,400
started seeing something weird the

00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,110
performance of my server was was

00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:44,590
horrible requests were taking more than

00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:46,630
five seconds and this at first wasn't

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:48,850
very surprising to us because first we

00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:50,560
had a sudden influx of many users the

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,630
teens that starting sparing it to their

00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,990
friends and we saw a doubling of user

00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:58,480
numbers and at the time we were running

00:24:54,990 --> 00:25:00,430
a single server in Ireland with one no

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,700
J's process we did that for two years

00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:07,260
and it worked fine but we figured like

00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,260
some put scaling is going to be an issue

00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,260
so we started working on improving that

00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,270
of course but at the same time we saw

00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,880
that there were two rooms with very

00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:18,220
easily guessable room names that were

00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,230
extremely active that every day of the

00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:22,810
eye of the hour every hour of the day

00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:24,850
and people were in there filling up the

00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,560
with eight people I didn't think much

00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,000
about it but one of the rooms were

00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,500
actually owned by one of the team so we

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,200
went in there to check out what was

00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:33,550
going on what we found was people just

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,150
chatting together getting to know each

00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:41,680
other nothing serious but one one person

00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:43,900
left another person joined this was sort

00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:48,700
of sort of fine we thought we didn't

00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:50,170
think much more of it but the

00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,850
performance of the server got worse and

00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:53,590
worse when we started shutting off more

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,940
and more features to try and actually

00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:58,150
get it up and running how the core

00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,950
service at least work and once we killed

00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,720
notifications everything suddenly

00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,250
improved so we sort of had like a hint

00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:08,050
that where the problem was we started

00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:10,540
investigating so it turns out that the

00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:13,750
feature that we built had some duty

00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:15,610
mostly technical debt and other yeah

00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:18,220
reasons that come from having a product

00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:20,090
running for two years some weird code

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:22,370
bats

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:25,340
and we had to sign this feature to be

00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,830
mostly for six to seven people and we

00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,559
haven't given much thought to

00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:32,690
performance like at all it didn't really

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,220
matter if we did one or two extra

00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,500
database queries we didn't look into

00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,890
that but it turns out that for every

00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:42,710
follower we were fetching the user data

00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:46,190
from the database using this is actually

00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:48,650
almost correctly copied from our from a

00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:50,210
load base we're a map over each follower

00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,340
and then we have something called the

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,690
user in richer which unless you were

00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,610
familiar with the code and the pearson

00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:57,980
implementing this worse not it actually

00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:00,679
made a database query and this was fine

00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:03,770
for ten maybe fifteen people but when we

00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:06,049
had 500 plus people following a room for

00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:08,120
every chat message you would do 500 and

00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:09,919
then for some weird reason we were

00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,600
throwing away the data which we got here

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,990
and then doing the same query three or

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:17,510
four more times which ended up resulting

00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,640
we had two thousand database reads and a

00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,140
thousand database rights / chat message

00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:26,659
sent in those rooms directed all the

00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:28,940
time which is crazy yeah so actually the

00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:31,130
database was backed up that calls long

00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:33,649
event cuse a node and triggered garbage

00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:37,070
collection everything went to yeah

00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:38,539
everything went amok really sonai should

00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,399
be fixed it by having smarter queries

00:27:38,539 --> 00:27:42,770
and we do both developers do we sort of

00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:45,799
fix our problems but it's a nice example

00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:47,390
of how the feature that you taught you

00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,860
you knew exactly how it's going to be

00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:50,630
used was used in a totally different way

00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,429
than you expected with you and the code

00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:54,320
that you write was actually negatively

00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:59,020
impacting the performance of the servers

00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,100
because of it and this happened because

00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,690
when teens couldn't talk to their

00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,130
friends when they weren't there they

00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,600
were seeking other people to talk to you

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,490
and when they found these rooms with a

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,169
lot of users naturally they wanted to

00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,250
follow those rooms that I could have

00:28:09,169 --> 00:28:12,260
people to talk to you and it wasn't

00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,580
generally like a good atmosphere in

00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,110
these rooms as well there wasn't

00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:20,630
anything like dangerous going on or

00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:23,779
awkward going on really anyway I was a

00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:25,640
bit of a regression but I hope to have

00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:28,100
showed you that sort of to my own

00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,320
experience that user experience is about

00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,780
a lot more than just green and red

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,830
buttons it's about how you go about

00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,080
understanding

00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:38,480
how you talk to users how you find

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,840
minimal solutions to implement something

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,850
as fast as you can to test it out but

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,640
how you implement them it's about the

00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:49,909
presentation and the messages you send

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,679
to users in the end and finally how you

00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:55,100
refined that solution based on the

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:57,110
feedback and really it is about how you

00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,610
write code how you approach problems and

00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,309
how we communicate with your team and

00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:04,970
your users so I really think that user

00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:07,990
experience is everything allows it for

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,990
