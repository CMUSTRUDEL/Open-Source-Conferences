I was very that was very nice thank you

00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:22,189
very much I've never been whistle

00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:27,980
introduced all right flight please does

00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:31,550
that look correct alrighty good hi

00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,620
everyone my name is Giani net I'm a

00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:35,239
JavaScript developer from Berlin and I'd

00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,850
like to thank the J's conf Iceland

00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:40,100
organizes that they invited me to close

00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:43,129
their very fine conference it is an

00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:47,179
honor the title of this talk is the

00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:48,530
state of the JavaScript community when

00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:50,269
you look at the topics that were

00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,429
presented just here at this event you

00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:54,800
will quickly see that there's not one

00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:56,929
JavaScript conference but many at sorry

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,899
community not one JavaScript community

00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:01,550
but many JavaScript communities we might

00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:03,800
write code in the same language but our

00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,200
interests are web internet of things

00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,090
virtual reality and plenty of subgroups

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,120
as well front and back and robots

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,520
bicycles and and add our community is

00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,770
really a set of communities and that's a

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,360
good thing the more communities we have

00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,670
in JavaScript the more interesting

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,410
people we have joining and the these new

00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,030
people are finding new problems to solve

00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:25,070
in JavaScript and then they will find

00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,780
even more solutions to these problems in

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,520
JavaScript and then other JavaScript

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,800
communities can take these solutions and

00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,530
apply them to their field for example

00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,770
jQuery a phenomenally successful project

00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,240
has a hazard its core a feature making

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,580
the dome of vile beast of browser

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,620
programming more accessible to a lot

00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,270
more people to the point where people

00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,740
were more jquery developers than

00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,140
JavaScript developers it was that

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,670
successful for still is when Rick

00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,620
Waldron wanted to get people to use

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,240
JavaScript to control robots he created

00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,490
the library or the library johnny-five

00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,590
and aside from a great name he stole the

00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,120
idea from jQuery that making the complex

00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:01,550
world of hardware more accessible to

00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,850
more people will lead to success and it

00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:07,460
worked this cross-pollination of ideas

00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,800
happens all the time and it's fantastic

00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:15,140
I'm very happy the JavaScript community

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:17,840
is so diverse in topics as far as

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,240
overused aphorisms go software is eating

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,500
the world is as good as any now in

00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,829
JavaScript that's already know in

00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:26,120
software javascript is every

00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:28,159
it's used for everything and most

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,900
developers that do something else also

00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,209
do at least a little bit of JavaScript

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,069
by any measure javascript is the biggest

00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:36,920
most successful programming language of

00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:38,239
our time or even all time so when

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,189
software's eating the world and

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,879
javascript is eating software so

00:02:40,189 --> 00:02:46,939
javascript is eating the world that's

00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:49,129
not good thesis here a better world we

00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:51,019
as a set of JavaScript communities have

00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:54,140
a significant impact on the world we

00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:55,819
shape its future this is why now more

00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,220
than ever it is important to look at our

00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:00,230
culture because our culture informs who

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,209
we are and where we are going and who

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:10,549
are we taking who we are taking along

00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:12,950
for the ride today the JavaScript

00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:15,170
community and the culture is me straight

00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,730
white male upper middle class Westerner

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,150
with all the privilege in the world and

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:23,269
that's great for me and everyone who

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,370
looks like me but most of the people on

00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,629
this planet do not look like me and if

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,639
we were building a future for everyone

00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:31,069
we need to have representatives of

00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,709
everyone participate in our making of

00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:35,889
that future they need to be part of our

00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:38,090
culture or design and business decisions

00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:40,879
building software is an act of

00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,919
representation just one chilling example

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,079
when Facebook change this default

00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:47,000
privacy setting for group memberships to

00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:49,129
public a queer person from an area that

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,260
is traditionally not as open-minded got

00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:53,269
the membership in a queer choir revealed

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,790
revealed to their parents putting that

00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:57,229
person at significant personal risk if

00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,239
Facebook's product managers and

00:03:57,229 --> 00:04:01,190
designers or developers will include

00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,659
more queer people this product design

00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:06,079
decision would have known would have not

00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:07,879
gone through most software's design and

00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,590
build without any understanding of a

00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,109
circumstance of the majority of the

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,940
people that end up using that software

00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:16,010
and the results are increasingly

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,690
terrible I just need to point at

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,190
Twitter's rampant abuse problem in the

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,409
cultural inability to deal with this

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,570
it's not that they can't solve this they

00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:27,530
don't want to at most of us are kind of

00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:29,539
okay with that in his book creativity

00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:31,430
ink at Catmull the founder of pixar

00:04:29,539 --> 00:04:35,029
reveals one of the cornerstones of

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:37,900
pixels continued success success heights

00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:41,780
failure and success makes

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:44,000
in short true long-term sustainability

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,310
comes from introspecting ones failures

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,920
and staying vigilant about one's works

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,740
downsides especially especially in the

00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,450
face of massive success there is no

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,730
argument to be lost that javascript is

00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,320
successful so let's introspect our

00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,720
culture and let's be vigilant about our

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,550
work discussing this whole topic

00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,650
comprehensively would probably take a

00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,210
couple of days so I'm just picking a few

00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:09,350
things so we can get this discussion

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:11,180
started one of the cornerstones of our

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,980
community is open source most of the

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,420
software we use dailies open source or

00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,160
build an open source and most of our

00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,380
tooling as developers is also open

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,540
source and as someone who has deep roots

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,880
in an open open source this is fantastic

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:27,440
this is the kind of world I want to live

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,210
in what do I in the past few months

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,680
three major JavaScript projects

00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,210
announced that the one person that was

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,950
left maintaining them is leaving and the

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:36,380
project would be abandoned more or less

00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,630
what happens is this somebody published

00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,220
something useful in github and NPM and a

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,920
ton of people start using and relying on

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,110
it eventually the support burden and

00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,240
user questions issue reports pull

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,830
requests and so on overwhelmed the

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,860
individual and they get overworked or

00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,510
worse burned out we had a show of hands

00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,730
about burnout in the opening talk by

00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,860
miles yesterday and a no fair number of

00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,930
you have experience with this my hand

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,460
certainly went up and I hope we can

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,800
avoid for the rest of you to ever have

00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,930
to deal with this by the way three

00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,330
projects were grunt power and uglify

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,430
that millions of people depended on it

00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,230
is obvious that our culture doesn't

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,890
include a way to make open source

00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,150
projects sustainable and it puts our

00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,500
infrastructure at risk and it more

00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,410
importantly it puts the people in our

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,000
community at risk there are many many

00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,860
things that we can do to improve this

00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,100
there are many many problems that we

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,380
need to be improving but I was recently

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,810
on a podcast called request for commits

00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,100
that's a new thing that came out because

00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:37,220
I had blocked about this topic last

00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,080
winter and I don't have time to go into

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,920
all the things to cover all the things

00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,750
but if you're interested in that

00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,300
specific part like please come up to me

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,920
later and we can talk about this if

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,210
there's one thing I want to pick one

00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,950
thing that we can be doing to improve

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,600
this and like if we can get the scouring

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,550
this will be really good

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:56,150
when reporting issues to package

00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:58,130
maintain errs be nice I understand that

00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,260
it is very very frustrating to spend

00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,090
hours or days to find out that the small

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,590
mistake in a dependent they're like very

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,450
deep down in their dependency tree

00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,770
causes you grief but letting that

00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,680
frustration out on the package

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:12,440
maintainer has terrible consequences one

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,420
your incentive of course is to get the

00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,460
issue fixed the number one thing you can

00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,410
do to make sure somebody is absolutely

00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,440
not inclined to work for you for free is

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,670
yelling at them and calling them names I

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,250
know most of you are clever enough to

00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:28,010
understand that and understand this and

00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:30,350
mature enough to not behave that way the

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,940
second terrible consequence is that

00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,250
you're very likely not the only one

00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,830
doing this not you specifically you know

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:39,140
what I mean and even if one abusive

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,760
issue might not cause any problems for a

00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,280
maintainer which is already unlikely

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,930
getting one every week or one every day

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,990
elevates the maintain is personal

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,730
frustration to a constant stream of

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:52,430
so-called microaggressions and these

00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:54,080
drain their emotional resources most

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,060
people leave open source because of

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,420
because of the abuse of their emotional

00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,250
labor women and under sorry women and

00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,810
other underrepresented groups ee or

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,640
triply sir because they don't only have

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,060
to deal with this but have the technical

00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,380
abilities questions non-stop as well

00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,780
like I said before there are a lot of

00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,000
things that we can be doing but everyone

00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,010
here should start not should start not

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,630
being an on github and also help

00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:20,030
out to create a culture of no tolerance

00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,440
for in JavaScript when we do

00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,690
that we will be significantly better

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,180
better position to make our community

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,400
more sustainable as miles pointed out in

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:31,370
a in his opening talk for us humans this

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,349
is the natural thing to do and as an

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,450
added benefit our culture will be

00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,340
perceived as more friendly and welcoming

00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,500
so we have bigger chance of attracting

00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,120
more new people and keeping them in the

00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:46,040
community to benefit from their

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,490
experience that Jenna just showed us how

00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,490
do you drink

00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:53,110
another angle of sustainability is the

00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:56,060
ability to pay people for their work

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,440
especially those who are not naturally

00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,810
privileged enough to work in open source

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,579
otherwise and of course some open source

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,890
projects are funded by corporations but

00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:05,829
the majority is not and at one point or

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,360
another this is going to be a problem

00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:09,890
many here will be familiar with the

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,959
heartbleed vulnerability that was

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:15,230
discovered in openssl a while back and

00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:17,540
that revealed two things first everyone

00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,190
and their dog was relying on open SSL

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:21,980
for mission-critical encryption work

00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,390
second the code was basically maintained

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,170
but by one person in their spare time

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,910
what could possibly go wrong this got

00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,800
addressed fairly quickly but most open

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,209
source project are not as prolific while

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,920
still being the foundation of a lot of

00:09:32,209 --> 00:09:36,500
other software open and closed and they

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,329
receive zero funding we have no culture

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,120
of making sure open source projects are

00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:42,800
financially sustainable and we even have

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,050
people argue that money ruins open

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,200
source but that that these people could

00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:50,480
be not more misguided I want to give

00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,949
special thanks to Nadia Iqbal who's been

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,899
doing fantastic research on this topic

00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:55,790
and it's now working at github to help

00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,230
address this issue more broadly there

00:09:55,790 --> 00:10:02,000
are links to her work at the end of my

00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:07,790
slides can have enough drink tension of

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,949
the pause the technology industry is not

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,410
very diverse an open source is even

00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:14,510
worse took me ages to come up with the

00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,949
rhyme for this only twenty to

00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,839
twenty-five percent of people in tech

00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,519
are women and one to five maybe ten

00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,149
percent of people in open source are

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,649
women trending downwards and we don't

00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:26,240
even if numbers for the Democratic

00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:28,850
demographics of other underrepresented

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,550
people in tech but the numbers will be a

00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,899
lot worse we have a lot of work to do

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,420
it's a quick interlude on the words of

00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:38,630
inclusion and diversity just to clear up

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,949
any misconceptions inclusion is everyone

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,600
and their dog are happy to be part of

00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:43,550
your community and they can safely

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,110
engage like any other member and have

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:47,540
fun doing so and get support when they

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,310
needed diversity is when people get a

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,720
lot with a lot of background different

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,579
backgrounds and experience are part of

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,199
your community and these experience

00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:55,459
inform your community's activities and

00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:57,770
make them better stronger more resilient

00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:59,510
and ultimately more successful as a

00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,980
result basically repeating with Jenna

00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,420
just

00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,420
on our slide thank you very much further

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:07,270
for the pre-work there and if you want

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,280
to learn more about this again at the

00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,260
end of the slides with a bunch of videos

00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:13,000
by someone called Lina Reinhard who's

00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,830
given a bunch of fantastic talks about

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,130
this that will really inform you about

00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:21,850
this now inclusivity must come before

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:23,710
diversity and diversity is a consequence

00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,510
of inclusivity if you're trying to

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,190
increase diversity without making things

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,230
inclusive you not only set yourself up

00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,150
for failure but new but for new

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,490
individuals will have they will have

00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:36,280
horrible consequences at experiences so

00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,290
don't do that so this is all a bit

00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:41,770
sobering so let's look at some of the

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:46,420
good things like this kitten I have this

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:50,080
in my browser or command 35 being a bad

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:52,480
day or a bad moment of a really others

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:58,510
helps this is good let's do this for a

00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:01,890
bit outside like miles to do like a

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,890
psychedelic version of this place

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,730
something I absolutely love about

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,920
javascript is the sense of collaboration

00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,110
to move our collective understandings of

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,150
solutions forward I love the pace at

00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,460
which this happens I like our community

00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,960
gets a lot of attention by big

00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,610
commercial players without any one of

00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,490
them dominating and I like how

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,260
successful the whole bundle is we even

00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,630
do get we do sorry we even get

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,370
competition right imagine ember didn't

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,630
have to compete with react they would

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:30,520
have never rewritten the rendering

00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,930
engine to be faster than react and then

00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,490
react would never have let that slide

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,110
and improve them they're designed to be

00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:38,770
amber again and then ember one-up them

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,570
again and so on and like the

00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,610
proliferation of useful ideas mentioned

00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,090
before this also happens all the time

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,350
and we're all better off because of this

00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:50,200
it clear downside of this and after

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,910
think I have to credit fellow speaker

00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,400
marie cocco soccer for this idea is that

00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:56,290
a lot of this happens in pacific time

00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,380
maybe in the overlap of us eastern

00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:02,050
pacific time asia and the EU play clear

00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:03,850
second fiddle in this and while the pace

00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,370
is thrilling sometimes these thing can't

00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,410
seem to wait for a planet rotation so

00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,420
everybody gets to say this limits our

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:13,090
view for solving issues the best way and

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,870
we can do a lot better we're doing

00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:15,970
really well in edgy

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,529
I think aside from all the great online

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,120
resources everywhere there are events

00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:21,279
like notes school and note together and

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,990
a lot of others that bring more people

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,420
into this community with the focus on

00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:27,580
learning and collaboration and with the

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,690
strong culture of trying to include and

00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,570
make safes make a safe space for

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,180
everyone I love the nature of

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,010
experimentation in our community for

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,720
example the continuum between fully

00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,850
serviced I'd rendered sites and fully

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,830
front and rendered apps and everything

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,510
in between and the continuously shifting

00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:46,540
trade-offs and the resulting technical

00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:50,020
solutions they all set up set us up for

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,730
a better for a better future one of

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:54,400
these experiments is very close to my

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,380
heart it's a small modules one I fully

00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,330
believe in the small modules philosophy

00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,250
and semantic versioning in NPM and all

00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,620
of that heck I even helped run

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,180
greenkeeper to make with the goal of

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:08,110
making all this best better for the

00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,970
whole NPM community so we don't have the

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,650
full picture yet but the sub stachy and

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:13,540
extreme of everyone combining their

00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:15,760
small modules from first principle has

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,589
its limits as has the not invented here

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,080
Laden no dependencies are right now on

00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:21,640
one orlith way of programming and we're

00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,529
continuously learning new things and

00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,600
invent new tools that radically change

00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,970
the way our habits in one way or another

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,770
and fascinating to follow a really like

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,209
what we're doing sometimes takes a

00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,709
little longer if I figure something out

00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:36,070
but eventually we'll get there I think

00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:39,640
it's really cool while there are many

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:43,300
communities in JavaScript the biggest

00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:45,520
one is clearly the web and that's my

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,650
origin story too I'm a child of the web

00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,260
I believe it is one of the wonders of

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,760
the world and worth preserving one of

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,410
the most fascinating things about the

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,920
web is that it was designed with a focus

00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:59,620
on the individual user one key component

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,050
the browser is an agent for the user it

00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,820
works on behalf of the user given that

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,890
the web is so commercially significant

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,520
this design is a revolutionary to this

00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:10,810
day when the web was invented

00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,610
everybody's data lived on their

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:14,800
computers and browsers made sure that

00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,390
websites couldn't steal that data now

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,220
everybody's data lives in the cloud and

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,870
browsers are ill-equipped to deal with

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,030
this new reality of so called corporate

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,160
surveillance this is something native

00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:25,600
mobile especially us has an edge on the

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,579
weapon there's a few more things where

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,670
the web slagging be

00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:31,019
however a lot of a lot of that is

00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:32,730
getting addressed and I'm very happy to

00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,439
see the progressive web app movement

00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,540
embracing the mobile web as a first

00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:38,220
class citizen I'm particularly excited

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,799
about this because about three years ago

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,869
in preparation for a workshop that we

00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,879
did in most fast London I can't coined

00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:46,679
the term of line first which is now an

00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,029
industry standard Tom and the thinking

00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,220
behind progressive web apps fully

00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:52,829
embraced the offline first ideas it's

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,079
really cool around that time three years

00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:56,549
ago we had built the first version of

00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:59,009
hoodie and offline first backend for

00:15:56,549 --> 00:16:00,209
your front-end web apps and while

00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:01,879
service workers and the like weren't

00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,079
around yet we were and still are

00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:06,499
building fully offline capable web

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,149
applications assets data everything and

00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:11,579
with hoodie we made things we made that

00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:12,959
accessible to a lot more people taking a

00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:15,629
book out of the jQuery in Johnny Five

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,970
playbook where we grew a little bit

00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:20,309
early though because now I believe all

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:23,639
that fun stuff with having data offline

00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:25,139
comes after you deserve Chris um but now

00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:28,199
that we had three times to like mature

00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:29,730
system at three years to mature system I

00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,889
think now is the time for every one of

00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,939
you to first learn service work and then

00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:37,199
get into hoodie so that's really cool um

00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:38,579
what I like most about progressive web

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:43,230
apps though is that they are designed

00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:45,509
around a culture of empathy I'm else by

00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,639
empathizing with users around the world

00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:49,470
that may not have a gigabit fiber on

00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,509
their phone for twenty-four seven we are

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,040
now building new web standards that will

00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:55,739
inform our development culture to build

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,269
on the web with more people in mind this

00:16:55,739 --> 00:16:59,189
is a very important shift in our culture

00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:06,079
and couldn't be more happy about it

00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:06,079
could be more happy to see it standards

00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:34,880
my notes say waitful laughter so i'm

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:36,800
waiting for spaces thanks again to

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,650
Marika for bringing this up the old

00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,860
saying goes standards are great there's

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,570
so many to choose from standardization

00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:47,090
is what makes JavaScript the language

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,830
strong no single vendor can dictate what

00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,750
the language is going to be and it's

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,370
very very powerful the same is true for

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:55,100
the surrounding technologies on the web

00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:57,560
but standards processes are also not

00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,030
very transparent first they are hidden

00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,130
behind a bunch of acronyms that help

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:08,240
nobody really understand what is going

00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:10,430
on w3c whatwg ECMA and it's just as

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,710
inaccessible as these acronyms are just

00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:14,420
as inaccessible as these acronyms are so

00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,390
the organization's behind them as well

00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:20,060
as the processes you can contribute to

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:23,120
the HTML standard on github today did

00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,980
you know that probably not do you feel

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,280
empowered to do so right now I don't

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:30,710
know about you but definitely not me so

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,960
you know how to get a seat on the tc39

00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:35,060
the acronym committee that's inside the

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,760
ECMA acronym that defines the java /

00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:41,330
standard i bet not and by the way i know

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,650
it's akma however can you guess how

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,380
diverse and inclusive these standards

00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,910
groups are probably not very some of

00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,280
them are realizing this and trying to

00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,800
change it some don't and specifically

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,330
note core the team that is responsible

00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,760
for building the runtime that runs all

00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:57,230
our JavaScript's is openly reluctant to

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,480
become more inclusive despite numerous

00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,830
people sending spending significant

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,990
amount of time trying to address the

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,490
issue because we have no culture of

00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,380
demanding the diversity in our

00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,480
leadership group and node core is a

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:14,240
leadership group node core gets away

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:16,250
with this we need to do better a lot of

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,440
technology happens in and around San

00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,990
Francisco the melting pot nurse and the

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,690
abundance of capital allows the most

00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,430
outlandish ideas

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,860
things to be tried out on the off chance

00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:28,390
that they are useful later because

00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,100
things are moving fast in technology

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,110
people are moving fast and technology

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,910
from a European perspective the US

00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:35,830
employment laws facilitate this and

00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:38,290
changing jobs every 6 to 12 months as

00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:41,700
normal a two-year tenure the startup is

00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:44,110
rare if not frowned upon as a result

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,850
things are really built with longevity

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,250
in mind when Twitter open source

00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,140
bootstrap and it got really popular I

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,330
feared that as soon as the developers of

00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:55,990
the sorry the Twitter employees leave

00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:57,970
the project would be toast luckily that

00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:59,740
has not happened because the bootstrap

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,570
developers left Twitter to go indie and

00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,880
focus on bootstrap but that's not the

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,440
common story so as a result the rest of

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,270
the world has to deal with the

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,860
half-baked and short-sighted swath of

00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,810
projects coming out of Silicon Valley

00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,540
because our culture dictates that no

00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:16,210
true software can develop anywhere else

00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:18,040
and don't get me started on a region

00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,960
that has witnessed a 40 year stretch of

00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,190
hyper growth and that has produced more

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,650
millionaires and billionaires that

00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:24,910
anyone cares to count and still has one

00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,860
of the most rampant cases of

00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,420
homelessness anywhere on this planet and

00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:30,160
can't be bothered to do anything about

00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,560
it other than creating a second layer of

00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,060
reality for just tech workers what is

00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,620
the point of innovation if you're not

00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:39,970
building a better society most software

00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,770
is designed and built without any

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,240
understanding of the circumstances of

00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,130
the majority of the people that end up

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,210
using that software and the results are

00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,210
increasingly terrible

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,800
miles brought up a lie ship in his

00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,670
opening talk and as a whole we're liking

00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,050
a culture of a laceup we are not very

00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,150
good at this and i know i've personally

00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:06,910
failed at this and probably continue to

00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:09,340
do so i know what instance of known her

00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:11,200
ass ax in our community not being called

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,880
out for their behavior despite enough

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,980
people knowing about it i've personally

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,840
got back got a hint of what was going on

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,480
a while back but i neglected to follow

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,340
up that was a mistake on my part because

00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,510
i kept hearing in confidence that the

00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,390
harasser has been making their rounds

00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:27,820
through the community this particular

00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,230
instance is now improving but all of

00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,180
this happens behind the scenes because

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,460
we have no culture that knows how to

00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,170
deal with this and there are so many

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,940
more cases that are not transparent to

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:40,120
this community or if they are they are

00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:42,520
tolerated the sad thing is it probably

00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,560
happened in this event as well it's just

00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:49,270
the odds it's not likely that this

00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:51,070
hasn't happened here so um I'm not here

00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:53,170
to tell you what to think is right or

00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,420
wrong I just want you to think for

00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:57,310
yourself about our culture and what it

00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,830
enables and if you are okay with that

00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:01,480
are you okay with the fact that most

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,100
salaries in our industry come from

00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,690
intrusive advertising that's beyond

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,040
creepy and as something sometimes

00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,020
life-threatening consequences for

00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,850
individuals or give governments and

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,860
cover the corporation's increasing

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,830
amount of power about our lives are you

00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,210
okay with that we're actively excluding

00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,590
the majority of humanity from

00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,230
decision-making in technology and

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,730
especially JavaScript I okay with the

00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:23,350
fact that our industry is built on

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,080
systemic oppression of anyone who's not

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:27,700
a white man are you okay with the fact

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,560
that rampant misogyny and abuse goes

00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,120
relatively unchecked in our industry and

00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,790
Jake Applebaum is just the proverbial

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,470
tip of the iceberg I okay with the fact

00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:37,240
that women get systematically paid less

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:39,160
than men for the same job are you okay

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,860
with the fact that women of color get

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,180
paid even less for the same job are you

00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,730
okay with the fact that people with an

00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,110
african-american sounding name or fifty

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,720
percent less likely to get a job

00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:51,610
interview I okay with the fact that most

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,350
startups founded and funded and thus

00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,360
controlled by a demographic that just

00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,550
does not have the purpose sorry just

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,380
does not have the perspective to wield

00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,730
that power responsibly and who build

00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,650
solutions for people like themselves

00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,350
rather than the 99 percent rest of the

00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:06,340
world I okay with the fact that we are

00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,020
building our industry

00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:10,659
on the foundation of volunteer and

00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,789
emotional labor and burnout most of

00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:14,320
these problems and are just problems in

00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:17,140
the JavaScript community further

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,179
problems of the tech industry or society

00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:23,169
at large so why should we care to fix

00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:24,520
them number one because it affects us we

00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,630
have leadership teams that are not

00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,700
equipped to make white reaching

00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,159
decisions and we and our project or

00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,720
words off offer it our first motivation

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,929
could be that we make our own lives

00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,909
better number to keeping our own hose

00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:40,630
clean before asking others to keep

00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:42,789
theirs it's kind of only logical three

00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:46,809
it makes us more sustainable and said

00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:49,360
sets us up for long-term success these

00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:52,539
are fine reasons but more importantly

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,789
our culture increasingly defines the

00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:56,850
world if we get it right it will spread

00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:59,590
like our culture's already spreading I

00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:01,330
believe it is imperative to leave the

00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:03,940
world behind better than we found it and

00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:06,309
as such it is our moral duty to make

00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:08,200
sure our culture's one the generations

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:10,480
to come can build upon and be proud of I

00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,250
don't want to be remembered to be the

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,470
generation that is missing out on

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:16,179
affecting much needed change as being

00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:19,809
complacent in the face of overwhelming

00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:22,630
evidence that despite our successes we
