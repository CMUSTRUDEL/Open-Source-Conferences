Title: David Blurton: Full-stack JavaScript development with Docker - JSConf Iceland 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-20
Playlist: JSConf Iceland 2016
Description: 
	Docker is great for wrapping up your application with its environment, but until recently it’s not been a great experience for development. The new release of docker for mac and windows changes all that.

I’ll show you how to take an existing application and get it running in a docker container, including live-reload. We’ll use docker-compose to link the rest of the application together, and set up a .dev domain for the full web experience.
