that'll be relevant in just a couple

00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:27,140
minutes I promise so hi everyone um I'm

00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:28,910
Liv Ericksson i am a virtual and

00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,140
augmented reality developer evangelist

00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,050
from a little company you may have heard

00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,239
of called microsoft if you want to be

00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,589
inundated with more tweets about virtual

00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:38,629
reality than you ever thought a single

00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:41,449
human could produce this is my Twitter

00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:43,820
account I love talking about VR just

00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:46,190
about as much as this picture shows you

00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,899
can probably guess I absolutely adore

00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,120
immersive technologies and I'm really

00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:53,360
really excited to be here with you today

00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,850
to share this so I'm going to jump right

00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,050
into it and start with the big question

00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:03,769
why care about virtual reality and why

00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:05,840
work on virtual reality I generally

00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:07,580
wouldn't give this device to people I

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:13,940
get asked a lot what made you get into

00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:15,590
VR AR and I was in the situation where I

00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,790
made my entire life decision on what I

00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,360
wanted to do with my career based off of

00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:22,310
a YouTube video again not something I

00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,530
generally recommend people do but I

00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,170
moved out to the San Francisco Bay Area

00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,180
three years ago and I wanted to find a

00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,490
technology that I just wanted to spend

00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:33,619
all my time doing and loved very

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,869
passionately and I saw a video where

00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:38,090
someone was talking about the oculus

00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:39,560
rift developer kit too and I was

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,759
immediately like yep that's it i'm going

00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,700
to just drop everything that I have

00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,460
learned up until this point and do VR so

00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,470
y vr it's changing the way that we think

00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:52,430
about computing and I'm gonna start with

00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:54,049
this one it's really really fun I was in

00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,640
the situation when I first got out of

00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:57,320
college that I didn't have this passion

00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,090
for what I was working on I had a great

00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,280
team I was kind of like okay this is

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,540
cool but I never really made this

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,060
connection that what I should be working

00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,649
on should just be really fun and I

00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,630
really loved it and I needed to find

00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:11,360
something in my life that I found really

00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:14,570
fun and virtual reality was one of those

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,549
things having this ability to be

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,790
transported to an entirely new world

00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:21,530
elevates storytelling and as humans we

00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,190
like telling stories we like to relate

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,950
to each other through stories

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,400
having access to an unlimited number of

00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,080
virtual places that basically I create

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,070
out of something that I think about and

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,050
like yeah you know what that sounds

00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,240
really cool I want to do that it's

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,820
opening up this whole new world where we

00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,210
can actually build anything that we

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,430
think of this is a picture from my very

00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,580
first virtual reality experience that I

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,590
ever did I spent my entire life loving

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,030
Star Wars any other Star Wars fans in

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,960
the audience I pretty sure I can't be

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:58,560
the only one yeah yeah okay um so my

00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,330
very first gr experience was living out

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,420
a dream that I had had since I was five

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,220
years old in getting to do a lightsaber

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,230
training demo that was the same thing

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,000
that Luke did when he got on to the

00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,220
Millennium Falcon in the first movie and

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,380
that was really kind of eye-opening for

00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,460
me was experiencing this technology and

00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,440
realizing that it had the potential to

00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,790
help me live out this kind of fantasy

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,500
world dream that I had never thought

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:27,030
would be something I could physically do

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,130
virtual reality is changing the way that

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,440
we relate to each other that talk on

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,050
empathy was absolutely amazing and it

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,670
really hits home a lot of these points

00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:39,030
that we are constantly seeking out new

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:41,550
ways to relate to each other so this is

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,170
a picture from when I went and visited

00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:45,810
my parents these are my parents they're

00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,400
being featured prominently here I took

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,140
that with this camera that you just saw

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,810
me kind of hide behind the podium and

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,220
take earlier because there's my sister's

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,570
missing from this picture I went back

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,540
home to visit them but she wasn't able

00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:59,310
to take off work and with kind of this

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,500
immersive technology that's developing

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:03,269
in this ecosystem I was able to take

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,920
this picture that I can stick into a

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:06,709
headset and it's like I can go back to

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,910
that place in time and I can remember

00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:11,130
exactly where I was what that felt like

00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,590
and I can have other people experience

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,989
that very specific part of my life

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,970
that's very important to me for all of

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,799
you I just took a picture standing on

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,890
stage behind the podium because I'm

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,450
nervous and I I know that when I talk to

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,040
people after I give talks you know some

00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:28,080
of them are oh I would love to speak but

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,340
I don't know what it's like and we now

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,289
have the technology where you can see

00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,110
exactly what it's like to be standing in

00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:36,419
my footsteps right here on stage at this

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,780
very moment and in the future I get to

00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,610
come back

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:43,620
and revisit that to which I find

00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:47,040
fascinating and it's changing how we

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,500
relate to technology I love this picture

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,730
I love this picture for a lot of

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,560
different reasons but what I love about

00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,980
it is that it really captures this idea

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,740
of thinking about robots in this case

00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,840
but technology in general in new ways

00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,270
that are more human they're more

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,270
personal we're able to start thinking

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:09,060
about devices and how they play into our

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:12,120
lives on a very new level that we

00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,770
haven't quite had before you know almost

00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,930
everyone in this room if not everyone

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,180
has a device that they're carrying

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,500
around that connects them to the people

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,690
they love the information that's

00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,070
important to them and virtual reality

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,160
starts to elevate that when you can

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,560
stand inside rooms and interact with

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,900
data in ways that are more realistic

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,479
more like the world that we're used to

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,180
experiencing compared to more

00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:39,300
traditional computing platforms vr has

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,610
benefits around fundamentally changing

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,000
that way that we interact with

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:47,220
technology so you'll see in a few

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,070
minutes an example of a demo that I've

00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:53,910
built that takes Excel data and graphs

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,080
it in 3d for me I love technology but I

00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,550
haven't really hard time looking and

00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,510
remembering charts and being like okay I

00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,610
know that was telling me something

00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:03,470
important but what was that and when you

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,070
start to think about data in ways that

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,770
relate it back to what you're

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,300
experiencing something like the price of

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,810
something in stacks of dollar bills

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,900
becomes a lot more memorable than if you

00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,950
simply saw a number and started to try

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,810
to remember what that meant because

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,910
we're spatial creatures we interact with

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,780
things in 3d all the time that's how our

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:27,300
world works as we know it so before we

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,870
even dive into the VR web I want to

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,700
start with this going over what the VR

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:36,720
ecosystem today looks like so first we

00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:39,919
have probably the most common mobile VR

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,720
device type available and this is

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,750
powered by a smartphone it's a device

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,060
that is essentially allowing your server

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,110
or your your phone to serve as the

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,300
processor and display for a VR

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,570
a device have any of you do any of you

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,430
have a mobile VR device a few of you

00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:59,230
good okay that's good that every time I

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,520
ask that question at a talk that number

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,960
goes up which makes me personally really

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,430
excited because I feel like I'm I'm

00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,370
doing the right kind of talk for kind of

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,500
how the industry is growing and evolving

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:15,180
so mobile VR like i mentioned allows

00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,960
your phone to serve as the primary

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,610
processor behind all of these

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,020
applications and the applications are

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,790
running are just generally simple

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:23,410
smartphone applications you have a

00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,260
number of internal sensors that are

00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,550
measuring rotation and head orientation

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,320
so it's tracking kind of where you're

00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,880
moving feels very natural and updates

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,250
the screen accordingly but it tends to

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,110
be a less powerful or immersive

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,670
experience than what you're capable of

00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:39,310
running in something like a desktop via

00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:41,770
our device with desktop ER devices

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,870
you're generally running standard PC

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,030
applications your head mounted display

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,800
is entirely separate you're not powering

00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,480
this from the device itself you're

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,070
powering it from an external computer

00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,260
which generally means that you're

00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:55,150
tethered in you still have a number of

00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,040
those sensors that are measuring the

00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,330
head tracking the orientation of your

00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,690
head and where you're looking but you

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,670
also have a number of other potential

00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:05,230
devices like seeing here you could have

00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,900
hand tracked controllers you could have

00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:08,860
full room scale tracking systems that

00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,570
are watching where you're moving around

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,580
so if I move over here it'll know that

00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,230
and you end up with a more powerful

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:18,940
experience but again at the expense that

00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:21,460
you're tethered to a desktop lastly and

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,380
this is very very kind of like broadly

00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,360
separating VR devices into these three

00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,460
categories and this is changing almost

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,020
monthly now but if I went through and

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,800
listed everyone we'd go way past 30

00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,110
minutes and there's a lot more

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,790
interesting stuff to talk about the last

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,590
one is standalone devices and these are

00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:38,200
devices that are all in one everything

00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,880
is contained in this case the headset in

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,770
the headset and the controller but also

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,680
sometimes just at a headset itself and

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:46,930
they can be mobile or desktop operating

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,790
system based they may be hybrid devices

00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,320
in the example of this headset you can

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,970
actually take the controller away which

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,740
is where all of the processing is done

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,020
and plug it into a desktop so you have a

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,880
different model but what you're starting

00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,380
to see here in the industry is that new

00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:01,030
devices are coming out and playing and

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,800
pushing the boundaries of what's

00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,850
possible with immersive technologies

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,819
today

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:09,009
and if you haven't had a chance to try

00:09:06,819 --> 00:09:10,480
any of those find me tomorrow because

00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:11,980
i'll have my gear vr with me and i'm

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,509
more than happy to do demos I love

00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,829
showing people V our stuff for the first

00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:20,410
time so why think about the browser as a

00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:23,800
platform for virtual reality experiences

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:25,810
in the future right now we're still at a

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,420
relatively early stage for this wave of

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,069
VR it's come around a couple of times in

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,779
the past it never really landed but

00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,459
we're starting to see this resurgence of

00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:35,860
the technology because we finally are in

00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:37,540
a position where we have developer

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,220
conferences like this to get developers

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,230
excited about building applications for

00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,360
immersive technology we're a lot more

00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,709
comfortable with technology and putting

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,930
stuff on our faces and running around

00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,490
with goggles on and we haven't really

00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,829
reached the point yet where there are

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,839
you know best practices that are defined

00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:54,730
or set standards which makes it a really

00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,639
fun and interesting time to just get in

00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:00,069
and start experimenting so when you're

00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:01,779
considering all of this the browser as a

00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:05,230
platform for virtual reality becomes

00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:07,630
really interesting a lot of the things

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,279
that make the browser a really good

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,009
option for a lot of applications today

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,649
are also paralleled when building for VR

00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:16,300
you have the ability to build an app and

00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:19,300
not have to think about what it's

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,860
running on that's a very very

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:22,360
generalized statement because of course

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,620
at this stage you have to think about

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,660
kind of what you're running on from a

00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,750
design perspective and feature

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,550
implementation but the benefit of the

00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:33,639
virtual reality web is that you can have

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,050
an application and start building out

00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,880
that experience that will work

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:39,100
regardless of the device that you're

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,670
using it on or if you're even using a VR

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,990
device at all this is really good when

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,399
you're kind of starting out with vr

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,870
development because it allows you to

00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:49,509
focus on the content rather than

00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,370
learning kind of the ins and outs of one

00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:53,380
particular platform because as I just

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,329
mentioned there's a huge number of those

00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:59,319
and it's changing almost monthly at this

00:10:55,329 --> 00:11:02,380
point you have open access to content

00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:03,880
which is really critical for virtual

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,829
reality experiences because we haven't

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,350
really figured out how to define them

00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:11,230
yet in a situation where you have maybe

00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:13,689
a three minute experience in VR that

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:17,260
captures very specific content like one

00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:17,920
maybe a festival experience is that a

00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,350
nap

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,350
is that a smaller piece of consumable

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,089
content is that a news story and when

00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,410
you are building these out to run

00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:28,269
natively and you're going through an app

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,130
store you're at someone else's ability

00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:32,769
to decide whether or not it's a game or

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,449
if it's an article and whether or not

00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:36,639
it's a big enough scope to put on the

00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:39,220
App Store so when you think about the

00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,560
web as a content platform for virtual

00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,810
reality you have a lot more flexibility

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:47,800
over that control and what experiences

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:51,040
you're able to distribute you're letting

00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,690
the browser do a lot of the work will

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,430
get into the specifics about the web via

00:11:52,690 --> 00:12:00,070
our API in just a second but at its core

00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:03,220
looking at the browser as a VR platform

00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,290
allows you to let the browser take care

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,880
of a lot of things that individual SDKs

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,649
would otherwise that you would have to

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,290
be implementing separately in your

00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:12,550
application so one of these benefits is

00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,380
that you are able to look at

00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,880
cross-platform development and say I

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,980
don't even want to think about whether

00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,230
or not I'm running on a desktop with an

00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:23,500
oculus rift or a mobile phone with the

00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,089
browser in a cardboard headset I just

00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,459
want it to work and I want it to look

00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:31,360
good if you're not running VR headsets

00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:33,730
at all and you lastly which I like in

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,140
terms of developing for VR you get to

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,510
bring your favorite web technologies

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:40,060
with you it's JavaScript rendering all

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,339
of this in a WebGL context you can build

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,839
on top of your favorite sites your

00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:45,670
favorite technologies you can add this

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,820
to things that already exist because of

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:51,040
that framework and those that potential

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,589
for adding that layer of 3d graphics

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,970
lets you really build some really cool

00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:56,740
stuff with all of the things that

00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:00,550
already exist in the JavaScript

00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:02,470
ecosystem so when you start to look at

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,990
building the VR web the elements of

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,300
today's ecosystem you know it's not just

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:10,269
one specific platform one specific

00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:13,209
framework though it does generally share

00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:15,730
that core around the web view our API

00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,709
however there's a lot of flexibility in

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:21,279
how you can start building virtual

00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:23,470
reality web applications today so at the

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,360
very top level where you look at 3d

00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,310
JavaScript libraries because these are

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,660
what's going to make up the majority of

00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,250
what someone will see in your

00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,660
application so one of the first

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,580
considerations is

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:35,830
how am I going to build this environment

00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,390
what do I want people to be inside of

00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:39,880
and experiencing when I'm building an

00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,100
application JavaScript libraries like

00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,380
3gs in Babylon provide these ecosystems

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,200
to build out 3d applications so that you

00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:49,600
don't have to write a rate caster or

00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,280
shaders yourself or even go through and

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,720
worry about writing and defining objects

00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,980
and primitives these libraries kind of

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,660
take that off so you can think about

00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,160
okay what is it exactly that I'm

00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:59,950
building and how do I have those tools

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,830
to do that and both of these libraries

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:05,800
have support for web PR today so when we

00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,540
look into the web view our API it's an

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,000
experimental API for browsers that

00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:12,280
allows the browser to handle all of

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,930
those interactions with VR hardware so

00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,030
it identifies corrected connected

00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,070
peripherals that you may have so in the

00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,230
case of say a vibe room scale system it

00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,780
identifies you know that you are in a

00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,250
room that's tracking VR and you as a

00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,930
developer just kind of have access to

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,970
that you don't have to worry about you

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,380
know doing different checks of what type

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,090
of device and my running is it actually

00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,040
connected at all is this a mobile phone

00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,020
that's running in a headset the browser

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,850
does all of that and it then passes in

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,770
that display data so that a camera and

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:40,630
your scene can just update seamlessly

00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:41,710
with whatever is happening on the device

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,290
and you don't have to worry about

00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,690
interacting with the hardware right now

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,430
the webview our API is supported in

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:51,960
Firefox nightly in chromium with paths

00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:55,600
to both of those browsers longer-term

00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:57,760
under the hood in web be our API it

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,830
breaks down virtual reality devices into

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,120
different components so that you can

00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:03,670
access the different parts of the

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,710
hardware some of the interfaces are

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,150
related specifically to rendering a vr

00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,860
seen appropriately for different

00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:10,720
headsets while others will handle things

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,910
like the orientation the expense ability

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,840
to provide additional services like with

00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:19,030
gamepad or audio and for a desktop a VR

00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,410
device you may see things that are

00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,000
completely separate from the headset

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:24,250
itself like additional tracking cameras

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,740
or controllers for a mobile phone it may

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,860
just be kind of making up that this

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,260
exists and getting those capabilities to

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,880
provide the implementation itself so

00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:35,770
under the hood you're looking at the

00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,600
base of all vr devices which is a vr

00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,430
display whether or not that's you know

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,650
all contained in one package or if it's

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,450
in a number of different devices the API

00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,550
will recognize these devices and pass

00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,170
those on and say hey

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,230
you have this plugged in you can use

00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,430
this at the state of any at any given

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:52,380
time the state of the headset will be

00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,580
saved in the VR pose so it will know the

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,320
difference if I'm looking here as

00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,850
opposed forces if I'm looking there as a

00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,160
different pose and all of that

00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:02,670
transitional data in between gets handed

00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:05,480
off to the application to use in in the

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:08,399
situation where you are say running a

00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:09,899
full-scale VR experience you'll also

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,540
have the stage parameters which will

00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:14,730
tell the browser application you have X

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,250
amount of space to move before you will

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:19,170
hit the boundaries of this and as I

00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,420
mentioned extensions for a lot of other

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,640
interfaces are also provided and if

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,810
you're interested you can go right there

00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:30,300
and then so when you look at the kind of

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,480
over arching libraries and developing

00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:37,200
for web PR it reuses a lot of libraries

00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:41,040
as i mentioned that regular 2d 2d

00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,380
display 3d applications will use with

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,209
3gs babylon and there's a few libraries

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,790
that sit on top of that and essentially

00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:48,870
will just pipe in a camera update and

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,110
provide all of the additional

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:54,839
functionality of having that headset on

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:57,149
the web via our framework contains three

00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,310
major components for working with

00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,959
browsers that have desktop headsets

00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,250
plugged in and then a polyfill that

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,740
fills in all the rest when you're on a

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,929
mobile device so the VR controls apply

00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:10,350
the headset transforms to a scene camera

00:17:06,929 --> 00:17:11,970
the VR effect is going to calculate and

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,069
tell your application how it should

00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:16,559
render your application depending on the

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:17,730
screen size the pixel density resolution

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,439
which changes from device to device

00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,780
especially when you look at mobile VR

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,270
and then the web viewer manager handles

00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:26,040
moving in and out of web PR and non web

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,880
PR mode which I'll show in just a second

00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,990
but of course there's always more

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,820
there's actually a pretty rich ecosystem

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,160
being built on top of the web view our

00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,080
libraries that make it even easier to

00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,550
develop if you're just starting out for

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:40,140
virtual reality applications and these

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,000
are generally wrappers around the

00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,809
JavaScript implementation of the web PR

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,280
API that you can use if you maybe prefer

00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:51,750
markup style languages like a frame and

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,960
visual programming systems like visor

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,370
create these are options that are

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,320
available to let you kind of program

00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,630
right in your browser

00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,789
an experiment with different different

00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,740
scenes different kind of technologies to

00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:07,880
figure out what works best for your

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,830
specific experience and they they just

00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,159
provide a couple of options because who

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:16,009
doesn't like options for development if

00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:17,899
you are familiar with game programming

00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:19,429
and game development there's also the

00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:21,500
ability now with the Unity game engine

00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:25,399
to build an application and export it

00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:28,580
directly to a WebGL web VR seen this

00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:29,750
lets you use JavaScript c-sharp boo to

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,360
write scripts in the Unity game engine

00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,549
and you add in a plug-in that says I'm

00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:37,009
going to export this to the web and I

00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:38,720
want it to support VR and then all of

00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:40,220
the desktop browsers that support what

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,690
VR will also let you do that in the

00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,360
application and I'll have a video of

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,279
this in just a second because that's

00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,830
enough talking you probably want to

00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:50,659
start seeing this in action as a heads

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,480
up these are some videos that i have

00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:55,070
taken from inside a VR headset so if

00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,320
you're very very prone to motion

00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,179
sickness it may get a little wobbly at

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,399
times on the screen just as a heads up

00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:05,120
for that so the first thing that I'm

00:19:01,399 --> 00:19:06,470
going to show you is a video of the

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,879
application that i was talking about

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:14,480
earlier and this is a way of taking a

00:19:10,879 --> 00:19:16,070
traditional data set that you have and

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,019
looking at it in an entirely different

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:20,629
way so i'm going to go ahead and this

00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:22,279
was shot on of mobile phone you can see

00:19:20,629 --> 00:19:24,500
when i'm starting out it's just a

00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:27,110
regular website you don't have to be in

00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:31,070
VR mode for it and I'm going to go ahead

00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:32,870
and see if I can play that there so this

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,269
is just using a bootstrap template to

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,470
kind of render everything because you

00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:37,669
want to just be able to kind of have

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:40,759
those experiences that users are

00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:42,860
familiar with and then it loads in a web

00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:45,379
vr scene that's rendering this graph

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,840
that I took from the Excel data and

00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:49,519
putting it into 3d when I switched it

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,289
into VR mode it starts rendering

00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,330
stereoscopically side by side so that if

00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:55,100
I was wearing this on my head it would

00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:57,379
now be rendering appropriately for my

00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,360
eyes and I can look around and I can see

00:19:57,379 --> 00:20:00,950
this and it's a little bit hard to tell

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,289
on a video screen kind of cuz this

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,940
screen itself is very large but for me

00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:07,220
being able to kind of stand inside of

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,889
this graph and see things like oh yeah

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,180
the cost of living in San Francisco is

00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:12,920
very very

00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,900
large and instead of having this kind of

00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,370
arbitrary scale these are in units of me

00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:21,250
like I'm standing there and I can look

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:23,870
up and see 700 Livi's standing there for

00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:28,580
comparative kind of analysis of the cost

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:31,970
of living so this next sample that I

00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:33,980
built here is using a frame which is as

00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,110
I kind of rushed through a little bit

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:39,500
earlier there a markup styled language

00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:41,270
from ma's VRS team where you can

00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,730
essentially use markup to wrap around

00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:47,030
three jas objects and create virtual

00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:49,010
reality scenes this is a live link so if

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:51,140
we want to test out the conference Wi-Fi

00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:52,190
here and you want to see for yourself

00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,090
what this looks like on a mobile device

00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:58,910
you can go there I as you can see love

00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,860
my little 360 camera and I'm going to

00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:03,110
actually go ahead and switch over to the

00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,190
scene live so you can get a scene get a

00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,080
sense of what it looks like on the

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,610
desktop browser but up here in the

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,200
corner you can see that's what it looks

00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,670
like on a mobile phone very similar to

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,830
the application that I just showed you

00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:15,710
because again it's using all of the same

00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:17,300
underlying frameworks there but I've

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,830
built this scene out based on some

00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:23,420
pictures that I've taken from this trip

00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:26,410
already I've showed this before or rough

00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:30,050
a rough kind of similar version of this

00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:33,260
application but the cool thing about a

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:35,420
frame is that this takes 17 lines of

00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,090
code this is the entire website that you

00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,710
just saw excluding that one script

00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:42,410
source so I'm cheating a little bit

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:43,970
there but if we go ahead over and switch

00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,410
into the browser here I don't have a

00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,880
desktop view our device plugged in

00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:50,810
because I don't have a desktop with me

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,530
um and that's not showing so let me let

00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:55,640
me switch that over real quick I

00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,070
apologize if I break the projection

00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,840
system for like all the other stuff so

00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:02,480
you can see here that I've actually got

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,100
this scene that's showing a 360 video or

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,860
a picture that I took at the blue lagoon

00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:09,740
on Tuesday so I can look around with

00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,540
this since I'm not using a VR device I

00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,900
can use my mouse to just kind of click

00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:18,230
and drag and this renders the way it

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,610
would in any browser and it's not in VR

00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,530
mode because the browser is detecting I

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:23,210
don't have anything plugged in if I did

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,830
I have this little button down here and

00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,210
it's not

00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,269
let me click on it because I don't have

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:31,630
a headset plugged in but if we switch

00:22:28,269 --> 00:22:33,220
back over to the slides and i'll see if

00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:42,269
i can get this you get a sneak preview

00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:48,659
of the next slide here oh no let's see

00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:48,659
well you know what I'll just keep well

00:22:49,649 --> 00:22:57,100
so it happens when you try to show the

00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:58,240
live demos but we'll just duplicate it

00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,840
and you can go through the rest of my

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,840
slides with me

00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:15,070
perfect all right and so you can see

00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:17,080
that that's handling all of the code

00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,549
that I didn't have like all of the the

00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,649
webview are switching and everything

00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:24,580
like that really powerful framework

00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:26,080
there this video here is what i was

00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,330
mentioning earlier with the export from

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,549
the unity engine into a web view our

00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,809
site so i'm going to go ahead and just

00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:36,850
click on this real quick to show you

00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:38,830
that this is sitting in a WebGL canvas

00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,630
and i recorded this from my desktop

00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:42,610
using my oculus rift so I put this on

00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,110
I'm looking around in my head set its

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,659
tracking all of that and passing that

00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:48,220
into the WebGL contacts and I don't

00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:50,559
really have to do anything specific to

00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,630
say I wanted this to work on the browser

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,889
it's the similar export function that I

00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:55,720
could have used if I was building it to

00:23:53,889 --> 00:23:56,889
a desktop application but I was able to

00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,710
just say I'm gonna stick this in a

00:23:56,889 --> 00:24:05,080
website and go with it so I'm going to

00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:08,260
switch back to this real quick because I

00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:12,190
think that this kind of starts to show a

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:13,659
lot of where browser-based VR will make

00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,120
the most sense kind of in the short term

00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:18,279
and that's in that right now not

00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,389
everybody does have a VR device you need

00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:22,539
to start thinking about these

00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:24,220
experiences in a very hybrid sort of way

00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:25,899
which is hard to do if you're building

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,809
native applications for VR either

00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:30,460
they're in the VR app or they're not but

00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:32,590
when you start to think about the web as

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,419
a platform for VR you have a lot more

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,220
flexibility with how you're able to

00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:37,659
build out these experiences to work in

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,120
that kind of hybrid model you know

00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:41,799
sometimes we do have our phones and we

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,179
want to do you know we want to have that

00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:44,769
flexibility of looking around with the

00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:46,029
phone and put it put that in the headset

00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:47,620
real quick you can imagine if you were

00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:49,539
shopping for something online maybe new

00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,580
furniture you wanted to say you know oh

00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:53,080
that looks really cool but how big is it

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,200
really and you can put that headset on

00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,539
super fast see the size of the furniture

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,470
the color of different apple and you

00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,360
want to see what that color of the

00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,760
dresses and you have that ability to

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,080
kind of look in this experience and be

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,289
navigating through and working with

00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,419
stuff in a very seamless way so looking

00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:13,809
ahead and thinking about kind of what

00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:16,149
the future of VR in the browser looks

00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:18,309
like these are all things that are

00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:20,799
evolving really really rapidly over the

00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:22,010
coming years as VR is becoming more and

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,400
more widely adopted

00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:27,830
over 5 million cardboard units were

00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:30,500
shipped in as of January this year and

00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:32,720
that was what nine months ago almost and

00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,220
the market is like regularly making

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,940
improvements new devices are being

00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,200
announced support for browser-based VR

00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:43,010
for these devices are being announced

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,670
just yesterday actually the open-source

00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:48,020
VR headset and the developer kits have

00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:51,740
released their support for the

00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:54,110
browser-based VR and because of the way

00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,420
the kind of virtual and augmented

00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:57,890
reality are blending together even at

00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,180
this early stage there are custom

00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,490
browsers with in virtual reality

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,100
applications that are starting to add

00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,170
support for holographic content so you

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,510
can almost have like a augmented or

00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:11,690
mixed reality scene inside of a virtual

00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:13,580
reality application based on web PR so

00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,260
you can write a web view our site view

00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,480
it in VR and then have that come to life

00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:19,300
within another virtual environment you

00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,790
start to get at a very inception level

00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:25,130
kind of thing we're really at the

00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:26,210
beginning like the potential with all of

00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,070
the different smart and connected

00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,590
devices we have around the internet of

00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,630
things around biometric devices Big Data

00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:34,130
machine learning starting to bring all

00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,450
of the tools that the web has kind of

00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:38,510
been evolving over the past several

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:40,910
decades into immersive content brings

00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:43,400
with it a lot of capabilities and a lot

00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:46,130
of potential for very very interesting

00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,140
applications in the future of course

00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:50,150
there are always challenges with things

00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,600
like this bringing browser performance

00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:55,160
with 3d content on par with native

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,750
applications and around framerate

00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,400
latency it's a little bit of a challenge

00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,470
but I've seen some really compelling

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,440
examples of people hitting 90 frames per

00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,340
second and some of these experimental

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,990
browsers and custom builds of

00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,370
development browsers so we're getting

00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:10,340
there and it's definitely something

00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:11,480
that's going to be feasible when you

00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,980
start looking at different types of

00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:14,300
applications and of course the content

00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,340
that you're building is going to depend

00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:19,070
a lot on the requirements for your

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,830
performance in the first example if

00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,060
you're building an Excel chart you're

00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,590
viewing an Excel chart without a lot of

00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,000
heavy animations that's going to be a

00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,580
lot different performance wise in the

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,710
browser than something like their full

00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:33,230
3d 360 degree game that you're watching

00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:35,290
or and playing with cross-platform

00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,540
design experimentation as I met

00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:40,300
right now a lot of the considerations

00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,940
around building a web view our site come

00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:44,050
less around technical decisions that you

00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:46,090
may have to make but more around the

00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:49,390
design considerations if you're wearing

00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:51,610
a headset with a phone in it you're

00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:53,380
going to have a different number of you

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:54,610
know interactions that are available to

00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,740
you then if you're using something like

00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:58,690
the vibe where you have a full room and

00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,520
you have hand controllers and then

00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:04,300
lastly getting really rich visual

00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:06,520
editing tools in 3d at for building 3d

00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,620
experiences in the browser is something

00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,850
that is also again kind of being worked

00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,760
on right now but it's at early stages

00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:14,560
it's really challenging sometimes to

00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,390
right things and knowing kind of what

00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,220
the 3d coordinate system in the headsets

00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,650
going to look like if I'm writing that

00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:22,480
all in texts so if I know you know the

00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,190
z-axis could be in front or behind me

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,140
where do I put things if I can't see

00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:27,610
them relative to one another having

00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,290
those visual editing tools makes a lot

00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:30,730
of sense but we're starting to see more

00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:32,680
and more opportunities where you don't

00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,240
just have visual editing tools on the

00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,550
monitor in front of you but you also get

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,470
them inside of a virtual application

00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,150
yourself so you can sit there and code

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:43,060
and see these objects appearing next to

00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:45,610
you as you're writing them so with that

00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:49,270
I want everyone to go build something

00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:51,550
awesome and there's so much that is out

00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,170
there right now around the ecosystem if

00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:54,400
you want to learn more I have a github

00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:56,230
repository where I've been collecting

00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,030
basically all of the resources I can

00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:00,550
find about learning virtual reality

00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,200
development in general design the

00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:04,150
different options that you have I love

00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,740
like I said tweeting and talking about

00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:08,410
VR so if you have questions you can

00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:10,000
tweet at me or you can you'll find me

00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,230
I'll be around to the next two days love

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,900
to talk to you more about all of this

00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:15,760
and with that I hope you're kind of

00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:19,000
getting excited about immersive content

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,470
because right now you know the way that

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,420
we interact with a single screen or

00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,680
multiple screens is fundamentally going

00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:25,540
to be different how we interact when our

00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,060
entire world and our entire environment

00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,830
can be manipulated and changed and we

00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,380
could have you know screens all over the

00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:33,730
place or you know virtual things that

00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,650
are sitting on stage to talk to you

00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,870
about things and demoing things with you

00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:40,450
so with that I want to thank you so much

00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:44,370
for having me out here and I hope that

00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,370
