Title: Berglind Ósk Bergsdóttir: Feeling like a fake - the Impostor Syndrome - JSConf Iceland 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-20
Playlist: JSConf Iceland 2016
Description: 
	Have you ever felt like a fraud and the whole world is going to find out that you're really not as competent as other people think? Do you feel like your success is because of luck or timing but not your own skills? Then you are not alone! This concept is well known and is called the Impostor Syndrome. It's not limited to software development but it's very common in our field.

Most people have experienced this at some point in their lives but don't talk about since they think they're alone. In this talk I'm gonna tell my story of suffering from the Impostor Syndrome and share my advice on how to overcome it.

	00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,320
hello

00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,240
yes my name is Backlund I nice to see

00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,460
you here I have to admit when I said yes

00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,320
to give his talk I didn't realize how

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:31,050
large so this conference would be but I

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:36,239
think it will be fine so ya feeling like

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:39,809
a fake yeah maybe yeah maybe first about

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,730
my background I'm a web developer and I

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:45,510
work for an Icelandic company called

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:47,010
colibri and we work and team up with

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,770
other companies to build digital

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,989
products websites and apps but i only

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,210
started there two months ago and before

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:59,670
that i have been an Android developer

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,500
for five years and so yeah I'm decided

00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,300
not to talk about my two months

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,119
experience of JavaScript but I'm going

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,430
to talk about the imposter syndrome and

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,039
this talk is just more about feelings

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,440
and thoughts and the emotions which is

00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:15,210
normally maybe not talked much about the

00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,160
attack on for this but it was also

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,560
likely empathy talk yesterday which I

00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,600
thought was great and miles they are

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,360
mentioned a impostor syndrome if you

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,140
noticed and so I'm going to tie into

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,380
this and the impostor syndrome is a term

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,090
that was coined up in the seventies by

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,570
two psychologists that we're doing

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:40,229
research on high-achieving women and it

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:43,290
refers to when a person feels like like

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,880
an imposter like a fake or a fraud in

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,650
their field and it's always afraid

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,479
though that everybody else is just going

00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,740
to find out that they are not competent

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,439
and this is in spite of science external

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,340
signs of success like and they are just

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:05,009
dismissed as timing or luck or something

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,750
like that so I wanted to like ask you

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:11,940
here you know how many of you are

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:15,540
familiar with this feeling mice exactly

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:20,100
and yeah you are not alone that's normal

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:22,769
some study showed that sanity percent of

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:26,790
all people have like experience this at

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:29,160
some point in their time and two or five

00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,860
successful people you know feel like

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,660
fake

00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:36,840
most of the time and you will be glad to

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:39,340
hear this is really common with

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:44,890
successful and like high achieving

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:47,080
people and it's not gender exclusive but

00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,320
it is more common with women and

00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,930
specially learning like male-dominated

00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:56,560
fields but you're also in a group with

00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:58,570
people like Neil Gaiman Tina Fey Bill

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,910
Murray and Emma Watson we're all

00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,250
expressed that they have experienced

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:08,470
important syndrome so that's not a bad

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:11,830
great to be a part of I'm come start out

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:14,890
just be telling you my story and then

00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:21,910
later on I have some advices that have

00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:25,120
helped me to overcome it and yeah i mean

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:27,430
i am a female in a male dominant

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,030
industry and i think like my intricate

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:32,410
this might have looked wrong from that i

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,630
studied computer science in the

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,420
university hun iceland and when i

00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,370
started to study it I didn't really know

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:43,120
programming I don't like I'll just a

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:46,660
little bit in HTML and I accidentally

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,690
took one course in SQL in college but i

00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:53,080
really liked math and computers so you

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:56,200
know i decided to try it out and and i

00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,690
remember at the first like social events

00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,820
in the school some guy came up to me and

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,489
asked me what what computer games do you

00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,840
play and I was like oh my god I'm

00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:07,019
never going to be a good programmer

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,269
because I don't play any computer games

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:11,560
but then I realized that you don't have

00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,959
to play computer games to be a

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,910
programmer and you definitely are not

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:17,709
necessarily good program or even though

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:23,020
you play computer games it was a relief

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:27,010
and another thing I noticed when I was

00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:28,900
in in the university that like it's

00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,090
difference between guys and girls

00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,130
because like I was one of very few girls

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:37,320
in my studies were just like I don't

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:40,960
know to Rihanna's baby and and I I

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,300
really have this urge to talk about my

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,800
feelings with

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,300
my girlfriends and I do that like all

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,090
the time and if I'm just rush to stuff

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:52,620
like that but the guys really don't do

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,690
that and it was so often like like I was

00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,940
like a total stress and freaking out

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,800
because I didn't understand anything but

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,599
it was afraid to tell it tell it to the

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,990
guys because like they never expressed

00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:06,150
it but then like I always like found out

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,800
later on that the most of them were just

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:10,289
as stressed as me and didn't like to

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,740
understand everything and some stuff

00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:15,659
like that so you know I encourage you

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,580
guys if you feel like that system I talk

00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:21,690
about your emotions and your feelings I

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:24,240
think it's definitely better and it's

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,340
normal I mean I can understand that he

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,719
feels like an imposter when you are

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:33,060
studying and I mean and it's common with

00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:34,500
students to feel feel the imposter

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,819
syndrome because like you don't know

00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,270
everything and you're constantly

00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:41,610
learning and like I just had this

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,590
nagging fear that I was not good enough

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:47,550
programmer and expected it would just

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:51,060
you know go away after I graduated but

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:53,639
then it kind of didn't and I studied

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,400
Android programming the first time it

00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,219
was taught here in Iceland 2009 to 10

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,639
and then i graduated in 2010 and i

00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:04,789
started to work on Android and PHP if

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,409
you remember left programming limits but

00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:09,300
mostly enter it and you know date

00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:12,779
another android program on the sides and

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,750
then in 2012 i was approached by an

00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:18,830
icelandic startup called plain vanilla

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:21,990
which does the trivia app called quiz 0

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,690
which is like i would have to say the

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,150
past trivia in the world and has gained

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,219
like worldwide success and they

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:31,349
approached me because like i was the

00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:34,500
most experienced the most experienced

00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:36,389
android programmers in Iceland which

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,310
might sound cool but i thought it was

00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:41,310
terrifying because i did not feeling

00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:43,889
like I was left experienced but I

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,379
accepted the job of course it was really

00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,960
exciting and we were just six at a time

00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:52,080
and the company grew up to 80 people in

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,320
two years and yeah games like really

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,810
worldwide huge success

00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,810
and even after a couple of years and I

00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,690
was a part of this whole process really

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:08,130
deep into the development and and

00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:09,840
everything I you know I still was always

00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,370
afraid that you know someday they would

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,620
find out that I did not know what I was

00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,410
doing and somehow I always assumed that

00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:21,240
everybody else knew what they were doing

00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:25,200
which is maybe not correct so about two

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,450
years ago I had had a massive burnet at

00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,760
my work and started to you know some

00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:33,330
soul-searching I guess you can say and

00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,640
then I came across his term the impostor

00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,920
syndrome and there's in a reading it

00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,510
black and white you know exactly the

00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,540
same feelings that I had been

00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:45,840
experiencing that that was just a huge

00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:48,840
of the first big step in getting like

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,510
overcoming it realizing it was not just

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,820
you know me being like an insecure woman

00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:58,440
but this was just like a Sherman can

00:07:53,820 --> 00:08:00,300
happen to our and anyone so yeah that

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,780
was great but like van in the past two

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,120
years I've done some things I feel that

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:08,190
have helped me overcome the imposter

00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:13,890
syndrome and I wanted to share those

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:20,430
advices with you yes how how to overcome

00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:23,850
it first recognize your success if you

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:26,970
just you know sit down and write down

00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,860
how how you came to the place you are

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,960
today like what decision did you make

00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,360
like when did it say yes when it could I

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,510
said no and you know what problems have

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,580
you solved then projects you have done

00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:40,890
and know what new things have you

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,320
learned and like I'll promise you you'll

00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:47,700
realize that you have a big part in your

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:52,980
success and then recognize your

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:54,750
strengths and weaknesses and like Miles

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,690
said yesterday I mean we are you know

00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,400
human and we are all the same but we

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,320
still have like a different you know

00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,410
your strengths and weaknesses and and

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,940
that's fine I mean some people are

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,880
introverts while others are outspoken

00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,680
and I

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,500
is better than the other they're just

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,460
you know both just you know a human

00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:17,590
elements and and I don't know about you

00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,420
but I sometimes tend to compare myself

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,610
with other people that have there's

00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:24,220
different qualities then I am or to like

00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:26,680
you know people that really excel in

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:29,170
what they're doing but unrealistic

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,800
comparison doesn't really doesn't really

00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:34,510
help so if we would just focus on your

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,910
strengths and if you can approve on them

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,680
and then we also you know think about

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,640
your weaknesses and you know maybe

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:45,730
that's something you can overcome like

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,000
for me it took me a really long time to

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:51,190
accept that being a single mom as I am I

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,170
just don't have the same time and energy

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,930
as people that on the children to spent

00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,600
in programming and work and all that and

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:01,030
that probably means that I won't gain as

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,550
much knowledge sent you know experience

00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:06,340
as those folks and that's just fine I

00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,680
have finally accepted that and I have

00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:12,130
you know different qualities I think

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,720
fairly decent that giving talks and you

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,130
know I'm good to work with people and

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,000
you know that might be something that

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:22,210
other people lack and and another

00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,420
weakness of mine i have i have found out

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:28,390
is that I I don't ask for help soon

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:31,030
enough so I like tentacle and just get

00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:33,370
stuck in a deep rabbit hole which makes

00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,860
me really frustrated and before I

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:37,960
finally asked for help with this of

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:42,520
course not good for anybody but i've

00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:45,370
been i've been working right another

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,650
thing is pair programming when i was

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,560
first as the pair program I was

00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:52,510
terrified I mean when you feel like a

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,160
fake how are you going to fake that when

00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,900
another person is just watching watching

00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,550
over your shoulder when you're

00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:03,340
programming but then it turns out you

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:07,270
know I did much better than I thought I

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:09,220
would I mean still today I get a little

00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:11,640
like stage fright when I'm asked to

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,720
program and like being a driver seat and

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,800
when I mean I think it's just practice

00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,769
and

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,839
and getting the experience to pair

00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:22,810
program with another person and see like

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,330
how they solve problems and go round I

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,040
mean that's really valuable and you will

00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,510
definitely see that other people don't

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,149
know what they're doing all the time

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:32,800
either you know so that's really

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,720
valuable and I'm not saying to pair

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,880
program all the time I definitely think

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,190
there's a time and a place for it but

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,630
definitely do it you know every once in

00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:47,920
a while that's really healthy I'm

00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:50,260
getting feedback from somebody you trust

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,380
somebody that works with you and you

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:55,060
know do it in a formal setting I tend to

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,399
when people like compliments meters on a

00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,500
casual basis you know I tend to just you

00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,209
know not really registering it or just

00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,060
saying like either just saying it or

00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:06,430
something like that but having a like

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,290
formal feedback I have both done this at

00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,200
plain vanilla where I used to work and

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:13,300
we also do it at colibri we're just both

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,579
persons you know come prepare to talk

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,310
about your weaknesses and strengths and

00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:21,550
you know giving constructive feedback

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:23,260
and I at least discovered that i have

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,970
some qualities that i didn't realize i

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,220
had and you know that's really good to

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,079
hear from a person you trust and it

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:32,500
doesn't have to be your boss or anything

00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:40,029
just you know a co-worker you or use the

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:42,399
work with and then ask for house it said

00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:44,470
that the worst thing that can happen if

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,990
you ask for half this that's all buddy

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:49,180
says no and I mean of course that can

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,850
suck and you have to be prepared for

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,310
that but I feel like the worst thing

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:56,079
that happens when I asked for have it's

00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,089
not necessarily together no but then I'm

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,760
just you know exposing that I don't know

00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:04,180
something and but that's there something

00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:07,360
you like have to overcome and you know

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:10,390
just realize that it's not senior to not

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,220
ask for half because you know you never

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:15,190
learn anything if you would never ask

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,949
anything and in the end it's not even

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:20,019
just about you it's about you know other

00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:21,730
people as well and it's better for

00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:23,020
everybody you know if you work in a team

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:25,420
with it just admit that it does know

00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,030
something and you would get help instead

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:31,080
of you know banging your

00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:37,560
had to a stone or something and related

00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:40,440
to that is be vulnerable by that I mean

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,090
just you know don't be afraid to express

00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,490
your thoughts and feelings they're

00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:51,330
definitely as valid as everybody else's

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:55,140
and you know it don't have to be afraid

00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:57,480
to be wrong everybody is wrong everyone

00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,160
to my wife I mean precedence or wrong

00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,090
all the time it's okay for you to be

00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:05,610
wrong and even if you like sometimes

00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,410
feel stupid if you say something that

00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,950
does not mean that you were stupid and

00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:13,230
everybody has that's every yeah every

00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:20,010
now and then yeah we are just human and

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:22,500
humans are not perfect I gave gave his

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:25,080
talk as well at the dais meet up here in

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,490
Iceland a couple of weeks ago and I got

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:32,520
a lot of really good feedback format and

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:37,080
some of the feedback I got made me add

00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:38,790
this slide into it was that like I'm

00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,880
talking about you know showing respect

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:43,890
and no being vulnerable asking for half

00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,590
and that kind of depends on that you

00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:49,290
like trust your teammates and your

00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:51,660
company and yeah it's been said to me

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:54,240
like that not all workplaces or like

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,970
that you know in some workplaces below

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,370
it's like frowned upon to show any

00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,020
weakness of asking cash for something

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,120
you know and some people said it was

00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:08,160
coming in ad agencies i don't know i

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,750
just heard that and but first of all if

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,040
you work in a workplace like that i

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,870
would just tell you to get the hell out

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,680
of there and go work somewhere where you

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:21,860
have feel good and but another thing

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:24,270
also i feel like actually having that

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,550
would you say yeah having that in the

00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:30,540
workplace gives you like tools and

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:32,760
platforms to you know you're expected to

00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,200
say that if you don't know something or

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,260
if you need help like in our daily

00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:39,060
meetings you know you should say if if

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,730
you need help to something and you know

00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:44,790
doing rattles going over what went wrong

00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:47,520
and what you can do to improve on it so

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:50,210
i definitely think that's a good place

00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,520
to start if you don't have it as well

00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:57,090
and then like at cooley bri we have

00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:59,880
taken it a bit further and i don't know

00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:02,310
if you heard about Jim McCarthy's 11

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:06,000
protocols core protocols has anybody

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:07,890
heard about it okay okay is it

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,320
definitely google it i wasn't sure like

00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:12,720
if people knew about it or not but Tim

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,010
McCarthy worked for Microsoft for many

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,020
many years and he was just really good

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,670
at you know building teams and he'll

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,490
expect that in two or three years just

00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:26,010
researching how how was the best way to

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:29,120
work at a team and being good teammate

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:32,880
and you know so it seemed basically

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:36,540
works for the minimal amount of time but

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,360
maximum amount of output and that really

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,250
depends on that people feel they can be

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,130
himself and feel good working in a team

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:46,200
so he has like these 11 protocols I'm

00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:48,990
not going to go through them all one of

00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:52,730
them is you know ask for help one I

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:56,790
wanted to you know explain is check-ins

00:16:52,730 --> 00:17:00,270
this is a thing you do either at the

00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:02,250
start of a meeting or on a regular basis

00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,980
like it Coldplay we do this just every

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:08,940
friday and then also in some meetings

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:12,030
and then you go the circle so everybody

00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:15,480
shares their feelings and we have these

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:18,360
four feelings you you you go by that's

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:22,140
you know if you're mad glad sad or

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,640
afraid of something and it can't be you

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,150
know or something related to work or

00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,250
just something personal at first you

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:31,350
kind of made me feel it's weird but you

00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:34,640
know I actually start used to it really

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:37,830
fast and I love LA two minutes now and

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,160
it's just you know exposes that you know

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:43,380
maybe a co-worker you know has a sick

00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,180
family member and that's why he has been

00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,830
feeling you know Pat the whole week and

00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,660
you realize oh man okay it's not because

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:50,850
he doesn't like me but it's because of

00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,920
that I mean it's just one example and I

00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,700
just definitely think

00:17:51,920 --> 00:18:00,250
this builds you know trust in within a

00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:03,680
team so yeah really recommend to advance

00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:07,090
so are there any positives about the

00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:10,940
imposter syndrome I mean yes there are

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:13,640
if you have it you you're very likely to

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:17,060
be successful you're likely to be a hard

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:21,080
worker you're probably like a

00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:23,060
perfectionist so I mean it there are

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,520
positives there but if you don't like

00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:28,730
what's out it can end in you know

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:32,270
undesirable stress and burnout and so I

00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:35,720
don't think it's a desirable state to be

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:39,340
in in the long run but I mean you can

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,340
take some positives out of it definitely

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:51,040
yeah so does this connect to Josh gift

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:54,140
at all you might ask for me it does

00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:56,060
going from like a senior android

00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:01,160
position i was at plain vanilla and

00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:04,040
going to like a junior front-end web

00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:06,710
developer at colibri was it took a lot

00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:09,110
of courage and i don't think i would

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,670
have done it if I still suffered

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,220
severely from the apartment syndrome

00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:15,290
because I knew it would mean that I

00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,800
would have to be totally honest about my

00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:21,950
childhood skills wits or not that good

00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:25,040
and I would have to be not afraid to ask

00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:29,510
questions and yeah to just you know

00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:33,290
being honest sand but you know yeah

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:35,000
having that Kurtz now it's the reason

00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:38,630
why I'm here at the account today so

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:43,510
there is this josh with connection and I

00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:46,010
mean and then I don't know if you can

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:49,370
completely overcame it I don't know I

00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:52,910
don't feel I definitely have just you

00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:55,280
know on wednesday i went to the reactor

00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:57,590
workshop with brian hall which was by

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,890
the way really good and in the morning

00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:02,540
he had like some examples we did and

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,870
then we had to do some exercise I'm i

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,940
started

00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:06,830
so it looked really simple and I

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,360
couldn't get it to build and was like oh

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,520
my god there's always people there they

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,020
can see what I'm doing and you know my

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,970
brain just goes into oh my god I'm so

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,809
silly I'm so stupid i can do this and

00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:19,580
you know it's totally not logical i know

00:20:17,809 --> 00:20:22,160
that but you know sometimes you can't

00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,470
control your brain but it just takes you

00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,500
know a couple of minutes today for me to

00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:29,510
get out of this state and realize you

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,340
know I'm just new at javascript it's

00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:34,070
okay even if i don't know the syntax

00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:36,770
completely and in the next exercise I

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:39,110
know I I know this now and I just asked

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:43,220
Matt my coworker to who was also there

00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:44,420
to help me and just when you're insecure

00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,190
about something and you have some

00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:50,450
problem just you know saying it out loud

00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:52,910
makes it so much smaller and easier even

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,740
though it can be hard but it really does

00:20:52,910 --> 00:21:01,550
and now I can just you know laughs

00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:04,280
laughs at this afterwards and meow so I

00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:07,550
just really think you folks for coming

00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,380
here and I would love to get the

00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,820
conversation about this going because I

00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,190
think it helps a lot just talking about

00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,500
this so I'm going to be here if you want

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:19,280
