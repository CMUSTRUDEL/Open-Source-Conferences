Title: Brian Holt: React: Learn Once Write Anywhere - JSConf Iceland 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-15
Playlist: JSConf Iceland 2016
Description: 
	React has set the front end development world on fire. It seems nearly over night that React became the darling of JavaScripts developers everywhere and before you knew it, sites like Netflix, reddit, Khan Academy, Airbnb, and more were rewriting entire front ends to harness that power.

The React inferno isn’t contained to just the DOM though; other communities have taken notice and are beginning to harness the power of the one-way data flow that React enforces. In this talk we’ll give you a brief overview of why React is so ®evolutionary for user interface development and some other communities that have taken hold of it as well. We’ll talk about seeing React everywhere from the DOM to the terminal, native mobile, game consoles, three dimensional environments, and even virtual reality.

hi cool so my name is Brian Holt

00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,110
currently working at Netflix and this is

00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,960
the most ill-advised talk I've ever

00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,580
given in the sense that there's so many

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,169
moving technology pieces that something

00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,290
is Brown to bound to break and I'm

00:00:26,169 --> 00:00:31,360
excited to find out which one it is

00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:33,250
so my first ill-advised piece is I'm

00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,370
going to be giving a talk out of the

00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,590
command line because that's a good idea

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:42,190
throughout this entire talk please feel

00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,570
free to tweet at Jas Kampf is there's

00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,640
going to be several poll questions and

00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,370
you can answer them and they should

00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,379
magically appear up here first one is

00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,210
what's your favorite framework of choice

00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:55,420
and looks like people are already

00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,620
tweeting react I think that's just

00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,339
because that's the name of the talk so

00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:02,319
whatever deal with it cool so I'm going

00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:04,629
to talk about react and the idea of

00:01:02,319 --> 00:01:06,850
learn once right anywhere and this is

00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,620
kind of struck me while is reading their

00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,870
Docs one day that the idea of learned

00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:13,480
once right anywhere most of us are

00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:17,070
familiar with PhoneGap or cordova or

00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:21,100
ionic or any one of these particular

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,200
frameworks that are trying to be write

00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:25,810
once run anywhere and to me that's kind

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,760
of a pipe dream so that's why I kind of

00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,640
latched on to react learn once write

00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,170
anywhere so let's talk a little bit I'm

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,810
yeah I'm Brian Holt whatever no one

00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,240
cares and I work at Netflix which is a

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:40,210
pretty great I like wasting all of your

00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,430
time and by where I used to work before

00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:44,710
Netflix was reddit so I really like

00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:47,329
wasting your time

00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,189
cool so let's uh let's chitchat a sec

00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:50,600
about react first of all if you ever

00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:53,479
moment if you went to a Linds talk it

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,560
was fantastic about performance I gave

00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,819
you a little bit more high-level if

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,689
you're not intimately familiar with

00:01:55,819 --> 00:02:02,090
react so it's a library for creating

00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:03,890
views and that's kind of like just the

00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:07,549
high level that's exactly what react is

00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:09,769
for it was created for the Dom I'm not

00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:11,450
mistaken was created at Instagram and

00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:13,420
then just kind of slowly took over

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:18,709
everything in the entire world including

00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:20,120
Netflix Facebook Firefox what else is

00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:24,200
out there lots of things are now being

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:26,360
written and react super super great

00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,860
library it's a pattern for writing you

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:33,610
eyes and so we kind of got stuck with

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:36,560
MVC as front-end developers right like

00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:38,390
MVC is super awesome for the backend if

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,049
you ever written Ruby on Rails Django

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,489
like that kind of abstraction of MVC

00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:46,370
Model View controller works really

00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:50,180
really well hey looks something like the

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:52,730
backbone go team so it works really

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,260
really well for the for the backend like

00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,790
this this separation of concerns if you

00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,139
have the models to talk to the database

00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,609
you have the views that actually talk

00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:00,230
out to the clients and if the thin

00:02:58,609 --> 00:03:01,609
little controllers that kind of wire all

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,829
your data about this works super well

00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:05,870
for for back-end programming and then

00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:09,049
people that was like this is an awesome

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,760
idea I'm going to apply this to to the

00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:12,620
Dom and it turned out that it's actually

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,319
not such an awesome idea if anyone's I

00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,510
maintained a huge backbone app before it

00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:19,730
can fall apart at the seams sometimes

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:21,470
there are great backbones out backbone

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:25,549
apps out there but you have to be very

00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:28,160
disciplined to get them to work well so

00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:29,299
some daring individuals decided to look

00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,519
at this and said there has to be a

00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:34,010
better way we should write a paradigm

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,260
that's specifically for writing UI

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,319
libraries and so they kind of came up

00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,120
with this idea of request/response right

00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,940
because that's kind of what the web has

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,500
been like for four years right like you

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,230
request a web page and you get back a

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,060
web page that's kind of the idea so they

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,880
have to say well we can kind of

00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,880
generalize this abstraction and

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,440
apply it to more of a JavaScript

00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,140
framework so they kind of came with this

00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,520
idea of given a set of state so I'm

00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:06,170
going to throw in state and I'm going to

00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:09,830
get an output of abdomin ever my user

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,600
interface time I'm looking for this

00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:12,800
ended up being really really great and

00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,390
then they came up with a bunch of crazy

00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,120
ideas of like how they can implement it

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:18,410
like the virtual DOM and crazy like

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,640
that but in the end of that you actually

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,859
don't have to care whenever you're

00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,510
writing react for the most part you

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:25,280
don't really have to care how it's doing

00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:28,040
it you just have to write your cosign

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:32,000
given this set of state my output looks

00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:38,060
like this while JavaScript and go team

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,250
okay so let's take a second to talk

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,710
about what exactly is going on with this

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:45,080
craziness up here this is written for a

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:48,770
library called blessed did anyone check

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,200
out ken wheelers web packed dashboard

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:54,560
anyone see that come up on Twitter yeah

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,690
super cool right same library I used it

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,650
first though so suck on a Ken

00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:03,590
I hope he's watching the live feed so

00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,669
I'm gonna herd it curses right like this

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,229
is blessed

00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:08,690
right that's instead of being cursed as

00:05:06,229 --> 00:05:10,970
its blessed it's a it's a dumb joke but

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:14,120
that's what they went with so blessed is

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:17,870
a you can write user interfaces for the

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,120
command line using node right that's all

00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,860
blessed is and then someone's thoughts

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,320
like well I mean we're writing user

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,729
interfaces why can't we point react at

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,640
that so that this actually is written in

00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:30,740
react blessed so I wrote a user

00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,530
interface for the command line using

00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,970
react which is pretty awesome so I was

00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,479
able to use all the same tools that I

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:41,150
used for the Dom use Babel whatever and

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,890
I was able to target the command line

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,229
using react which i think is pretty cool

00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:49,540
so yeah let's go back to to talking

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:49,540
about react for just just a moment here

00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:58,280
actually JK lol we're gonna go back for

00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,540
just a sec so most of us are have worked

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,530
with react before or these sort of

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,360
familiar with it and there's two

00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,400
packages here there's react and there's

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,930
react Dom right and this is kind of

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,520
confusing for newcomers to the

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:09,680
to the react world because they're

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,509
thinking I don't understand why I need

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,340
both these packages i have i want to

00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:15,380
write react and I want it to render out

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:20,530
to the Dom that's kind of way it started

00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:22,520
right up and through til react point

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,470
1314 something in that area

00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,150
those were the same package you just

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,360
downloaded one react and it just worked

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,400
and then these crazy people over

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,580
Facebook's like let's write react and

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,979
have it target iOS and Android and so

00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,690
they started writing these react

00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,970
components that instead of targeting the

00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,910
Dom they started targeting native

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:45,440
platforms and so they realized like

00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,910
we're using the same paradigms using the

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,590
same lifecycle methods all these

00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,720
different pieces that are built straight

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:53,449
into react they're regarding real react

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,430
components and just that last mile right

00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:56,599
the last mile of delivery was the only

00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,860
part that difference so they decided

00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:00,169
like let's break out the part that

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,229
actually writes it out to the Dom call

00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:04,639
that react Dom and now we have this

00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:05,870
generalized react library that it

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,699
doesn't actually care what it's

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,340
targeting it just makes components right

00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:12,560
it's just a way of declaring the way

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,840
that your components should look and now

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,639
we can do things like react native and

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,139
react blessed and all these other crazy

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,900
things that people shouldn't do but are

00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:25,340
gonna do anyway like this talk so that's

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,409
what that's what react blessed is that's

00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,789
what react Dom is is that's these last

00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:31,250
mile libraries and that's kind of what

00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:33,680
this talk is about is all the crazy

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,570
awesome stuff you can do with the react

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:41,990
library just by swapping out that last

00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:44,720
mile cool so yeah let's go back to

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,220
talking about why react is so cool and

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,530
why is kind of took off right like it's

00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,370
the new shininess that everyone's

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,050
talking about

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,970
half these conference talks are about

00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:54,169
them like if you write angular or

00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,550
empress Peschel if you write ember

00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:57,349
you're probably sick about hearing about

00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:00,849
react but let me tell you still why it's

00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:03,440
cool it's about creating components and

00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:06,020
that's for me that's kind of the bottom

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,360
line like you instead of having these in

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,120
in terms of UI development arbitrary

00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,039
separation of concerns we decided to

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,360
take all the concerns for very small

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,599
pieces and then just mush them all

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,840
together in just this unholy matrimony

00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:23,240
which ends up being really

00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:25,949
great I'm doing a great job selling it

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,479
so you take all these components and are

00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:30,720
these concerns and you mash them all

00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:32,789
together for these very small components

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,669
but what's really really awesome by

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,890
smashing all these concerns together if

00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,839
you're looking at your you know webpage

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,279
and say like the the login buttons

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,110
broken like the text is wrong or

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,700
something like that let's pretend for a

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,960
second that this is angular and I pick

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,910
on angular just because it's the one I

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,020
know the best but lots of frameworks

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,640
have had this problem before it could be

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,130
a jQuery app it could be just a plain

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,230
vanilla GIS app you look at it you see

00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:58,520
the button text is wrong and you think

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:01,080
okay I have a bug where is my bug I

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:02,910
don't know if it's angular it could be

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,370
the directive it could be the controller

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,410
it could be the template it could be the

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,670
template for the directive it could be

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,020
one of the many services that you

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,130
decided to inject it could be the

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,470
library that brought it in right like

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:16,529
there's just all in other words you have

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,730
no goddamn clue where it is right just

00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:19,940
by knowing that you have a bug you are

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,560
not really not much closer to finding it

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,959
now what's nice about react if you see

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,510
the component has a problem with it the

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,250
problem is in the component like it just

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:33,330
has to be there because all the concerns

00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:34,770
lived there now I'm simplifying a tiny

00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:37,589
bit right like I guess it could come

00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:39,420
from like a ie user interface library

00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:41,100
that that you are using in conjunction

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,730
or something something to that effect

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,830
but my point still stands that you have

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,600
a very very good intuition of where it

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,370
lives and you have at least the

00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,070
beginning of the trail to go find what's

00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,570
wrong with it and I think that's having

00:09:53,070 --> 00:10:02,310
a beginning point when finding a bug is

00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:04,170
already a huge step up so yeah it's a

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,750
pattern for creating user interfaces

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:10,620
that's what react is is a pattern for

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:12,270
user interfaces and other communities

00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,220
started eyeing this and say like this is

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,900
really great like I like this

00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,390
declarative method of declaring my

00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,700
components saying kind of this reactive

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,260
way of saying okay given the set state

00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,420
and these props need to change will I

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,830
pass down to my children it just made

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,450
sense and not only does it make sense

00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,540
for the Dom it makes sense for a lot of

00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,980
user interfaces as you can see here this

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,310
was really easy to write this didn't

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,779
take me

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:38,160
very many lines of code that I wrote an

00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:40,920
entire presentation giving kind of piece

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,480
of let's be totally honest but I

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,910
wrote this with not too many lines of

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,550
code now if I asked you today to go out

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,710
and know today and write user interfaces

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,350
for the command line first of all you'd

00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,820
be like why the secondly it'd be kind of

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,890
hard to get started with that but using

00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,570
react this was actually really easy like

00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,700
I don't have to know anything about

00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,930
writing for the command line and to be

00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,580
honest I really don't know that much

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,870
about it but I know a lot about writing

00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,100
react because I've been doing it for a

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,440
long time and I was able to knock this

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,029
out super fast because I was able to

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,350
take that those same things I had

00:11:09,029 --> 00:11:14,160
learned for writing react to the Dom

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:16,110
read writing react for native and

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,680
actually even at Netflix were writing it

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,940
for on TVs ps4 is Xbox is that kind of

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,500
stuff I was able to take those same

00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,839
learnings and apply here and I think

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,510
that's that's pretty powerful I was able

00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:30,060
to target a platform that I really don't

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:33,390
know too much about which is pretty

00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:38,160
fantastic so again this is not the dream

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:39,870
of write once run anywhere right I can't

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,330
take this same code and try and run in

00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:44,460
the browser I can't run it on a TV

00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:46,320
that's that's not a useful target at

00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:49,170
least in terms of the technology in my

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,000
opinion available today to us however

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,460
the idea that I can learn this paradigm

00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,620
once and then apply it in many places

00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:58,140
very very fascinating to me and so far

00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,750
has pretty well held out in fact react

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,910
in terms of its ecosystem today is very

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,800
much about in embracing the differences

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,570
in all the different platforms if you're

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,850
writing react native for Android you're

00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,830
encouraged to if you need to drop into

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,600
the Java layer in you know knock out a

00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:15,000
couple pieces and then have that plug

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,890
back in to react native those are scape

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,560
hatches they're not only like available

00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,030
but they're encouraged and the same

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,709
thing with react Dom if you need to you

00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:25,920
know in component in mount and reference

00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:28,350
the window bringing a jQuery plug-in for

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,760
who else who knows why I wouldn't

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,170
suggest it but if you need to do it you

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,550
can do it right and so it's about

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:36,420
embracing the differences in the

00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:39,089
platforms so let's let's just take a

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,220
little sidetrack to JSX

00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:43,110
let's be honest about people that wrote

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,600
react who do not write react at first

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,720
because I had JSX

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,600
this guy this guy right here I saw JSX

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,610
and I was like this is dumb like I just

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,810
got JavaScript out of my HTML I sure as

00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,699
hell I'm not puttin HTML in my

00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:57,350
JavaScript like that was that was my

00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:58,970
reaction when I first saw that blog post

00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,540
come out from Facebook like you guys

00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:05,990
just go write your PHP your special PHP

00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,910
and leave me alone and then I came back

00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:10,220
like a year later as like I was

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,720
wrong this is actually really great so

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,490
let's talk about like what is jsx it

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,339
basically lets you write eight XML like

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:19,759
syntax aka

00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:22,940
HTML for the most part directly in your

00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:24,889
JavaScript and it's really just syntax

00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:27,500
sugar for that just transpile x' two

00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:30,470
function calls that's 100% of what JSX

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:35,389
is but the reason why I like it is I'm

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:36,500
writing code to mimic markup right like

00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:38,329
ultimately that's what I want to do I

00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,880
want to write code that ends up being

00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:42,440
markup so if I'm writing code that's

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,300
going to end up being markup wouldn't it

00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,709
be great if I could just write the

00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,759
markup right and just get that kind of

00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:51,470
middle step so that's what JSX aims to

00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,420
be is like you're trying to get HTML

00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:55,639
ultimately output to the Dom so just

00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,889
write the HTML and then they'll

00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,959
transpile it into something that

00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:01,339
actually really works in JavaScript and

00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,300
for the most part introducing a build

00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:05,630
stuff is not really a problem anymore

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:08,420
because most of us are using Babel right

00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,920
most of us most of us want to be using

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:12,170
Babel if we're not already using Babel

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,459
so introducing another plugin that

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:19,310
transforms your JSX

00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:22,370
typically not not a problem so if you

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:25,220
are holding out still because of JSX I

00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:28,069
suggest one everyone that I know that

00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,779
writes react eventually ends up on jsx

00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:34,250
with one exception but he's kind of

00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:36,709
weird so it's cool but just give it a

00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,470
shot and if you really really don't like

00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,670
it it's actually pretty easy to write

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:42,980
react without JSX

00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:44,899
it kind of sucks because it's like not

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,009
many tutorials because again most people

00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:49,130
end up writing JSX

00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:50,149
but if you want to learn then come talk

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,370
to me we can definitely figure it out

00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:54,350
together and the other thing I like

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,779
about JSX is it's very declarative right

00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,840
you're declaring I want my markup to

00:14:56,779 --> 00:14:59,790
look like this

00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,830
and I that also very appealing to me

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,810
like I much as possible I think

00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,880
declarative code is easier to read

00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:08,850
easier to reason about easier to

00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,940
maintain all those things which in my

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:16,620
opinion make it empirically better that

00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:19,070
doesn't really make sense anyway so last

00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,330
thing has actually had written this I

00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,020
but I didn't want to bring it to Iceland

00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,000
so I didn't

00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,790
so there's another library called react

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,450
hardware that you can write react for

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:32,760
the Arduino which is like right like

00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:34,890
mind blown but you can actually like you

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,050
know turn on the breadboard and you know

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,540
blink the lights all that using just

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:40,860
react which is just fascinating to me

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,250
that someone took the time to do this

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,589
but it was super fun to write so all of

00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:49,260
this to say is it's really really cool

00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:52,680
stuff going on with react and I invite

00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,640
you to give it a shot so I'm going to

00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,300
move to the second part of my

00:15:53,640 --> 00:16:00,870
presentation and we're going to now go

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:03,350
into the react Dom so where are you from

00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:07,100
feel free to tweet that out

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:09,450
hopefully my server still running

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,970
so yeah react Dom is most prevalent

00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,140
today that's kind of what react was

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,330
created for and everything else is kind

00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:18,900
of trying to capture that magic that we

00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:21,690
already have with react it's being used

00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:25,440
at Netflix it's being used at reddit

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,940
Facebook Google Mozilla everyone is

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,250
using it to build interfaces and it's

00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,620
pretty pretty sweet yeah I have here my

00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,120
notes it's scales which i think is just

00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,800
like the most thing to say I

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:40,050
don't even know what that means but it

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:42,780
scales what that might mean is that it's

00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,339
really easy to use in teens because you

00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,170
can treat components like I write a

00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:48,030
component and you write a component and

00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,490
they can kind of be black boxes to each

00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,380
other with the way that react works they

00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,120
kind of expose this like API is like

00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,709
okay I expect you to give me these

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,660
things and I'm going to do things with

00:16:55,709 --> 00:16:58,860
them right and there's secret things you

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,810
don't you don't get to know what it does

00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,980
right which is can you I mean you can

00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,709
look at the code but you don't have to

00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,750
know what it does and I think that's

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:08,370
that's pretty awesome that you can treat

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:12,100
your

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:13,539
colles coat is as a block box that can

00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,240
be scary too if you don't trust your

00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:20,140
colleague but then you have other

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:24,309
problems I suppose so let's talk about

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:27,610
like what this might look like so this

00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:30,190
is kind of a typical react app that you

00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:32,380
might see right that you have these

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,720
interior like drop down components and

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,919
then you have like an author panel I

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,640
don't even know if this is supposed to

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,409
be a graduate of Google image search but

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,480
it's it's a component made up of other

00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:44,679
components that is then inside of

00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,850
another component which is then inside

00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:47,409
another component right so it's just

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,659
components inside of components inside

00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:52,210
of components but like something you

00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:53,409
might notice which is really cool I have

00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,940
a couple of dropdowns right here and

00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:56,860
then I also have a drop down over here

00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,510
or I have like a date picker over here

00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,770
like I write these little components and

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,580
then I'm able to just use them across

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:05,620
the site my favorite example of that is

00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,080
I used to work at reddit and you can

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,880
think about a reddit post right and a

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,620
reddit post you can give gold you can

00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,740
upvote you can down vote you can report

00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,669
to the admins you can give a permalink

00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,350
there's all these different behaviors

00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:18,370
that are commonly associated with posts

00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,929
no matter where you put them right it

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:22,059
could be embedded into another page it

00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:24,280
could be on the comet view it could be

00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,200
on the home page it could be on a

00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:30,250
subreddit view all these different pages

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,929
that display the same component well

00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,929
it's kind of annoying to have to either

00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:36,280
copy and paste these you know the

00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:37,659
JavaScript associated with these all

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,220
these behaviors that also have to come

00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:40,960
with the markup and all the styling and

00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,600
all that kind of things the nice thing

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,549
about react is I write this drop-down or

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,929
this reddit post and I'm able to embed

00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:48,669
it in all these different places and it

00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:50,740
brings with it all of its styling it

00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:53,080
brings with it all of its behavior it's

00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,700
very you know dry do not repeat yourself

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,600
kind of an idea and I think that's a

00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,510
pretty awesome in fact what you're

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,890
seeing here is another presentation

00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,320
crazy thing that I decided to write oh

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:07,770
you can't see that what there I swear

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,770
there are

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,660
see there are things down here people

00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:20,860
are tweeting we're just going to leave

00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:22,960
it like this right this is readable no

00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,190
okay well I promise there's a whole row

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,190
and they're very pretty and I can see

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:30,970
them it's mostly Iceland let's see it

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:36,970
was like seven Iceland tweets five us

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:37,600
ones three world ones and yeah that's it

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,850
oh yeah

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,230
so tweet some more than you can say

00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,230
it'll make another row on top of it

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:49,420
props down action up so this is really

00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:52,530
what kept me in react the idea with

00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:56,650
react is this idea of one-way data flow

00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:59,320
which is this amazing idea of parents

00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,000
passed down pieces of data and callbacks

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,500
to the children and the children can

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,990
read them and they can call the

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,610
functions but they can't actually modify

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,520
them they're read-only they're mutable

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:12,100
to the child which means that if there

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,480
is a problem with that state it means

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,760
the child didn't muck with it because a

00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,460
child simply cannot muck with it and

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,340
that really reduces your surface area

00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,350
for bugs and I hope you're kind of

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,030
getting a theme here that react is very

00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,010
maintainable it's very easy to track

00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:30,610
down these bugs and I think it's a

00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:32,560
really compelling reason to use react so

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,240
you pass down these props but when the

00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,590
child has like some sort of event right

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,850
like if say it's that date picker that

00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:39,070
we were just looking at it needs to

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,970
inform the parent container that

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,710
something happened

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,440
well the parent just passes down an up

00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,780
callback the child says hey something

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,790
happened here's the data I got you deal

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:51,580
with it right and then it passes that

00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,860
data but back up to the to the parent

00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,360
and the parent is able to modify its own

00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,060
data so if there's any problem with that

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,640
modified data the parent did it right

00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:06,010
because only the parent can do it which

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:08,230
I also think is pretty compelling it's C

00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,560
I know what I can do I can just unmask

00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,560
amaizing

00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:18,250
there you go now you can see it another

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,440
favorite part favorite part I have about

00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:23,020
react is that the best practices for

00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:25,450
react are usually just JavaScript best

00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,799
practices and I think this is kind of a

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,620
bold assertion to make because I'm in

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,940
subtly implying kind of on purpose that

00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:34,990
that's not necessarily true of other

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:37,450
frameworks but the nice thing about

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:39,760
reactors it's knowable you can know

00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,400
everything about react there's just it's

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,010
not very big in terms of how many

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,299
methods there are I wish I probably

00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:47,679
should have gone and counted but they're

00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:49,990
not very many you can know the entire

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,790
API whereas is there anyone here

00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:57,220
comfortable in deserting they used the

00:21:51,790 --> 00:22:00,309
entire jQuery API in an app no hands no

00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:03,010
hands okay no Liars in the room because

00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:04,990
it's impossible there's like 300 methods

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:07,660
right and that do wildly different

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,400
things and so that's why I feel

00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,049
comfortable and asserting that because

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,090
there's such a small API there's not a

00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:14,020
whole lot to react and so most of the

00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,640
stuff that you're doing on the

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,410
day-to-day is just writing raw

00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:21,070
JavaScript which i think is also pretty

00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:23,770
pretty damn compelling I talked about

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:25,360
this already react is definitely more

00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,760
declarative you declare the way you want

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,419
your components to work we are kind of

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,750
posting those those blanks for you and

00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:36,120
reactors community whoo look at that

00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:39,820
hold on we're going to take a picture

00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:42,190
wait where is there it is that is

00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,980
getting tweeted

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:48,970
so I was trying to find like a picture

00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:51,000
from your act calm save image as that's

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:54,250
embarrassing

00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,590
okay so react his community

00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,620
and I was trying to find a picture of

00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:02,710
react comp and I couldn't find it so I

00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,330
decided to take one of you all react is

00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:05,860
a great community and the other thing

00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,780
that's reactors community is this is a

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:12,160
webcam component that I did not program

00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:14,140
but stole from NPM thank you 8m p.m. and

00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,520
it had everything built-in like it I

00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,690
took that screenshot and have to do

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,660
anything that was already built in so

00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:24,180
there's also a community of people that

00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:27,280
will help you out so yeah go team and

00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,900
react as a fad absolutely like anyone

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,740
that's not telling you that is totally

00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:34,660
deluding themselves like obviously its

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,320
new shiny right now we had new shiny

00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:40,570
angular a couple years ago and we had

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:47,530
backbone knockout quit anyone still

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:49,360
writing quit I'm sorry just but I think

00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:51,640
the lessons that we're taking here from

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,420
react are going to to live with us for a

00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:58,050
long time this idea of one-way dataflow

00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,860
is going to live with us for a long time

00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:01,450
we're going to take a lot of these

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,830
lessons and apply them to our future

00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:05,800
frameworks or to our future user

00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:07,480
interfaces and so in that sense writing

00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,950
react today I think is still a good

00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,410
thing because you're learning good

00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:15,190
practices of how to write maintainable

00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:22,170
large apps in production all those sort

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:24,250
of great things so I have my yet most

00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,230
probably terrible idea

00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:31,120
for a demo but we're going to do right

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:33,840
now all right so I got to open QuickTime

00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,840
here

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:50,179
I had it open didn't I nope okay

00:24:38,509 --> 00:24:54,019
QuickTime and new movie recording yeah

00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:58,489
maybe cool alright so this is also

00:24:54,019 --> 00:25:02,840
written in react this is written by RS

00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:07,669
using a technology called that's not

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:10,840
what I wanted to do called a frame and

00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:17,049
look at that look at those pretty people

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:23,720
alright and then just put this into

00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:25,249
Google glass right here alright so if

00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,700
you let's try refreshing this page

00:25:25,249 --> 00:25:27,700
actually

00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:36,350
so a frame is a really cool tech that I

00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,629
believe live was her name was talking

00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:40,909
about this morning it's a technology

00:25:38,629 --> 00:25:41,929
from our good friends at Mozilla that

00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:45,889
they're going to save the world from

00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:49,239
everyone there we go so if you tweet

00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:53,049
that should come up there I think I

00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:53,049
would imagine that would be

00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,540
yeah it looks like it's still working so

00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:03,600
I know absolutely nothing about 3d

00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,920
programming like zero things but I was

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,480
able to write something in virtual

00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,920
reality where it would take your picture

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,150
off of things you were tweeting and put

00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:12,540
it in virtual reality like that is

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:14,730
stupid easy this is only like 100 lines

00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:17,540
of code or something like that and I was

00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:19,470
able to do that just using technology

00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,230
using the same things that I already

00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,940
knew about writing react for a sign-up

00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:25,680
process on Netflix I was able to apply

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,880
those same lessons and apply them into

00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:31,440
3d so I think it's pretty cool and

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,810
pretty compelling I don't think this is

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:43,170
letting people tweet which is

00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:47,550
disappointing but nonetheless I promise

00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:51,120
you it does actually work let's see if I

00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:54,080
can actually just do it on here I'm

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,080
almost out of time anyway so

00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:06,970
there we go Oh looks like someone is

00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:09,400
tweeting so yes we have to learn once

00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:12,670
right anywhere it is a real thing if you

00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,260
take the time to learn react and I think

00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:16,090
these lessons that were you learning now

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,680
with react community are going to

00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:21,420
service into writing user interfaces for

00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,420
