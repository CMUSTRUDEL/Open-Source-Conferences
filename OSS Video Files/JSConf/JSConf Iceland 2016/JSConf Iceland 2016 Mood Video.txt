Description: 
	The debut JSConf Iceland drew 400 attendees from around the globe. Two tracks over two days and a bonus "Experience Iceland" day made this a one-of-a-kind community event. 

We want to thank the team, volunteers, speakers, sponsors and everyone who bought a ticket. Thanks to you, this dream became a reality.

JSConf Iceland will be back March 1-2, 2018. Look for updates on Twitter and our website:
