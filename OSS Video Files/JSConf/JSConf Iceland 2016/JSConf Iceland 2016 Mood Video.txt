00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,460
I couldn't be happier to be the first

00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,920
speaker because it means I get this over

00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,450
with and I can just enjoy when I first

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,390
heard that the conference was happening

00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:43,260
I was like okay I need to go he was

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,920
completely held up to my expectations

00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,720
it's their first time and I've been to a

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,100
lot of first time conferences and this

00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,590
is one of the most well executed

00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,870
conference of ever speaker selection is

00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,640
great it's pretty good I can't wait for

00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:59,170
next year I think about things that

00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,200
we've been doing that's qualified how we

00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,750
evolved our software over the years and

00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,369
some lessons we learn about how to move

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,470
with big teams to work with big teams

00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:09,400
integrate a lot of people together work

00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,860
in the same codebase

00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,840
and how our desktop application for

00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,000
Spotify has evolved during the years

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,850
my name is flickering I work at quiz

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,470
shop and today I was talking about flow

00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,110
it's a static type checker for

00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,759
JavaScript developer Facebook and so far

00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,250
this Congress has been amazing and the

00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,640
local community really did a good job I

00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:33,340
just talked about maze processing and

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,540
how you can use what's available in

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:40,390
browser already to do something that you

00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,310
may think really complicated and you

00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:44,560
have to use external library but it's

00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,729
really once you understand a concept you

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,729
can all do it in browser

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,339

00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,460

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,609
really excited about it but this is so

00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:37,040
different than it's like another level

00:02:34,609 --> 00:02:38,930
of different nature and beauty I'm

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,489
really excited about it and I'm really

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:42,489
