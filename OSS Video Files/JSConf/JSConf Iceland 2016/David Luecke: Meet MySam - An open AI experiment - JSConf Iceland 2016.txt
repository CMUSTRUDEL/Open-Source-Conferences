Publication date: 2016-09-22
Playlist: JSConf Iceland 2016
Description: 
	Apple has Siri, Google has Google Now, Facebook has M. Why can't we have our own virtual assistant?

In this talk I'd like you to meet MySam, an open-source "intelligent" assistant that you can train yourself and extend with plugins written in JavaScript and HTML5.
