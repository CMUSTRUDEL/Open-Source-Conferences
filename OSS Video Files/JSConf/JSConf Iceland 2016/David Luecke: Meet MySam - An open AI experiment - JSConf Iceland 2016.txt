Title: David Luecke: Meet MySam - An open AI experiment - JSConf Iceland 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-22
Playlist: JSConf Iceland 2016
Description: 
	Apple has Siri, Google has Google Now, Facebook has M. Why can't we have our own virtual assistant?

In this talk I'd like you to meet MySam, an open-source "intelligent" assistant that you can train yourself and extend with plugins written in JavaScript and HTML5.

thank you thank you and welcome

00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:42,550
and when I was five items I scientists

00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:48,309
in Switzerland British scientists put

00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:51,489
online the World Wide Web I don't think

00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:55,570
it made the headlines anymore but 25th

00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:57,489
birthday this one and it's pretty

00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:02,770
amazing what happened in last 25 years

00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:04,629
with it right we can do things like live

00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:08,800
in Vancouver and work for a company in

00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:12,280
Chicago we can you know meet in Iceland

00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,920
at a conference with people from all

00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,110
over the world and most important of all

00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:22,030
we can look at cute cat videos all times

00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:23,950
of the day so that was a pretty big

00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:28,720
change and that's kind of symbol of how

00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:32,130
I feel about machine learning I'd like

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:37,570
to use the much cooler sounding

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:40,810
intelligence or AI and yeah it's kind of

00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:44,200
like a like the Internet it's a general

00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:46,390
purpose technology we had two talks

00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,689
already that talked about using AI to

00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:52,869
generate art Google is using it to drive

00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:58,210
cars and I'm going to talk about using

00:01:52,869 --> 00:02:00,159
it to do natural language processing the

00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,680
cool thing about the web browser is that

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,070
Google and Mozilla actually offering us

00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,860
an API maybe you've seen yesterday to do

00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:12,100
speech speech recognition but to make

00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:15,040
sense of that language is a little

00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:18,820
harder and just like parsing HTML not

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,310
possible with regular expressions so I

00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,550
have this you probably can't see this

00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,870
but there's

00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:28,970
pile of wires over there it wasn't my

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,670
gray decide you to bring my own audio

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:36,170
setup there's some good helps to get it

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:41,750
all working hopefully and the reason I

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:44,660
said I brought I talked to it by

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,090
pressing this button it's a little it's

00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,680
called a flick you can get them before

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,750
pax 2 it's actually pretty cool you hook

00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,030
it up to your Android device or other

00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,720
Bluetooth enabled device we were about

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,310
that yesterday and yeah it's literally

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,980
just a button but you can program it to

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:03,860
do stuff and I programmed it to get my

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,560
friend to listen so let's see if that

00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:12,260
works

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:15,320
hey can you hear us yeah so this already

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:21,590
starting out that that's okay hey can

00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:22,580
you hear you might see that I don't know

00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,110
what you're talking about screen a

00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:29,090
little more often I'm gonna explain it a

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:31,720
little more as well cool do you want to

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,720
tell us your name

00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:45,870
actually came from me watching too many

00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,810
movies about hey I might know Samantha

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,540
from the movie her and Samaritan from

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:54,569
personal interest the you is actually

00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,640
inspired by it but besides that this

00:03:54,569 --> 00:04:08,909
thing has nothing to do with an AI

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:15,989
companion that us run the world so maybe

00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:24,419
you can tell us what you do know do you

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:25,680
want to tell us what you do maybe you

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:38,880
can quickly go over what this is

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:42,840
actually this screen is the texts that

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:53,160
it got let's try one more time can you

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:55,320
tell us what you do so it's an open

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,630
source intelligent in quotation marks

00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,389
couse it is obviously still pretty dumb

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:04,229
a system that you can train and extend

00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:08,460
yourself um you might know or use Siri

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:11,700
or Alexa or M which is still in beta

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:15,780
there's many many things like that come

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,820
up in the last little while and they're

00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,430
all kind of still like black boxes and

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:24,090
this thing you can teach your own

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,250
language and also extent with plugins

00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:29,340
written in html5 and JavaScript it's

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:33,539
pretty cool the whole thing actually is

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:39,630
written in JavaScript and I'm gonna go

00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:40,800
into the tech in a little bit okay when

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,710
you don't know what else to say you just

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:53,130
talk about weather hey what's the

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:54,659
weather like dramatic pause so this is

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:58,940
actually an example for a plugin it's

00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:58,940
using plain gyah create simple weather

00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:05,460
now you can also ask for a city please

00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,010
don't need a city because yahoo doesn't

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,090
allow to ask for anything else anymore

00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:14,340
and for I think the next little bit I

00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:17,219
might need a volunteer but let me first

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,020
show you what you're getting into

00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:27,320
I brought another mic that you can use

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:27,320
and we'll try is it stubborn for you

00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:52,130
this is the only evil robot joke in this

00:06:48,330 --> 00:07:06,570
talk I'm gonna not do any other ones

00:06:52,130 --> 00:07:08,940
cool what's the weather like cool and

00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:36,120
maybe the last thing is you can actually

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:39,120
look up general things like cool so we

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,760
can do three things if I have a

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,169
volunteer that wants to try it out we

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:54,620
can go through the process and see what

00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:54,620
happens this is you know this is like so

00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:13,410
let's let's see if it works so maybe

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,410
start with you

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:50,529
see this thing makes me way better jokes

00:08:46,660 --> 00:09:05,019
than me all right let's figure out the

00:08:50,529 --> 00:09:10,660
weather so the cool thing about this is

00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:27,399
that you get say hey this is not right

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:31,240
I'm gonna teach you a new thing all

00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,750
right now the most the most interesting

00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,750
part is

00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:49,380
so what is the answer to the universe

00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:56,640
everything

00:09:49,380 --> 00:10:16,470
oh let's try what is the answer to life

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:18,710
the universe and everything so as you

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,710
see

00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:50,929
Thank You max all right this actually

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,089
turned out way more entertaining than I

00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:55,339
thought it would be

00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:57,259
now before we look on under the hood on

00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:04,480
what's happening yes let's talk for a

00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:04,480
couple minutes about the technology so

00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:38,809
it's a natural language processing

00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,220
libraries per node it has like some

00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:43,339
basic things like

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:49,639
tokenization of a sentence it also has

00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:53,379
basic classification and that was cool

00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,379
but the classification runs on

00:11:53,499 --> 00:12:00,199
statistical analysis and I thought it

00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:01,399
would be an interesting exercise because

00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:05,379
I've been watching too many movies

00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:08,379
yeah to hook it up to a neural network

00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:08,379
yesterday

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:25,830
so you can use that to put sentences in

00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:29,360
to train it with certain sentences and

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:31,620
then get label them and get

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,610
probabilities back that I put something

00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:39,510
else so typical um yeah neural network

00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:41,400
machine learning thing now I know this

00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,380
isn't feathers is another thing I mean

00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:51,330
and I know this talk is not about

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:52,500
feathers but I can't just and I think it

00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,990
also covers something that's that's

00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,750
still kind of important and not done

00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,080
that often which is how do we make

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:07,080
machine learning data available publicly

00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:09,390
right I mean Siri and light box

00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,920
citizen living room but how do you how

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,840
do you make it publicly available and

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,930
not just within SDK but actually has an

00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,820
API so what feathers does it's kind of

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:21,660
like a small library on top of Express

00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:24,570
that lets you create and consume rests

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,520
and real-time API and that's it so you

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:28,200
can pick whichever that database you

00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,330
want you can pick whichever front-end

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,950
technology one it's just this connector

00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:35,640
in between and what this basically does

00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:38,280
in this case is gives us a database

00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:41,220
connection just to store stuff it's

00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,840
using any DB because the whole thing

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,500
will it's running in a browser right now

00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:49,140
but it also can run an electron so that

00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,580
means that we don't want people to

00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:54,030
install MongoDB and stuff like that it's

00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,560
just a file based database and and then

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,900
it also provides the connection because

00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,390
it also works in the Kline between the

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,910
front-end app and the backend and then

00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:04,150
we have election react steel which is a

00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,560
module loaded

00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:07,960
throwing stuff dynamically without

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,520
having to build it I needed that for the

00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:13,380
plug-in system which will hopefully have

00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:18,610
some time to look into cool um so

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:20,920
there's two three hmm hey that's my man

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,950
someone always changed so there's a

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,210
couple things to it the first one and I

00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,850
don't even think I have to blow that up

00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:29,470
because this queen is huge maybe a

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:34,930
little bit

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:36,610
the first one is actions an action is

00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:49,090
basically something that you want it to

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:51,460
do if you haven't met a sentence try and

00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:54,010
pull out something that's similar so in

00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:57,850
our case of the two tag goes from

00:14:54,010 --> 00:15:01,090
position 4 to 4 which is your

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:04,120
so if somebody says can you hi there my

00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:06,130
name is it'll usually try and pull out

00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,760
the information around that sense this

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:11,020
is actually a pretty dumb algorithm but

00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,880
it works so well because the

00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:14,800
classification of the neural network is

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,530
so accurate that you don't have to worry

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,650
about the sentences being so different

00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,820
so this is how it gets where what's the

00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,680
weather in Vancouver and things like

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:27,160
that

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:31,360
then we have something here reply with a

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:35,430
couple of things and this is the search

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,840
of course this has been done by people

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:40,450
way smarter than me already and there's

00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:43,120
an API for it and a really cool one

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:45,670
actually that I hope I have some time to

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,760
show a little bit so this is actions

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:52,620
there's only 11 of them and then the

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,620
next part of the thing we have is

00:15:53,160 --> 00:16:00,870
trainings so you know people always

00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,870
think that millions and millions

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:15,990
well it's somewhat accurate

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:18,770
so this basically maps text to an action

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:22,860
every time we make a new classification

00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:25,770
it'll save you when it's not sure it'll

00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:30,180
save and Retraining put that one so that

00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:33,200
every time master and the action is

00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,200
basically just the action

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:46,260
oh sorry it's all good I'm gonna go back

00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:50,130
here then I thought this one this one

00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:54,480
did work sorry about that

00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:57,209
okay so this sounds better so now we

00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,779
have actions and trainings the last part

00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:03,029
of the API actually is the interesting

00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:05,400
one which is the classification and

00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:08,339
classification is basically you can just

00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,309
post to this classify endpoint with your

00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:13,110
actual text so if you say can you tell

00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:15,510
us the weather in Berlin and they send

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:19,970
this it'll come back with something like

00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:23,850
this the texts the tokens tokens are

00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:27,030
just each individual word stems are

00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:28,710
interesting this is basically the base

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:31,170
form of the word so that if you have

00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:33,570
singular plural it doesn't matter

00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:36,030
or if you have other languages that add

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,350
a lot of things at the end of words you

00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,950
want to know what the actual word is

00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:45,450
about so that's pretty useful and by the

00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:47,790
way this should ideally also work with

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:49,080
other languages I tried it briefly with

00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:51,690
German I unfortunately didn't have

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,750
enough time but because it's all based

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:57,300
on word stems and neural networks you

00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,710
can train it in your own language if it

00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,679
is possible too

00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:03,419
if no natural has a stammer for it so it

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,150
can build the bit create the base forms

00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:08,400
over work cool this is the action that

00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:12,000
it created basically it creates a new

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,350
action for us and this is the confidence

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,580
so it's actually pretty confident

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:17,730
already because we've done it many times

00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:20,610
there's 96 percent confident that this

00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:23,160
is what I want and this is the original

00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:26,309
action that it got trained with now if

00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,910
you look back into the browser you'll

00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,910
see that

00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,840
it's yeah there we go

00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:44,840
you'll see that it updated and browsers

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:48,110
already now it still has to bend at

00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:54,170
humans land on the moon in it's pretty

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:56,780
warm in Berlin alright so what happens

00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,670
in the background is let's make this a

00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,230
little bigger too because this is where

00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:03,590
the action machine learning part happens

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:08,390
you'll see here it gives us a list of

00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:10,850
labels to values and those are the

00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,860
confidences of what action you want to

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,630
perform so we'll see here there's a

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:18,410
whole bunch of them that are like less

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:20,600
than one lesson way less than 10% but

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,280
this one is 92 percent and this is

00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,610
exactly the one that we wanted it to do

00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,230
so that was really cool to see under the

00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:39,790
hood and how it gets better the more you

00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:42,380
train it alright give me back my browser

00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:44,600
let's briefly look at how to build a

00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:49,030
plugin because I found it really

00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:51,679
important to make it almost as easy as

00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:56,720
even though jQuery is not used as much

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:59,059
anymore it's still the creating a plugin

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,460
for it was the easiest thing you could

00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:05,840
ever do and I really like that so a

00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:09,350
plugin basically has a client and a

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,960
server file and on the server in our

00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:13,460
case for this one I'm gonna actually

00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,730
show you first what this plug-in is

00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:18,620
about this is the looking up information

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:21,770
on the internet and it's using Wolfram

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:25,790
Alpha which is by the people that also

00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:28,880
made Mathematica and it's a knowledge

00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:30,920
engine so instead of things like google

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,990
it that looks up relevant links for you

00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,920
it actually tries to get the meaning

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:38,050
from what you ask it so when did people

00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:42,080
land

00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:45,530
the moon it'll give us way more oops way

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,200
more information then what we got back

00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:50,570
in the answer but you'll basically get

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,850
the same the same things so this is

00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:57,820
pretty cool because I didn't have to do

00:20:52,850 --> 00:21:00,800
it you just used the API and then

00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:06,080
display it on the client so what we did

00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:09,740
here was use the node API plug-in create

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,470
a new client with the app ID this is

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:16,430
only a test API key if you want to use

00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:18,590
it and then it will create a new feather

00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:21,380
service it's kind of like a a middleware

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:25,160
except for that it has a crud object

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:28,070
that you pass and in this create so if

00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:31,040
you post or call create will create a

00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:33,200
query with grab the query from the data

00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:37,820
and then just get the result from the

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,560
client and return it back so this is

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,020
just an API endpoint just like the

00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:45,410
classified service that we posted to and

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:48,440
on the client we have the same feathers

00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:52,520
app but two additional things one is

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:54,860
learn so when you saw the I don't know

00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,510
what you're talking about screen you can

00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,670
basically add things to the drop-down

00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:01,490
and say okay now tell me the weather now

00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:03,590
do this and now do that you can create

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:06,440
your own forms and submit your own data

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,930
in here and then we have the actual

00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:10,910
actions so when the action is certain

00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:15,440
enough so when so more than 50% sure

00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:19,750
it'll just perform the action and what

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:23,030
we do here is pretty much get the text

00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:25,970
make a query here to our service that we

00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,770
created on the server so the cool thing

00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,630
about this is that it's fine agnostic

00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:34,850
now so we could also put it on our

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:37,370
mobile phones or mobile apps or electron

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:40,940
which is what it's going to run in as

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:43,460
the distributable and then we have the

00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:46,940
results and just print the main or

00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:49,520
primary primary result oh and then so

00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:50,570
that's pretty much it and then and then

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,130
this is a plug

00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,899
tear down function so you just clear it

00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:56,509
out so you can use whatever technology

00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:58,880
you want you get all the information

00:22:56,509 --> 00:23:00,889
that it got trained with and then you

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,100
can perform whichever actions you you

00:23:00,889 --> 00:23:07,759
would like so that was pretty fun and

00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:10,460
and this once I had the whole system in

00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:14,179
place was actually really quick to do

00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:20,049
and I spent like a whole afternoon

00:23:14,179 --> 00:23:20,049
asking it random questions all right so

00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:27,259
that this whole project started as I

00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:31,490
should have to remember to stay here

00:23:27,259 --> 00:23:33,559
this whole project started as a demo for

00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:36,289
the Calgary meetup that I hauled from

00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:38,750
the front moved to Vancouver and we

00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:41,830
wanted to just show hey here's some

00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:44,210
things that you can do with feathers and

00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:47,240
let's let's try and use some AI so we

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:49,730
build a collaborative gesture teaching

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,700
app which was really cool

00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:55,399
it was a clunky but it worked and the

00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,500
next step was to go into the nest

00:23:55,399 --> 00:24:00,590
language processing and I couldn't find

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,070
anything related to it except for the no

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:06,919
natural library for for JavaScript and

00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:09,679
there's only two personal assistant

00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:13,100
projects similar there is serious which

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:16,039
is a research project that tries to do

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,710
much more like make sense of photos and

00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:22,639
learn from everything not just language

00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:25,990
stuff and Jasper I think which is a

00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:29,539
Python app that's built to run on your

00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:31,610
Raspberry Pi or device like that and

00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:34,399
this one on the other hand I do really

00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:39,440
like to have as a desktop app and a web

00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:41,419
app and it worked really well as a demo

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:48,080
and and then I just continue working on

00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:50,539
it to continue working on it and three

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,750
weeks ago I was hacking away and I was

00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:55,970
teaching in new things and it recognized

00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,539
them and when it didn't then I showed it

00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,860
new things and all of a sudden went and

00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:03,000
once it learned a little more it was

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,030
really weird cuz

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,310
it got less and less sure of things that

00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:10,890
had learned before so if I said thank

00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:13,200
you it would be like I'm only 20 percent

00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:15,630
sure you want me to say you're welcome

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,850
and that was really weird because you

00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,620
know as a programmer we used to for

00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,590
programming it in once and it'll like

00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:28,110
just work forever so I try to figure out

00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:31,700
what the problem is and I think sorry

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:34,590
it's really helpful sometimes to have a

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,870
non programmer sounding board because

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,690
then you have to explain it in different

00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:41,390
terms and when I did that I said so I

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,490
built this thing and it works

00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:46,230
but it's super confused with the old

00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:49,140
stuff the new stuff it knows really well

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:50,880
but the old stuff it doesn't and we

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,560
talked about it was like Dave you

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,310
accidentally build Marvin the Paranoid

00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,780
Android and and and that was really

00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:59,310
interesting because the programmer right

00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,110
you always like okay a program at him

00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:04,410
once and it'll work and I get mad if it

00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:06,750
doesn't work even with Siri you're like

00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:10,830
cursing Apple because they didn't get

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:13,020
what you wanted to do and that was the

00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:15,150
case here too the problem was no

00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,710
positive reinforcement it was I was only

00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:20,010
telling it when he was wrong what else

00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:24,480
it was supposed to do so that was really

00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:26,370
interesting for me to learn that you

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,860
have to treat it less like programming

00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:31,440
and more like teaching a person or

00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:34,050
teaching someone which was really cool

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,480
for me to see because I think in the

00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:38,400
near future we might be you know

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,630
teaching our software as much as we

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,940
program them and looking at where those

00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,590
data are stored how they're shared and

00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,680
where they're coming from is gonna be

00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:51,660
come more and more important and just

00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,060
like we meet better operating systems

00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,400
with at least making parts of it

00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:58,860
open-source I think there should be a

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:02,070
way for training data for machine

00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:03,780
learning to be shareable as well there

00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:06,750
is not even a shareable format neural

00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,460
networks work various have a fairly

00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:12,210
similar architecture in most programming

00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:16,200
languages and there isn't a standardized

00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,950
format yet to to to exchange it so if I

00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,740
train it

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,830
Google's tensorflow I can't drop it into

00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,059
brain js2 use it in the browser and I

00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,190
think that's gonna be going to be pretty

00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,980
important in the future and I find it

00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:31,409
pretty exciting because it's well it's

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,419
way more unpredictable but that's how

00:27:31,409 --> 00:27:36,990
our work is every day anyway

00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:39,059
and working with the computer the same

00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:41,279
way we work with other people I find

00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:43,740
pretty exciting and one thing I want to

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:47,279
work on a little more is turn this into

00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:49,080
a fancy generator that just scaffolds

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,899
you app by asking you a couple questions

00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:54,330
it's a pretty basic step but it will

00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:57,059
make things a lot easier because you can

00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:59,909
actually interact more instead of going

00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:02,279
through a command line and yeah if you

00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:04,830
interest in this as well come chapter me

00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:08,659
this is it for me and thanks everybody

00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,659
