Description: 
	Since its creation in 2010, the npm website has gone on quite an adventure. Oh, the stories it could tell! From its humble beginnings as a pioneer node application without a single line of client-side JavaScript to its current state as a full-fledged web application with front-end and backend frameworks, this site has seen it all. Learn from our successes as well as our mistakes as I take you on a journey of lessons learned over the past 2.5 years (and counting)!
