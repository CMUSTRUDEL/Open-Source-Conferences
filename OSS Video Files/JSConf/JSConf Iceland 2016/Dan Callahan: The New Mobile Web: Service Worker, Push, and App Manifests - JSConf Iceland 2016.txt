Description: 
	Compared to native apps, mobile websites have historically been at a disadvantage: no installation, no push notifications, and they only work when you're online. This year, that changed. Browser vendors have worked together to implement open standards that address each of these shortcomings. This session examines how the Service Worker, Push, and App Manifest specifications fill the gap between web and native.
