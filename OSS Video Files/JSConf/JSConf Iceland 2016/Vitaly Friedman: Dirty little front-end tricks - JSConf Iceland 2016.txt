Publication date: 2016-09-16
Playlist: JSConf Iceland 2016
Description: 
	Do you love the object tag, too? How do you feel about responsive image maps? Have you ever tried to work around complex tables, nasty carousels, endless country selectors and complex user interfaces? Well, let’s bring it on!

In this talk, Vitaly Friedman, editor-in-chief of Smashing Magazine, will present dirty practical techniques and clever ideas developed in actual real-life projects, and use many examples to illustrate how we can solve problems smarter and faster. Please take the techniques with a grain of salt. Beware: you will not be able to unlearn what you’ll learn in the session!

thank you thank you so hello everyone

00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:19,779
this is going to be interesting

00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:22,510
apparently many people like a dirty B

00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:24,520
front end and C tricks so that's pretty

00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,990
cool now it's not going to be easy

00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,880
because you know I don't want to do the

00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,710
hard work so you you're going to do the

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,720
hard work the way we're going to do it

00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,239
because they are really dirty I have to

00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:38,350
warn you first the things are going to

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,510
see you will not be able to unsee and I

00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,489
don't take any credit or responsibility

00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,910
of what happens next once you saw them

00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:48,309
right they are really bad like seriously

00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,620
bad so we'll see how it goes now the way

00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:51,039
it's going to go just to be a bit more

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,059
fun

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,920
I brought some chocolate with me so I'm

00:00:55,059 --> 00:00:58,239
going to post challenges and we're going

00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,460
to probably cover like 10 or 15

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,620
challenges and if you think that you

00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,230
have a good idea just shout and I'll try

00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,780
my best to throw the little piece of

00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,909
chocolate at you I don't take any credit

00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,430
or responsibility of whether I hit you

00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:17,409
or not right again but this is going to

00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:18,970
be fun alright so let's go now this is

00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:20,979
me this is how you stole flag back in

00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,689
the day things do change over time I

00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:24,610
currently do live in Vilnius in the

00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:26,649
Vienna which is why this check out is

00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,299
from Vilnius Lithuania but I'm still

00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:29,920
editing most of the stuff and smashing

00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:31,540
and also I do a lot of consultancy these

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,299
days they spend a lot of time in

00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,100
companies and companies real fun

00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:38,259
sometimes especially the enterprise-e

00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,509
corporate and you know this kind of

00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:41,710
thing because they tend up to find to

00:01:40,509 --> 00:01:44,320
kind of come up with really interesting

00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:47,680
pragmatic solutions to anything right

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,439
people can solve everything seriously in

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,649
a interesting creative way so let's see

00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:55,380
all right you ready that doesn't sound

00:01:53,649 --> 00:02:00,850
very exciting you have to talk to me

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:02,409
already all right this is better all

00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,320
right so let's have some simple stuff

00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:08,530
that's not too complicated I think so

00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,720
here's the task for you right so what if

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,510
you need to nest one link inside another

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,100
for example inside notes footnotes or

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,110
articles when you want the entire

00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,480
excerpt to be linked but you also want

00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,160
the excerpt to contain potentially

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,290
contain links which lead to another site

00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,010
right so you might encounter things like

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,230
that

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,209
right I have a product image maybe or

00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,849
product description so you have a block

00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,500
of text right which is a link but at the

00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:34,810
same time you might have links inside of

00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,239
that paragraph which should stay links

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:41,530
as well now how would you do it without

00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:46,930
JavaScript can you have nested links in

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:48,849
HTML that's not very clear to me at this

00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,540
point so if you say yes you have to tell

00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:59,739
the eye how you do it

00:02:51,540 --> 00:03:01,659
anybody button and an anchor inside not

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:02,409
sure about that okay somebody said

00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:07,769
object

00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:07,769
who said object all right so here we go

00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,150
I'm trying my best here come on

00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:14,379
seriously so there are many solutions

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,400
right so one thing that we could do

00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:17,379
potentially is of course use

00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,690
position:absolute to put the link on top

00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:21,159
of the paragraph and also use that index

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,200
to kind of make it work

00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,450
but you know we can use object type

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,069
because it's fancier why well if we

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,019
actually try to nest a link inside of

00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:30,849
another link what browser is going to do

00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:32,319
is assume that you're stupid and it's

00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,209
going to close the first thing for you

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,799
but it's not going to reopen it so in

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:37,660
the end you end up with this part of the

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,730
paragraph not being a link anymore right

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:42,849
which is the problem now we can solve it

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:45,910
why well how well by just putting up the

00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:48,069
anchor inside of the object tag why the

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,079
hell would you do that because object

00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:52,299
behaves very much like SVG or iframe if

00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:54,310
you think if you like so the browser

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,430
will actually just ignore whatever is

00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,560
inside so it won't say it's so dirty

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,329
everything that's inside objects so

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,889
dirty I'm not even going to touch it so

00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:05,199
I'm going to keep it as it is so it's

00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:06,790
going to work just as expected right now

00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,079
I don't say that this is cool and this

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,970
is you there's something that you should

00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,530
do but it's useful to know this because

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,970
if you encounter situation when you

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,280
can't use JavaScript for some reason

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,159
kind of close link opening closing

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,859
opening then you can actually use it and

00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:24,789
in fact if you want to make it work

00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:27,400
in older ie you can use conditional

00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:28,570
comments inside object which is probably

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,849
the worst thing I ever said in my life

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,469
but you know this does work and if you

00:04:30,849 --> 00:04:34,090
feel really comfortable with this or

00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:35,560
uncomfortable you can look at the

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,480
kittens if you do feel comfortable you

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,790
can read the entire article which

00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,920
the entire thing or again you can just

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:45,040
use position:absolute on top of the

00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:48,250
paragraph but object is really awesome

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,230
for two reasons actually first of all

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,930
because everybody hates it and second of

00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:55,060
all because you can actually embed SVG's

00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,280
in a very smart way now there are many

00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,950
ways of embedding SVG on the page right

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,450
um you can do it in line you can you

00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:03,250
know you can just use image source and

00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:06,190
background image and so on but have you

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:10,480
tried to embed an SVG file on the page

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,260
using the object tag this is awesome

00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,970
right

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,620
why well first of all if you actually

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,360
embed it in the regular way just by

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:20,050
using image source or background I'm

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,240
kind of cold and sorry dense kind of

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,180
blocks as access to the SVG path so if

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,620
we have an SVG on SVG file it contains

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,720
some paths that we want to you know

00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,580
change the thickness of or change the

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,100
color we can't do it if we embed it this

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,720
way right we can inline it but then it's

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,940
not cacheable which is a problem we can

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:42,160
also base64 it but it's again the same

00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:44,380
story so what can we do well this is the

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,600
best thing we can do sitting by actually

00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:48,670
so we can embed it as inside of the

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,370
object tag using just a proper type

00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:54,280
attribute and then inside of the object

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,590
SVG thing inside of the SVG file we can

00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,050
use media queries and JavaScript and CSS

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:02,430
and whatever you like and this CSS can

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:05,740
be styling can actually style the actual

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,570
path on whatever we have in the SVG just

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,700
you know on hover or whatever whatever

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:13,630
you want to do now this works really

00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,100
well in even in those old browsers right

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,440
that's pretty cool

00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,330
it's good to know that we can use that

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,710
all right here's another one now by

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,450
default we know I mean we're going to

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,430
have lots of them so get ready

00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:26,410
by default broken images look freaking

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,180
spectacular right so if there is

00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:31,360
actually any way to improve the

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:34,300
experience by changing the styling if

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,410
images are actually broken right because

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,050
this is what we're getting most of the

00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,250
time if an image cannot be loaded then

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,280
we're going to get this little

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:45,210
placeholder finger with a broken image

00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:49,629
inside it does not very you know cool

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:54,099
can you change it how

00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:58,639
mm okay tough drop I see who said that

00:06:54,099 --> 00:07:00,080
okay I'm pretty good today I'm seriously

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,939
right so here's the interesting part

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,499
that you need to know now the image

00:07:01,939 --> 00:07:04,909
element if you look in the spec you'll

00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:06,589
find lots of really interesting stuff in

00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:08,809
there the image element is a so-called

00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:11,059
replaced element it's an element whose

00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:13,189
appearance and dimensions are defined by

00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:15,020
an external resource make sense however

00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:17,839
absolute elements should not work on it

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,699
unless the image cannot be lauded so

00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,069
even the image can not be lauded the

00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:24,169
before and after two tournaments will be

00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:26,719
applied and they will not be applied if

00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:29,210
an image is loaded right so we can do

00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,639
all kind of starting to improve the

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,399
experience of the you know broken images

00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,319
without doing too much at this point and

00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,059
it just works we just apply before and

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,919
after to image and voila you're done I

00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:46,610
see a lot of excitement in here it's

00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:48,889
great it's going great right so this

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,419
works really well okay but maybe this is

00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:52,129
not too practical so let's talk about

00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:54,020
something really practical something

00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:57,559
that you probably should be using every

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,599
single day on every single project so we

00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:01,699
like fluid type right and we often have

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,439
to implement fluid typography to make

00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:05,449
sure that everything scales up and down

00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,959
beautifully as designers intend to do it

00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:10,459
right now how do we do it well if you

00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,860
wanted to be really fluid you will

00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:15,800
probably tighten up the font size

00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,479
together with the VH OVW unit right so

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,719
all the time whenever the browser is

00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:22,969
Croesus the window whenever the browser

00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:25,430
window increases you also will have the

00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:27,409
increase in the font size it's great but

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,779
then you know it can even grow

00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:31,669
infinitely and it can become very very

00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:33,649
small which is kind of not what we want

00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:35,959
we want to have nice boundaries right

00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:37,880
this is what would love to achieve and

00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:39,889
we wanted to be reduced kind of scale up

00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,349
and down nicely but not necessarily

00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:45,110
proportionally just growing like nuts or

00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:47,540
getting smaller we wanted to be kind of

00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,829
in control now the problem is following

00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,079
now we could use something like this

00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:55,160
right okay just set the font size being

00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:58,339
the calc of 1 M plus 1 plus 1 BW right

00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,920
we we double use of course 1% of the

00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:02,870
viewport width right now that works but

00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,080
then in that case 1 am why do we

00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:08,360
it well because we want to have kind of

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,360
minimum font size right that's okay

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,730
that helps us but not quite now now we

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,940
can do something like this when we just

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,830
included like for VW and for the agent

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,890
to be mean for example and we'll all

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:24,830
scale up and down but what if we're

00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,839
talking about the pro graphics scale we

00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,820
don't just want something to grow we

00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:32,000
want to have a specific kind of not

00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,040
breakpoints but specific docking points

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,339
where the type will grow to wards so

00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:39,800
converge towards right so what if we

00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,660
wanted to choose a font size of 16

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,029
pixels at the screen resolution of 400

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:48,050
pixels and then we wanted to transition

00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:55,430
to 24 pixels at a resolution of 800 can

00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:56,900
we do it without the break point a lot

00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,460
of excitement in the room oh great all

00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,410
right no but seriously can indeed have

00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,510
any like a problem like this before or

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:05,300
design a country wants to have a nice

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:09,200
typographic scale like 1/3 or minus 3rd

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,360
or whatever and you have to build it how

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:20,029
would you build it so it scales down and

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:21,589
are beautifully everywhere no don't have

00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:23,839
but no actually it's a bit more

00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:27,589
complicated I just need to use a little

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,779
formula to make it work so that a second

00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:31,580
that's okay that's okay it's going to

00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:33,800
fun in reality it's not that complicated

00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,540
so of course what do you have again we

00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,850
have a special boundary I say between

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,660
400 pixels and 800 pixels and you have a

00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:43,490
specific size like growth between

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,740
starting font size and final font size

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:48,440
right so you just plug it in here you've

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,000
got kind of the maximum subscreen size

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,470
minus minimum screen size where you're

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,720
talking about like the spectrum that

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:57,490
you're walking at and then here at this

00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:01,190
point you're kind of subtracting 100%

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,990
100 PW minus 4 horn pixels at this point

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,540
you are getting to the area like what is

00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:08,000
where am I either lower lower boundary

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,680
or in the upper boundary right and then

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,120
you multiply it with difference between

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,010
the maximum font size and mean font size

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,310
and you add the minimum font size and

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,310
you're done

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:20,499
that's really not complicated right so

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,999
the only thing you have to do is you

00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:24,100
have to define all these four values

00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:28,540
you've set them and you're done right

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:30,369
and then this is what it looks like so

00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:34,240
you have your modular scale right

00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:35,800
and all these headings including

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,959
typography like the body copy as well

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,879
are just going to flew it and kind of

00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:41,889
grow naturally without you having to do

00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:43,720
anything without even single media query

00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:45,399
and without flexbox without anything

00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,949
just with one little property that's

00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,269
really cool right we actually published

00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:51,309
an article about this which you can also

00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:53,920
read on so in just in case you're

00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:56,470
wondering calc is really damn good well

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,050
supported except you know who but we're

00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,420
used to it right but this is not quite

00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:05,920
what you want sometimes I mean that's

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:08,050
cool if you can just grow and and if the

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,119
font size can grow and actually become

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,339
smaller but what about the line height

00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:14,230
because as we know from the Fogg Rafi

00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:17,350
the smaller the font sizes or the small

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,910
the line lengths is the small the line

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,449
height should be as well and the other

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,360
way around

00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:24,279
the largest their length is the taller

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,660
the line height should be as well can we

00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:28,839
fix that maybe you want to have

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,119
something like this right automatically

00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,829
without JavaScript without too many you

00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:34,869
know fancy mate we're breaking points

00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:37,329
just we want it to be fluid and just

00:12:34,869 --> 00:12:39,040
right again we have the same problem

00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:41,019
exactly right we have these two

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,179
boundaries let's say we have a minimum

00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:45,189
line height one point free at some point

00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:47,290
if it's smaller than that it's just not

00:12:45,189 --> 00:12:49,480
going to work well right and also if

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,490
you're going to worry above 1.5 it's

00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,160
going to be too wide right so we have

00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,049
this nice boundary between 1.3 and 1 to

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,699
5 and we just need to define where it's

00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:59,769
going to operate so it's going to

00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:01,869
operate maybe in a layout between 21 mm

00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:05,379
sent to 35 amps you plug it in the

00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:07,299
formula you do a little bit of math

00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:10,149
right you plug it's the formula and

00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:12,069
you're done it's exactly the same story

00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:14,889
just for the line height we're here

00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:18,040
we've got we got the full range of

00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:20,170
paragraph width in here 35 minus 21 then

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,910
some point in here we we just look at

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,709
the account we need to open numerator to

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,569
see how close we are to the upper

00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:27,160
boundary and then we also need to

00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:28,480
multiply it with the difference in terms

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,110
of wine height to get to this proper

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,959
factor

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:33,760
and then we also add the minimum phone

00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:36,430
line height at this point and we're done

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:38,500
right and that's really really amazing

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,170
and in the end you get this which

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:46,050
without media queries again without

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:46,050
flexbox without anything it just works

00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,579
right and if you actually make the

00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,990
window a little bit smaller please

00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,579
whatever yes that's okay we saw it

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:02,490
already

00:13:56,579 --> 00:14:04,690
just move on I'll get the life yes/no or

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,510
whatever but it will actually work as

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,709
expected all right here's the next one

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:11,380
so how do you make sure that a

00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:13,660
multi-column table both a row and a

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:15,790
column are highlighted on hava and on

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,370
tap now highlighting the current draw is

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,200
easy we can just use TR hover but what

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,450
about the column this is what we want

00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,410
right we want to be able to kind of tap

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,820
on 22 and we want both the column and

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:35,769
the role to be highlighted without

00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:37,690
JavaScript who was that okay not my best

00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:38,860
one yeah we can just use two the ones

00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:41,170
because this is the best thing you can

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,820
have in CSS so this has a few magical

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,130
properties which just work everywhere

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,800
and like like amazing area all the time

00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:49,959
apes or elements and be flexbox if you

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,910
can't do something with in CSS try

00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:53,800
flexbox if it doesn't work try more

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,510
flags box if it still has a more type

00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,339
Sedonas this is my strategy for

00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,740
everything I'm sorry I succeeded so far

00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:01,620
so please try the two now how can we do

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,540
it with two elements without JavaScript

00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,430
all right this is really nasty maybe you

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,279
should not be using CSS for this but you

00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,899
can write so we can create huge pseudo

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,329
and on top of that table that we have

00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:16,269
with a negative top value of half of

00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:19,029
that value then we hide the pseudo

00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:20,769
elements with overflow:hidden put on the

00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:22,300
table then we use negative that in next

00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:25,120
we can actually copy paste the content

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:29,470
and we've got it and then we can of

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,910
course also use make also focus upon

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,699
focus that montage start maybe with a

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:36,390
bit of JavaScript right but when I saw

00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:39,010
this for the first time in my life I

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:41,649
literally freaked out and even cried a

00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,970
little bit just a little bit because you

00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,800
can apply to the element

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,660
to the classes and can apply to the

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,120
classism to the elements can apply to

00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,170
the elements and to the elements

00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,699
probably and it can apply to the

00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,379
classroom see the classes so at this

00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:55,240
point what we're creating is we have

00:15:53,379 --> 00:15:56,769
this table creating huge through the

00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,509
element that covers the entire table

00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:00,399
with a width of hundred percent because

00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:01,689
this is the maximum width right and with

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,069
the height well we don't know what it's

00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:04,990
going to be so we set it in ten thousand

00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:06,850
pixels then we actually just move it all

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,769
up to minus five thousand pixels so it's

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,329
kind of centered and then we use you

00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:12,009
know we put it to the left well just so

00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:13,300
it's you know just to be sure and then

00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:15,459
we use background color current color

00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,529
just because we can and then we can use

00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:20,290
that index minus one so we kind of push

00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:23,470
the content to the top so above the

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:25,810
table so we can copy/paste it and we're

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:29,620
done right and we can also of course

00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:31,389
apply to th as well if we want to it's

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,310
actually really simple now you don't

00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:35,829
need to ask you for that right that's

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:37,000
pretty cool now this is not that bad

00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:42,579
this is not too dirty

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:45,519
let's talk dirty so who has a pleasure

00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:49,059
of eventually building email layouts

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:51,639
maybe responsive email layouts a few

00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:53,680
people so these people who are building

00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:56,550
responsive emails can you please come

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,410
after the talk in here so we can hug you

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:00,519
because this is really really bad I mean

00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,199
this is really really difficult now

00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,089
first of all it's not because you know

00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:05,589
we don't have proper CSS support not

00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,449
because we don't have proper job oh we

00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,100
don't have JavaScript at all images are

00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:10,390
not loaded usually what if alt and we

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:14,230
have to deal with things like Outlook

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,699
and other very similar creatures which

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,699
is no fun at all and you want to make it

00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:20,230
responsive good luck because Google

00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,419
Gmail does not support media queries

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,400
because of security reasons they say but

00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:26,020
they will know if they are not intending

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,640
to support media queries so how would

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,100
you then build a responsive email that

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:31,600
works well in Gmail now especially if

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,980
you know if you're opening an email that

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,630
looks broken it's not like you're going

00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,179
to go to desktop to seen in defense of

00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:40,630
you you're just deleting it right so

00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:42,340
well let's be fix it in fact when you're

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,750
talking about responsive email it feels

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,370
like we're really going back in time

00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,429
when things used to be

00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:50,409
you know mmm ie 6 & 7 & 8 things like

00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:52,630
that because most of the time still

00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:55,390
today although every second almost every

00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,919
second email is opened on mobile

00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,710
they still

00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:00,640
most of the time so email designers and

00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,159
developers to come up with very

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,770
interesting techniques including

00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:07,330
background coloring for example because

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,580
images are not loaded by default except

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:11,980
if it's Gmail so they will be covering

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,390
kind of coloring the background cell

00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,779
because of course you're using table

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:18,549
layouts at this point just in case table

00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:20,559
layout so we can actually color every

00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:22,330
cell now sometimes you can be really

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,100
creative with it I was working with a

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,360
guy who was in a project but it was

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,370
really important for them to actually

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,649
display an image even if image is not

00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:34,179
displayed or cannot be displayed in

00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:35,590
email client hmm so it was really really

00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:37,179
important like it was a button it

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,860
couldn't be just a button obviously it

00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:40,870
couldn't be just you know itself it

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,880
should had to be an image that had to be

00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,950
displayed they came up with really

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,289
interesting idea again you will never

00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,770
forget this but of course you can

00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:57,610
transform or convert an image into an

00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:59,260
HTML table by you know for every pixel

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,990
that you have in an image you can

00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,330
convert it into 1 x 1 TD with that

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:07,480
background color it's going to be a big

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:09,730
huge HTML of course but if you set it if

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:12,669
you do it right and you put an anchor

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:18,250
around that table it will work in

00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:22,120
Outlook right so this is what people

00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:24,159
come up with now this is really bad I'm

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,720
not encouraging you to do it but just in

00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:27,130
case you need to do it some people can

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,590
come up with really interesting ideas

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,600
right so this is like you know but we

00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,950
can do some stuff because we have type

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,080
of properties that actually behave

00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,779
properly so we can do you know if you

00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,270
have let's say if you have let's say

00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:43,750
like to here four columns

00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:45,640
I think of six no no here four and here

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,980
- right if you want to move from four to

00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,630
two columns you know with tables we can

00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,610
do this we just have to display them as

00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,380
block instead of table cell and set the

00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,940
width properly right if we want to kind

00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,220
of move the columns around we can also

00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:58,990
do this by just using the table header

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,640
open table footer group properties there

00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,549
are four of them there will footer group

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,929
table header group table caption and

00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:06,789
table cell of course and something else

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:08,409
and the interesting part is if you look

00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:10,330
into the spec and it's probably the best

00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:12,400
thing you can do like spec is

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,770
best evening lecture you can have right

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,540
it's so fascinating sometimes because

00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,910
you know with flexbox we can reorder

00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:21,610
components or reorder kind of things in

00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,900
the layout and Dom that's great but we

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,850
could do that with table properties as

00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,430
well because if we have let's say free

00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:30,070
problem three elements a b c and we want

00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:31,510
to have we can't use media queries for

00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,090
example for gmail but we want to

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:36,730
reshuffle them or reorder them to be a c

00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:40,720
we just have to define B as stable

00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:42,880
footer header group a as table cell and

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,010
C a stable food group and they're going

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,750
to reshuffle because the header always

00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,580
lives above the table the food always

00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,860
seems below the table and table cell in

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,780
between and table caption between the

00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,820
table cell and table for the group right

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,650
so we can reshuffle up to four elements

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:58,270
in a very high can dirty way if we want

00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,770
to make it work for you know all the

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,570
clients so that's great we're going to

00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,250
use these kind of things everywhere and

00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:06,670
sometimes you also need to use of course

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,840
this little thingy well just in case

00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,130
you're wondering just for Yahoo because

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,650
they are otherwise doesn't understand

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:13,390
classes so we need to put it in the

00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:16,780
attribute selector so that's kind of

00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:18,760
nice in a way but this is what you will

00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,140
end up with in the end right but this is

00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:24,100
not quite what we want because we want

00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:26,260
to make it work in Gmail so let's say we

00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,120
have a four column layout and a large

00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,340
screen we want to make it two columns in

00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,230
a small screen on a small screen or

00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,030
maybe even simpler we have two columns

00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,770
from large screen and one column on the

00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:38,920
small screen right we just want to stack

00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:42,870
things in Gmail today we can make it

00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,870
work or do you know how to make it work

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,350
now this is really really bad I mean

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,840
people who watch me at this point will

00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:52,450
be totally devastated and go facepalm

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,450
all the time I think but we can make it

00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:58,360
work with calc with with ant marks with

00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:04,390
so can you tell me who is going to win

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:07,180
if we set this on our CSS box so we set

00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:10,000
the width on 320 pixels we set the min

00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:13,170
width on 480 pixels and marks with on

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,170
160 pixels

00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:21,730
who is going who think that width is

00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:24,220
going to win who thinks that men will

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:26,230
mean which is going to win good thing

00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,730
that marks which is going to win who is

00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,370
literally wondering what the hell I'm

00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,720
doing here

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:34,510
so this is really interesting because

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,400
the answer is it depends so if we look

00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:38,080
into the spec which is again and very

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,850
interesting lecture that they can

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,190
actually read at night you'll find read

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,750
a lot of interesting stuff for example

00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:46,660
if the width value is greater than the

00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,190
max with marks with winds now that we

00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,570
understand that makes sense right

00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:51,309
because marks which kind of restricts

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,760
the growth or restricts the width right

00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:56,530
let's make sense however and that's the

00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,690
interesting part if the mean weight

00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:03,520
value is greater than the width or max

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:05,800
width then mean with winds okay let's

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,230
read it again if the min width value is

00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:12,040
greater than the width or max width then

00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:15,820
mean with winds we can abuse it in so

00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,440
many different ways right so let's say

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:20,410
we want to make it work in Gmail without

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,100
media queue so how how can we do it like

00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:25,900
this yes okay that's okay just bear with

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,190
me this is going to be fine now what the

00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,200
hell are we going here we want to build

00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:32,230
a two column layout that stacks and

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,990
grows below 480 pixels so below 480

00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:37,330
pixels one column above 180 pixels two

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:39,160
columns we cannot use media queries for

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:42,040
this right so how do you make it work

00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:45,700
well with this we set we set min with

00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:48,400
some 50% max with 100% and we've as a

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:51,970
calque of 480 pixels minus 1% which is

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,890
our parent element x 480 why the hell

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,720
would you do that right so basically

00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:58,030
this is like a two column desktop

00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,790
version at this point and this is like a

00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:02,080
one column mobile version 480 pixels is

00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,090
our break point and obviously

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,040
hundred-percent refers to the parents to

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:09,190
the width of the parent so what are we

00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,620
doing here our goal is to create a value

00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:13,720
bigger than our max with all smaller

00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:15,850
than our mean with so instead of with

00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,150
mean with all max width is going to be

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,150
applied

00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:25,399
right does it make sense so why does it

00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:27,950
make sense so here we go let's say we

00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:30,499
have again the breakpoint is 480 pixels

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:33,019
so with a parent of 500 pixels you know

00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:34,460
it's more than 480 pixels right so what

00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:37,340
do we have here mean width is going to

00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:41,570
be 50% which is 250 pixels max width is

00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:44,210
than 500 pixels and the width is - 9600

00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:47,179
pixels right now at this point minutes

00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:48,590
is going to win because if the minutes

00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:51,739
value is greater than the width or

00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:55,820
max-width min which is going to win okay

00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:57,859
right so the code it is let me see

00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,629
it's 150 pixels because it's loud it's

00:24:57,859 --> 00:25:02,299
not larger than max width but it is

00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:02,479
larger than width so it has to win all

00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:03,979
right

00:25:02,479 --> 00:25:07,609
on the other way around if we go below

00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:09,529
480 pixels so we have let's say 400 here

00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:12,979
we've got 200 pixels here we've got

00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:15,109
former pixels and here we've got 38,400

00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:17,119
X and fallen pixels and because max

00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:22,279
width always restricts the width marks

00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:26,389
which is going to win right and you're

00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:27,799
done right and you could say well this

00:25:26,389 --> 00:25:29,419
is not fancy enough maybe we could do

00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,590
something else maybe we can use you know

00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:32,119
JavaScript if javascript is not

00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,099
supported and the answer is of course

00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:35,809
you can right

00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:38,389
how can you do this well what if you

00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:41,450
wanted to build a real-time wall like

00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:45,799
tweets to tweet a wall in an email when

00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:50,710
you send it out can you make it work of

00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:50,710
course you can now the question is how

00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:53,989
external CSS now you can do better than

00:25:53,629 --> 00:25:56,419
that

00:25:53,989 --> 00:26:00,729
but that goes in the right direction you

00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:04,599
can you deserve one I think anybody else

00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:06,710
now obviously we can reference an image

00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:09,139
which is going to live on the server

00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:12,559
which is going to be updated every two

00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:14,509
seconds and we then are going to crop it

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,419
and we're going to animate it a little

00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:19,070
bit right so it appears as if it was

00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:22,519
live and it's kind of life just maybe

00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:25,309
with a five-second you know delay more

00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:27,619
or less right and it kind of works right

00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:30,139
that's pretty cool so that's you know

00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,759
not a big deal in fact this is what what

00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:34,100
they did for the email design conference

00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:37,010
template and it's actually really

00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,779
right that's pretty cool in fact if you

00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,700
really indeed do have to deal with

00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:42,260
responsive email there are two resources

00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,029
I highly recommend one is their

00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,580
responsive email patterns and the other

00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:49,700
one responsive email resources and this

00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:52,039
technique by the way is not for me but

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:54,649
from Remy Parmenter thanks Remy

00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,860
so that's dirty but it's you know it

00:26:54,649 --> 00:27:00,440
works alright here's the next one so you

00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,760
want to add a background to inline text

00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,140
for headings but the text should be

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,390
petted along both the left and right

00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,070
edge of each line now the left and right

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,110
wedding will only apply to the very

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:10,940
first and very last line so if you apply

00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,070
petting and you have you you know your

00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,440
text surrounding it some here you've got

00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:17,149
your padding right and here you've got

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,830
your padding but here you've got no

00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:24,460
padding and here you've got no painting

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:24,460
either right so how would we fix it

00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:32,360
sorry negative margin potentially yes

00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:37,010
but then here you've got double padding

00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:40,190
Oh box shadow okay

00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:42,669
so what's that then why are you sitting

00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,669
so far

00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:52,160
okay I'll try again later all right in

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:56,190
fact we can do this just for you so I

00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:57,570
hope it's okay yeah so we can do this by

00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,130
just using the Bookshare method when we

00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:01,080
just put the boxer on both sides and

00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:02,520
we're done right so we're kind of

00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,530
drinking a little bit but it's really

00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,270
CSE just just adding a boxer on the both

00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:08,010
sides and then you don't have really

00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,780
petty but you kind of looks like you

00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,850
have painting right well that's pretty

00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:16,430
cool and it's really simple now let's go

00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:23,460
something go a bit more interesting ways

00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:33,620
maybe let's see okay I do want to not

00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:35,670
this one but just a second sorry okay no

00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:37,890
so here's the interesting one which is

00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:39,750
just really useful in many scenarios so

00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:42,330
what if you want to use a full with the

00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:44,070
element in a fixed width container right

00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,390
for example when you want some content

00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,800
to extend beyond the boundaries of the

00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,030
container this is what you want

00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,650
sometimes you want to have like Elias

00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:51,570
landing page and you have your container

00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,770
where the text lives and of course you

00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,390
want to restrict it because otherwise

00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,790
the time the line length is going to be

00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:59,460
too too big but that image could be kind

00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:03,420
of breaking out of that layout right so

00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,470
how do we do it we W all right well you

00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,300
can have full screen that's not a

00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:08,760
problem the problem is forward that you

00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,410
actually do want to make sure this kind

00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,840
of outside but you don't want to close

00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:14,580
the first deep open like you know put

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,180
the image inside and then reopen the

00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:21,030
other div again right so this is what

00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:22,530
you of course could do well first of all

00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,580
you want to restrict your container then

00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:25,470
you have your diff and then you have

00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,970
your piece over the images and so on and

00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:29,310
what you will have to do then

00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:30,990
potentially it's just close the div and

00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:33,270
then reopen open the image and then

00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:36,720
close open the deep again right but

00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:42,020
that's not nice I mean in fact I mean an

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:44,610
areas that's not difficult right sorry

00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:48,390
negative more that's good I like it

00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:50,640
keep going okay all right that's okay

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:53,220
all right so in fact negative margins

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,170
work quite well here to release our

00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:57,330
child element from its container I'm

00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:58,320
very proud of the phrasing we need to

00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:00,899
know how much

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,610
space series between the container and

00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:04,169
the viewport edge right and we can

00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:07,049
calculate it just by using calc again

00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:10,710
right how again does it work well we can

00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:12,929
just use negative V I don't mean here

00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,759
I've got two margins right basically we

00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:18,509
are pulling the content out but with

00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:20,639
minus 50% with minus 50 VW first and

00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:23,100
then we put it back with 50% on the

00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:25,230
parent right of course in the width and

00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:26,940
it just works again everywhere so just

00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,679
we're just pulling it out and then we're

00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,240
pulling it back with outside of the

00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,759
scope of container and then kind of back

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,220
so it doesn't you know set a good price

00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:38,070
full screen right and the problem

00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:40,590
however is if we do this we end up with

00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,960
this little bugger right

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,789
and so before because this happens we

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,940
actually need to also put all four

00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:52,379
hidden on all four X hidden as well and

00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:53,970
then we're really done right so in many

00:30:52,379 --> 00:30:56,129
scenarios you would be using you know

00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:57,419
really closing the diff and then

00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:58,980
reopening it but you either you really

00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:11,070
don't have to you can just pull it out

00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:15,779
and it will work I think there was

00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:17,279
something white wouldn't work but it's

00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:19,950
my guy I would need to check it out but

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,490
it's a good one yeah all right okay

00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:33,090
let's see what else let's go something

00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:35,100
all right this is fun okay this is very

00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,580
practical so you want to implement how

00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,620
much time do I have actually oh no time

00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:42,929
mm okay then I have to do just one okay

00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:46,139
I mean but it's really not a big deal

00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:47,669
seriously so just last one so happy hour

00:31:46,139 --> 00:31:49,799
fun I'm sure you did I mean you'll get

00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:54,200
all the slides anyway what is the best

00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:56,639
way to encode and one times one pixel

00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,769
would you use JPEG for that would you

00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:04,500
use a gif for this we do use the PNG

00:31:58,769 --> 00:32:06,350
what would you use why smaller give it

00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,620
smaller

00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:10,970
is it hmm let's see so that's

00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:15,110
interesting some people have nothing to

00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:18,890
do on the weekends welcome one times one

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:21,679
pixel give just in case you can't see it

00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:23,840
here this kind of waving at you I don't

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,130
think that you realize and we could

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,080
think well this is not a big deal this

00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,520
is not that difficult I mean this is not

00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,390
really like you know it seemed kind of

00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,270
simple

00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:35,299
uncompressed pixel is just one bit right

00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:36,980
oh four bytes depends again depends on

00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:38,240
how we see it so if you look at the

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,640
black and white is going to be one bit

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,429
grayscale 1 byte grayscale and alpha

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,280
channel 2 bytes RGB 3 bytes RGB a 4

00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:50,179
bytes right that's okay and you could

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,950
think well so that's it right this is it

00:32:50,179 --> 00:32:55,789
well not quite if you want to encode it

00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:57,650
using give or leaf or JPEG or whatever

00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:59,990
and that case you will need to do a bit

00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:01,970
more work because as it appears every

00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:03,860
image format specifies not only you know

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,630
the actual image but also how to

00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:07,580
interpret the data and also has some

00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:09,020
metadata in it so for example the width

00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,240
and the height and the number of bits

00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,590
per bytes of ice per pixel and so on so

00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,220
if you look specifically into what they

00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,690
contain

00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,970
you'll find that there is a magic number

00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,070
which is like a user agent string in

00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:21,320
browsers right it's kind of a fixed

00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:24,260
identify which they kind of communicate

00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:26,659
whether it's a gif or JPEG or PNG or

00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:28,400
anything else it also has some decoding

00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:31,520
details like all profiles orientation

00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:33,409
gamma dose per pixel has some arbitrary

00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,179
metadata potentially like things like

00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:37,520
time stamps copyright notices or

00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:39,350
coordinates and some overhead stuff like

00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,330
markers and checksums or even pairings

00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,070
for consistency just to make sure that

00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:45,409
whenever the image is transmitted it's

00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:47,570
always actually correct in the correct

00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:49,909
shape and if you look inside you know

00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,919
into the hex bond dump of it this is

00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:53,870
what you will find right this is a PNG

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,990
this is a few markers even if it's just

00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:59,419
you know one x one pixel and they differ

00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:01,580
and the different size as well and some

00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:04,880
people really spend time analyzing this

00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:07,130
so this is a gif right and this is

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,399
Debbie P and it turns out if you look

00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,619
into the table and compare what

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:15,139
different pixels have different values

00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:18,200
right which is important to know but in

00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:19,800
fact this most one is give for white and

00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,020
everything else too

00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,730
right and then you could say well this

00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:25,800
is not interesting enough what about you

00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,990
know a color it's like a real color so

00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,330
if you actually put and go and explore

00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:32,100
like there's not just one x one pixel

00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:33,690
but let's say ten thousand pixels nine

00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,640
ten thousand pixels what's going to be

00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:37,830
the smallest and the answer is well it

00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,440
depends of course but in that case the

00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:42,419
smallest is going to be PNG which is

00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,060
interesting by the way the reason why we

00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:46,919
didn't include jpg and here is because

00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:50,340
JP cannot be transparent and it was all

00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:54,090
about transparent pixels right all right

00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:59,130
well okay so no more time right are you

00:34:54,090 --> 00:35:01,650
sure oh yes this is brilliant okay so

00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:03,960
let's do this so that's what else oh my

00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:07,350
god okay this is what this one is really

00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,340
useful to so baseline ring or vertical

00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:11,850
written right

00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:14,160
every designer gets on somebody else's

00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,740
nerves when it comes to basically like

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,450
the perfect vertical reading how do you

00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,830
do it how do you make it right there are

00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,270
so many great frameworks of course you

00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,530
could use but do you have to use them

00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,510
because you can actually make it really

00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:27,840
simple now in the answer is one thing

00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:29,940
you just have to keep in mind now if I

00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:31,020
don't know if you can see oh wow they're

00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,210
actually supposed to be like a little

00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:35,250
grid behind so it depends really on how

00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:36,660
you implement it now very often if you

00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,730
think about the vertical reading you

00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,710
think about the lines living between the

00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,410
grid lines right so you have this lines

00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:45,540
like the you have agreed and these lines

00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:48,390
of text should be sitting right between

00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,220
them right and they're kind of the same

00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,260
distance between when they start in

00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:54,240
between when the end or you could do it

00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,980
slightly differently where you just put

00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,450
the text on that line in the grid and

00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:02,130
it's unlikely that you can see it's to

00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,950
be honest but that's okay I will explain

00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:07,860
it anyway so we tend to actually really

00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:09,630
most of the time use just a multiple of

00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:11,760
line height everywhere

00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,980
use it for pairings and margins and

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,140
sometimes even border width right but we

00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:19,620
can align to the by base line instead

00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,420
right so for this to work we just need

00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,220
to calculate the offset and then shave

00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,020
the content by that offset so what does

00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,090
it mean so let's say we have this lines

00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:30,180
right imagine we have lines we have

00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:32,160
lines everywhere right here right we

00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,140
have lines in here everywhere and

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,839
here is a line and here is a line and

00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:41,329
that line is right where the texts it's

00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:44,099
all right right here not in here

00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:46,740
just below it but actually right there

00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:49,049
which I'm really bad at this right where

00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:52,470
it's it's all right in that case this is

00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:54,450
what we can do so by default how does it

00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,339
work but default browser center the cap

00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:58,859
height as they define it between the

00:36:56,339 --> 00:37:00,180
grid lines so the height of the cap

00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:02,549
height is the height of a capital letter

00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:05,339
above the baseline again baseline is

00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:07,530
where the text sits so we can shift it

00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:11,730
by half the difference between line

00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:13,740
height and cap height why well because

00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:16,079
the tips text sits right between those

00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:21,150
lines so if we just take half of that

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:22,980
line for example and we remove the top

00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:26,510
of the line height then we actually have

00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,510
the text sitting right on the base line

00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:33,119
okay this didn't go as expected all

00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:35,339
right we just need to determine the cap

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,260
height and then offset the entire thing

00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:39,240
a little bit down and then we have to

00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:42,000
pull it back with margin negative margin

00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,829
at the bottom that's okay just a second

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,690
so this is how it's going to work so we

00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:47,010
have our line height define power

00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,140
formstack we could have different

00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:51,480
typefaces for example right and we have

00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,250
different font sizes in the end we're

00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,900
doing pixels here we're using pixels

00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:56,609
here but you can of course transform

00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,220
them into e/m units later so it's more

00:37:56,609 --> 00:38:03,690
flexible it just for us to be easier it

00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:05,099
kind of to follow easier simpler so we

00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,440
have the font sizes and then we just

00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:09,270
have to kind of refine it with cap

00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,980
heights a little bit with the formula

00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:12,690
you will see in a second so once we

00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,609
define them we just plugged in a formula

00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,470
and it works right so how exactly does

00:38:14,609 --> 00:38:18,240
it work in the end we have this little

00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:19,740
sauce mix in where we define the font

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,200
size and cap height an offset and

00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,369
returns that actual offset by again

00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,770
using that formula which I said before

00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:27,599
where we're kind of using the half of

00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:30,390
the line height minus cap height times

00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,579
font size right it will make sense just

00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:37,200
don't have time to explain everything

00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:39,000
right and the only thing we have to do

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,829
is kind of put that off so once we

00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,029
define the offset calculated the offset

00:38:40,829 --> 00:38:45,720
we just need to push it a little bit

00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:46,560
down so it sits right on the baseline in

00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,770
order to do this

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,000
we use we can use this and this is

00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:53,160
really like a magic trick

00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,900
most front-end developers will will

00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,330
freak out at this point because you can

00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:59,430
use margin top and margin bottom and it

00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:01,410
could you know weed here you have you

00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:03,870
have offset so you're pushing all the

00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:05,820
text a little bit down to see it on the

00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:08,070
baseline and design it out of you know

00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:10,080
not to screw up everything you have to

00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:13,320
pull it back with margin bottom for the

00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,610
for the when the paragraph ends right

00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,380
for example if you have a set the

00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:19,020
paragraphs you want them all to be

00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:21,300
sitting right right so what you have to

00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:23,670
split back so you still have this

00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,800
consistence in terms of how the lines

00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,960
and how they go so once you have this

00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,030
you might be wondering what the hell is

00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,500
going on here and you are free to leave

00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:34,590
at this point it's like two minutes left

00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:38,550
so how does it why does it work because

00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:40,740
we have collapsing margins in CSS if you

00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:42,870
look into this back in the evening at

00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:44,910
night you'll be able to find some really

00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:47,070
interesting facts about how it works as

00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:49,260
it turns out collapsing margins are not

00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,700
always collapsing margins so they work

00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:53,370
differently with positive and negative

00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,890
margins you have two positive margins

00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:58,830
the bigger one will win and like imagine

00:39:55,890 --> 00:40:01,110
you have a margin bottom and you have a

00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:03,120
margin top right I mean if you're doing

00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:05,640
CSS you will know this stuff if you have

00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,980
two positive values on two consequence

00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,720
paragraphs the one with the bigger value

00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,120
will win if you have two negative

00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,400
margins the lower well I'm the one that

00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,140
is more negative is going to win if you

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,500
have one positive and one negative

00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:22,140
they're going to add so the Marches will

00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,930
sum up we can abuse it in so many

00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:26,370
different ways right because this is

00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:28,650
exactly what we can do and what we are

00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:30,870
doing here anyway right we have always

00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:32,880
positive one and another one is negative

00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:34,890
and this is exactly what we can use so

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,390
they will be added up and they will

00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:41,250
maintain this vertical written that we

00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:43,620
want so what do we have in the end only

00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,000
one problem we have only one problem if

00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,250
an element doesn't have a border no

00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,770
padding and this first child has a

00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:52,200
margin that margin will flow out of the

00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:54,900
parent right because we define the

00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:57,210
negative margin but the actual parent

00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:59,040
has no you know has no padding so it's

00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:00,130
going to flow out so we need to put all

00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,100
four hidden on it

00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:05,380
that's okay if you could see the lines

00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:08,200
you will see that all of this text is

00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:10,480
sitting on right on this on the grid

00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,610
line without us having to do anything

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,530
without any media queries without

00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:17,350
anything just works using a little bit

00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:18,580
of you know cook calc is like magic it's

00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,550
like you know flexbox

00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:24,040
calc and you don't that's all you need
