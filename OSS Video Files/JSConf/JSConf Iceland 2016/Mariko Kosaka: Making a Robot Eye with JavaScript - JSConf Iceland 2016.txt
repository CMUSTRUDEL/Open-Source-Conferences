Title: Mariko Kosaka: Making a Robot Eye with JavaScript - JSConf Iceland 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-20
Playlist: JSConf Iceland 2016
Description: 
	Have you ever wondered how computers "see" images? Do you want to work on an AR (Augmented Reality) project or build a NodeBot that can recognize your face? When you work with an image as your data input, sooner or later you'll encounter the magic term "Computer Vision.

It can be intimidating to some. At first, that led me to choose a powerful library that works like magic in an unfamiliar language (C++). It felt like library was a black box and I had no control. I started wonder, what is so magical about computer vision? After all it is just code someone wrote. Can we unravel it? and reconstruct in JavaScript??

The answer is YES. In this talk, we'll start by getting image data from canvas object, then transform the data to alter an appearance of the image. You will get first insight into what data looks like to a browser (hint: it's just an array of numbers !). Finally, we'll go through simple image analysis process to build your own AR app in vanilla JavaScript!

thank you

00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:20,170
hi um that's my twitter handle if you

00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,670
have any questions right at all go if

00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,070
you want to message me want to complain

00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:28,210
about the content you can do so on there

00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,830
so I want to start with a story and just

00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,670
for the second imagine this is a

00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:36,970
classroom in high school I took a class

00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:39,730
that is really hard to translate it into

00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:43,899
English but it's something a line of

00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:47,320
music appreciation or sound listening

00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:49,629
and you know not only we listened to a

00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,510
lot of music and learn about classical

00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:56,530
music history we also watch a lot of

00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:58,899
movies we alter the sound wave

00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:02,350
artificially to sound the conversation

00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:05,920
more softer or more sharp and think

00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:08,710
about if that changed how we thought the

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,070
conversation we're going we also

00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,540
discussed about iconography of the

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:16,270
jacket cover on the Lee code and

00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:18,760
everything so this was the first time I

00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:22,390
realized that there's a certain pledges

00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:25,390
thing as nonverbal communications the

00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:28,090
communication that your eyes or your

00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:30,370
ears or just getting some kind of signal

00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:35,530
from light or the it will wave on the

00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:37,990
air and somehow we or just analyzing it

00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,640
without even thinking and doing certain

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,400
kind of communication and this was

00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,230
really fascinating to me so I studied

00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,650
communication in college and also a

00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:51,070
visual anthropology and my first job out

00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:53,200
of college was a online video sharing

00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:56,560
community site and now I woke as a web

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,930
developer making text editors but making

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,200
of clinical applications or websites or

00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:04,510
designing a system to me was always

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,500
creating a means of communication for

00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:09,700
humans to me it was never about

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:15,580
connecting a two computers or two

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:18,269
programs together so can't day we are

00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,560
surrounded by non verbal or visual

00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:24,010
communications or sound communication

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,469
really how many of you have like all of

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,780
these application in your pocket like

00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:31,270
there's so many applications that use

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,420
sound elements so many applications that

00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:36,640
use picture element we are all

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,380
surrounded by it and even as a

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,530
programmer this is a really exciting

00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,209
time that a lot of research on image

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,090
processing and computer vision is

00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:48,850
happening this is the example of doing a

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,010
style transfer which is a way to use

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,890
machine learning to analyze the picture

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:57,790
and apply the style and technique so

00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,860
painting into another picture you might

00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:04,150
also know the deep dream from the google

00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:11,880
lab so even in the Lee search field the

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:14,110
exciting thing is happening so

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,600
discovering this type of communication

00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:19,239
was really fascinating to me because as

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,959
a human eyes whoa this is really big

00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:26,670
picture like us looking at this picture

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:30,280
how many green circle in this picture

00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:33,220
one how many yellow squares are in this

00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,620
fixture one yeah this is interactive one

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,720
so like you can just tell me so like you

00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,640
eat last programmer thinks that like you

00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,030
know really like to write a logic and

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,430
like really like flexed logical thinking

00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,900
muscles but when you're looking at it

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,700
and then like when I ask you like how

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,930
many yellow squares are there you don't

00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,870
need to think about like if else

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,269
statement you just like there's one like

00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,709
you don't even think or you don't even

00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:59,140
know that you were thinking in your

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:02,140
brain and this is really interesting and

00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:05,019
frustrating when you are trying to make

00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:07,390
an application that deals with visual

00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:10,450
element so I want to show you one sample

00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:16,530
that I'm hey last year i made a

00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:19,239
application let's call sweater if I I I

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,720
work as a software engineer on my day

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,990
job but on my side on my side project I

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,539
really like to create a tools and um

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,850
program to design a textile and this was

00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:32,919
around Christmas time so I wanted to

00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:36,370
make something fun something people can

00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:38,409
just do so I'm a ugly sweater generator

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,650
or in British term I guess Christmas

00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:42,520
jumper generator you can just upload the

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:46,080
picture

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:49,599
then I will make it into a sweater foam

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,870
to me this is not even perfect because I

00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:56,370
see this image and in my mind there is

00:04:52,870 --> 00:05:00,190
like a vivid image of like me should be

00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:05,919
extracted more there is clear border

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:10,259
between clear border between here in the

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:14,199
background and my hair but when I do

00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:17,229
applied it to the text align there is no

00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:20,259
border here and like how do I even tell

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:22,630
my program where is me and where's my

00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:25,060
background and got me really interested

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:28,030
in this topic of Miss processing and

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:31,120
computer vision when you google computer

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:33,130
visions you would probably find some

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,219
kind of libraries may popular one is

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,740
open CD and there's a whole bunch of

00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:42,009
document about how to use it so many

00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:44,379
back so many blog posts about a tutorial

00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:47,259
of using this library my main

00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:50,770
frustration was that all of them were

00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:53,110
about how to talk to this API how to use

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,490
this tool that's doing something that I

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,699
don't understand and none of them

00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:01,300
explain what actually this library is

00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:03,669
doing and then you know as I mentioned

00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:06,610
there's things like very trendy topic in

00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:11,080
lasers like deep deep learning and deep

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:13,000
dream that you almost started feeling

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,819
like it's just like something that like

00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,830
via links to research facility it's just

00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:20,229
like really over top of my head and I

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:23,259
can't really understand like I don't

00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:26,080
know so when we were looking at object

00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:29,139
from human I we can immediately identify

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,840
certain attributes like colors of the

00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,819
object height of the object name of the

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,130
object that's commonly known in the

00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:38,590
society but the problem with computer

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,630
vision is they don't look at that object

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,300
a look at digital representation the

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,729
digital photo of the object and this is

00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,789
a photo of the object is really just a

00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:51,039
whole bunch of bytes and bits in there

00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:52,509
so the robots or the computer program or

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,940
computer whatever you want to call is

00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:56,020
just looking at that number and my

00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,979
question

00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:02,889
is how do we tell that person that lava

00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:06,460
how to lead that like us humans do with

00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:08,409
these orange attributes and another

00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,819
question is that is it really like Alli

00:07:08,409 --> 00:07:12,099
Leigh difficult thing to do that you

00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:14,590
have to help PhD or can I just use it

00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:16,419
what can I just do it in the platform

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,500
that I'm really most familiar with and

00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:20,379
the language that are most comfortable

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,539
which is JavaScript and the answer is

00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:24,460
yes you can use canvas element and we'll

00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:26,590
get to that but before we get to that I

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,960
have a announcement not disclaimer

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:33,520
announcement I consider myself as a

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:36,669
translator I it's not really between two

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,130
different languages but translator in

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:41,340
the sense of providing different

00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:45,069
perspective I have a tendency to draw

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:47,590
all over the technical documents I have

00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:50,770
tendency to use a lot of analogy to

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:52,750
explain certain concepts so the stuff

00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:56,379
that I'm gonna do today my look

00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:59,909
unfamiliar or weird and I'm sorry if

00:07:56,379 --> 00:08:03,039
that's the case but I really think that

00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:05,169
there is a value in having different

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,180
perspective not just only having one

00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:09,310
traditional way of describing computer

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,590
science but having a different

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:17,259
perspective in this field so I'm gonna

00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:20,259
do that so image as i mentioned digital

00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:22,539
image is just a bite that computer is

00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:25,029
looking at so like how how can we look

00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:27,520
at that number ones and zeros and matrix

00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:29,289
e thing so i made a special image so

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,399
like if you like stir yourself in the

00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:35,740
center and then the craft right down and

00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,649
then go cup and then just like focus on

00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:42,190
the center for like 10 seconds then you

00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:45,010
will look start to look at this like do

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,920
you see it you see the zeros and ones no

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,829
no no no it's not like that it doesn't

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,420
look like that you have to write a code

00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:56,470
so as i mentioned i use the canvas

00:08:52,420 --> 00:09:00,940
element canvas is a HTML 5 element that

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:04,209
let you write a tough draw a picture on

00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,120
your browser using javascript so it's a

00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:10,240
perfect element to do this job

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,940
to create a canvas is just as easy as

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,860
creating any other kind of ACM element

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,480
just clear to element in canvas or you

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,850
just type it in the canvas tag and

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,339
reference by ID and you need to specify

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,370
size of that and I'd like to think this

00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:26,620
process as for this day's as like you

00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:29,260
reserved certain piece of land somewhere

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:31,450
but you don't know where it is yet you

00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:33,640
need to know because you don't know like

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:36,460
whether this land is in Iceland and

00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,850
speaks mysoline language or this is in

00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,779
New York in the middle of like heist

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,779
skyscraper so you need to give some

00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:46,240
context to this piece of plan and you

00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:48,850
exactly give the context but I doing get

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,610
context you specify what kind of context

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:54,490
you want i'm using 2d context but you

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:58,320
can also specify WebGL to do the GPU

00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:01,779
programming but at this point you know

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,400
exactly what kind of language and what

00:10:01,779 --> 00:10:05,230
kind of method that you're getting out

00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:08,170
of this context once you have the

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:11,320
context you can draw amazing do this by

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:15,459
through the context so contact start

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:19,209
draw image and pass a image into it

00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:22,180
we'll put a digital image into canvas

00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:25,450
element and now your javascript king in

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:28,300
track to interact with this fixture in

00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:30,339
order to get that data whatever the

00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,730
computer is looking at there is a method

00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:37,150
called get image data and then you

00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:40,290
extract the data out of the canvas so

00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:43,750
let's look at what in this data element

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,490
this is what image data looks like just

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,950
imagine you have a three by three ed

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:51,580
tiny pixel that's just like super and

00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:54,880
lowers into this screen and the left

00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,890
left of it is what looks like if you

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,440
call get a nice data and then get the

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,510
data out of it it's just a JavaScript

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,300
object certain attributes are very

00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:06,940
obvious width and height is a width and

00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,310
height of the image with a pixel unit

00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,070
and then there was data and there's

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:15,190
whole bunch of numbers that you need to

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:18,160
understand but this is ingredient what

00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:20,079
constitute this picture so in order to

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,740
understand what this data is the way you

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,500
need to under

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,779
than what's in a single pixel if I drew

00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:29,110
the single pixel which looks really big

00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:30,910
in here I also gave eyes to kind of I

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,390
humanize it a little bit so that you

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:37,110
like you know get familiar with pixel

00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:40,720
underneath the pixel is full values

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:43,660
first three you can think of it as a

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,820
different colored of light bulbs red

00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:50,020
green and blue and a force one will get

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:53,680
to it but you can control how blight

00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:55,660
each color of the light bulb is so if i

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,959
turn the red light bulb all the way up

00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:01,930
and turn off green and blue then your

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:05,290
pixel becomes red if you do the other

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,839
colors you know slightly greenish and

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:11,860
you can start mixing the colors in lgb

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:14,380
space if you have same values for each

00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,570
of three you always get gray different

00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:21,250
shades of gray but you always get gray

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:24,420
and this always get grey comes important

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:27,850
later in this talk but you can see that

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:29,890
right the force number is opacity so

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:32,290
this is purely for software to know if

00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,750
some images are overweight how much

00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:37,510
should I brand it in to lender it on

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,630
your screen so you can see I have

00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:43,899
slightly less paucity and you can play

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:49,589
around pretty much you specify lgb a on

00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:56,800
your CSS it just comes in four numbers

00:12:49,589 --> 00:13:00,190
so so now this data start to make sense

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,500
I Pat it by just a chunk of four so that

00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,680
it's easier to lead and from top left

00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:09,700
corner to the bottom right corner each

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,459
pixel has four numbers for them so let's

00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:15,100
do the same thing here that first pixel

00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:18,430
because it is a first for it should be

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,920
top left corner hopefully let's see

00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:23,680
let's make it into green so I turn off

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,860
all the rape red light bulb which is our

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:30,160
first value and then I turn the green

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:33,040
channel all the way after 255 and then

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,990
turn off the blue and update and then it

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,949
should turn into agree so this is how

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:42,160
the most basic way you edit a digital

00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:47,050
image and we will deplete do that for

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,900
all of the pixel from now on now kind of

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:53,199
thinking this one-dimensional array data

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:56,140
in two-dimensional space is a little

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:58,570
hard but what leading made sense to me

00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:01,329
was when one of my mentor explained to

00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:03,670
me the way this this way so when you're

00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:05,620
writing a letter to somebody in your

00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:08,589
head you don't need to think about ok so

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,029
this paper fits 20 characters so I'm

00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:11,890
going to think about 20 character first

00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:13,600
and then for next sentence i'm gonna

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,459
stick like a mother 20 character know

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,459
your blend is thinking just like stream

00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:21,070
of data and then when you put it onto

00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:23,110
the paper you just unconsciously going

00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:26,560
up I lined out of space not a lie

00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:28,690
another face another line so in a way

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,540
that the what's in your head is the data

00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:34,089
that you see and they miss data and what

00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:37,649
transfer to the paper is what you are

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:40,630
looking at on the screen as a texture so

00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:42,399
now we know how to get to the data and

00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,020
how to get to the pixels and how to

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,060
change the color of the pixel let's do

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,770
something fun I hope it translates well

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,839
on the screen but let's do something

00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,060
like image filter the Instagram filter

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,370
if you research how to do the image

00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,529
filter you look at you discover the

00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:00,370
squiggly functions that's called a plump

00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:02,470
I can't even pronounce Oh basically

00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:04,779
master and a whole bunch of maybe glass

00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:07,180
but it's like always a grey and like

00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:09,100
black I like to think of it as like

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,589
introducing a social construct to this

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,770
like pixel social world because it's

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:17,470
really just setting a rule that all of

00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:19,660
the pixel follows for this texture so

00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:23,140
like age group who's allowed to use

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:26,079
playground certain days you have to go

00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:27,880
to school you have to start paying tax

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,130
once you go through to school like all

00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,589
of those things you just define it and

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:37,630
then you apply it to all of the pics

00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:41,699
pixels so here is a function that's

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:44,260
visualized in a data visualization in

00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:46,160
the case that you're not applying a

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:49,339
filter you were just like getting image

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,569
in and same image out it looks like this

00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:54,500
so let's say your light bulb is

00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:57,259
illuminating the red light bulb is

00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,360
eliminating 181 the output of it is

00:15:57,259 --> 00:16:02,509
always 181 and you know it doesn't

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,879
change anything and I colored it in the

00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:10,250
gradient of red green and blue just to

00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:13,370
specify that all of the three lights are

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:15,529
going through this function so if you

00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,899
have a 1 pixel then you do the same

00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:20,689
thing for three times for each channel

00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:21,860
all of them follow the same who'll but

00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:24,649
then like you know changing the

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:28,689
brightness you slightly change those

00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:35,629
carbs so in this case let's say blyton

00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:39,230
all of the pixel so there's a 72 161 so

00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:42,230
that's what like 73 is like all of the

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:45,250
pixel that go seeing gets more blatant

00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:48,829
and then comes out the contrast is

00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:52,339
similar to brightness but it's changing

00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:54,410
a slope of the curve so here is a high

00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:57,170
contrast it is here is a low contrast

00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:59,720
image in no contrast case input is so

00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:01,970
from 0 to 255 you haven't altered

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:07,569
anything on the input side but the

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:12,289
output is limited to in this case 56 to

00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:14,600
190 200 so it slightly lose the color

00:17:12,289 --> 00:17:15,980
that's possible and it doesn't have to

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,409
be straight line there is this thing

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,380
called posterization and it's basically

00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:24,049
glue p'ing the pixels together based on

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:27,980
the number so in this case any pixel or

00:17:24,049 --> 00:17:31,909
any any data that has 155 to two or

00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:35,830
three all gets 192 and this way you get

00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:39,909
this pollster eyes effect of color is

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:43,159
limited and it's kind of fun to do so

00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:46,400
now that we know how to get the data how

00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:49,100
to change the color how about changing a

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,630
structure of the picture like blur and

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:55,220
sharp image to do that you need to do

00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,289
some kind of mass called corner

00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,240
convolution which I feel like it sounds

00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:00,050
like a yummy cereal but I'd like to

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,970
think that as

00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:04,190
thinking about a social graph of the

00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,450
pixels we introduce a social construct

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:09,110
but then you know within the social

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:11,120
construct of the world you know it has a

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:13,550
lot of relationship in it and you need

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,290
to think about those things so here's

00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,570
one pixel that we want to change the

00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:21,350
color to change the structure of this

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:24,560
image you the pixel has a sounding

00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:27,110
friends and in case of blur let's think

00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,990
about it you want to blend it in as much

00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:32,720
as possible to your neighbors so you lay

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:36,230
yourself and your neighbors equally and

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,390
you get the other ways color of all of

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:41,900
the nine pixels and then you change your

00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:44,270
color to that average color in the

00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:47,150
bigger picture so let's say you see here

00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:50,900
is a distinct red line going across you

00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:53,420
do that mass for each single one of the

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:57,980
pixel going through and result of that

00:18:53,420 --> 00:19:00,740
is blurred image so this is a box floor

00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:04,280
that we just did let's see how r / this

00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:06,950
is original blurred orginal blurred but

00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,350
in reality though like not all of your

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,970
friend is like equally important right

00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,100
you have a best friend and you have a

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,630
distant friend so in that case you can

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,750
use something like Gaussian blur or you

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,910
can make your own matrix that you want

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,130
to introduce in Gaussian blur case they

00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:25,130
use normal distribution so you're closer

00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,780
friend gets laid it higher and then your

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:31,420
distant friend which is on the corner

00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:35,060
get high elated lore and it's slightly

00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:37,820
edged preserving way of doing the blur

00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:40,010
and if you ever wondered why SVG filters

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,110
you have to type Gaussian blur that's

00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:45,190
because the type of matrix that got the

00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:48,020
SVG filter uses is a Gaussian filter

00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,310
sharp on the other hand is the opposite

00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,230
you don't want to blend it into your

00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:53,270
friend you want to be unique like you

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,370
you really want to stand out in that

00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:58,370
case you you laid yourself the center

00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:02,150
context or later so really high while

00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:04,220
you don't want to get the inference from

00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:06,290
your friends like late at zero or you

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,760
even want to like learn opposite like if

00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:10,190
you're doing the saying that I'm gonna

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,170
go the other way so like you Nick lady

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:16,720
negatively and then that produces a

00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:21,970
sharped image so here's always no sharp

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:23,560
and slightly maybe you can see it right

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,080
so if you want to play around all of

00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:29,350
these filters I have a library that's

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:32,440
called graph ejs that let you easily try

00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:35,530
out those Salters I kind of designed it

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,750
thinking like underscore but for image

00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:39,280
processing so you can pass any of the

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,010
image data and then you specify the

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,780
parameters and you get an image data

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,610
object out which is the processed

00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:49,930
version of image so if you want to play

00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:52,330
run you can look at those so now that we

00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,070
know how to get the data how to eat the

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,290
data how to change that and how to

00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,270
change a little bit of structure let's

00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:00,550
think about neighborhoods because much

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,710
like the city is consistent of many

00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:06,040
different neighborhood based on whatever

00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:08,170
that reviews that we carry the image has

00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,490
interesting parts of the image important

00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,320
parts of the image and they're not

00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,570
interesting parts or differently

00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,270
interesting parts of the image so how

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:19,420
can we get that information out of this

00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:22,620
image in order to do this you need to do

00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:25,660
like plea processing for like two things

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,790
one is upscaling and one new fresh

00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,310
holding and let's go through those two

00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:33,220
so that we can define neighborhood so

00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:36,160
there is a little let's grayscale it as

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:40,510
I mentioned all the pixel have sweet

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:43,060
values gray scaling is the way to think

00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:45,670
that how bright each pixel is you don't

00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,770
care about the color of the pixel you

00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:49,360
are just interested in how blight are

00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:53,050
you're like what's your important like

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,730
the true self inside so how do we do

00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:57,040
that because we have three numbers how

00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,530
can we do that well we can take very

00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:02,860
naive uploads you're just picking one so

00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:05,410
in this case I picked green and just use

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:08,050
that all over and it didn't work the the

00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:10,840
bottom half disappeared because the

00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:14,220
green channel on the bottom half objects

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,560
turn on happens to be 0 and 0 so it just

00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,620
Talent down so how about like if we

00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,780
average it out it's getting there it

00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:26,570
looks like gray scale image but here is

00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:29,630
a problem for us the human eyes die

00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:33,769
Green Square it looks like much brighter

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:37,399
than the one on the blue one but in this

00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:40,220
average grayscale image those are two or

00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:42,889
same if you look at numbers it makes

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:46,600
sense because both of them have same

00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:49,460
amount of numbers in the pixel why

00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:53,440
because our human eyes are heavily

00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:55,789
biased towards one color which is green

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,549
so when you look at it even with our

00:22:55,789 --> 00:23:00,649
thinking you feel like green it's

00:22:58,549 --> 00:23:04,850
blighter you you feel like green is

00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:07,100
valuable and you need to this proposed

00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:10,940
interesting question of like we alter

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:14,659
our code so that it works with our

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:17,029
cognitive bias which is doing a loom

00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:19,340
according so the recording is the coding

00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:21,320
that used in the TV industry it's

00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:24,710
basically giving a privilege in each

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:28,250
green channel while not really giving a

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:30,909
previous on blue and the red channel and

00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:34,850
then output of that looks slightly like

00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:37,549
natural quoting coil for us is not your

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,159
not natural in the numbers but natural

00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:41,990
for our eyes okay we got through the

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,230
gray scaling another one it's a

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:48,169
threshold once you have a grayscale you

00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:50,299
got little three channel thing you will

00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:52,519
now only have information about how

00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:56,679
blade that pixel is but you want to get

00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:58,909
down to more more smaller number so you

00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:03,710
the gray scale is the image that

00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:06,889
contains a number from 0 to 255 so 256

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:09,889
shades of gray threshold eng is the way

00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:13,970
to make the image into just black and

00:24:09,889 --> 00:24:20,029
white and nothing in between so in this

00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:23,299
last case we have a let's see if i want

00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:26,110
to extract this light bulb corner then i

00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:29,059
would just slightly alter this and then

00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:32,570
here threshold it so anything that's

00:24:29,059 --> 00:24:34,879
below 153 gets zero anything a Papa gets

00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:38,419
to 55 and you get black and white

00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:40,250
photography so once we have that and we

00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:42,680
kind of isolated the

00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:46,310
object that you are interested in the

00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:48,380
picture ended up like this well let's

00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:51,140
just imagine that picture end up like

00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:52,790
this so we kind of like grayscale did

00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:55,310
and adjusted the threshold and then

00:24:52,790 --> 00:25:00,080
isolated it so how can we tell computers

00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:02,330
how to identify what's in it because

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,280
I'll humanize it's easily you can tell

00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:08,060
there's a two white lesions in this

00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:09,980
image and the shape of the image like

00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,650
which is larger and which is smaller but

00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:16,340
in computers case remember it only knows

00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:19,370
is it black or white they don't have any

00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,230
idea about the shape so how can we tell

00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,590
computer that so it's still computer

00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,730
that which is called labouring so

00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:28,340
computer goes to reform the top left

00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:30,560
corner and then finds first white pixel

00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,810
and then says okay I found a white pixel

00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:35,810
its label at one go through another

00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:37,880
second color and then find another one

00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:41,330
and then ask the questions same question

00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:44,660
it's white is it any way connected to

00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:48,640
the pixel that I'm already identified no

00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:51,350
so label says to this one is interesting

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,120
it's the ask the same question I found a

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,970
white pixel is it connected to anything

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,040
that I already identified as a human

00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:59,930
eyes it's clearly connected to other

00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:02,720
white pixels but remember at this point

00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:05,480
computer doesn't know rest of it it only

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,430
knows the past though so it says okay

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,370
it's not connected I kind of a level

00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:13,010
three next one it's now clearly knows

00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:15,950
that it is connected on the top and left

00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:18,710
side and it says okay I'm gonna label it

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,780
one but taken note that three was also a

00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:23,680
possibility and then do the same thing

00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:27,440
and then come back to that knee mode

00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:30,260
labels we that was like you know come

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,300
back and then the eval evaluators pixel

00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,940
and indeed it is connected to label one

00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:38,210
so you get one so now at this point

00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:42,020
computer knows there's two interesting

00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:45,860
place in this picture however what they

00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:49,520
don't know yet is where it is or where

00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:51,950
the border is so we need to find the

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,839
edge of each object how do we do that

00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:56,129
kind of the same

00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:59,099
computer finds the first white pixel

00:26:56,129 --> 00:27:02,609
again and because it is the first one it

00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:03,959
defines as a border and then it does a

00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:07,259
slightly different thing going through

00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:12,959
the edges so it asks is the left side of

00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:15,299
me white no so move on is the left

00:27:12,959 --> 00:27:17,729
bottom side of me white it's white so

00:27:15,299 --> 00:27:20,999
okay so I move on to that and label that

00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:25,379
as a border so do the same thing is it y

00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:27,869
know is it white no is it why yes so do

00:27:25,379 --> 00:27:32,459
that and then now computer knows where

00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:34,759
the border of the interesting part is so

00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:38,399
at this point our robots or computer

00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:42,599
knows looking at this or like give the

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:44,009
data of this nose hmm let's see I think

00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:45,899
about the question that they can answer

00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:48,719
they can answer there's three

00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:51,419
interesting parts in this picture they

00:27:48,719 --> 00:27:53,399
can if I ask like where is that yellowy

00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:56,129
part of the interesting part they will

00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:58,229
point to the middle if I ask like other

00:27:56,129 --> 00:28:01,229
color will point to the other one but

00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:04,859
what they cannot tell is like a question

00:28:01,229 --> 00:28:07,289
like which one is round or which one is

00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:12,659
triangular and at this point you can

00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:15,570
think of many ways to label or like find

00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:18,179
that information you can go into machine

00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:20,369
learning and just try to train the level

00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:23,159
to like by giving them a lot of

00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:27,899
references or you can go into using a

00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:30,929
lot of a skip in my mind a lot of

00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:33,570
geometry masks to try to find out the

00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:35,219
shape of the image so for now I'm

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:38,820
running out of time so let's do one

00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:42,539
quick demo of how to find a circle in

00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:45,499
this image in order to find circle there

00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:48,179
is a very simple mathematical function

00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:51,959
that you can apply and it's called

00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:54,989
circular shape factor the calculation is

00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:56,759
for pi times area / circumference it

00:28:54,989 --> 00:28:59,219
sounds like math but we already know

00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:02,459
those information area because we

00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:04,499
labeled it with one or two rays so we

00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:07,380
already know how big each of the object

00:29:04,499 --> 00:29:09,660
is and so conference is the edge of

00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,330
objects so we labeled it so we know the

00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:14,760
lengths of the circumference so we all

00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:16,740
have a number that we can just put it

00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:20,400
into this formula and get number out

00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:23,760
this shape factor returns one if the

00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:27,720
object is completely circle and as the

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:31,260
object move further away from the circle

00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:34,190
the number goes down so if I were to try

00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:36,990
to find a circle then you can just learn

00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:40,020
this function and then just kind of set

00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:43,410
the / hold up if the value comes out of

00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:48,090
this is 12.9 then I'm gonna say this is

00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:56,370
around so I have a one quick demo that I

00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:59,850
need which is to find circles so here I

00:29:56,370 --> 00:30:01,890
have two socks I organized a meetup in

00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:04,290
Brooklyn Kobuk enjoy us and for our to

00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:07,500
universally we made a JavaScript socks

00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:09,840
and also I have my own socks that is

00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,520
slightly similar patterns it's like you

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,400
know different shapes and then one shape

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,730
is circle and one shape is triangle so

00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:20,430
let's see if I put it over there and as

00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:22,800
I explained the you can see the original

00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:25,710
picture glace killed one and how i

00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:28,590
extracted the threshold let's ask our

00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:30,420
lobo if this is a JavaScript socks and

00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:33,750
it says it looks like a job as good

00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:37,320
socks and then let's give try and go on

00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:39,360
and let's say if it says so not so you

00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:42,170
know same thing and interested and it's

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,670
just know this sucks is not just powered

00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:47,430
because I applied the function saying

00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:50,040
like a circle is a triangular and you

00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:51,630
know you can see and the threshold the

00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,820
object that comes out of the threshold

00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:57,210
is certainly rounder than this one which

00:30:53,820 --> 00:31:00,990
is clearly triangle I have to click on

00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:02,970
it it would be great to kind of not do

00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:05,820
that in automatically detect but there's

00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:07,890
a challenge in browser see as I

00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,990
mentioned there's so many much going on

00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:11,910
like you know even the demo that was

00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:13,350
like tiny there's so many pixels and

00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:15,390
there's switch on also of each of them

00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:17,610
so so many so many so many months are

00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:20,010
going on that browser gets really

00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:22,200
unhappy if you're doing it in your

00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:24,240
thread so I'd suggest that you just

00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,400
investigate using something like web

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,980
worker and I like to think what worker

00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:33,450
is like International Space Station to

00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:35,310
us the browser Dom that is the arse it

00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:37,110
is something that we want and it is

00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:39,480
something that we created we communicate

00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:41,520
data over it and do any math and

00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,710
scientific research over there and you

00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:46,470
get the data out but the International

00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,300
Space Station does not belong in the

00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,300
worse so it doesn't have access to DOM

00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,550
no access to window so you can only

00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,260
communicate over data well you might ask

00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:57,120
like how about service workers the buzz

00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:00,750
word well I like to think service worker

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,870
as like UFO which is a similar thing

00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:06,090
it's in the space but there is so many

00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:08,070
leg up work that browser provides like

00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:12,210
background sync and push notifications

00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:14,220
that you are not controlling in

00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:16,650
wolfwalkers case in the life cycle of

00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:19,230
your application you create a worker you

00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:21,240
terminate the work or you control what

00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:23,610
the web worker is doing service worker

00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,390
same idea don't have access to dom don't

00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:29,400
have access to window but um it is

00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:33,240
something that you don't know how it's

00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:35,760
doing on the back so the best part is

00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,730
that it's really easy to start you start

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,550
a new worker and then start launch the

00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:43,200
survey station you import scripts if you

00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,840
want to use outside library because

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,180
again I mentioned you there's no access

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,250
to window so even if you might already

00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,920
have underscoring application you have

00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,870
to install it again and the worker side

00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,440
and then in between worker and main

00:32:54,870 --> 00:33:00,560
thread you communicate by using method

00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,860
post message and listening to the all

00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:07,410
message event and then once you're done

00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:10,530
with it you terminate and don't you

00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:13,140
control entire lifecycle of workers so

00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:15,480
here's an example of very image

00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:19,470
processing heavy app that I made that is

00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:22,500
not Walker door I guess I'm doing a

00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:25,620
bunch of blur operations and it is just

00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,770
completely freeze the UI and not doing

00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:31,200
anything and once it's done and it comes

00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:33,470
back all of the quick events that was

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,750
accumulated just like thought I ran

00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:38,059
so this is not nearly good a good user

00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:40,730
experience so this is a war curved

00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:43,789
version which animation doesn't get

00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:46,190
blocked you can actually see that I am

00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:50,000
applying a blur function again and again

00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:52,370
and again you I works and then now it's

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,530
processing and it comes back as a

00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:58,390
processed image so it actually works

00:33:54,530 --> 00:34:00,919
faster too so I encourage you to

00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:02,720
investigate what's possible inside of

00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:05,270
the browser it's really easy to say oh

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:08,899
like you should use C because it's bare

00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:12,169
metal and it's fast but us we are web

00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:14,750
developers I hope you also some kind of

00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:16,849
web developers we deal with users and we

00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:20,990
deal with users intentions and cheating

00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:24,859
on the user's a text users actions so we

00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:27,290
can create much meaningful interaction

00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:30,470
by just using what's available and

00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:32,270
browser not even going into creating

00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:35,359
another app or anything browser has so

00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:37,040
many potentials if you get inspired by

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,500
this talk and want to investigate more

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,990
have a two recommendations book of

00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:45,320
shaders if you want to go into WebGL

00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:47,629
encoding patricio and gin or artist

00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,030
based in New York that created a book

00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:52,099
that is also Illustrated and explained

00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:55,510
in the different point of view another

00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:58,700
one is a machine learning for artist

00:34:55,510 --> 00:35:01,640
Jean teaches a machine learning class at

00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:03,890
art school so he has a he's clean

00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,930
decoded entire semester Warsaw of

00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:07,700
material and then put it on to github

00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:09,410
and you can watch it and its really

00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:15,380
interesting creative use of machine

00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:17,660
learning inspired by those 2 i'm

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,660
thinking of turning these contents into

00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:24,200
some kind of online book so if you are

00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:28,609
interested maybe I cannot guarantee when

00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:30,890
it's done again my 1200 is that I have a

00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:32,690
googly eyes on my bad so if you find me

00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:35,089
come talk to me and if you want to have

00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:37,820
Google you guys I have extra ones there

00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:41,080
is a two links to my projects and love

00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:43,140
friends and thank you very much

00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,140
