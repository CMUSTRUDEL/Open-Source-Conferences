Title: Myles Borins: On left-pad and empathy: understanding human connection - JSConf Iceland 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-13
Playlist: JSConf Iceland 2016
Description: 
	Empathy can be a pivotal factor in the success of yourself and your projects. If you don't care about the people using your product, why are you making it? If you don't care about your co-workers who will have to use your code, why do you work with them? If you don't care about yourself, why are you doing this as a career?

Some people may ask "why empathy?”. Let’s examine this concept, find ways to be more empathetic in our actions, and discuss the pragmatism of empathy.

This talk will explore various ways in which developers can be more empathetic to the community, their co-workers, and themselves. The talk will also explore larger ways we as an industry can work together to improve empathy. We will then use these tools to examine the “left-pad” situation to find empathy for all those involved.

thank you so let's get started

00:00:16,669 --> 00:00:21,599
this talk has an alternate title instead

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,730
of on left patent empty it's on on

00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:26,759
writing and consuming api's with empathy

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,710
because human is hard we'll get a little

00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:30,660
bit more into that afterwards but you'll

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,260
see that this talk we'll talk about left

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,540
pad but it's not the most important part

00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:38,820
hello I put this slide at the beginning

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,110
of every one of my presentations it's a

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:46,049
bit of kind of a mantra and I'll just

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:49,320
stare at it and that calms me and now I

00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:52,470
feel ready to prepare and talk my name

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,920
is miles I work for a small disruptive

00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:58,170
start-up called IBM I full-time

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,820
contribute to the node.js project but I

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,080
just want to mention you know everything

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,629
I'm saying in this talk is my own

00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,390
opinion it's not that of my employer so

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:07,979
now that the fun stuff is done and maybe

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,490
we should talk about what qualifies me

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,620
in particular to talk about empathy so I

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,920
have an undergraduate degree in fine art

00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,690
but you know that doesn't do it I have a

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,280
master's degree in music and you know

00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,560
that doesn't really matter to talk about

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,480
empathy either it turns out I can talk

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,710
about it because I'm a human being and

00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,620
we're all humans here and it's an

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:30,090
important thing for all of us so then

00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,540
that goes on to like what qualifies me

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,190
to talk about left pad so I work full

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,590
time on node but you know that doesn't

00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,360
really matter I noticed that you co

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,550
system breakage in about ten minutes but

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,950
that doesn't really matter I have an

00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,229
opinion a lot of people have those but

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,150
in your opinions don't matter nothing in

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,590
particular actually qualifies me to talk

00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:53,010
about it so I'll probably talk about it

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,979
very little but so what will we talk

00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:59,810
about today a brief overview of left pad

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,979
a definition of the word empathy empathy

00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:05,310
versus sympathy this is an interesting

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,940
one the neuroscience of empathy how are

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,500
hard-wired to actually experience it

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,760
learning empathy because it turns out

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,080
just because we're hardwired for

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,549
something doesn't mean we're really good

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,370
at it or heard of heard for a lot of

00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:19,769
things and then we'll talk about empathy

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,310
is an API developer and kind of tie this

00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:22,310
all back together

00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,980
it's a brief overview of left pad you

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,690
all probably know about what happened

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,570
there was a disagreement between

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,540
multiple parties a namespace was handed

00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:36,460
over to a copyright holder a model and a

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:42,850
module publisher unpublished all other

00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:45,400
modules chaos the result the community

00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,860
grabbed all the open namespaces modules

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,200
to avoid bad actors from doing bad

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,900
things the version of left pad that

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,550
broke everything was republished NPM

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,610
changed their unpublished policy to

00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:59,140
avoid this happening again the world

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,300
kept spinning and hackers kept on

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,980
hacking and we move forward this kind of

00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,310
showed how resilient our community is

00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,320
and how quickly things can move on so it

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,850
kind of asks you know like why are we

00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:16,080
still talking about it and so we're not

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:19,030
let's talk about a definition of empathy

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,190
so here's a spoiler the term empathy is

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,070
actually just over a hundred years old

00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:25,209
it's that English word empathy is a

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,910
hundred and eight years old that's

00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:30,519
pretty amazing you know this thing that

00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,230
if you went and looked online the

00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,580
Supreme Court in the United States is

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,200
having all these discussions about

00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,550
empathy Obama's campaign was built on

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,709
the idea that we need to be more

00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:42,280
empathetic it seems to be in our entire

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:44,860
zeitgeist empathy you know a hundred

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,290
years that's not a lot of time the

00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,780
etymology of the word though comes from

00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,660
the German word I'm feeling and I think

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:55,870
I said that right or right ish and the

00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,730
Greek word empathy ax I'm feeling is a

00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,680
little bit older but still only a couple

00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,390
hundred years old or like maybe a

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,320
hundred and fifty I have to double-check

00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,239
that but but this is this is a new word

00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,739
it's a new concept but it's also

00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:13,510
something that we've been trying to

00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:15,820
understand for hundreds of years and the

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,190
Icelandic word for empathy is Sam Kent

00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:21,040
that's at least the translation that I

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,410
found and it roughly translates to

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,110
togetherness and solidarity and I really

00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:28,330
like that definition but rather than

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,090
trying to define the word by just what

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,430
the word means let's talk about what it

00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,520
means in a deeper way and there's this

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,259
fantastic nurse Theresa Wiseman

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,660
who wrote a paper about empathy with

00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:44,280
patients and she defined the attributes

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:48,759
of empathy as understanding perspective

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:51,280
staying out of judgment recognizing what

00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,830
the other is feeling can you in

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,810
communicating it back it's important to

00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,449
be able to recognize what's happening to

00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,250
internalize it and to then you know

00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:03,210
bring that back to the individual that

00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:08,340
you're talking to empathy is feeling

00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:08,340
with people not for people

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:13,389
Theresa then claimed that it's the

00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:16,120
ability to empathize which distinguishes

00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:21,310
an average nurse from an excellent nurse

00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:23,229
in the eyes of a patient so perhaps it's

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,020
the ability to empathize which

00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:27,759
distinguishes the average developer from

00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:31,150
an excellent developer in the eyes of

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,889
others and just maybe it's the ability

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:35,500
to empathize that distinguishes an

00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:38,219
average human being from an excellent

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,810
human being in the eyes of the world

00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:42,190
you'll see a few of these there's a this

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,710
is a lot of concepts so we'll take a

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,960
little break and just let that sink in

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:54,310
think about what it meant and stare at

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:55,990
the cat so brené Brown did this amazing

00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,909
talk on the difference between empathy

00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,889
and sympathy and I could not personally

00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:03,159
if I wanted to do a better job so we're

00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:04,719
gonna watch a video really quickly about

00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:16,990
the difference between empathy and

00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:20,610
sympathy so what is empathy and why is

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:23,800
it very different than sympathy empathy

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:26,979
fuels connection sympathy drives

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,930
disconnection empathy it's a very

00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:33,009
interesting Teresa Wiseman is a nursing

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:34,330
scholar who studied professions very

00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:36,099
diverse professions where empathy is

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,219
relevant and came up with four qualities

00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:40,419
of empathy perspective-taking the

00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:42,340
ability to take the perspective of

00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:44,289
another person or recognize their

00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,509
perspective as their truth staying out

00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:49,350
of judgment not easy when you enjoy it

00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:51,490
as much as most of us do

00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:54,070
recognizing emotion and other people and

00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:57,940
then communicating that empathy is

00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:00,370
feeling with people and to me I always

00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,250
think of empathy is this kind of sacred

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:05,350
space when someone's kind of in a deep

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,200
hole and they shout out from the bottom

00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:11,290
and they say I'm stuck it's dark I'm

00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:14,860
overwhelmed and then we look and we say

00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:18,370
hey calm down I know what it's like down

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:24,180
here and you're not alone sympathy is

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:24,180
ooh it's bad uh-huh

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:32,290
no you want a sandwich if it he is a

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,330
choice and it's a vulnerable choice

00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,550
because in order to connect with you I

00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:40,690
have to connect with something in myself

00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:43,660
that knows that feeling rarely if ever

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:49,030
it does an empathic response begin with

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:51,100
at least I had it yeah and we do it all

00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:52,690
the time because you know what someone

00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,300
just shared something with us that's

00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:57,040
incredibly painful and we're trying to

00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,160
silver lining it I don't think that's a

00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,270
verb but I'm using it as one we're

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,900
trying to put this a little running

00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:06,370
around it so I had a miscarriage at

00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,380
least you know you can get pregnant I

00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,120
think my marriage is falling apart at

00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:12,120
least you'd have a marriage

00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:19,229
John's getting kicked out of school at

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,360
least Sarah is an A student but one of

00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:25,949
the things we do sometimes in the face

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,440
of very difficult conversations is we

00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:29,639
try to make things better if I share

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,150
something with you that's very difficult

00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,380
I'd rather you say I don't even know

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,310
what to say right now I'm just so glad

00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,860
you told me because the truth is rarely

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:42,839
can a response make something better

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:49,050
what makes something better is

00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:50,700
connection so you're going to notice a

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,200
lot of this stuff repeated through the

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,089
talk because I think this is really

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:57,120
important and the way to learn anything

00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:58,770
is through repetition in artistic

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,600
practice they call it a practice because

00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,550
you have to practice over and over to do

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,650
something so we're gonna have an

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,080
empathic practice today so I hope you

00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:09,930
don't mind the repetition but empathy is

00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,470
feeling with you and sympathy is feeling

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:18,270
for you empathy is about being present

00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:20,459
with someone empathy is a choice rarely

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,660
can a response make something better

00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:25,560
well make something better as connection

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,040
another tripping Kati break will let

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,040
that sit in

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,120
so let's talk a little bit about the

00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,300
neuroscience of empathy this parts

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,910
really cool a lot of these ideas come

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,130
from a fantastic talk by Jeremy Rifkin

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,570
I've embedded the youtube link inside of

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,360
the slide so if you go and find my

00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,529
slides online you can watch it we're not

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,029
going to watch this video because it's

00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:51,230
over ten minutes long it was kind of

00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,970
cheating to watch a three-minute video

00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:56,029
it's definitely cheating to watch a ten

00:09:52,970 --> 00:10:01,130
minute video but healthy brains are

00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:06,020
wired for empathy one such phenomenon is

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:09,890
known as mirror neurons so there was a

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:12,260
scientist who was watching monkeys and

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,450
watching monkeys eat peanuts and the

00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,830
monkeys were all wired up and they were

00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,200
watching which neurons in the brain

00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:21,380
would fire off from the monkey would eat

00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,120
a peanut and through trouble total

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,520
happenstance is most amazing things

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,200
happen they forgot to unwire the monkey

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,820
one day and on the day that they didn't

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,589
unwire the monkey a lab assistant

00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,870
decided to eat a peanut in front of the

00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:34,880
monkey and what they discovered was that

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,860
the exact same neurons in the monkeys

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,020
brain that fired off when the monkey ate

00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:41,480
the peanut fired off when it watched the

00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,850
scientist eat the peanut that's really

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,579
interesting the same part of our brains

00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,040
are active when we watch people doing

00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,390
things our brains don't necessarily know

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,250
the difference between the experience of

00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,430
ourselves and the experience of another

00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,540
person

00:10:54,430 --> 00:11:00,200
the Italian scientists that I was

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,970
talking about was giacomo rizzolatti and

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:07,279
he was a scientist at the University of

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:09,260
Parma Marco iacoboni professor of

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,200
psychiatry and bio and bio behavioral

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:14,300
sciences argued that mirror neurons are

00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:19,790
the neural basis of the human capacity

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:21,230
for the emotions such as empathy so even

00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:23,240
though we have this word that's only

00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:26,029
about a hundred and eight years old the

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,100
human race has this isn't something that

00:11:26,029 --> 00:11:30,110
our brain just developed well it

00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,000
probably developed up from time but but

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:34,779
we've been wired for this a lot longer

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,670
than we've had a word to describe it

00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:40,130
when a baby cries in a nursery and all

00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:43,670
the other babies join in this is called

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:45,379
empathic distress the babies don't know

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,689
any language to just

00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:50,720
a bit but just hearing something else

00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:53,809
cry folks that emotion to make everyone

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,269
else cry around the age of two and a

00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:58,369
half a child can actually begin to

00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:01,429
recognize themselves in the mirror and

00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:04,429
this starts with the idea of selfhood

00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:07,009
and it increases this empathic

00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:09,289
development at around eight years of age

00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:11,720
a child learns about life and death and

00:12:09,289 --> 00:12:13,549
they learn about vulnerability learning

00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,289
about this vulnerability gives people

00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:17,539
the ability to understand hey

00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:19,729
not only is there me and is my life

00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:22,279
sacred there's other people their lives

00:12:19,729 --> 00:12:24,199
are sacred to all these things that I'm

00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:26,329
experiencing other people are

00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:30,229
experiencing and this helps us develop

00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:33,019
the ability of of empathy once you

00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:35,479
realize you only have one life you can

00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:37,369
now feel others struggle you know that

00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:41,479
they have their own life and their own

00:12:37,369 --> 00:12:43,879
struggle so some philosophers such as a

00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:46,220
scope and power believe that empathic

00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,529
emotions such as compassion are possible

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:51,259
because we are all part of a greater

00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:53,899
ontological whole I really love that

00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:55,459
idea a lot of my own spirituality kind

00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,039
of comes from the idea that we're all

00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:59,869
part of this this greater thing I don't

00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:02,089
know what that is and I don't know that

00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:06,259
anyone really knows what it is but we're

00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:08,269
all kind of connected but it's important

00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:11,809
to remember that while our ability to

00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:14,269
feel empathy may be soft wire our

00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:16,909
ability to act on it is a lot trade

00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:19,309
we're wired for a lot of things we're

00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:23,239
wired for love we're wired for hate

00:13:19,309 --> 00:13:26,029
we're wired for hunger we're wired to be

00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:27,799
able to learn things but but even just

00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:30,769
learning as an example is something that

00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:33,709
you need to learn just because we are

00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:36,669
set up to empathize doesn't mean that we

00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:40,869
know what to do with those emotions

00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:40,869
another little break

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:52,190
so let's talk about learning empathy

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,380
expressing care for another is not an

00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,240
innate ability present more naturally in

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,890
some people than others but rather a

00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,450
skill that can be taught and nurtured

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:02,120
through a supportive educational

00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:05,380
environment this is from a paper that

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:10,220
you can find at the end of my slides

00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:11,690
McClellan proposes that we have to teach

00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,330
students we have to teach individuals

00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:16,490
how to empathize that part of our school

00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,890
system should be giving people the tools

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:22,010
that they need to empathize with

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:24,080
individuals and it turns out that

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:28,790
empathy was something that I had to

00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:30,800
learn so this is a younger me I see

00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:35,540
pretty great style I wish I still had

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,940
that sweater I was not exactly a problem

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:41,570
child but I wasn't you know the easiest

00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:44,240
person to get along with I wasn't really

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,790
observant of other people around me and

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,380
I went through a lot of life not having

00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:54,770
a ton of meaningful relationships for

00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:57,650
this and then I met Kristina she's wired

00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,850
very differently than I am she patiently

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,250
taught me how to be in zurvan

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,380
she's the kind of person who takes on

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:07,210
other people's emotions and it was just

00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:10,250
not something that was natural to me

00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:12,740
sharing my life with someone has made me

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,340
a better person and it's made me more

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,040
empathetic

00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:18,140
I personally improve that this can be

00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,000
learned just because you may not be

00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,820
great at it today doesn't mean that you

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,950
can't be great at it tomorrow and I want

00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,840
to even speculate but I don't have any

00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,060
scientific research to back me up on

00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,760
that individuals who are maybe not

00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:33,650
hardwired for empathy as much I believe

00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,700
that they can learn it with patience and

00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:40,070
with love it's important to remember

00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:43,040
that while our ability to feel empathy

00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:47,410
may be soft wire wired our ability to

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,590
act on it is a learnt trait ask yourself

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:55,220
Who am I

00:15:49,590 --> 00:16:00,410
who is the other how are they another

00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:03,779
how do we relate what do we share and

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:09,600
what do they need from me and I from

00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:11,430
them take a second this idea the other

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,250
is actually a really important one and

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:16,350
it's really baked into our culture of

00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:18,390
the world to think about other people as

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,940
an other and not as an ontological hole

00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:22,880
we have others in in religion we have

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:27,300
others in nation-states we have others

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,529
in that table versus this table but as

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:33,570
the saying goes we're not so different

00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:35,250
you and I so empathy as a developer and

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:39,150
how the heck does this have anything to

00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:42,300
do with left pad so there's three places

00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:44,580
to focus on here the first is having

00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,730
empathy for the people that you make

00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:50,160
things for the other is to have empathy

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:53,100
for the people that you make things with

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,500
and finally and it's not always so

00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:59,370
obvious is actually having empathy for

00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,530
yourself so having empathy for the

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:05,670
people you make things for how can we do

00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:08,250
that reliability is one people when

00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,560
they're consuming api's need to know

00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:13,439
that they can rely on you not breaking

00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:17,160
them this is actually a huge thing and

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,929
people can act irrationally when their

00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,520
things break and this was in my opinion

00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:21,959
one of the worst things that happen in

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,510
left pad there was a contract and that

00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,949
contract was broken all the other

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,620
emotions all the other pain kind of

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:30,360
stems from this in my own opinion is

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:32,880
people expect when they sit down to run

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,960
things that they'll work and that

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,890
contract that you have is not broken

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,320
performance and you'll notice that

00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,880
performance comes after reliability but

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,740
it's important that things will run on

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:48,120
people's systems and run performing Li

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:51,240
and that it will be fast but again this

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:54,720
should never be instead of being

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,610
reliable platform support supporting

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,160
lots of different platforms you need to

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,710
have empathy for the person running some

00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,890
random flavor of Linux you've never

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,570
heard of

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,000
they're trying to run your code too and

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:09,580
you don't necessarily know why or how

00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,270
and and simply saying don't fix or won't

00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:15,460
fix isn't always an answer and this is

00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,990
always the hardest one but if you're

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,300
building software that other people are

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,080
using to remember to build for your

00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:24,520
consumers and not for yourself

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,680
interesting problems are interesting and

00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,480
it can be really easy to spend all of

00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:31,750
your time trying to write the next cool

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,700
thing if the people who use your product

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,340
don't care about that that doesn't

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,920
really help there is a lone inventor

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:41,679
myth in technology and in the world at

00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,720
times we react as if you know there's

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,070
one person who knows more than everyone

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,750
else

00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,220
you know Steve Jobs and Apple is one

00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:51,340
example of that where it maybe worked

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,860
maybe Linux I don't know I don't really

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:57,220
believe in it myself people know what

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,960
they want and it's not really fair to

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,059
just go and change things because you're

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,010
interested in a problem especially if

00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:07,120
people are relying on you listen to them

00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,950
listen to the people that you're working

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,420
that you're making stuff for because

00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:15,220
they care and they know listen so how do

00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,880
you have empathy for the people that you

00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,440
make things with documentation and this

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,120
also seems like something that's for the

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,679
people who use your stuff but

00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,450
documentation is important also for

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,920
people who are coming into your project

00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,350
and want to work with you your

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:31,950
documentation of your process of your

00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:35,920
onboarding of your relief strategy

00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:37,630
documentation of how collaborators are

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,550
expected to work with each other your

00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:42,870
code of conduct all of these things need

00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:46,270
to be documented not just your AP is

00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:48,429
testing without tests people cannot

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,780
contribute no one wants to write code

00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:52,809
when they don't know that things are

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,460
gonna break tests are empathy it may not

00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:56,320
seem like it but your tests are a way

00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:00,100
that other people can work with you and

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,660
get things done onboarding how are you

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,580
onboarding people in the first day that

00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,170
they're contributing to your project how

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,540
about the first week in the first month

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:10,059
you can have a ton of empathy and really

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,220
help your project be successful if you

00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:14,260
can have this outline for people how do

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,760
people start contributing in the note

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,770
project we have a good first

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,570
Contribution label on github that you

00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:21,310
can click on they'll give you a list of

00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,830
issues that can be good to get started

00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:25,780
with once they've started doing that how

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,890
did things land once they've started

00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,550
contributing how do they get a

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:31,870
commitment having all of this documented

00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,580
as we were talking about earlier is

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,890
really important but also having

00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,660
everyone internally agree on this is

00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,070
really important these aren't the kind

00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:40,930
of things that you should be debating

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,160
and arguing about when people are just

00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,550
trying to get started in trying to

00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:49,450
contribute this is really important be a

00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:50,620
good ally and I would argue that being a

00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,210
good Ally one of the first things is

00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,410
never actually identifying as an ally

00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,780
and we could talk more about that later

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:58,000
if you're interested but being

00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,440
supportive and therefore the various

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,480
kinds of people who want to come in and

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,980
working on your project is one of the

00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,620
most important things that you can do

00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,630
sitting there and and looking at the

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,190
individuals and seeing what's blocking

00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,800
them seeing what's hurting them seeing

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:14,170
what's driving them away you need to fix

00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,570
that and you need to be willing to do

00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,940
the hard things to do that and again

00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,590
listen to them listen to the people that

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,630
you're working with if the people that

00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,820
you're working with have a problem or

00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,240
feel uncomfortable there's a reason for

00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,930
that

00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,820
and you need to change and having

00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,590
empathy for yourself and this is to me

00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,200
one of the most important parts because

00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:37,060
burnout is alive and well and I don't

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,990
know how many can I get a raise of hands

00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,690
of people who have felt like they've

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:46,620
burnt out before look around the room

00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:49,090
it's a real thing set healthy boundaries

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:51,310
you don't need to have an all green

00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:53,050
github chart I mean they remove that

00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,370
that streak thing and I think that's one

00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,500
of the most amazing thing and things

00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,560
they ever did but set healthy boundaries

00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:02,860
for yourself listen to your body if

00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:05,110
you're tired sleep one of the tricks

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,760
that I started doing when I went to grad

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:08,050
school was instead of trying to pull an

00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,640
all-nighter I would actually just go to

00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,410
sleep early and then would go to sleep

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,450
early and wake up super early and get a

00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:15,820
ton of work done in the morning if you

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,770
feel like you need to sleep sleep there

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,180
isn't any one thing unless you're

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,560
working in a mission-critical thing

00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,850
that's going to kill a human being there

00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:24,730
is nothing that's more important than

00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:27,130
taking care of yourself be aware of

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:29,510
impostor syndrome I still suffer from it

00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,220
every single day it's real

00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:33,080
easy when you're working on an

00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:35,090
interesting and difficult things and

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,320
surrounding yourself with more people

00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:39,110
who are working on interesting and

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,810
different difficult things to just feel

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,880
like you're not capable the amazing

00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,140
thing about the software role that I

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,610
would argue may be many other

00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,870
professions as well but I don't know as

00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,340
deeply is that we're really just

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,740
constantly learning all the things we

00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:54,470
don't know you can't be expected to know

00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,880
everything and at the same time you

00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:57,320
can't be expected to know all the things

00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,400
that your colleagues know that's why we

00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,920
work together because we all have

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,810
different skills stop psyching yourself

00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,770
out you're all awesome every single one

00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:07,640
of you I don't even need to meet you I

00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:10,340
know it listen to yourself don't doubt

00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,000
your gut your gut knows what to do and

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:15,890
if something feels wrong run with that

00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,120
figure out why it feels wrong if you

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:21,290
don't feel comfortable or something

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:25,700
listen to yourself so let's bring it all

00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:28,700
back before we wrap up here well we may

00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:31,540
be soft wired for empathy the term has

00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,830
only existed for about a hundred years

00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:36,080
Theresa's Wiseman's definition of

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,750
empathy and the attributes are

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,630
understanding perspective staying out of

00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:44,060
judgment recognizing what others are

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,640
feeling and communicating it back this

00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:48,740
is not the same as feeling for someone

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,720
this is feeling with them you don't even

00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,720
need to say anything you just need to

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,880
understand and be supportive it is

00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,160
important to remember while our ability

00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,720
to feel empathy may be soft wired our

00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:04,220
ability to act on it is a lunt trait

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:09,110
empathizing requires you to be

00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:12,020
vulnerable and that can be scary empathy

00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:14,060
is a choice and this is one of the most

00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,430
important things you have to choose to

00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,800
empathize with individuals it doesn't

00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:22,100
just happen

00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:24,710
ask not how am i unique but rather how

00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,170
are we the same break down those

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,270
barriers stop mothering we are all the

00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:36,560
same we are all on the spaceship earth

00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:39,200
together feel with people rarely can a

00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,670
response make something better what

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:47,600
makes something better is connection

00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:49,450
maybe what you say doesn't matter maybe

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,210
the only thing that matters in the end

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:55,330
are the relationships you built

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,330
