Title: Visnu Pitiyanuvath: HSL: The RGB You've Been Waiting For - JSConf Iceland 2016
Publication date: 2016-09-20
Playlist: JSConf Iceland 2016
Description: 
	RGB is a color space designed for CRTs. It's not designed for people brains. HSL is designed for people and loves you. I've got some highly interactive slides to teach people what HSL is and make it intuitive.

hello so like miles yesterday we has he

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,250
has a beginning slide to Center himself

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,660
I thought I would play a song to more

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,060
center you not me because this is

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,820
totally nerve-wracking to be playing in

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:36,900
front of people but but we'll see how

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:41,030
this goes what's the song about rainbows

00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,030
by the way which is ties into this

00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:08,979
oh man I messed up I'm just gonna stop

00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:11,649
and I'll play a song later it might be

00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:18,580
better cuz I yeah that's okay that was

00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:21,250
scary okay so colors um I really like

00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,830
colors um I hope all of you like colors

00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,740
because you hear who uses hsl kind of

00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:29,110
today a lot doing that okay love you

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:32,560
people cuz you're near and dear to my

00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:34,420
heart who uses RGB a lot still okay

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,289
great love you people too because I can

00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:40,300
impose my world view on you so hopefully

00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:43,990
by the end of this talk you will decide

00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:46,990
because of my my glam I plenty of

00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:50,289
evidence that you should be using hsl so

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,659
RGB was RGB it's red green and blue so

00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:55,119
these are this is an orange let's

00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:59,170
simplify this a little bit so this is

00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:03,149
red so the problem here often is like

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:06,000
you have like a red and you want a lets

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:08,350
you want a lighter version of that color

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,390
so when you're when you're just in red

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,390
green or blue it's pretty simple like

00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:16,959
100 here you add some to that and you

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,630
get a lighter red and that makes kind of

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,739
intuitive sense so same same math works

00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,590
out pretty easily if you're dealing with

00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:26,440
pure green clear blue but you end up

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,760
getting into weird weird areas here when

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,579
like you're trying to do the same thing

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,170
with like this orange if you kind of

00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:34,870
apply that same into it is kind of like

00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:38,109
I'm just going to add some numbers to

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:40,390
this to this RGB triplet you end up like

00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:43,180
you get a lighter color but it's not

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:45,070
orange anymore to yellow now and so say

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,320
i don't know like this blue it was zero

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:48,850
i'm not going to add to zero i'm going

00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,820
to leave it 0 doesn't really help you

00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,470
you're still yellow and really what

00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,530
you're trying to do is you want this

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:58,720
this here to go from this orange so this

00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,160
lighter orange but this doesn't make

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,799
sense anymore like you're adding her

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,690
like some red you're adding actually a

00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:08,709
lot of blue and you're not adding much

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:10,600
green so that that really to me doesn't

00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:12,100
make any sense and I don't think it

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:18,220
makes sense to humans

00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:20,740
so what's going on here so RGB is if you

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,590
look at a monitor if you take like a big

00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,660
magnifying glass to this monitor where

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:26,860
you go like stare up in that like that

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,080
projector up there and hopefully not go

00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:32,260
blind then you're going to see like a

00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,180
pixel is made up of four LEDs you get

00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,500
like a red LED a green LED and a blue

00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,930
LED and they're really close together

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,600
and they're really small and they turn

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:44,110
on and off at different like

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:47,860
brightnesses and so what they could be

00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:49,300
off at zero or fully on at 255 and so a

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,050
different weight like a different

00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,370
intensities and since they're so small

00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,560
and far away from your eye your eye

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,060
kinds like doesn't perceive them anymore

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,190
and the light ends up adding together

00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,840
and the light is really what's going on

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,100
and mixing together to kind of form a

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,240
different wavelengths when it hits your

00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:09,400
eye so so yeah if you if you deal with

00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,550
mixing lasers together all day long then

00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,750
you should use our gb if not then i

00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,239
would say that it's not cool anymore

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:20,770
it's not cooled and be memorizing RGB

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,810
hex triplets to impress your friends RGB

00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,790
is not like brewing your own small batch

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,310
coffee with a cordless screwdriver

00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:31,300
microcontroller it's more like this guy

00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:32,980
on his commute in San Francisco on his

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,630
bus doing a line of cocaine off his

00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:41,980
iphone our CP is it's not so uncool

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:43,030
that's cool again it's not cool um I'm

00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,280
actually wondering what like this guy

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,800
sneaking out here he's like oh that's

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:52,480
good behind me oh he must be using RGB

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:55,990
too ok so RGB is a color space or color

00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:57,940
mode or color model which I learned

00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:59,380
yesterday where other names for it so

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,070
what is a color space sounds kind of

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,170
scary but not too scary it's like XYZ so

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,840
kind of like Cartesian coordinates if I

00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,360
say that corner over the room 000 to get

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,160
to me you come like 100 feet along this

00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:15,430
wall sorry about the imperial units I'm

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,990
a uninformed American like a meter to

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,640
this way and like two or three meters up

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,060
to my head and I can tell you where I am

00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,180
in the room and so similarly to hear if

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,860
I kind of increased the red hear it

00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,810
goes along this axis and because my red

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,789
if i increase the blue it kind of comes

00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,370
off that that axis and it's kind of like

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:35,100
a purple and I can kind of come up and I

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,800
can see like there's this nice salmon

00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,810
color here and you can kind of see this

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,610
entire space of color and it's cool so

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,289
you can like reference it's a good way

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,030
to reference colors um you get all these

00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:47,130
Reds over here you get that graze up

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:51,030
through the middle and I saw a blue

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:53,280
corner but again to kind of go back to

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,070
the analogy of kind of or that example

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,690
of lightning a color I was like at this

00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:01,440
orange and I really wanted to get like

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,490
over here kind of and what we were doing

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,900
is like we were kind of going up

00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:09,360
straight this way so that direction and

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,759
that angle there like it it doesn't

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,349
really make sense and it's analogous to

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,990
like this position of where I am in the

00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:17,580
room I want to tell everybody like an

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:18,810
emergency to exit through that door over

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,320
there I'm not going to be like oh you

00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,729
know like a hundred feet that way and on

00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,349
the wall and if I'm telling you in

00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,849
relation to me I feel like these vector

00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:28,889
math and I give you a relative vector

00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:30,150
and that doesn't make any sense really

00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,760
what I'm trying to say is like to my

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,800
right I'll hundred feet that way right

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,080
and so that's polar coordinates if you

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,599
remember from like I don't know sixth

00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,720
seventh grade geometry which I remember

00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,490
learning and thinking like this is weird

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,409
but the one takeaway I remember from

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:48,330
polar coordinates is that if you kind of

00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:50,190
reframe your problem or kind of change

00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:54,240
is a problem statement actually ends up

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:56,789
with sometimes simpler answers like this

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,400
where like I can say to my right and 100

00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:01,650
feet so that's kind of why I want you

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,919
here so I would say let's make our own

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:06,509
color space what do I want out of this

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:08,669
color space is I want to be able to

00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,650
communicate to another person somewhat

00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:13,139
intuitively like what color I'm talking

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:16,380
about and I want to make like performing

00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,610
tasks on those colors more intuitive for

00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,840
so you can like reason about it from

00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:24,180
first principles and so how would we do

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,370
that so let's for example if I won't

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,680
want to describe the color of Jake the

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,240
dog here he's like a must so if I'm

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,279
gonna try to tell you the color of Jake

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,779
the dog out I wouldn't give you our GP

00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:37,710
triplet i would i would probably say you

00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:37,830
know he's like mustard yellow or to kind

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,090
of

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:42,120
break that down a little he's yellow

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,650
kind of like a muted yellow and kind of

00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,960
darker especially compared to like this

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,970
yellow in this rainbow back here so

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,870
let's break down kind of what I more

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:53,880
naturally did to describe that color

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,470
let's take that rainbow which I alluded

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,470
to at the very beginning with that badly

00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,330
played song and just put into an array

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,750
of because we like to put things into

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,310
arrays of let's start with 12 colors so

00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:09,890
I get the entire rainbow here this is

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:14,340
roy g biv so red orange yellow greens

00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:15,930
some random cyan a blue maybe this is

00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,380
indigo maybe this is violet who knows

00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:21,810
and if I kind of just increase the

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:24,600
number of buckets here we get to a nice

00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:27,480
little rainbow and as you notice like

00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,660
these are kind of thirds so red is at

00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,750
zero greens at a third blues at a third

00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:36,750
and kinda you get back to read so I'm

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,760
just ignore ignore why I'm doing 360 but

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,110
i'm going to go 360 because it does make

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,090
dividing this in the Third's a little

00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:44,760
easier this is 120 so greens at 120

00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:48,360
blues at 240 and it kind of wraps around

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,910
at 360 back the red so that specifies a

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,160
color like on a rainbow great that's one

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,670
large step so how do I talk about kind

00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,500
of like the color of the sky or like the

00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:02,250
muted sea green so if I want to like

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:05,280
describe the nice mute like cast over or

00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:09,390
overcast the blue outside for the sky I

00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:12,030
need to talk about saturation so if I

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:14,750
pick a color on this rainbow like this

00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:18,810
this nice little blue here pretty close

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:20,520
and then I want to like yeah on the

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,500
scale of one to ten I'd say the sky is

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,150
somewhere around like a five today at

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,060
least earlier now it's actually a lot

00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:28,380
brighter and again like to work with

00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:33,270
more colors here let's just go up to a

00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:35,130
hundred ok so now that gives us a lot of

00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:38,250
vocabulary ready so it gives us again a

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:41,580
hue a color from the rainbow and then

00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,560
kind of how colorful that is and at that

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,910
at the end of the spectrum spectrum at

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,520
zero it's like the lack total lack of

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,900
the color so gray so you'll be you'll

00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,030
notice that you were missing black and

00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,779
white here to kind of talk about black

00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,670
and white

00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,499
I would kind of say it's kind of how

00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,689
much light is falling on color how

00:09:55,499 --> 00:09:58,949
bright the room is in a sense so if we

00:09:57,689 --> 00:10:00,720
turned off all the lights in here it

00:09:58,949 --> 00:10:03,509
would be all black and we be in darkness

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,370
if we turn the lights way up to like

00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:08,999
crazy levels we'd all be blinded and we

00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:11,819
just see white that's my story anyway so

00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:14,370
again same get the gate 1 i'm going with

00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:16,439
this so let's go to scale 100 0 to 100

00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,680
at the total lack of light where

00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:22,019
darkness and at full-on lightness we're

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,339
all blind and we see white I'm at 50 is

00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,879
like that nice sweet spot where like you

00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:31,319
see all the colors in the room nicely ok

00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:35,910
let's put all together so that I just

00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:38,879
backed out hsl so hue saturation and

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:42,209
lightness that's why it just all stands

00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:44,220
for so again you can kind of see how

00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:47,279
everything ties like this is RGB down

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:49,769
here and this is hsl appear you can kind

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,449
of see how if I change like rotate

00:10:49,769 --> 00:10:53,279
through is Hughes how like the RGB

00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:56,069
values kind of move around a little bit

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,750
in a weird way goes through like some

00:10:56,069 --> 00:11:01,139
weird permutations if I pick a color

00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,309
here and like a brightness here and I

00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,000
kind of so if I go to like full

00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:09,300
saturation so this this pink actually

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:14,790
want to use let's use it's like blue

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:17,220
again so if i'm at like fulbright so if

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,230
i start down here and i slowly ramp this

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,649
up i see blue and green going up but no

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:24,959
red and as i keep getting further like

00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:27,059
red finally starts to kick in and it

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,350
kind of goes higher so that it kind of

00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:29,970
makes sense again I'm not going to be

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,519
able to tell you what color would cause

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,199
what to happen the other cool thing may

00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,910
like relationship that kind of makes

00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:38,309
sense is as you go from like full

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:39,899
saturation down the left saturation

00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:43,019
these like red green and blue is kind of

00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:46,160
all merge together which again maybe

00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:48,629
make sense if you if you play with this

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,800
it so great so I can specify color

00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:55,800
hopefully more intuitively than RGB to

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,249
another person so what about making

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,079
doing some stuff with those colors so

00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:04,050
back to the original example just

00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,279
lightening this orange so I have human

00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,389
saturation specified

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,540
and all I do is increase the lightness

00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:14,790
so that's a lighter version of orange

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:17,189
this is me at the dentist with my

00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:19,199
hygienist Linda and my little dog Coco

00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:22,740
who likes to go with me and make sure

00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:25,499
that Linda's not going to mess me up and

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,899
so if I went a nice gray scale version

00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:30,300
of this photo I would just desaturate

00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:34,889
these colors and I get this this more

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:36,779
timeless photo or like in my just one

00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:39,629
like maybe a cool washed out version i

00:12:36,779 --> 00:12:41,819
can go to like around here so that's

00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:44,339
great scaling a photo that's cool um and

00:12:41,819 --> 00:12:46,079
if you saw Amy's talked yesterday about

00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,230
making art or you played with the lights

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,749
in the other room this also comes up

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,910
often is they were using it yourself for

00:12:51,749 --> 00:12:55,319
a very specific reason and that's

00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:58,319
actually if you've ever tried to like

00:12:55,319 --> 00:13:00,959
make a color palette with RGB it doesn't

00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:03,620
make any sense like everything else but

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,449
if you just okay so say let's pick yeah

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,399
like a nice red all right I kind of like

00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:10,740
this like this cool looking red right

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,420
here I like this red based on saturation

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,059
lightness values I just pick and I just

00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,889
rotate through all the hues I end up

00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:20,730
with like colors that kind of fit

00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:22,259
together and they they they go together

00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,629
if you tried to do this without you be

00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:28,170
you end up with all these weird colors

00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:30,000
that just don't look right okay

00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,850
hopefully I've convinced you that hsl is

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,879
really awesome and you want to use it so

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:38,160
how do you use it so it's already kind

00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,939
of everywhere you guys cough website

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,579
check out the body so this is in RGB hex

00:13:41,939 --> 00:13:46,050
triplet if you mouse over this it even

00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:49,589
tells you now you can shift click and

00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:54,000
you can see all these different color

00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:56,819
space things and you can edit this and

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,069
if I just kind of change the hue it goes

00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:01,290
through all the hues so that's pretty

00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:06,329
cool and so all the tools that you use

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:08,610
that support RGB I'm i will bet you some

00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:10,350
money maybe not a lot of money but some

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,470
money that they will also support hsl

00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,079
and CSS like sports hsl all the browsers

00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:18,870
support hsl you can just write that out

00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,170
and so there's some maybe not support

00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,389
forward

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,810
a preprocessor or other thing will

00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:29,490
actually just translate it for you okay

00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:32,190
so ah so I was just telling you all

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,110
these cool things about hsl so if you

00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,639
were to say take all the people in the

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,370
world that we're really excited about

00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,570
like color and lighting and like they

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,740
have conferences together they're

00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:44,760
actually called the commission

00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:48,660
internationale de lis damage or cie for

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,880
short it's kind of like all of us except

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,940
who really geeked out about color and

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,470
lighting and like how the eye works and

00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,670
they like get together and have

00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:00,180
conferences except they call them

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,320
symposiums and and they talk about all

00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,149
the stuff so they actually have they

00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,120
publish their own color space it's

00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:09,990
called cie lab that is actually probably

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:13,680
cooler than hsl um it's like the new the

00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:18,990
new Frank Ocean album of hsl not con

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,850
Yenny well he's so passe oh so so if you

00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:23,449
want to talk about cool color spaces i

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:26,370
would love to talk to you about lab and

00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:30,180
let's see i do want to end on a song

00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:33,329
okay are there any Elvis Presley fans in

00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:35,010
the audience okay good oh sorry then I

00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:40,220
apologize ahead of time because i'm

00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:43,550
going to do injustice to his song okay

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,550
let's see

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:46,370
would it be I guess like a.j scoff has

00:16:40,810 --> 00:17:15,679
surely too much react dan so it goes

00:16:46,370 --> 00:17:21,079
that something take my advice all right

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:28,150
everyone like a.j is conf has surely too

00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:47,530
much react and so it goes that something

00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:47,530
to my word take my own advice cuz i can

00:17:49,510 --> 00:18:01,840
using H and sell high kiss no using H

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:26,840
falling in love with you right ah so

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:30,049
thank you my name is Disney um these

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,850
slides are at this nugget hub that I oh

00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:35,330
that's my name with a p on the end

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:38,929
github you probably use it I owe some

00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:40,880
islands hsl so this is actually this is

00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,590
this kind of reasons a blog post if you

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,330
actually go go through these slides so

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,919
if you are too lazy to convince your

00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,200
coworker and you're convinced also of

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,340
yourself that you should use hsl you can

00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,679
point them as these slides and they

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,970
should make some some sense by

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,970
