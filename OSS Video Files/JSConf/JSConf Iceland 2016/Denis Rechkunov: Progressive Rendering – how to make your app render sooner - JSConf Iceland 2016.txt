Description: 
	Time To First Byte (TTFB) is a measurement used for the responsiveness of a web-server. TTFB measures the duration from the user or client making an HTTP request to the first byte of the page being received by the client's browser.

This value has a high impact on the perceived performance of your web application. This makes TTFB an important metric as it directly correlates with your customers happiness and willingness to stay and interact with your application, especially if your app needs much time to request data for building a page.

I'll talk about Node.js streams, the progressive rendering approach and how we can use them to make our web-app look blazing fast.
