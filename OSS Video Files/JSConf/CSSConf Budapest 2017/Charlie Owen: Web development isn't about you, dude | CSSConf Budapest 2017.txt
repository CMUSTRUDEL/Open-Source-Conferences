Title: Charlie Owen: Web development isn't about you, dude | CSSConf Budapest 2017
Publication date: 2018-02-16
Playlist: CSSConf Budapest 2017
Description: 
	One of the hardest lessons to embrace in web development is that not everyone is like you. It can come as a shock to learn that for the average web dev - young, male, surrounded by the cutting edge of tech, and with a high disposable income. But the truth is that many people are poor, have old devices, have slow data connections. Many people simply can’t use computers the way you do.

“But we don’t cater for those kind of people!”, you might cry. Well, this talk will demonstrate how you haven’t got the luxury of assuming that. Because how someone interacts with your site is completely out of your control, and this talk will show you the many ways your assumptions can fail. But it will also show how coding empathically with this in mind will let you produce sites that are usable by all and are robust in the face of anything the weird wild web can throw at them.

hello hello can you what you can all

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,819
hear me you can alright that's good

00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,500
right

00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,860
fantastic thank you for that wonderful

00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:13,679
introduction from Kevin um I'm a

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,230
front-end designer developers you might

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,220
have heard and as you might also be able

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,769
to guess my accent I am also British but

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,779
please don't worry I'm actually one of

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:28,920
those British people who likes Europe

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:31,279
unlike everybody else in my country and

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,739
that's why I live in Berlin which is

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,480
such a beautiful amazing place but I was

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:39,510
attracted by certain things they

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,020
attacked it's got some the best food on

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,329
the planet

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,960
really quite gourmet quality food which

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:48,120
I love it's a very conservative and

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,420
quiet place where people keep to

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,699
themselves and it's just generally be

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,219
German it's gotta be nice quiet

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:59,640
respectable attitude so I love living

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,399
there and then the Berlin I word for

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,189
spring to nature as a senior front-end

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,860
dev and if you haven't heard of spring a

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,930
nature it's actually one of the largest

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,010
academic and scientific publishers on

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,509
the planet so should have heard of them

00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,939
justified by med central Scientific

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:21,299
American and the eponymous journal

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,710
Nature that kind of place where you get

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,659
published in there it's Nobel Prize

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,700
territory for you and he helps

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,770
scientists to get their work seen by

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,250
other scientists and the community in

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,939
general and I really love it there but I

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,040
didn't come to talk to you about that I

00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:40,650
I came to have just a quick chat about

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,740
the single biggest invention in human

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,600
history so hopefully I can go through

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:52,320
this in 30 minutes and it should be fine

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:54,030
it's no biggie and I just want to riff a

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,399
little bit on Jeremy Keith he he does

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,670
something based somewhere and I just

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:04,409
want to talk about the web about how

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:07,290
utterly incredible it is and it's

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,349
incredible because of its Dominus it

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,550
really is done it's stupid and that's

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,950
what makes amazing

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,830
it's a bunch of dumb stupid technologies

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,370
put together and they come to make

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,200
something amazing so I'm just going to

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:26,580
talk very quickly about some of those

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,920
things and I think we can safely say it

00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,390
started with Telegraph's yeah

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,210
everybody's familiar with what

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:36,210
Telegraph's I love the B beebeep beebeep

00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,590
kind of things yeah yeah and these

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:41,150
things completely changed the face of

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,340
global communication I mean we went from

00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:47,460
weeks it would take to send a message

00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:51,270
anywhere in the planet to seconds there

00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:53,520
was such an incredible change and the

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,470
Telegraph allowed the invention of the

00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,550
telephone you know people want to get in

00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:59,330
on the act they wanted to get their

00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:03,570
voices heard and that use the same wires

00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:06,450
and then those telephones allowed the

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,620
invention of computer networks not

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,870
obviously we had to invent the computer

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,600
first but we those computers could then

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,040
communicate with each other and I don't

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,959
know if anyone else is blessed with

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,350
being gold enough to remember this

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,490
particular movie wargames Ike you

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,770
remember stuff with the acoustic

00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:26,010
couplers you put the mode that telephone

00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:28,140
on the modem then the modem screamed

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,940
another computer somewhere in the

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,250
distance and then that computer screen

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:35,120
back and they were all screaming

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,570
together and that allowed this whole

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,950
distributed network thing to happen and

00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:44,130
then we standardized things we

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,920
standardized with tcp/ip and computers

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,830
could talk to each other and eventually

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,860
they all merge together they form the

00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:56,750
interconnected networks the internet big

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,850
story by itself and then we built

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:02,190
application protocols on top of this no

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,500
common things to enable us to do this

00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:08,670
stuff that we do every day email and DNS

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,820
and HTTP and we had to figure out ways

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,920
for those to communicate so we had you

00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,100
our alleys which allowed you no

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,540
standardized ways of finding things so

00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,780
you might have you know whitehouse.gov

00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,729
or

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,510
ultimate idiots at whitehouse.gov but it

00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:32,600
could be anything

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:36,950
on that and then finally HTML vague but

00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:40,260
exciting as Tim berners-lee boss said

00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:43,350
seriously understating the whole

00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:46,320
foundation of our careers here in the

00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:51,390
world and that but a world change in

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,390
this of it and I think we should stop

00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:58,650
for a second and think about the web

00:04:53,390 --> 00:05:02,310
about how amazingly strong it is and

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,500
it's strong because of that dullness we

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:08,120
mentioned because of all these dumb

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,120
technologies that have come together

00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:19,970
especially HTML which is this simple

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:23,820
very simple declarative language and by

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:29,750
declarative well what do we mean by that

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:34,170
I guess you could say that's suggestive

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:36,720
HTML suggests to the browser what it

00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:39,300
wants to happen it's all like hey could

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,880
you maybe do this for me and the browser

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,820
comes back with oh yeah now yes nicely

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,990
yeah maybe I could do that it's got a

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,010
little bit of flirting again it's a

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:52,770
little bit of suggestiveness

00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:56,900
but this suggestiveness is what makes

00:05:52,770 --> 00:06:00,600
the web and HTML incredibly robust

00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:04,230
because you can pull a page apart as

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,730
it's running you can go in that it's

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,560
like the Terminator man you just can't

00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,500
stop it you can go in there and rip its

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,440
guts out you can remove 90% of the code

00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,700
from page but the end of it you can

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:21,450
still click a button and proceed with it

00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:26,340
and that robustness is why the web

00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:30,810
dominates a stricter language would have

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:33,630
broken 100% it would have fallen over

00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:36,150
it's so fragile what is shattered as

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,850
soon as it encountered a huge error like

00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:42,460
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:46,240
it's code but it's been removed and in

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:49,420
addition to that the web is well it's

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,690
unrestricted and in the early days

00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:56,500
anyone can build a browser and anyone

00:06:52,690 --> 00:07:01,870
could get a browser for any machine or

00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:06,550
any operating system and that meant that

00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:08,680
anyone could publish things and the

00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:12,450
early web was weird

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,400
it was fantastic for that weirdness

00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:18,100
people used to just get the brain dumps

00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:22,630
onto HTML page and put it out there in

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:27,940
public they said declare their love for

00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:30,520
things and people and even some famous

00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:36,690
Souls you know got their early starts up

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:40,710
and they're on the early weird web but

00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:42,910
unfortunately some darker times came

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:46,020
possibly more dark than I thought that

00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:46,020
given the contrast issues

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:54,180
what used to be free and weird suddenly

00:07:50,890 --> 00:08:00,250
became balkanized and commercialized and

00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:02,650
completely locked in I don't know if

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:04,750
anybody here is again blessed with the

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:08,920
age have been able to remember this

00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:12,220
particular stuff the web at one point

00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,740
got split between these two browsers and

00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:17,890
devs effectively had to build two

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:23,320
versions of their sites in order to cope

00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:25,390
with this and users how to like declare

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,870
loyalty to one particular browser and

00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:33,400
stick with it it was a weird time of

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:36,060
just like frozen innovation and in fact

00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:40,000
everything froze development froze

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:43,860
innovation stopped and resumed really

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,860
weird crappy time for a number of years

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:56,220
but history restarted from an unexpected

00:08:50,290 --> 00:09:00,160
direction when the first iPhone appeared

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,650
and while it wasn't the first smartphone

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,610
certainly it was certainly the first

00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:11,830
popular one and he gave us this huge

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:13,840
enormous diversity lesson because we've

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:16,840
been assuming up until that point that

00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:20,290
our site had to work in you know one of

00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:22,240
two browsers effectively and they

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,720
couldn't cope with this new diversity of

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,180
things and so we had to learn things

00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,280
like responsive web design ether my

00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:34,240
codes grades like synthesis of a few

00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:38,680
simple dumb techniques again because we

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,930
didn't want to exclude people we didn't

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,470
want to stop people from using our

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,470
websites

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,600
and while I'm not an Apple over by any

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,970
means

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,680
despite laptop it was a gift to us

00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:57,110
these were really good times because we

00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:01,130
were suddenly designing with all kinds

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:09,620
of devices in mind it was the ultimate

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:15,020
of the web but are we starting this

00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:19,850
cycle again maybe with different aspects

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:21,640
different technology reasons but with

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:25,160
the same result

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,320
which is that suddenly we're starting to

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:33,680
exclude people from the web

00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:37,730
again we suddenly got websites that

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:41,240
require megabytes to download just like

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,610
how we talked about earlier this is this

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,220
is incredible

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:50,920
basic information science with text

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,920
content not YouTube not videos

00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:58,790
accessibility who is that it's still a

00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:02,510
complete unknown to most people it's

00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:06,560
somehow not a core requirement of being

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:11,240
a front-end developer somehow it doesn't

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:16,450
appear on on our job applications and it

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:18,760
should be one of the core skills and

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:22,880
this is not going to be popular

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:29,800
JavaScript as a default delivery

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,800
mechanism just to deliver HTML

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:35,320
now I'm going to take a moment to just

00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:40,440
ran to you a little bit because here to

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:43,750
me this feels like building a Boeing 747

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,540
to commute to work you know build their

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:49,680
plane up take it up into the sky land

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:52,030
it's two kilometers away which is

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,980
technically amazing and I've got such

00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:56,230
awe and love with you for you for doing

00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:00,970
that but what didn't you have been

00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:02,920
better getting a bicycle you know we

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:08,050
should have this layered approach to

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:12,130
things it's HTML CSS JavaScript and it's

00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:16,300
led to this weird situation now West

00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:18,430
sites are no longer robust like we saw

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,710
earlier it used to be the case where all

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:24,550
sites could just run no matter if

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:28,420
they're in it to a website but now sites

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:32,490
die easily they're fragile and they

00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:36,580
shatter things like Network conditions

00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:40,050
user choices blocked JavaScript can all

00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:40,050
destroy a site

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:46,770
and maybe as a response to this we've

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,220
got this whole new focus

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:54,150
we know talk about tooling and packaging

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,890
and ecosystem stuff which don't get me

00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:58,440
wrong I mean I use this every day I use

00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:02,480
webpack I use NPM I write modular

00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:06,780
JavaScript I get why we need this stuff

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:11,580
but the focus has become on developer

00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:14,940
happiness on us having fun and the word

00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:18,120
uses despite these talks that we've had

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,790
today would have been superb the word

00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:26,310
uses from the general consensus in the

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:28,680
industry has disappeared and we're back

00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:33,270
to building sites that are not for

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:38,510
everybody we're starting to explicitly

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:42,470
say my site is not for some users

00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:42,470
because we won't have our fun

00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:52,320
so maybe it's time to stop this kind of

00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:56,160
cycle which is a common one in tech

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,459
let's face it I mean remember when we

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:04,889
reinvented IRC just so we could have gif

00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:09,170
ease in there or we reinvented RSS and

00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:09,170
called it's accelerated mobile pages

00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:17,579
we're afraid to build on top of things

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:20,310
now we just want to disrupt it's about

00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:25,370
the prestige and the money and the bling

00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:25,370
and it's not about the people anymore

00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:30,899
but you know maybe that's just life

00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:36,779
under late-stage capitalism and we

00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:40,260
should just accept that well maybe not

00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:42,959
maybe that's a bit negative there are

00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:47,250
things that we can actually do before

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:50,640
it's too late so what can we do to break

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:56,070
break this cycle how can we make the web

00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:59,660
better again well firstly we can learn

00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:03,449
the basics and I don't mean of

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:08,370
technology here I mean about people

00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:11,060
I mean about human things such as

00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,100
empathy

00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:16,330
and we've got this assumption that

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:18,950
empathy is some kind of innate traits

00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:22,610
that you're either born with it or

00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,740
you're not born with it and that is such

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:28,690
a lie

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:32,810
empathy is a muscle it's a learner will

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:38,270
that you can reinforce every day just by

00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:41,060
practicing it and practicing this

00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:44,270
empathy allows us to be more aware of

00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:47,840
other people's needs become aware that

00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:52,990
not everyone is like us here like us

00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:56,840
here in this room right now because

00:15:52,990 --> 00:16:00,170
we're genuinely quite rich people in

00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:02,630
this industry I know we don't always

00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,670
feel like it right now I literally

00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:08,390
stopped paying off my student loans last

00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,860
year I feel you on this but in the

00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:12,740
assumptions that we make about things

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,340
for example how many people here of

00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,930
Gotland

00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,840
the latest technology I've got the

00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:21,560
latest MacBook how many people here have

00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:26,120
got the latest iPhone X on order for

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:28,550
next month not everyone else is like

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:34,390
this the rest of the world doesn't think

00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:37,580
in these ways and yet we do and in fact

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:41,300
we kind of make these idiots into the

00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:45,830
norm for things when they're not and

00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:50,270
we've got to be better than that so what

00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:52,520
else can we consider we can consider the

00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:54,970
fact that not everyone is well connected

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,970
in the world

00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,920
and I think sometimes we consider a poor

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,800
connection to be something like this

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,230
they must be autumns poor person in a

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,290
hut somewhere you know you know there's

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:10,600
poor poor people which is a bit of a

00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:15,940
weird racist thing because the actual

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:19,000
reality is this I saw statistic the

00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:22,839
other day there was something like 30%

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:28,000
of rural America is still on dial-up

00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:30,700
internet 56 kilobits per second is a

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,380
standard for huge numbers of people in

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:36,820
the richest country on the planet and

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,190
again we had Harry talking about this

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,170
earlier what the realities of the

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:46,390
internet connection are for people

00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:46,780
around the planet another step in

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:49,870
empathy

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:54,160
you know maybe we've got to consider

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:57,610
that not everybody is able but it in

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,540
fact 12% of all people have a disability

00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:03,310
of some form or another and that's not

00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,930
just things like wheelchairs and

00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:08,310
blindness you know the stereotypes that

00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:12,670
we think of now she covers huge areas

00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:16,960
stuff like color blindness arthritis the

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:20,500
use of crutches we've just got to keep

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:23,140
these things in mind constantly because

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:27,900
our job at the end of the day is about

00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:32,590
building things for other people it's

00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:35,370
fundamentally about empathy that is the

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,370
core of our job

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,440
okay so maybe you've listened to these

00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:45,260
things and maybe you take them on board

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,940
so how can you start using them in the

00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:51,340
real world

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,340
what does building with empathy mean

00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:59,600
well it's this doorknobs

00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:02,690
I know doorknob calm Budapest now both

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,299
of these doorknobs are absolutely lovely

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,650
I'm sure we can all agree in that we

00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:11,059
don't discriminate against doorknobs

00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:14,390
here but one of these works for

00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:19,070
everybody on the planet while the other

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:21,530
one excludes people excludes people who

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:26,080
might have arthritis who might be

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:26,080
amputees or who might be using crutches

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:33,679
and if we start thinking in this kind of

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:36,200
mindset just with that simple example we

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,929
start helping more people again as we

00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:42,590
heard earlier we start helping things

00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:45,080
other than just the obvious case so

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,970
designing a door handle in a proper way

00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,520
you know actually helps people who were

00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:53,679
carrying large loads were carrying bags

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,679
who've got a baby in their arms

00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,530
and you can take this empathy into the

00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:06,010
workplace and try to get it in there

00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:09,670
from the beginning by progressively

00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:13,450
designing and that means starting right

00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:16,960
at the very start sketching things with

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:20,380
UX people testing ideas with people

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,510
before you ever touch code Before we

00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,150
jump in with the latest exciting

00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,520
technology that we've heard about just

00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:34,390
stop and think about how a person will

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:41,760
use it and then then you can get those

00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:44,620
ideas into HTML and I do mean just HTML

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:50,710
you know the traditional thing with

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:55,030
forms and hate wands and no styling test

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:59,950
if this kind of stuff works with real

00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:04,290
people again because this hTML is going

00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,290
to be the foundation of your website

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,960
and why should you do it like this well

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,610
if you build it this way from the start

00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:19,650
you're checking the basics from the

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:22,860
start and because HTML is super generous

00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:25,290
it gives you so much accessibility stuff

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,990
for free without you even having to

00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,910
think about it

00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:33,420
if you do things this way think about

00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:37,740
basic HTML first you're going to have

00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:39,990
something that works from the start and

00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,270
as bonus you can be seen how a screen

00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:46,700
reader might see it or how someone using

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:49,920
a text mode browser might see it and

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:53,930
then once you've got a working hate

00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:57,030
smile foundation then you can mold it up

00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:59,840
okay get some ghost music soundtrack on

00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:05,810
stop molding it into a beautiful design

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:09,210
forming the HTML into components and

00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:12,210
then only then at that point do you add

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:15,690
the fancy things do you put the

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:17,880
JavaScript on top upgrade those boring

00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:20,970
forms that we talked about so that they

00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,300
I don't know connect to rest api's so

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:29,040
the pagination now works without a page

00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:31,560
reloading I know that's a bit abstract

00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:34,860
so let's give you a practical example of

00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,930
this now this is gonna be something that

00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,030
I've been working on for the last few

00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:42,510
weeks you know as part of a small side

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:44,130
project then we've got our workplace and

00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:48,750
we start out in exactly that way we

00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:51,830
talked about starting with HTML and then

00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,910
we add the most simple style sheet to it

00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:57,900
something there's barely more than

00:22:53,910 --> 00:23:01,920
styled hate smell and we make sure that

00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:04,230
that works everywhere and it does work

00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:07,440
everywhere just buying by nature of what

00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:11,760
it is this is fundamentally workable on

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,760
every device iPhone desktop whatever it

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,030
is

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,850
and then we do a test against a fancy

00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:23,180
media query wonder is being crafted to

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:27,790
catch the latest browsers and then those

00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:31,310
browsers we send an upgraded experience

00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:35,030
we send him and a full working

00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:36,920
stylesheet and in fact this is a reduce

00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:40,880
form of the BBC's cutting the mustard

00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:44,330
technique and yes we've deliberately

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:49,420
chosen to exclude some browsers from

00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:52,460
having a full enhanced experience here

00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:55,550
because we know even if those older

00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:59,480
browsers get that reduced functionality

00:23:55,550 --> 00:24:04,730
that reduced styling more it will still

00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:07,760
work for them and then like I said

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:11,030
before only then do we load in fancy

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,700
JavaScript and we touched up by a match

00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:16,640
media event because we check to see if

00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:19,370
the CSS is loaded and if the CSS is

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,710
loaded that we know we can it's advanced

00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:24,410
browser we can attach javascript to it

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:28,850
and then we can do tabbing we can do

00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:31,640
animations we can do your drop down and

00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:33,680
we've got all this documented in an open

00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,350
playbook that we maintain I'll post a

00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,460
link to this afterwards on Twitter so

00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:43,670
you can all take a look at this in more

00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:46,700
detail and that ties the fundamentals of

00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:49,930
progressive enhancement a really simple

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:53,930
example but it's about making a site

00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:57,850
Universal from the start and only

00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,850
upgrading it when it becomes necessary

00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:05,150
and doing something like that makes a

00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:08,120
site robust as hell again you can make

00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:11,230
it so that it doesn't fall over when one

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,230
aspect of it breaks

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:19,820
and in addition it's the ultimate in

00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:23,240
agile development because by doing

00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:25,700
things this way you don't you don't

00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,760
sketch something in sketch and then try

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,590
to code towards that as a final goal you

00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,960
know you don't have this waterfall

00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:35,810
approach to things that is quite frankly

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,830
common in our industry right now no you

00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:42,590
do things a jille you build you test you

00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,930
iterate you build you test again over

00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:49,940
and over making something gradually

00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:52,010
better as you go along and for people

00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:55,010
like me who were fundamentally lazy this

00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:58,100
is amazing it means you only build what

00:25:55,010 --> 00:26:01,100
you need to you don't start on trying

00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,790
the latest techniques you only add

00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:06,950
advanced things as they are necessary

00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:12,380
this incredibly lean approach to things

00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:16,190
I think also fights FOMO

00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:19,610
if if people don't know what FOMO is

00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:22,220
fear of missing out and again this is

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:24,020
something that I think we all have we

00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,550
all suffer from I know I certainly do I

00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:27,490
hear about the latest techniques as I oh

00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:30,770
my god I haven't learnt about that one

00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:33,260
we tend to get excited by the latest

00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:36,260
technologies and rather than asking

00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:39,530
again does he benefit the users does

00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:41,780
this make things better for them it

00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:47,690
stops us and puts a break on that

00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:53,000
excitement because we do frankly tend to

00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:55,700
build too complex at the moment we're

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,250
trying to keep up collectively with

00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,500
giant engineering companies that have

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:03,950
tens of thousands of engineering staff

00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,390
doing the latest things and we're all

00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:07,790
running behind trying to keep up with

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:12,500
them and thinking this is must be the

00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:15,230
best way of doing things when it isn't

00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,580
necessarily maybe we could just start

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,420
keeping things simple

00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,420
a bit more

00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:26,630
and there are some limitations I will be

00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:27,679
the first to admit that it's absolutely

00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,990
amazing

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,720
but one thing progressive enhancement is

00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:34,340
still beats by easily by the client-side

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,910
JavaScript framework so right there

00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:42,049
right now is state management absolutely

00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:45,140
state management is a big thing but I

00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:48,020
will still argue that it is only a

00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:52,130
minority of sites that actually work

00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:55,100
that way the high profile sites all rely

00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:58,190
on it but the average site that we are

00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:02,860
producing does not need to jump into

00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:05,299
full state management immediately I

00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:06,740
thought maybe we can work on that I

00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:09,049
actually think this is something that

00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:12,380
will come in the future we'll have that

00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:14,840
merging of easy state management's and

00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:20,360
progressive enhancement and that will be

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:22,809
incredible for the web at that point we

00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,850
should remember what it excels and again

00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:29,480
doing things this way makes it robust

00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:33,200
and makes it Universal makes it work for

00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:36,049
everybody it will always work in the

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,540
worst conditions when this broken

00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:40,549
JavaScript when there's bad Network

00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:43,059
conditions when people deliberately

00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:45,890
disable things and believe me they do

00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:48,290
deliberately disable things now Josh

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:50,240
Cribbs being turned off by people I know

00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:53,360
but simply because they want to avoid

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,549
the adverts and the huge number of

00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,080
third-party downloads that come from

00:28:55,549 --> 00:29:05,390
those it's lightweight and it loves

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:07,190
people first anyway even if you don't do

00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:08,600
progressive enhancement there's still

00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:11,419
are those things that people have talked

00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:14,390
about earlier in the day you can do

00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:17,830
stuff like turning on your in your dev

00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:21,799
tools turn on 3d performance turn on the

00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:24,559
CPU throttling start using the site like

00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:27,020
average people do out there in the real

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:29,290
world simulate those real-world

00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,290
conditions

00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:37,140
and if you can use real hardware because

00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:42,150
again as we've heard today your 3000

00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:44,370
euro Mac is not anywhere near the

00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:48,150
performance of what a real-world person

00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:49,560
has it's vastly overpowered the new

00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,380
iPhone that people are going to have

00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:54,270
next week is infinitely more powerful

00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,870
than the average phone that people hold

00:29:54,270 --> 00:30:00,780
in their hands but because we use these

00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:06,720
every day we assume that everybody else

00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:09,540
uses them and they don't and again as we

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,450
said earlier if you can make this run on

00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:15,150
a low powered device if your site runs

00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:18,540
on the lowest end of things it's going

00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:23,520
to be screamingly fast on the real high

00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:25,200
powered devices and then in addition

00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,090
just another one those little tasks you

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,670
can do you can turn on your screen

00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:31,710
reader and again if you're a stereotype

00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:33,660
for the developer which we all are you

00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:35,760
can just have to do on your Mac you just

00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,890
have to go command f5 and you've

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,700
immediately got voiceover turned on and

00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:43,530
you can start testing these things you

00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,780
can start navigating your site by sign

00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:47,310
and believe me this is so much fun when

00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:50,760
you actually do it for the first time

00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:54,840
when you actually find out what a whole

00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,460
new interface to use him websites and

00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,220
there's a steep learning curve with it

00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:02,070
don't get me wrong you have to learn a

00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:03,870
100 new key combinations but if we're a

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:06,000
group of people who can learn a pianist

00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:08,910
by hearts and all the different CSS

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,160
properties I'm confident we can learn

00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:16,470
that kind of thing for sure and

00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:19,890
similarly start trying to navigate with

00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:22,320
your keyboard every day and this one is

00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:25,230
incredibly easy you just it's wonky just

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,200
time tab through everything start seeing

00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:29,250
where your website looks like with that

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,020
try and discover those little things

00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,630
that we saw earlier those little

00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:37,500
ordering areas that can creep in so

00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:39,150
easily by going visual first you'll be

00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:42,920
amazed at how much better you can make

00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,920
your site's straightaway

00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:52,180
be my he was said by the CEO somewhere

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:57,490
but these aren't my users I don't have

00:31:52,180 --> 00:32:01,000
users like these poor users or disabled

00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:05,860
users and I will come back to you and

00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:08,920
say you do have users like that you do

00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:12,670
because you don't know a user situation

00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:16,480
at any point you can't always assume

00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:19,120
they are in the best situation they

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,520
might be even your millionaire user your

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,190
high petrol user might have borrowed a

00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:27,760
phone of somebody else they might be

00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:29,890
sitting a scaled down work computer they

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:35,100
could just be in a bad situation on

00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:35,100
holiday somewhere you cannot know this

00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:40,180
and at the end of the day even those

00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:43,510
millionaires are going to have crappy

00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:50,740
days so let's try and be kind to the

00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:56,520
poor old millionaires anyway the web

00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:59,350
success is built on it being robust

00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:05,200
being built on a robustness that works

00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:07,750
for anybody I know that people depend on

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:14,290
that robustness we have to keep

00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:18,880
defending it we have to keep that beauty

00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:21,970
and that weirdness in the web because

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,510
the web is beautiful because of its

00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:31,930
diversity its diversity of people and

00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:35,770
its diversity of technology we are the

00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:39,400
enablers for that diversity so let's not

00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:42,400
make it about us and let's start making

00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:45,510
it about the wonderful weirdness of the

00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,570
web thank you
