Description: 
	debugger; is not simply a command, known to any javascript developer. Itâ€™s an opportunity to stop and take a look around to understand what bugs we have. In this talk we will set debugger not on our code but on ourselves to see what bugs most of us fight in our day-to-day developer lives.
