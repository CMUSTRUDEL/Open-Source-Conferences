Title: Denys Mishunov: Debugger for developers | CSSConf Budapest 2017
Publication date: 2018-02-16
Playlist: CSSConf Budapest 2017
Description: 
	debugger; is not simply a command, known to any javascript developer. Itâ€™s an opportunity to stop and take a look around to understand what bugs we have. In this talk we will set debugger not on our code but on ourselves to see what bugs most of us fight in our day-to-day developer lives.

oh my god

00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,780
[Applause]

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,719
[Music]

00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:15,709
[Applause]

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:18,910
my name is Dennis and I have a problem

00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:22,369
though I'm not an anonymous alcoholic

00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:24,230
and let's make it clear from the start

00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:30,070
I'm not even public alcoholic I nearly

00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:30,070
don't drink my problem is different I'm

00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:39,860
I'm a developer there are a lot of

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,080
questions without answers in my head why

00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,120
do we calculate padding's based on

00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,769
parents width even for top and bottom

00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:52,100
values I don't know what do peak angular

00:00:48,769 --> 00:00:53,390
or react polymer or View vanilla GS or

00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:58,160
mean GS with chocolate chips

00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:00,920
I don't know now when we are writing CSS

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,230
and JavaScript is at the time to make it

00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,580
even and starts writing javascript and

00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:10,360
HTML and CSS I don't know there are many

00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:13,670
more questions that I have no answer to

00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,460
exactly they did C won't be covered in

00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:21,190
this talk today instead I want to talk

00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:25,580
to you about us us as human beings us as

00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:26,240
developers we developers are all very

00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,060
different

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,550
some like CSS others prefer playing with

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,830
the latest JavaScript framework some

00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,240
like aesthetics and house enjoy a

00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,250
skillfully designed websites

00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,950
others prefer building unique user

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,479
experience all the way from the ground

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,450
but no matter our differences there is

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:47,630
one thing we all share in common we all

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:50,270
want to be professionally successful in

00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,910
whatever we are doing and the wish to be

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,360
successful to be the best is not bad at

00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,000
all

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,039
this is how evolution works the problem

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,560
is that a lot of people take this wish

00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:06,349
to become successful way too serious

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,450
in 1982 physician Robert Goldman post a

00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:12,349
question to elite athletes in power and

00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:15,709
combat sports asking if I had a magic

00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:18,560
drug that would be so fantastic that if

00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:21,920
you take it once you would win every

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,690
competition you would enter from mr.

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,180
Olympia to Olympic decathlon for the

00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:34,280
next five years but it would have one

00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:36,140
minor drawback it would kill you five

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:42,350
years after you took it would you still

00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:44,040
take this pill I'm sorry the problem is

00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,530
that more than half

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,260
the respondents answered yes they would

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,909
still take this bill puzzled with this

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,159
result goldman repeated the same

00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:56,549
question for the following 13 years

00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:58,680
until 1995 and during all these years

00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:00,510
the results were consistent people were

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,129
willing to trade their lives for just

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:07,439
five years of success we developers of

00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:09,269
course are not athletes frankly a lot of

00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:17,310
us are as far from sports as is possibly

00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:20,609
could be and thankfully this bill

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:26,760
doesn't exist so we all have to find our

00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:29,310
own way to professional success but no

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,859
matter whether we are different and

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,680
whether we take different paths on this

00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:37,739
path to professional success we all face

00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,209
the same problems and exactly about

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,609
those problems I would like to talk to

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,180
you today we'll try to see what those

00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:43,919
are

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,349
we'll try to analyze them and hopefully

00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:53,090
we'll try to see what we can to do about

00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:55,290
those a lot of modern physicists

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,419
sincerely believe that the world around

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,129
us is nothing more than just huge

00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,019
computer simulations so we all live in

00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:04,169
matrix so for the purpose of this talk

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:07,169
let's assume this is true so let's

00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:10,079
imagine and think how would an average

00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:14,549
developer could look like in the form of

00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:18,810
let's say a JavaScript program it all

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:20,699
starts here we are born and raised and

00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:24,120
at some point we get to the first hour

00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:26,099
our first milestone as developers we

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,289
read our first book in my case it was

00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,120
it's really hard to see here but in my

00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:32,039
case it was designing with web standards

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,380
by Jeffrey Zeldin the first edition of

00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,120
this book you enjoy the book and you

00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,490
want to apply this new knowledge so you

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,080
get into your first project probably for

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,699
yourself or for a friend

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,400
probably it was rubbish and probably you

00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,849
didn't get paid but you really enjoyed

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,530
the moment and the idea that you can

00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:51,780
create something once and it will be

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,210
instantly available for millions use of

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,789
the users around the world so you want

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,870
to go on and you get to your first job

00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:00,480
as a develop

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,300
and things go on and on and on and on

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:08,430
until something goes wrong take a look

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:11,180
at the console the program representing

00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,770
us as developers starts throwing errors

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,650
let's take a look at what those problems

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,450
are there are only three here for the

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,830
purpose of this talk there are many more

00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,780
but exactly what these three we are

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:29,430
going to talk about today so the first

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:31,410
one is perfectionism next slide I will

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,090
just show you some pictures I'm not

00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:45,540
gonna say word I'm interested in your

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:50,910
reaction to those I will let this one to

00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:52,890
stay on the screen for a while of course

00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,350
this is not a scientific research but

00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:58,370
from your reaction I might consider that

00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,520
some of you consider yourselves

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:03,180
perfectionists

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,860
I remember in 2013 when I company I was

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,480
working out back then was about to merge

00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,480
with another company I had a

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,330
conversation with my background boss

00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,440
about how this merge might affect my

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,520
style of work

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,850
danny's he said your style of work is

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:24,810
like champagne it's long processed well

00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:27,210
thought and expensive the style of a

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:31,040
company we are about to merge is more

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:34,020
like a Prosecco it's faster it's

00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,660
probably cheaper and probably less

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,930
quality lower quality we both know that

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,910
but when both drinks are poured in the

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:45,360
glasses at a party most people won't

00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,980
tell the difference anyway even though

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,840
later this company decided that their

00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,190
front-end works on the unicorn sparking

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,620
magic and they don't need in-house

00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:55,470
front-end developer at all I still

00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,780
remember this dialogue as a good example

00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,850
of how the work of perfectionist and non

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,830
perfectionist is perceived by normal

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,530
people and yes I used to think about

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:06,090
myself as perfectionist but what do we

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,590
want it or not perfectionists are a

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,780
completely different breed when it comes

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:14,350
to work long perfectionists

00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:17,350
consider work to be just that when it

00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:20,860
comes to perfectionists we consider work

00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:22,480
a challenge we consider it as a way of

00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,820
expressing ourselves and challenge

00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,360
ourselves there is an approach

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,580
all-or-nothing in our work we do not pay

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,770
attention to deadlines to any obstacles

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,770
before we get to this perfect result

00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:41,500
there is no room for mistake in the work

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:44,230
of perfectionist so we do anything we

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,880
can to avoid even slightest hint to

00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,020
criticism because criticism is the worst

00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,430
enemy of perfectionist

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,530
and when the work is done according to

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:52,950
how perfectionist intended it to be this

00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:56,230
working truly shine so why exactly

00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:58,600
perfectionism is marked as a bug in our

00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:02,740
program don't get me wrong

00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:07,780
perfectionism is really good for example

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:09,400
it's great when like yes the problem

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,320
with perfectionism is that there are two

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,930
different types of perfectionism

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,669
according to modern psychology there is

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,620
positive perfectionism or healthy

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:21,070
perfections and there is negative

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:23,320
perfectionism so positive perfectionism

00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,030
is the moving force for of a lot of

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,919
industries because it helps you achieve

00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:31,360
outstanding results in whatever you have

00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:33,190
passion for it's wonderful for example

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,510
when your dentist is perfectionist or an

00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,030
architect that built a house you're

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,950
living in or it's really great that

00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:41,770
Steve Jobs was such a perfectionist that

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:43,930
with his attitude to perfectionism to be

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:47,380
perfecting things he set the bar for the

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:50,290
whole industry but there is a pattern

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,350
here perfectionism is always good when

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:56,170
you are a consumer believe it or not

00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:59,410
when you create things perfectionism can

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,640
really stand in your way the same Steve

00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,130
Jobs as classical example of

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,040
perfectionists was really hard to work

00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:09,339
with in 1977 when he was working on his

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,339
new Apple 2 computer he had to pick the

00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:14,950
color casing of this computer and the

00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:16,480
Pantone company sent him two thousand

00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:19,890
shades of beige to pick from

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,589
not two not 20 not two hundred two

00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,630
thousand shades of beige now we're good

00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:27,420
enough for Steve Jobs

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:29,970
so he was desperately willing to develop

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,800
his perfect beige color for his perfect

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,259
computer he was so obsessed with this

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,569
idea that Michael Scott CEO of Apple

00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:40,860
back then had to interfere and stop jobs

00:09:36,569 --> 00:09:44,160
from doing that negative perfectionism

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,290
can make people really aggressive when

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,810
somebody challenges their ideas or the

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,970
way they work I will show you a short

00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,160
clip from a sitcom Silicon Valley that

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,930
most probably you are familiar with but

00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:08,000
it nicely illustrates the problem that

00:09:54,930 --> 00:10:13,130
I'm talking about sure what's wrong

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,130
nothing nothing literally it's all good

00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:23,040
right you really hate space no no no no

00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,459
I don't it's not hate hates a strong

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,670
word

00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,350
um truth be told I do have a slight

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:31,699
preference for tabs but that's only

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:37,319
because I'm anal and because I prefer

00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:39,449
precision well not to pick a fight here

00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:43,259
but if you really care about precision

00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:44,550
when you use spaces but whatever once it

00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:50,360
goes through the compiler it's the same

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:50,360
thing right yeah yeah technically yes

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:58,720
I guess I just I just don't understand

00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,819
why you anyone use spaces over tabs like

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,009
if it's all the same or why not just use

00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:04,779
tabs because it could look different on

00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:07,089
other people's computers tabs create

00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,529
smaller file sizes alright I run a

00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:10,180
compression company trust me I've

00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:13,029
devoted my life to minimalizing file

00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:16,389
sizes it's what I do I mean I do not get

00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:18,550
why anyone would use spaces over tabs I

00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:25,480
mean why not just use vim over Emacs I

00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:31,480
do use vim / Emacs oh god help us so

00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:33,879
it's funny right but in addition to

00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:37,360
affecting our personal life negative

00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:40,750
perfectionism can have real effect on

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:45,129
our work life and it can take different

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:47,079
forms in our day to day job but we are

00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:49,959
gonna talk about the most common ones

00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:52,990
the first one is called perfectionist

00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:57,040
paralysis we all know what is

00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:58,990
procrastination aren't we the problem is

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,389
that different people procrastinate due

00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:05,399
to different reasons some are just tired

00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:07,810
some want to make the mental shift but

00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,689
perfectionists procrastinate because

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:13,139
they are waiting for an ideal moment to

00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:15,699
start working on their ideal project

00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:18,360
well at least that's how perfectionists

00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:21,939
think about this process in reality

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,860
perfectionists just afraid of not

00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:28,899
achieving perfect result after all it's

00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:32,110
the fear of failure they try to think

00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:34,949
about not existing problems every task

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,069
they're working with this over complete

00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:38,589
overcomplicates

00:12:36,069 --> 00:12:40,689
even slide even smallest tasks and

00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:42,639
naturally enough perfectionist needs

00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:44,559
some time and some strength to fight

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,399
this huge monster that eats their time

00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,990
and resources but let's assume that in

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,759
reality this ideal moment never comes

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,910
before it's too late right but let's

00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:57,069
assume that miracles happen and you've

00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,990
got your ideal moment so you start

00:12:57,069 --> 00:13:01,240
working on the brush I'm sorry on a

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,309
project or simply a deadline is knocking

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,300
at your door and you have to start so

00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:06,100
you

00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,110
start this and then you get into the

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:13,120
next problem of negative perfectionism

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:15,100
that is called picking a detail so they

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,040
wish to finish every task perfectionist

00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,590
works with necessarily with perfect

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,600
result leads them to pick really small

00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,720
tasks that they would be guaranteed to

00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,060
finish with perfect result but while

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,500
working with these small tasks

00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,330
perfectionists dive so deep in this task

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,580
that they completely lose overview of a

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:39,130
project that still lives around this

00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:41,350
small task again let's assume that you

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,790
have perfect project manager who is

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,290
familiar with your style and reminds you

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,990
from time to time about delivering the

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,820
result so at some point you're ready

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,520
you're ready to deliver your feature

00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,140
your project your application whatever

00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,210
and you get to the next problem of

00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,460
negative perfectionism that is called

00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:00,760
unnecessary task or as I call it a

00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,320
cherry on top the moment you're ready to

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,900
deliver your feature your project your

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,510
application whatever an evil idea comes

00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:09,720
to your mind

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:12,370
hmm this thing might be improved a bit

00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:16,120
and you start with just taking a look

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,740
and another evil idea comes to your mind

00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,540
mmm this is not hard

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,470
shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes

00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:26,680
now and you dive deeper and deeper and

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,480
deeper and at the end you spent the

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,550
whole day for something that at best

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,620
doesn't bring value to the project at

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,860
worst you Ron get recept hard because

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,600
this feature works unpredictable and

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,150
predictably I'm sorry or just ruins the

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,730
whole project and only then you realize

00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,950
how stupid this day was so we see that

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,780
negative perfectionism brings a lot of

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,210
troubles into our lives into the lives

00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,820
of those we are working with and those

00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:56,080
who dare to live with us but what is the

00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:59,160
solution a lot of resources advice to

00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:03,400
just stop being a perfectionist

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:06,490
this is much easier to say than to do my

00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:10,180
solution is to convert this obsession

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:12,880
driven negative perfectionism into the

00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:15,310
positive perfectionism how we can

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:18,130
achieve this let's get straight into the

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:20,920
examples let me tell your story

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:22,269
by the age of 40 before establishing one

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,339
of the most profitable and well-known

00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:27,149
companies in the world Henry Ford had

00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:30,940
established two other car companies and

00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:34,180
failed with both moreover the management

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,040
of the second company had to push Ford

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:39,279
off the company just four months after

00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,319
he established it a lot of resources

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,079
attribute these failures to Ford's

00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:46,209
craving for perfectionism according to

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,540
the story of this second camp car

00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:51,910
company that is now called Cadillac Ford

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,910
was constantly working on perfecting the

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:57,339
designs of the cars completely ignoring

00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,889
deadlines and postponing production of

00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:01,750
the real car but no matter his craving

00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:04,180
for perfectionism the first cars of his

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:07,329
third company that now is known as Ford

00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:09,430
Motor Company we're just on par with the

00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:12,579
competitors neither better nor worse

00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:15,519
they were just rich cars because of this

00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:18,279
Ford insisted on postponing production

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,839
of the cars before they get perfected at

00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:21,790
this moment the investors had enough of

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,800
Ford and insisted on implementing the

00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:28,660
paradigm make sale now fix them later

00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,279
had it been not to the healthy attitude

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,800
to perfectionism from the investors of

00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:34,660
the Ford the world might have never

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,449
heard of Henry Ford he would just push

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:41,230
his third company off the bridge as he

00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:42,399
did two times before that but let's take

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,680
a look at the difference between

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,920
negative and positive perfectionism in

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:51,759
our industry two statements the first

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,769
one my product should be perfect I'm not

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:58,839
going to you release develop a feature

00:16:53,769 --> 00:17:01,360
commit before I'm sure it is perfect and

00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:05,140
the second one my product should be

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,319
perfect and this release feature commit

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,220
moves me one step closer to this perfect

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,439
result

00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:12,579
well this example is really easy to see

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,169
that to notice the difference between

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:16,150
unhealthy and healthy attitude to

00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:19,449
perfectionism and see how the negative

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:26,559
perfectionism really blocks us when we

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:29,260
create things we have to accept we have

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,800
to learn ourselves to get to this

00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:34,890
positive attitude to perfectionism

00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:37,740
we have to accept that our products can

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:40,020
leave in any version alpha beta 0.1

00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,040
anything they should not be perfect from

00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,510
day one they might be even incomplete

00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,900
Jim Bouchard author and motivational

00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:51,330
speaker tells this about perfectionism

00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:55,770
perfection is not a destination it's a

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:57,710
never ending process enjoy because if we

00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:00,900
do not convert into the positive

00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:02,520
perfectionists we tend to grasp all the

00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,130
information we have in our industry in

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,710
order to just understand what is perfect

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:11,850
and what is not and then we tend to fall

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:16,140
into the next bug of our program that is

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:18,240
called impostor phenomenon I bet some of

00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:22,740
you are sitting and asking what

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:25,140
phenomenon and would be right until

00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:29,730
recently this topic has not been really

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:31,560
covered in our industry but scientific

00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:34,500
research shows that two out of five

00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:37,290
successful people constantly suffer from

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,390
it and up to 70% of the general

00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:41,910
population has experienced this problem

00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:46,620
at least your during at least one period

00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:50,010
of their professional career so let me

00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:53,310
give you three statements and then I

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:55,470
will ask you to raise your hands let's

00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:58,830
start with the first statement you think

00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:00,930
that your success in something is due to

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:05,370
luck timing or any other third party

00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:08,580
power not your hard-working your

00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:11,550
intelligence or your talent the first

00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,380
one the second one you think that others

00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:16,970
might discover that you're not as

00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:19,650
skilled as they think you are

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:22,830
wait a second wait a second wait for it

00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:26,730
the third one you think that others are

00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:29,730
more intelligent than you are and now

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:33,800
it's your time who can say that please

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:36,870
something on this list applies to them

00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,300
wonderful take a look keep keep the

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,800
hands just like those and front

00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,190
take a look like almost the whole

00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,190
audience

00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:50,100
welcome welcome to the club of Impostors

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,990
and let me congratulate you because we

00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,360
are all in a really good company you

00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,280
think why would anyone want to see me

00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,799
again in the movie and I don't know how

00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:04,320
to act anyway so why am I doing this

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:07,220
Meryl Streep actress 389 nominations 156

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,090
wins three Oscars as Best Actress I

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,770
always feel like something of an

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,660
imposter I don't know what I'm doing I'm

00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:15,900
not a writer I've been fooling myself

00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:18,540
and other people John Steinbeck and

00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,690
writer 27 books Pulitzer Prize for

00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:23,520
fiction Nobel Prize in Literature I

00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,590
still doubt myself every single day what

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,540
people believe is my self-confidence is

00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,929
actually my reaction to fear

00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,549
Will Smith actor musician six American

00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:37,070
Music Awards four Grammys two Oscar

00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:40,140
nominations as Best Actor so technically

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:44,520
impostor phenomenon is the inability to

00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:45,840
internalize your own achievements that

00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,669
leads you to the feeling that you were

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:54,179
less competent than the rest of the

00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:57,000
world believes you to be the term

00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:59,040
imposter phenomenon when I first heard

00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,049
about it I had my WoW moment because I

00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:03,960
didn't even know that the feelings I had

00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:07,679
had a name but it they had and quite

00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:10,169
established name the term impostor

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,280
phenomenon first appeared in the

00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:19,049
scientific from 1978 dedicated to high

00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:20,700
achieving women in academics that's true

00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:23,340
for many years scientific community

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,950
believed that this phenomenon is highly

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,140
confined to high achieving women but the

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,260
very same same scientists now believe

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,419
that this feeling the feeling of being

00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:35,640
proud is much more universal and it

00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:38,280
might be even more problematic for man

00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,370
because naturally it's much harder for

00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:44,490
man to confess like insecurity and

00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:46,950
incompetence hence men end up hiding

00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:50,030
their fears being unable to unburden

00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,030
them and seek help

00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:58,980
when we do not pay attention to our

00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:01,510
imposter syndrome what can happen from

00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,520
simple psychological discomfort that the

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:07,120
insecurity brings it can lead us

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,220
straight to failure only a couple of

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,840
years ago I had several applications of

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:14,890
to read functionality in my portable

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,740
devices like pocket flip board

00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:20,440
Instapaper and I was sending saving all

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,690
the news all the interesting things you

00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,630
know in our community right then there

00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,790
were magazines Smashing Magazine at

00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:30,400
least the part net magazine those

00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,470
constantly brought me the latest how-tos

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,510
and tutorials and news from like

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:36,580
interesting articles from the world of

00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:40,179
development from the from the web

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,950
development then we have Twitter reading

00:22:40,179 --> 00:22:43,990
Twitter might be depressed on its own

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,400
because in so many talented people

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,559
bragging about their achievements and

00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,050
their success doesn't help fighting

00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:52,480
impostor syndrome at all but my story

00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:56,200
doesn't end up then here of course there

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,330
were also RSS feeds newsletters like

00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,550
HTML weekly JavaScript weekly there were

00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:02,679
videos from the most recent conferences

00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:04,570
and these constantly brought me new

00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:07,809
information and I tried to consume all

00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:10,360
of this information but in the flow of

00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:12,640
all of this information I also have to

00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:15,580
find time to do real work that paid my

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,470
bills so naturally enough one day I

00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:20,110
figured out that I don't read those

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,030
articles anymore on the past days I

00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:24,490
would just glance through the titles

00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:27,010
pick two or three and they would stay

00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:31,510
opened in my browsers in my browser

00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:34,510
usually untouched for days so why did it

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,190
end up like this why didn't I feel

00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,470
myself more competent after consuming

00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:40,420
all of this information the answer is

00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,559
that it wasn't me

00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,690
who was interested in all this

00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:46,690
information it was my imposter syndrome

00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,610
pushing me to learn all these things so

00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:51,550
that I wouldn't feel myself an

00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:53,350
incompetent fraud so what impostor

00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:55,660
syndrome really does is instead of

00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:58,150
pushing us to learn new exciting things

00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:02,560
that we can apply in our work it leads

00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:04,929
us to the state of frustration but those

00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,179
who have ever experienced this feeling I

00:24:04,929 --> 00:24:09,659
have good

00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:13,080
you see for you the irony of imposter

00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:16,409
syndrome is that true frauds seem to

00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,710
rarely experience this feeling as simple

00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:21,539
as that or as English philosopher

00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,519
Bertrand Russell puts it in a more

00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:25,559
poetic way the trouble with the world is

00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:30,779
that the stupid our culture and the

00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:32,490
intelligent are full of doubt so one

00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:35,249
interesting thing of imposter syndrome

00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:37,259
is that we cannot really fight it we

00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:38,820
cannot change the situation because

00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:40,320
nobody can guarantee you that you are

00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,899
competent enough to be in this industry

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:45,899
nobody can guarantee that you are the

00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:48,119
smartest in the room it's impossible so

00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:50,129
instead of fighting these things that

00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:53,039
drive us into impostor syndrome what we

00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:55,679
have to do is change our attitude to

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:59,899
this feeling and the first thing we have

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:03,389
to start with is embrace impulse train

00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:05,610
Pacific Standard magazine puts this says

00:25:03,389 --> 00:25:08,129
this imposter ism is for many people and

00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:12,749
natural symptom of gaining expertise and

00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:14,399
this makes total sense when we gain

00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:16,619
expertise we extend the perimeter of

00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:19,590
what we know but at the same time we

00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:22,909
expose ourselves to even more of what we

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:26,399
don't so next time you have an attack of

00:25:22,909 --> 00:25:31,499
imposter syndrome do not rush to get the

00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:33,480
new information instead just stop stop

00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:36,539
and enjoy this moment because most

00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:40,529
probably this is the sign of you gaining

00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:43,470
expertise you gaining wisdom to realize

00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:47,279
that there is much more in this world to

00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:50,879
discover and there is much more in our

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:53,159
industry for us to discover yet but I

00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:56,100
deliberately say most probably because

00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,049
some people confuse stupid bravery to

00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,600
expertise and this is completely

00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:02,909
different story another thing I would

00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:05,730
tell I could tell you to change our

00:26:02,909 --> 00:26:08,999
attitude to impostor syndrome is measure

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:11,730
yourself with your own yardstick it's

00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:15,359
very easy now industry to be consumed by

00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:18,299
comparing yourself to others but this is

00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,070
the game impossible to win instead try

00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:23,100
comparing yourself

00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:26,010
to yourself compete to yourself where

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,630
were you a year ago six months ago can

00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:31,260
you see the difference can you see this

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:33,480
progress if you can there was a

00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,880
wonderful talk at the recent smashing

00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,250
conference in Barcelona and the Yuko

00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,530
wonderful illustrator it said if you

00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,800
look at your pop works and they look

00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:45,540
 probably you're on the right track

00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:47,970
this is exactly this feeling like if you

00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:50,670
see that now you're much better than you

00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:55,050
did a year ago you're on the right track

00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:58,200
and last but definitely not least I can

00:26:55,050 --> 00:27:01,040
tell you communicate your fears this

00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,870
might sound a bit scary but Neil Gaiman

00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:07,080
an acknowledged author of comic books

00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:09,180
and movies and different books it has a

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,750
perfect anecdote to soothe anyone with

00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:14,310
impostor syndrome let me read it for you

00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,780
some years ago I was lucky enough to be

00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:18,390
invited to a gathering of great and good

00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:20,730
people artists and scientists writers

00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,500
and discoverers of things and I felt

00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,320
that at any moment they would realize

00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:29,220
that I didn't qualify to be there among

00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:31,920
these people who had really done things

00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,870
on my second or third night there I was

00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:41,280
standing at the back of the hall while a

00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:43,170
musical entertainment happened and I

00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,580
started talking to a very nice polite

00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:49,560
elderly gentleman about several things

00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:50,970
putting our shared first name and that

00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,250
he pointed to the call of people and

00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:56,130
said words to the effect often I just

00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:59,570
look at all these people

00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:10,369
what the heck am I doing here

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:12,799
they have make amazing things I think

00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:15,049
that counts you something and I felt a

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:20,330
bit better because Neil Armstrong felt

00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:21,919
like an impostor maybe everyone so do

00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,979
not be afraid of communicating your

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,639
fears next time when you're in the

00:28:24,979 --> 00:28:30,259
office and afraid of being found out by

00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:33,229
your colleague that you do not know as

00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:35,210
much as they think you do tap into the

00:28:33,229 --> 00:28:38,210
knowledge that probably the people

00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:40,070
around you might feel inadequate as well

00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:44,389
they might have exactly the same

00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:47,119
feelings even even your boss because if

00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:49,759
we do not change our attitude to

00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:52,129
impostor syndrome it pushes us to work

00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:54,799
really hard in order to prove ourselves

00:28:52,129 --> 00:28:58,460
and then we tend to get into the third

00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:02,359
bug of our program that is called as

00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:05,869
simple as long hours let's start with

00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:08,929
raise of hands I will ask you three

00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:13,369
questions the first one have you ever

00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:15,649
worked long hours like developing

00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:19,220
something or writing CSS or JavaScript

00:29:15,649 --> 00:29:21,379
or like you work the whole day and then

00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:24,289
you extend this day and then keep going

00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:27,580
after midnight or something how many of

00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:29,899
you had to have done this at least once

00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:33,259
wonderful what a stupid question I ask

00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:40,269
huh okay how many of you do this on a

00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:44,210
regular basis okay now the main question

00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:46,700
how many of you the day after putting

00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:48,470
these long hours like writing CSS after

00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,499
midnight or JavaScript after midnight

00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:53,809
realize that the things that were

00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:56,419
written that late have to be tossed away

00:29:53,809 --> 00:29:59,119
they are either buggy or not functioning

00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:08,049
well or they completely break project

00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:12,049
please raise it okay good so long hours

00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:13,190
are nothing you know industry but I

00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:15,350
haven't made that I have never

00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,270
heard of cases of people on the death

00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:20,510
path saying something like oh god why

00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:22,550
was I working so ladle conversely

00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:24,500
palliative nurses working with anta life

00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:27,830
care state that one of the most

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,870
mentioned regrets people say on their

00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:34,400
death bass is that they were working way

00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:38,120
too much and again long hours in our

00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,880
industry is nothing new from touch time

00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:43,760
we just have to put long hours because

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,310
we have to finish some something or do

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,620
some some really really urgent work

00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:53,270
right so long hours per se are not a bug

00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:56,900
there are two different types of long

00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:58,280
hours though temporary long hours this

00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,960
is the type of long hours that we

00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,480
usually put one for example in you

00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,940
exciting technology is out and we are

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,740
willing to figure out how this works so

00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,990
we are willing to put these long hours

00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,490
in order to be smarter to be to

00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,980
understand how this new thing works

00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,510
another case of course is around

00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,780
deadlines because we all know how good

00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:20,510
we are with time estimations aren't we

00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:22,130
so this type of long hours is typical

00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:24,800
for somebody who we would call hard

00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,930
working developer but there is another

00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:31,340
type of long hours that is more

00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:33,770
permanent and perfectionism and

00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,450
impulsive syndrome as problems set us

00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:38,450
straight into this category of long

00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:39,710
hours this type of long hours is typical

00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,700
for somebody who we would call a

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,830
workaholic

00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,240
it's kind of hard to see the difference

00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:47,420
between hard working people

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:51,140
and workaholics but I like how Brian

00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:52,820
Robinson psychotherapist puts this hard

00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:54,800
working people usually have some balance

00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:58,490
in their life they might see that they

00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:00,590
tasks and think about skiing while

00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:12,680
workaholics are on the ski slopes

00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:17,150
thinking about work this this problem in

00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:19,370
our industry is dictated by our

00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:21,530
privilege we are privileged in our

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:24,860
industry because we can work from

00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:27,220
anywhere in the world anytime and for

00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:31,280
some developers and more so for some

00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:34,190
employers this means all the time but

00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,170
the question is do we manage to do more

00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:38,960
during these long hours maybe we are

00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:41,510
more productive in the beginning of

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,299
1920s an American company conducted the

00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:48,380
research including their own employees

00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:51,500
and figured out that 20 hours in

00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:54,920
addition to the average 40 hours week so

00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:58,160
60 hours week in total indeed leads to

00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:00,350
increased productivity 60 hours a week

00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,710
increased productivity but it takes only

00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:09,740
3 to 4 weeks for the productivity

00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:13,010
actually to turn negative so this

00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:15,020
research has been conducted by the Ford

00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:19,370
Motor Company one of the earliest

00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:21,890
adopters of 40 hours week so as we can

00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:24,320
see the fact that we are busy during

00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:26,360
these long hours doesn't really mean

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:30,669
that we are productive during these long

00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:32,860
hours why let me introduce you to our

00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:35,840
front brain

00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:39,650
no matter the unexplored potential of a

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,020
human brain in the simplest form it

00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:44,720
still behaves like a simple muscle and

00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:47,270
when we put long hours as a regular

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,730
muscle our brain gets tired when our

00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:54,530
brain gets tired it's prone to making

00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:56,030
errors in the world where we crave for

00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:58,070
perfectionism where we want to deliver

00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:00,950
the best possible results this leads us

00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:03,950
to mental record it all starts with long

00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:06,169
hours as an attempt to achieve more to

00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:09,770
be more productive our brain gets tired

00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:11,899
and we make errors in our work when we

00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:13,550
make errors we cannot be satisfied with

00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:15,679
the results so we lack the feeling of

00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,919
accomplishment and in order to regain

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,770
this feeling of accomplishment and we

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:26,720
fix all these problems again we put long

00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:28,879
hours this mental recursion and long

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,530
hours instead of making us more

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,409
productive actually leads us to the

00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:36,200
state of stress but stress and it's

00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:39,250
heavier forms like burnout are not only

00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,250
about productivity

00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:49,569
Hiroshi in Japanese in technically means

00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:51,460
death by overwork according to different

00:34:49,569 --> 00:34:55,599
resources in 2015

00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:58,630
10,000 people died in Japan solely due

00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:00,849
to overwork 10,000 people but even then

00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:05,200
these terms tells nowhere near another

00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:07,390
term ghoul Allah see that technically

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:13,619
means the same death by overwork but in

00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:16,960
Chinese every year China loses about

00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:20,470
600,000 people due to overwork this

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,420
results to 16 deaths every day due to

00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,539
overwork we're not talking about people

00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,950
working with sharp objects or guns

00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:30,160
majority of these people are white

00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:32,349
colours sitting in the offices in order

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,259
to understand why stress is so dangerous

00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:39,609
to us we have to dive a bit deeper into

00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:41,859
our friend brain so when when we feel

00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:44,079
stressed our brain sends signals all

00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:46,539
over our body to enable the protective

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,019
mechanism among other things this

00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:51,460
mechanism consists of two chemicals

00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:56,160
adrenaline and the so called stress

00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:59,259
hormone cortisol combination of this is

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,869
brilliant it helps us make really fast

00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:03,940
decisions when we are in real danger

00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:07,240
this combination is very similar to

00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:11,079
adding important to your CSS files it

00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:14,769
overrides everything else our body

00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:17,200
forgets about how to plan our life for

00:36:14,769 --> 00:36:19,119
the next 10 years because it's busy with

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,700
thinking how to survive the next 10

00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,700
minutes this is what stress does to us

00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:30,339
this mechanism is vital for hours for

00:36:27,279 --> 00:36:33,099
for us to survive right and it might

00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:34,509
even bring this creative adrenaline kick

00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:36,119
to those hard-working developers to

00:36:34,509 --> 00:36:39,369
finish that one feature before deadline

00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,710
but the same mechanism applied for

00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:47,170
prolonged periods of time to our brain

00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:49,839
can severely damage our brain recent

00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:52,440
research in Berkeley California and

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,020
Sweden show that

00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,910
our brain physically changes its

00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,860
structure under prolonged periods of

00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:00,420
stress this is what happens and McDonald

00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,190
region is increased thinning of the

00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,870
prefrontal cortex shrinking of the

00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,400
hippocampus and the only question we

00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:08,070
might have here is what the heck does

00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,140
this mean so let me translate this into

00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:12,380
human readable language it means

00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:15,090
premature aging of your brain

00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:18,270
significant drop in learning abilities

00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:21,570
and weakened memory and make it

00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:24,900
ridiculously obvious these three income

00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:30,000
in combination are the signs of mental

00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:32,100
disability isn't it amazing we do work

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,620
hard we want to achieve the best

00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:37,680
possible result we learn new things and

00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:43,020
the paycheck for all of this is early

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:45,000
dementia or Alzheimer's we have to do

00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,650
something about this I'm pretty sure

00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,030
that you are familiar with the most

00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:53,670
common ways to fight stress like

00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:55,770
physical exercises or meditation simple

00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:58,200
as simple things as chocolate or

00:37:55,770 --> 00:38:02,010
ultraviolet light can help you find

00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,500
stress a bit but today I want to talk to

00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:09,060
you about another approach approach that

00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:11,250
would help you to prevent this severe

00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:13,710
damage to our brains let's talk about

00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:17,010
Harvard Howard University we all know

00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:19,530
about Harvard right it's 133 Nobel

00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:21,120
laureates 35 current billionaires 8

00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,550
presidents of the United States it's the

00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,250
birthplace for Facebook and Microsoft

00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:30,060
it's also active universities in the

00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:33,390
world in 2017 only 5.8%

00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:35,460
applicants a gained admission to this

00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:38,190
university because in the process of

00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,860
admission things not directly related to

00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:43,440
studying are taken into account as well

00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:46,620
like achievements and music achievements

00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,270
and supports owned startup business and

00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:50,040
so on and so on so it wouldn't be an

00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:51,750
exaggeration to say that anybody

00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,880
studying at Harvard has to leave

00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,560
completely crazy life dedicating every

00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,470
minute of his or her life

00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:02,820
to either studying or self-development

00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:05,940
and a lot of them do in 2004 there were

00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:07,349
it was a meeting between students

00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,619
the management of the University where

00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:13,349
students raised some concerns quite

00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:16,530
weird concerns I must say so some

00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:19,290
students claimed that they want to take

00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:23,460
two full-size courses four-year courses

00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:25,500
and pass them in parallel others wanted

00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,480
to take the full four years course and

00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:30,210
pass it within three years so

00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,030
technically what students wanted was to

00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:36,000
do as much as they possibly could while

00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:38,099
they are at Harvard what a pleasant

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,660
thing should it be for management of

00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:41,790
university to hear these things from the

00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:46,800
students right but instead of being

00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:49,500
impressed Harry Lewis Dean of Harvard

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:54,050
undergraduate school back then sent a

00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:57,750
letter to all the students in Harvard

00:39:54,050 --> 00:40:01,349
titled slow down getting more out of

00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:03,599
Harvard by doing less in this letter

00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:06,480
Harry Lewis appealed to the students

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,180
that instead of increased mental

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:14,220
pressure what they really need is to

00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:16,560
slow down he advocated to for students

00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:18,450
to take some time off Harvard and not

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,069
just an evening or a week but take the

00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:24,089
whole term or the whole year of Harvard

00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:25,980
naturally enough the parents of the

00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:29,250
students were furious reasonably

00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:32,609
believing that after spending one year

00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:34,380
of Harvard students won't be remembering

00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:37,140
anything they had they learned before

00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:40,050
leaving Harvard or they just won't be

00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:44,310
willing to get back to Harvard right but

00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:49,050
statistics tells us 96% of those who had

00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:52,020
full year of Harvard came back gained

00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:54,990
grad mission and successfully graduated

00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:59,390
Harvard Harvard calls it this slow

00:40:54,990 --> 00:41:02,430
learning drew faust current president of

00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:06,900
Harvard University says college can help

00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:10,710
you learn how to think more than what to

00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:14,339
think how to think more than what to

00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:17,310
think and I believe this is exactly the

00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:19,740
problem that we have in our industry we

00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:22,890
have tons of information telling us

00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:28,190
to think even if it's titled how to but

00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:31,410
we have to learn ourselves how to think

00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:35,010
today we have seen that a program

00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:36,990
presenting an average developer has a

00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:38,960
lot of box we have covered just the tip

00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:42,660
of the iceberg there are many more

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:45,030
problems in this program but unlike our

00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:47,250
projects we cannot postpone fixing this

00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:51,060
box for later because unlike our

00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:55,110
projects this program has no versions

00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:58,230
other than 1.0 and debugging and fixing

00:41:55,110 --> 00:42:02,670
problems we have to do we have to do it

00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:04,200
straight in production does our industry

00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:08,850
need more professional successful

00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:10,920
developers frankly I don't know but what

00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:18,119
is certain is that our industry is more

00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:21,750
healthy more happy developers my name is

00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:24,240
Dennis I am a developer and I have a lot

00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:26,670
of problems because of this but as

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,190
psychiatrists say acknowledging a

00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,460
problem is the first step to mental

00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:34,329
health

00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:37,420
today I have shared some problems and I

00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:40,030
personally have but I'm sure they have

00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,640
resonated with some of you because even

00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:46,510
though our friend the doesn't mean we

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:50,980
cannot have the same problems Department

00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:55,650
these problems to your production stay

00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,650
healthy stay happy thank you
