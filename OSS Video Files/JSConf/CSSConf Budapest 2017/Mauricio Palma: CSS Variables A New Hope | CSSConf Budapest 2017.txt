Title: Mauricio Palma: CSS Variables A New Hope | CSSConf Budapest 2017
Publication date: 2018-02-16
Playlist: CSSConf Budapest 2017
Description: 
	The history of the relationship between CSS and JS traces back to the origins of web UI development. Their symbiosis has evolved into a dynamic, ever-evolving ecosystem. But this was not a voluntary coexistence. The communication between each other has been forced.

CSS Variables is the new promising future for CSS and JS. The alliance that should finally bring harmony in front-end development. In this talk, we will uncover some truths, myths, and lies behind them. Starting with the syntax and specification. We will showcase examples that highlight some of the incredibly useful features. Weâ€™ll also uncover some obscure secrets that could endanger this new alliance.

[Applause]

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,130

like to thank this users comes Budapest

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:26,220
team for making this amazing event

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:32,759
I think they deserved if you give it up

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:34,770
for them one time they feel great so my

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,370
deepest thanks to them for having me and

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:42,000
thanks to you too my name is Mauricio

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,760
Palma and I was born and raised in Costa

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,680
Rica and living in the beautiful city of

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:52,100
Hamburg for the past 11 years

00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,989
I'm also UI developer a syn Estrada

00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,989
working with a colorful range of clients

00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:59,879
mostly the big brands out there and I

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:04,860
must admit we're doing a lot of exciting

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:07,140
projects nowadays I'm also co-founder of

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,360
would like ocean that would like ocean

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,570
with craft swimmer out of ocean

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,000
recovered fishing nets and together with

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,220
several organizations and divers were

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,360
collecting ghost fishing nets to use

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:24,780
them in our products so to be quite

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,080
honest with you I think I'm one of those

00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,140
polo kids of the web even though I'm 36

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,470
years old and what I mean with that is I

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,040
start developing sides I started for six

00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,220
years

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:44,340
my first sites and apps for the web so I

00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:48,270
was not around in 1991 when Tim

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,460
berners-lee announced HTML at the time

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:57,420
there was no method for styling web

00:01:50,460 --> 00:02:00,600
pages neither was I around in 1996 when

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,890
Haakon V Lee first introduced the first

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,329
official specification of CSS level 1

00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:10,160
which is the same year in which

00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:10,160
Macromedia introduced flash

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,020
so it was pretty much at the same time

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:19,290
when Brendan eyes developed JavaScript

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:22,080
in just 10 days going through a lot of

00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:27,810
corporate and marketing reinventions

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:31,340
like mocha and life spray so not I was

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:34,440
not around during this exciting and

00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:40,319
turbulent times of the wild wild web I

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:44,280
could enjoy working with html5 css3 es5

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:48,600
harmony and all the amazing api's that

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:51,420
the browser provide for us today so life

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:56,610
has been good to me at least I thought

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:59,519
so when I started out and as a journal

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:03,540
after gathering some years of experience

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,610
I realized I was not quite right I spent

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:08,250
countless hours trying to find

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,310
performing techniques to manipulate the

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,650
quickness of the Dom researching all

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:17,670
kind of techniques to generate smooth

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:22,130
animations trying desperately to get CSS

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,130
to work smoothly with JavaScript

00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,099
second

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:35,730
so time goes by and you gather some

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,130
experience within your possibilities and

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,280
try to work yourself around all these

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:43,200
things and don't get me wrong I love

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:49,050
doing what I do and it's the same laughs

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,370
I have since day one and just like you

00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:54,300
just heard speaking is something

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:57,570
relatively new to me and as you probably

00:03:54,300 --> 00:04:00,150
noticed my first stalk ever I think I

00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,720
have three stalks in my life and this is

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:07,050
a real special one it is my first one

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,750
and it all started with my friend Gregor

00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,300
Adams also known with the handle picks

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,900
alas who actually invited me to co-host

00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:19,220
a CSS variables talk at an internal

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,860
singer strata technical off-site and

00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:25,080
this is how I started experimenting

00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:28,830
playing around and actually using CSS

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:33,450
variables and I must say it changed the

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:36,690
way I write my CSS today so it's been a

00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:39,960
busy exciting journey and I would like

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,780
in a very humble way to inspire you from

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,520
what I have learned in this journey

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,500
hopefully at the end of this talk you

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,380
will take back one or two techniques

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:55,650
that you could use at your own work that

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:57,120
would be the best so it is we should be

00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,919
looking some little stars in the

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,669
background but anyways we're getting

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:05,760
into that it is this desire to find

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:08,850
hidden information that will allow us to

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,419
change the way we work today the way we

00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:15,710
write our CSS today to be always hungry

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:20,430
for more information so in the screen

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:23,240
there is a hidden message oh and let's

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:23,240
find out what it is

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,710
so we're using the spotlight

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,550
a new hope and that's the name of this

00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:41,060
talk that I prepared for you and

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:45,880
hopefully I can demonstrate how elegant

00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,880
and powerful CSS variables can be

00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:55,789
so I'm using SVG's for this example so

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,309
let's go through the example see how we

00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:01,069
made that and decided to create the

00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:07,009
animation like I said with an SVG and

00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:11,389
CSS variables the new hope' headline is

00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:13,819
an SVG path and to achieve this

00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:16,669
spotlight effect I'm using four

00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:18,770
different SVG circles using custom

00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:22,209
properties to define their positioning

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:25,519
within the SVG view box as you can see

00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:28,219
property names are prefixed with a - -

00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:31,490
annotation and it contains a value that

00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:34,699
can be reused these are the custom

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:36,769
properties if we take a look at the

00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:39,860
values we see we have the radius pretty

00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:42,469
much the size of the circle we have a CX

00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:48,309
custom property which is the positioning

00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:48,309
in the x-axis and the same goes for C Y

00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:55,550
by using the VAR function we can access

00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:58,129
the values we previously assign at root

00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:01,249
level this would be the positioning of

00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:04,309
all circles using the conceal spot class

00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:10,009
and all of them are currently positioned

00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:12,259
in the middle so we can only see one

00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:16,550
circle so we're selling all four circles

00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:19,279
they're stacked behind each other but if

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:22,099
we reflect for a moment and think about

00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,490
the custom property spec you'll find

00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:28,009
something like custom properties are

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:30,559
ordinary CSS properties and what that

00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:35,659
means is that they are resolved with the

00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:40,009
same inheritance and cascade rules so if

00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:42,490
we take this information toward oh one

00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:42,490
second

00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,890
okay by using this information to our

00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:52,100
advantage

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:56,030
we can make all circles visible given

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:59,360
them a new position and but instead of

00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:02,210
overriding the rule declaration we can

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,120
reassign the custom property with a new

00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:08,300
value in an element with the higher

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,760
specificity that's a hard work but it

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:18,080
kind of work out right now so in that

00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:21,980
case yep in this case we can use the

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,950
none type pseudo class element to

00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:30,050
recursively reassign the new value

00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:32,360
leading us into this result so there is

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,720
one last thing we knew in our CSS to

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,870
achieve the spotlight effect so we will

00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,479
be using the clip path property

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:47,090
referring to the for SVG click path

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:48,800
elements what these four elements

00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:51,380
contain are the extractives

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,260
letter sections of the new hope headline

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:59,810
this will be the clip regions of each

00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:02,690
circle leading us to this effect and now

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,880
it's time for magic but not the kind of

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:08,360
magic when you know why code is behaving

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:11,060
in a certain way not that so in my

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:15,500
opinion this is one of the most powerful

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:18,400
features of CSS variables custom

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:22,370
properties are available at runtime

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:25,940
making them accessible at all times in

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:29,210
JavaScript to JavaScript and every time

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:31,780
I say that I get so excited think about

00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,780
it for a minute

00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:48,129
did you reflect that on that I hope so

00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:50,680
it is very important in order to

00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:53,259
simplify the explanation of what is

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:56,079
going on in JavaScript I will focus only

00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:58,269
in the custom properties if you want to

00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:01,029
take a look at what different techniques

00:09:58,269 --> 00:10:03,490
I'm using in JavaScript you can take a

00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:06,670
look at the code things that there will

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:09,730
be available and I also prepared a

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:12,879
little a code pen collection for this

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:16,899
conference and you can see what's going

00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:20,110
on under the hood so for now we'll be

00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:23,259
listening to the mousemove event read

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:26,879
and calculate values in relation to the

00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:30,399
SVG view box and the real fun is

00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:33,519
happening on that update function by

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,790
just using the set property method we're

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,160
able to write and update the custom

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:43,629
property values at the root of the

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:46,559
document so we can take a look at the

00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:46,559
effect one more time

00:10:51,990 --> 00:11:00,690
and this is how we achieve that effect

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:02,899
thanks to custom properties we can do

00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,899
that

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:20,510
yes so I close my eyes to all ends and

00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,510
open my heart to new beginnings

00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:25,940
oops

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,780
Oh No

00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,790
so I don't think I get tired of

00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:44,430
repeating these but custom properties

00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:47,730
being available at run time opened a

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:50,220
whole new world of possibilities and in

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,709
my pursuit to illustrate this for you I

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:59,190
prepared this galaxy animation using

00:11:52,709 --> 00:12:05,130
HTML CSS in just a bit of JavaScript for

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:08,959
no it's not after a while you cannot

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:08,959
hear the sound it gets really annoying

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,529
so what I want to do is create an

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:18,990
animation for every single star

00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:22,770
something like a circular sensation from

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:26,490
the X and C axis so if we take a look at

00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:30,060
that this is what we want to do with

00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:33,930
this single star and for this I'm

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:36,630
actually running a timeline from 0 to 1

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,850
and this is my actual counter and if you

00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:42,420
can look at the button by including this

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,850
in mine sine and cosine custom

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:50,160
properties I can achieve this wished

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:52,620
circular transition and it's a little

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,800
bit Yankee and I've been having problems

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,260
with my speaker notes at slides if

00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,870
somebody knows the reason of it can tell

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:03,180
me about later it's been a pain so you

00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:08,700
have to trust me it's actually more

00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:11,459
smooth but anyways I emphasize in the

00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,130
word transition because such animations

00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:16,380
we want to focus on hitting the 60

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:19,200
frames per second mark and we don't want

00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,300
to retrieve a repaint at first of all

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,570
the reason for this is that today's

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:28,110
devices refresh their screens 60 times

00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:30,899
per second that means that if there's a

00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:34,740
transition running the browser needs to

00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:36,420
match the device refresh rate refresh

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,709
rate and that's what you should always

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,709
achieve to

00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:47,990
but hearing 60 frames-per-second marked

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:50,300
with one element it is not that hard now

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:53,060
in order to dip it to demonstrate the

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:56,000
differences I did two examples and the

00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:59,000
first one would be without CSS variables

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,940
I think the way you should you would

00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,140
normally do it and it looks like

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:08,690
something like this we spread the stars

00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:13,190
are the elements across the x axis and

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:16,160
the z axis with sorry the x axis and the

00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:19,970
y axis with position:absolute we're

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:23,630
achieving depth by using the translate C

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:27,190
and because we want to animate the Stars

00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:30,620
using transform I have to iterate over

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:33,710
250 elements retrieve their CSS

00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:36,050
translate Z value and save it in an

00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:41,780
array that is reference with the name

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:45,260
z-axis list so I have to iterate one

00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:49,490
more time map the values of the

00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:52,760
translate C or our array and write the

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:56,600
new translation all of it in the endless

00:14:52,760 --> 00:15:00,290
60 times requestanimationframe loop and

00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,860
it already sounds so expensive so if we

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,860
take a look

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,910
and

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,170
we check out the frames per second

00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:23,650
can you see it no so I will have to read

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:29,800
it for you I cannot even see it myself

00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:33,190
but something 24:22 and you see it is

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:40,380
Genki so it's a lot of operations for

00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:44,040
the browser to do so let's close this

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,040
and continue

00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:52,910
now I want to create the same animation

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:56,810
using CSS variables and with CSS

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:59,510
variables it is much more elegant and

00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:02,240
intuitive I don't have to iterate over

00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:05,810
the Dom I don't have to retrieve any

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,510
values from the Dom at the end I just

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:11,780
need to update and write the values from

00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:18,710
my sine and cosine variables that's it

00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:21,560
it's pretty pretty simple our CSS

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:25,010
remains in our CSS and not as inline

00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,200
Styles inline Styles in our Dom and this

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:32,950
is one of the reasons I love custom

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:36,740
properties or CSS variables so much but

00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:38,720
like in any journey I encounter some

00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,160
difficulties and I will not lie to you

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:45,110
it was not all sunshine and rainbows

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,330
with the CSS variables inclement ation

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,850
at first I was not hitting the 60 frames

00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,280
per second mark and I started freaking

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:55,220
out like I'm here talking to you about

00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,650
fuses variables and performance and Adam

00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,670
even achieving or reaching my own

00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:03,070
expectations

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:06,620
so as it turns out pseudo elements with

00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:10,520
filter C use this filter like blur and

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:13,850
brightness are super expensive to

00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,970
animate so I had to change my styling

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:20,540
strategy now the stars are not looking

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:23,840
so good as originally but like in life

00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:32,320
you have to make sometimes compromises

00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:32,320
so let's take a look at the example

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:42,120
since a little jacket I will close my

00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:44,880
speaker notes because I want you to

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,290
experience to be of animation so give me

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,980
one second I don't know if it's going to

00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,980
be good in you

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,559
[Music]

00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:55,559
and it's not bad

00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,899
we'll check the frames per second

00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:15,840
and we are 758 almost there you should

00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,690
always try to keep the 60

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,320
frames-per-second heart now we will

00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:21,320
close this

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,310
and we continue

00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:55,150
so I started wondering what if we try

00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,420
the new stars tragedy with the first

00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:01,630
demo without ceases variables and not so

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,910
surprisingly I was able to actually hit

00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:07,030
the 60 frames per second mark

00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:09,610
so I actually realized the browser is

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,410
actually so powerful that you can

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,950
animate all these divs all these

00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:19,360
elements in the DOM and still can reach

00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:22,290
a 60 frames per second animation so

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,290
let's take a look at that

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:44,380
and we are 58 59

00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:52,510
almost at 58 almost there but always

00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:54,789
looking for 60 very important now this

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:57,730
is what I love the most about CSS

00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:59,950
variables beyond anything else that's

00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:02,529
what I think is the most powerful

00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:05,260
feature and is their ability and

00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:09,340
elegance to interact with web devices

00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:12,820
api's in a declarative manner UI

00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:15,669
development is changing and develop it's

00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:18,130
changing at a rapid pace so when we

00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:22,179
speak about responsive we're speaking

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:25,690
more about an interface interacting to

00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:28,240
the user user context more than just the

00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,580
layout composition adapting to a

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,260
viewport width that's what actually

00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:37,630
responsive should be meaning today so if

00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:41,500
we take this animated galaxy interface

00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:45,100
how could we contextualize our current

00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:48,010
showcase and maybe we could move the

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:50,679
perspective of the galaxy according to

00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:54,460
our device orientation and then give us

00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:56,890
this look that we're on a spaceship it

00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,700
sounded like a good example for me so

00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:02,679
let's give it a try so with the

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,830
assistance of a little WebSocket server

00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:08,649
and client I will be able to give you

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:12,570
the same mobile experience on the screen

00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:16,450
and maybe with a little bit of latency

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:18,779
we will have to see so for now we will

00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:21,549
listen to the device orientation event

00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:24,760
for us there are only two values that

00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:26,559
are relevant at the moment and device

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,690
orientation actually returns four

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:33,640
different values but we will focus on

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:36,730
two for now the alpha alpha is pretty

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:40,120
much the movement of the device in the C

00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:42,909
axis it is tempered the perpendicular to

00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,519
the ground and you can imagine it like

00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:49,499
line that goes to the middle of the

00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:54,489
earth it returns the value around 300

00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:57,460
around zero and 360 degrees beta on the

00:21:54,489 --> 00:22:05,849
other way returns to degree value from

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:09,700
minus 180 to 180 degrees and for our CSS

00:22:05,849 --> 00:22:13,779
this is all what we will need for it to

00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:18,580
work so let's give it a try need a

00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:21,630
second to actually start my server

00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,630
[Music]

00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,080
this is not for real I just

00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,180
[Applause]

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:47,980
when a second I hope I can show you this

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:50,160
not this would be really sad one second

00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:50,160
please

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:20,160
so one second if it doesn't work we just

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,310
leave it for now I'll try it one more

00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,310
time

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,260
okay that's great so we're ready to go

00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,870
so we have the server running now we'll

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,049
connect to the server with my own mobile

00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,049
device

00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:01,800
unfortunately you cannot see it really

00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,480
good but like I said all the examples

00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,780
are important and so if you want to take

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:11,900
a look at it now I'm moving my device

00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:11,900
and it's having happen

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:35,030
so now I'm actually moving the device

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:43,100
little Latin see but as you can see one

00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:49,250
can use in the declarant declarative

00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:50,880
manner use our CSS to actually interact

00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:54,079
with it

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,079
[Music]

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:10,810
I closed that before we all go crazy

00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:14,890
with the music and let's continue so

00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:17,590
this this stop is reaching to an end but

00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,220
I have one last showcase I hope it works

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:24,280
because we did like in the last minute

00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:27,690
for you or maybe for me so I'm not sure

00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:30,460
about it so I think lightly with

00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:34,150
contextualizing interfaces and I thought

00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:38,500
what if we contextualize the result of

00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:42,250
this presentation so I prepared an emoji

00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:46,270
happy meter and it's using the Audio API

00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:50,140
I'm using CSS variables and SVG's and

00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:54,630
this is how it works so the result

00:25:50,140 --> 00:26:00,070
completely depends on you so if you like

00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:05,050
let's take a look if you like what you

00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:08,590
just heard you have to give it up and

00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:09,410
you have to give it up real loud so come

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:21,660
let's try it

00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:21,660
[Applause]

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:29,770
okay I'll make this smile that's right

00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,770
again one more time

00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:47,990
so thanks thank you very much I would

00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:50,680
say that went really well for your first

00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:50,680
