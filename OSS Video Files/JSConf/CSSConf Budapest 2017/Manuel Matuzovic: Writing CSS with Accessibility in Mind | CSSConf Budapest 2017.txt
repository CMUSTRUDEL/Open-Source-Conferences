Title: Manuel Matuzovic: Writing CSS with Accessibility in Mind | CSSConf Budapest 2017
Publication date: 2018-02-16
Playlist: CSSConf Budapest 2017
Description: 
	Web accessibility has so many facets, that learning about it and implementing it correctly may seem daunting to some of us. Just imagine excluding a whole group of users by simply declaring * { outline: none; }.

The good news, though, is that CSS has a lot to offer that may help us create accessible web sites and web apps. This talk aims to demystify web accessibility and provide you with simple and practical CSS tips and tricks, which you can easily incorporate into your workflow today. You are going to find out how to make your web projects more inclusive and improve the usability and user experience at the same time.

okay now again hi and first of all thank

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,660
you for having me and thank you all for

00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,030
being here my name is Manuel Matosevic

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,610
and I'm a freelance front-end developer

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,230
from Vienna the slides are already

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,390
online so you can check them out and

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,590
follow and log on your laptop if you

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,539
want to write I'm a way to put a badge

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,400
that was working on some JavaScript

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,990
stuff or you know actually I wasn't

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,760
working it was doing it just for fun

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,590
because I like to spend some of my free

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,510
time doing web stuff who else does that

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,500
who spends free time doing web stuff

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,559
yeah

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,840
some of us because we all love our job

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,250
or at least I do and I still love it

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,230
even though I'm doing this for quite a

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,110
while now I made my first web site about

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:47,940
17 years ago some friends and I were

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,770
playing an online game and we had a

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,309
so-called clan and I made the website

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:56,309
for his clan and that's the site the

00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:00,570
name is in French the name is in French

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:02,430
and the translation is eat your poo we

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,769
were some badass 13 year olds yeah

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,310
definitely but our website was pretty

00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:11,100
cool we had some image buttons and of

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,229
course a gap gas book and some Paul's I

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,880
informed users that the size was the

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,060
site was optimized for a certain

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,220
resolution and of course I had a marquee

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,980
tag here yeah

00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,980
[Applause]

00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,660
and there was even some custom

00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,440
JavaScript stuff going on a few years

00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:34,580
later I made my first personal website

00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,260
there is a lot of embarrassing stuff

00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,090
going on I'm not going to go into detail

00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,510
later I even cut some stuff out because

00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,190
it was just too much there are two very

00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,990
interesting things here the first one is

00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:50,180
one of my favorite favorite movies was

00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:52,220
the shinning and the second thing is

00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:55,310
that I didn't use CSS at all in this

00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,229
website I made the layout with so called

00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,170
frame sets some of you may know who them

00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:03,790
yeah yeah frame set and I defined three

00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:08,509
columns using HTML attributes and then I

00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:10,489
embedded and in each of those columns

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:12,230
separates HTML file one for the

00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:15,470
navigation one for the main content and

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,570
one for a sidebar for the layout of the

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,239
main content of course I used tables and

00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:23,810
attributes like border color background

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:34,160
color align and I set the width to 442

00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:36,680
percent it worked and for the global

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,480
styles of course I used again HTML

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,220
attributes like background color V link

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,190
and ailing for active and visited links

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:47,120
and the good old fonts tag for font size

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:49,280
and font family if I didn't use CSS

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,590
because maybe I didn't know about it or

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,989
maybe I just didn't need it but a few

00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,880
years later in college I learned CSS and

00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:59,360
all the great properties like float

00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,310
position overflow background properties

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,650
line height and so on that was amazing

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,350
and then a few years later again I was

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,910
introduced to a game changer to CSS free

00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:10,400
because all of a sudden we had

00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:13,100
border-radius box shadow animation

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,720
transforms web fonts of course and the

00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,400
way the web looked like changed

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,110
significantly and it still keeps

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,090
changing because browsers are can't

00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,970
constantly shipping great new features

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:25,190
like flexbox grids feature queries

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:28,430
custom properties amazing stuff to

00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,850
create amazing experiences but you know

00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,070
what

00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,390
spider-man's uncle says with great power

00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,990
comes great responsibility

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:39,599
[Laughter]

00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:42,219
[Applause]

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,590
and now we also have many tools to

00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:46,450
create bad experiences and that's what I

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,040
want to talk about in the course of the

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:49,359
next twenty five minutes I'm going going

00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,969
to show you some properties that you can

00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:53,680
use in order to improve the

00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:55,750
accessibility and the user experience of

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,450
your sites and some properties that you

00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,489
can misuse in and change the experience

00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:04,239
for the worse and I'm going to start

00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:05,980
with font size the font size for text

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,790
was in the last few years somewhere

00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:12,519
between 14 and 18 pixels that that has

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,169
changed recently and we can see more and

00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,750
more sites increasing their font sizes

00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:18,820
for example and CSS tricks a medium that

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,039
we have a font size of 21 pixels and

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,460
that's a good thing because 16 pixels

00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:26,620
for text is definitely not good enough

00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:29,349
or not big enough of course it depends

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:31,660
on the font you're using but starting

00:04:29,349 --> 00:04:34,150
somewhere between 18 and 20 pixels is

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,430
probably a good thing and then working

00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,440
your way up from there because usually

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,539
the bigger the screen size the bigger

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,199
the distance between the user and the

00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:45,729
screen so for a usage on a smart TV for

00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:48,190
example you would want to have a really

00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:53,710
big font size so people can read still

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:57,130
read the text from a far distance next

00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:00,280
thing line height the line height in

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,590
most browsers is at roughly 1.2 by

00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,620
default the web accessibility initiative

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,870
recommends a line height of at least one

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,199
point five because for people with

00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:13,630
cognitive disabilities it's easier to

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,580
start a new line after they have

00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:18,400
finished the previous one if the line

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,860
height is bigger and on top of that if

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,680
you compare the two the second one looks

00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:26,099
even nicer if the because of the bigger

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,099
line Heights

00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:34,330
text is by default aligned to the left

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:37,569
or to the right depending on the reading

00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:40,419
direction of the language and a thing

00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:43,650
designers like to do is to justify the

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:46,599
text because justifying text makes

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:49,090
especially long text look nicer because

00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:51,039
all lines have the same length what the

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,680
browser does in order to get those same

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,099
length lines is that increases/decreases

00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,250
the word spacing and this may result in

00:05:57,099 --> 00:06:02,169
irregular word spacing and for some

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:05,199
people it's harder to read text if the

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:07,090
word spacing is irregular and on top of

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,639
that a friend of mine recently told me

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:15,039
that using justified text in web design

00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:17,129
is so 2016 so it's bad for accessibility

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:23,169
and it's not cool so just don't do it

00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:25,569
please Dennis told me to say please here

00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:27,370
we have a nice paragraph the line height

00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:29,710
is all rights the font size is all

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:33,099
rights but something is odd about this

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:34,900
paragraph it's just too narrow not

00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:38,229
enough words fit per line it's it's hard

00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,810
to read on the other hand in this

00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:42,819
paragraph the text is just too long the

00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,789
paragraphs is too wide what's considered

00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:49,029
ideal is a character count between 45

00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:53,229
and 75 characters per line so that's

00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:55,889
considered ideal yes so here for example

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:58,960
we have a paragraph with a maximum

00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:01,199
maximum of about 65 characters per line

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,339
it looks nice and it's easy to read

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,919
what's cool about that is that we can

00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:08,550
use CSS to control that we can set a max

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,289
width of this paragraph to 65 characters

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,479
the character unit has been around for

00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:16,479
quite a while now and it's pretty cool

00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:20,289
it represents the width of the glyph

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,509
zero in the elements font and this

00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:25,509
paragraph for example here will only be

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:27,460
as big as to fit 65 characters roughly

00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:29,669
65 characters per line so that's pretty

00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,669
cool

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:36,310
we have or there are several pseudo

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,889
elements you can use in CSS to create

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,229
cool things two of the more popular ones

00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:43,810
are before and after you can use before

00:07:41,229 --> 00:07:46,419
to add content directly after the start

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:49,930
tag and after to add content directly

00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:52,990
before the end tag we can do cool to

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,999
stuff we can do cool stuff using those

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,759
pseudo elements but there is one thing

00:07:54,999 --> 00:08:01,210
we shouldn't do we should not add text

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:03,819
using CSS text belongs in an HTML file

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:07,990
coming from that database or API but it

00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:10,719
shouldn't be in CSS what we can do is we

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:14,139
can add icons or glyphs using CSS for

00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:19,270
example here this code will produce this

00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:22,240
nice-looking X and I've used this X here

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:24,370
to create a custom list I've removed the

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,379
default list styling and I've added

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:32,370
spans in each list item with this X and

00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:35,349
if the sound works we are going to hear

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:38,519
how the screenreader jaws on Windows is

00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,519
going to read this list

00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:53,769
okay doesn't matter it will it will say

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:56,649
Times item 1 times item 2 times item 3

00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:58,899
times item 4 because as it turns out

00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:00,970
this X isn't the X but the symbol four

00:08:58,899 --> 00:09:03,069
times like in two times two or three

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,800
times four and this can get very

00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:07,990
confusing because users might think that

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:10,600
we are multiplying all those list items

00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:14,230
but in reality we're just using it as a

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,939
design feature as a bullet so what you

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,970
want to do here is you want to make sure

00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:21,160
that you hide those things semantically

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,139
this means that it's still visually

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,209
visible but hidden for screen readers

00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:26,709
and you can do that by using the area

00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:30,939
hidden attribute and setting it to true

00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:33,310
and by the way in this example don't do

00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:35,110
that what I just showed you you would

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,509
rather stick to the good old list I'll

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:41,259
type all this tile image for changing

00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:47,579
these icons is more accessible now a

00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:47,579
nice topic for today color contrast

00:09:48,230 --> 00:10:02,340
color contrast is important because of

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,700
conferences and because 285 million

00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:10,530
people are visually impaired 39 million

00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:13,350
are blind and 246 have low vision 7 to

00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:16,020
12 percent of men and less than 1% of

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,540
women have some form of color vision

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,370
deficiency it's usually hard for them to

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,040
differentiate two colors like red and

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,780
green now the reason why color contrast

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,430
is important is that people deem their

00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,470
screens on their smartphones for example

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,680
and people like to use their smartphones

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:33,420
outside even when the sun is shining so

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,450
we know color contrast is important but

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:39,180
how much is enough the web accessibility

00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:40,920
initiative defines it by enough contrast

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,410
between text and its background so that

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,170
so that it can be read by people with

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:49,110
moderately low vision okay we got that

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:50,820
but you know we need in a number we need

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:52,920
a way to measure that and there is one

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,400
they got so called contest contrast

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,170
ratio the lowest ratio is one to one you

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,230
get that if you use the same color for

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,480
text and background the highest ratio is

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:06,080
1 to 21 you get that if you use black

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,030
text on white background and vice versa

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,980
the minimum ratio for normal texts we

00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:13,530
would like to achieve for normal text

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:16,680
that is less than 25 pixels is for 0.5

00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:19,530
to 1 and the minimum ratio for bold text

00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,170
that is less than 19 pixels is 3 to 1

00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,530
and for larger text it's also three to

00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,200
one

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:28,620
that's the absolute minimum ideally you

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,960
would have a ratio of 7 to 1 for normal

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:35,940
text and 4.5 to 1 for bold text of

00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,770
course there are ways to measure the

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,960
ratio for example there's one in the

00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,880
browser made by leave a room you can

00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,350
enter here on the left side the

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,730
background color and on the right side

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,380
the text color and it will give you the

00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:51,750
score for example here we have a ratio

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:53,910
of 3.2 to 1 which is not enough but you

00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,040
can change that and try some other

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:58,890
colors and the score will update and

00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,280
here for example we have a score of 15

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:04,010
point 3 to 1 which is very good

00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:06,470
another way of testing accessibility is

00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:08,480
possible with deaf tools in Chrome

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,970
starting with Chrome 60 lighthouse is

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,430
baked in in chrome dev tools in an audit

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:17,120
panel and you can check your sites for

00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:19,490
several best practices for PWO PWA best

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,790
practices accessibility performance and

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,740
general press best practices lighthouse

00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:27,830
will check your sites and give you a

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,290
score and it will list all the things

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:32,330
that aren't alright and it for example

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:35,240
here it will tell you which elements

00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:37,430
don't have enough enough contrast so

00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:40,070
that's pretty nice another great thing

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,380
is that you can display the color ratio

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:45,170
directly in the color picker in chrome

00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,120
dev tools that's not possible in

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:50,360
standard chrome you have to get Chrome

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:55,940
Canary enable experiments and you have

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:57,410
to press shift seven times and then you

00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:03,140
really have to do that and then you have

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:04,700
to check the setting and that's it now

00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,839
measuring is one thing but actually

00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:12,650
testing is another thing again there are

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:15,620
ways for us to test contrast ratios and

00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:18,170
so on for example in Windows you can

00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,910
enter the settings and you will find

00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,070
high contrast settings and you can

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,170
switch the default theme of Windows to a

00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:27,860
very high contrasting theme for example

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:31,670
like this one or this one or you can

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:34,700
also set your own colors here and I did

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:38,089
that and I made a very simple example

00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,950
okay the contrast it's better now very

00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:42,050
simple example it's based on something I

00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:44,570
found in dribble it's something like a

00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:47,630
login form and I used it in several high

00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:49,400
contrasting themes and this is what it

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,560
looks like what you can see here is that

00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,839
the button isn't recognizable anymore

00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,600
you see it's entered text but you don't

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,580
see that it is a button and if it wasn't

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,110
for the placeholder text you wouldn't

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,870
see the input fields they would be

00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:05,210
invisible a really quick fix for me was

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,740
to add default borders for the input

00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,540
fields and the buttons and now the

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,300
accessibility is much much better for

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:14,510
those for this simple form in high

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,810
contrast modes of course there was there

00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,730
was

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,660
just quick fix there's a lot more to it

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:22,610
Annika hanker wrote a very awesome

00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:25,910
article about that and I'm going to

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:29,210
share it with my slides later on another

00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:32,270
great tool is called no coffee

00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:34,250
it's a browser plugin there you can set

00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:37,370
several things for example you can make

00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:39,230
the site blurry or you can simulate

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:41,270
color deficiencies or you can even

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,550
simulate blocked visual fields so there

00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:46,520
are a lot of things you can do in this

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:49,940
settings panel here to test stuff again

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:52,370
it's called no coffee the reason why I'm

00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,990
talking about contrasts I guess you know

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,000
the reason but one of the reason when

00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,970
reasons why I'm talking about contrast

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,460
is there has been a certain trend of

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:04,820
using low contrasting colors in web

00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:07,790
design something like a grey on grey

00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,100
text color on light grey backgrounds

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:13,070
now this might look nice but it's very

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,170
inaccessible and I'm pretty sure that

00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:20,420
there are other colors than gray and

00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:22,370
light gray that look nice believe it or

00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,050
not but people are still printing stuff

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,480
out and people are even printing

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:30,050
websites people are printing contact

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,720
information directions recipes articles

00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:34,820
pretty much everything and we should try

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,260
to give them at least some kind of

00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,870
experience in that that's actually

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,360
pretty easy all you have to do is to

00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:44,360
define a at media block in your CSS

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,160
similar to media queries and then change

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,380
all the items you want to look

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,420
differently on paper for example if you

00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:53,930
have a fixed header you can set it to

00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:56,089
static on paper or you can also maybe

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:59,800
hide the navigation because it's

00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:59,800
probably pretty useless on paper

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:06,130
who would fall another thing you can do

00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:08,770
maybe is to by default hide everything

00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:10,870
or air it direct child item of the body

00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:14,200
except for the main content so hiding

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,940
the header and the footer and one thing

00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,010
that's pretty cool about the print

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:20,020
medium is that we can use absolute units

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,390
like centimeter or millimeter and point

00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,160
just makes sense you shouldn't use that

00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:27,040
on a web but on paper it makes

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,230
absolutely sense something that special

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,290
about print is that links are

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:35,589
unfortunately useless you can click them

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:38,650
you can try but you yeah it wouldn't

00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:40,660
work but there is a thing we can do to

00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:45,220
make them at least to put at least some

00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:48,070
use in links on paper and that's it's

00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:51,010
this selector here we can select all

00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:53,050
links that start with HTTP this includes

00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:55,690
HTTP as well but it doesn't include

00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,370
relative paths or anchor links and then

00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:00,400
we make sure that we don't includes

00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:02,230
absolute links to our site and then we

00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,199
use the after pseudo elements to adds

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:08,230
the content of the href attribute in

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,660
parentheses right next to the text so

00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:13,089
this paragraph here will look like this

00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:15,160
on screen and on paper it will look like

00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:18,880
this so the value of the href attribute

00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,870
is printed next to the word it's not

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,870
perfect but it's something

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,809
if you are like me you like to use the

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,370
keyboard sometimes for navigation on the

00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:32,070
website for example if you're filling

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:34,470
out a long form because it's easier to

00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:36,770
jump from one form iron to another if

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,299
you use the keyboard the tab key

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:41,340
sometimes that works great and sometimes

00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,529
that doesn't work at all because we as

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:47,460
developers are pretty good at doing bad

00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:50,250
things to form items we are let me show

00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,820
you some of those things here we have

00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:56,789
two buttons when I click the first

00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:59,760
button and alert pops up great if I

00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:01,470
click this second button the alert pops

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,570
up as well and now I'm going to use the

00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,149
tab key to focus those buttons I can

00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:08,940
focus the first one but I can't focus

00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:10,529
the second one the reason for that is

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,110
that the first button is an html5

00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:15,750
pattern element the second button is a

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:19,080
DIF that looks like a button and divs

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,970
aren't focusable of course you can add

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,880
the tabindex attribute and make it 4

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:25,529
focusable but if you are already using

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,029
the keyboard you would probably want to

00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:28,919
do everything with the keyboard also

00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:31,140
triggering this event by clicking space

00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,850
or enter and you can only do that on the

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,860
button because we get those key events

00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,700
for free with the button element that

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:40,740
just does just doesn't work on it if of

00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,390
course you can add those events manually

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,830
but why would you if you just could use

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:50,549
button so please use button if you need

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:52,590
about another bad thing is here with a

00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:54,299
nice looking form and now you are going

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,799
to see which keys I'm pressing right

00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:57,799
next to the form

00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:06,560
[Music]

00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:09,660
did you see that no you didn't because

00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,910
that's in my CSS I'm selecting all items

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,460
in this page in their focus state and

00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:17,130
I'm setting the outline to none but just

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,840
using those free lines I'm excluding a

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,430
whole group of people from being able to

00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,160
use my sites

00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:26,250
if I remove those free lines you will

00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,170
see this now all of a sudden we can see

00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:33,270
where we are in the forum because we get

00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:34,920
this nice blurry blue line outline now

00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,810
the reason why designers and developers

00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,420
remove this blue outline in the first

00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:42,300
place is it's just actually just doesn't

00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:44,640
look nice and on top of that it's very

00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,020
inconsistent across browsers so for

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,090
example here on Chrome we will get this

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,770
blue outline on Firefox you will get a

00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,620
dotted outline and on Android for

00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,870
example a solid orange outline so it

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,880
kind of makes sense to remove it but if

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,290
you do provide at least some kind of

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,690
alternative styling you can use your

00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:01,860
branch colors and use solid borders

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,220
background color

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:07,710
link text color whatever it is just some

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,260
kind of focus stars and again you can do

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,810
it by using the focus of the class or

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:16,410
you can use some of the newer stuff for

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:18,900
example here this form only this place

00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:22,320
the border if one of its children has

00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:24,060
focus so it's not the form itself that

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,850
it's focused but one of its child items

00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,910
and that's possible using the focus

00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:32,840
within pseudo class it's pretty new

00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,840
support is okay

00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,250
but you can use it now if you're not

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,520
using it for anything too critical I

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:45,560
guess one thing that's annoying about

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,570
focus tiles is that sometimes they are

00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,040
displayed when you don't want them to be

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:50,720
displayed for example if you're using

00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,940
the mouse so here for example we have a

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,790
custom tab component and you can see the

00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:58,850
outline when I'm using the keyboard but

00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:00,890
now I'm going to click the tabs or the

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,780
panels and it's still visible and this

00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,580
is not just annoying but also can be

00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,990
very distracting to Mouse users so what

00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,940
we need is a way to differentiate

00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,130
between keyboard and mouse users and

00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:12,530
that's possible using the focus ring

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,600
pseudo-class focus ring pretty much does

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,970
the same thing as focus but it only

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,130
applies those those Styles when it makes

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,990
sense and the browser decides when it

00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:25,730
makes sense so we don't have to do much

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:30,770
more unfortunately it only works in

00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:32,300
Firefox right now but but there is a

00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,790
very lightweight polyfill that you can

00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,140
use check it out try it and maybe also

00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:39,050
give feedback to the people who made it

00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,590
so who are we making this for who are we

00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,570
making

00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,950
focused odds for of course for us the

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,840
power users who would like to use the

00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:47,300
keyboard on long forms but especially

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,610
for people who actually rely on the

00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:51,500
keyboard is the only way of navigation

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,690
for example a person with just one arm

00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,340
or maybe someone who would actually use

00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,310
the mouse but can't because he or she

00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,020
broke their arm or maybe also a new

00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:02,930
parent who's holding the baby and has to

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,250
check something out online so it's

00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,500
important for us to know that there are

00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,660
permanent temporary and situational

00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,010
impairments and this makes the group of

00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,660
potential keyboard users for example

00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,060
much much bigger

00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,560
I took the graphics of the inclusive

00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:19,700
design guide by Microsoft it's pretty

00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:22,040
cool check it out all right it's now I'm

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:26,960
going to talk about some of the newer

00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:28,670
stuff here about grids we have a list of

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,980
images here and I want to lay them out

00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:33,290
in a nice-looking grid that's pretty

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,780
easy with CSS grid layouts I just said

00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:38,420
that this beta grid I define as many

00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:41,800
columns as fit the screen with a minimum

00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:44,720
width of 180 pixels I add some spacing

00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:47,270
vertical and horizontal spacing and I

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,960
said a default height for all rows in

00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:52,960
these grids so four lines of CSS

00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:56,380
and we get this pretty awesome and it's

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,039
of course also completely responsive so

00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,480
that's nice by the way the images are

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,090
scaled so nicely because I'm using

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,820
object fits Sara mentioned that in her

00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:08,559
talk the only thing that's not right

00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,840
here is that we lost the different image

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,640
sizes we had big and long images we can

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,380
fix that I'm going to select all the

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,690
long and the large images and I'm going

00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:18,490
to make them spend two rows and then I'm

00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,740
selecting the large images and make them

00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:22,210
span two columns and I'm going to place

00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:24,010
the first one at the very end of our

00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,720
grids and the last one at the very

00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:29,529
beginning to make it look a little nicer

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:31,870
and this is what we get due to the

00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:33,580
implicit implicit placement at it and

00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:36,880
the different image sizes we get those

00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,440
gaps we can try to work around that

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,049
there is a property called grid Auto

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:43,720
flow and if you set value to dense the

00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:48,640
browser will try to fill those gaps and

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:51,539
this is what we get six lines of CSS and

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,870
of course also completely responsive

00:23:51,539 --> 00:24:01,480
this is super super super awesome and it

00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:03,669
sucks let's see what happens if you try

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,549
to use the keyboard on this gallery so

00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:07,570
the first image is focused now and I'm

00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:10,620
pressing tab okay

00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:13,929
oh where we going okay that's all right

00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:16,990
which one is okay this one mm-hmm so

00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:20,679
since the browser reordered the items

00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:22,270
the visual order isn't anymore the same

00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,520
order as Dom order and that's bad for

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,809
keyboard users because there's no way of

00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,690
knowing which item is going to be

00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:30,909
focused next don't get me wrong

00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:32,890
please use grid and use everything grid

00:24:30,909 --> 00:24:35,230
has to offer it's really really awesome

00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,880
but just be careful when you're using it

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,980
on very interactive interaction

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,980
sensitive stuff like forms prop no don't

00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:44,980
use no forms but on galleries or stuff

00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,779
like that this of course doesn't just

00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,730
apply to grid but to pretty much any

00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:51,850
property that affects order in some way

00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:56,980
like flexbox position floats negative

00:24:51,850 --> 00:25:00,520
margins and so on all right okay since

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:03,690
we are at a topic of grid who of you has

00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:06,160
already used grids

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:12,190
okay some people who used it in

00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:14,740
production okay you're cool you cool do

00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:16,240
it it's awesome all major Brown major

00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,810
browsers that ester browsers are

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:25,000
supported even edge since a week yeah or

00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:28,510
a few days so all major tester browsers

00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,180
are supported of course they're still IE

00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:32,800
10 and 11 and older edge but you can

00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,260
still use it thanks to the power of

00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,120
progressive enhancement you can provide

00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,280
a very basic version of your site for

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,200
example using floats and then enhance it

00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:45,280
with grids let me show you a demo to

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,020
illustrate what I mean by that here we

00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,330
have a very simple single column layout

00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,860
it doesn't look nice because it's on a

00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,270
large screen but that's pretty much what

00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:57,310
would you what you would get on a

00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:59,230
smartphone that's not very nice but it's

00:25:57,310 --> 00:26:03,360
alright I can enhance that by using

00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:07,600
float and now we have a layout it's

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:11,020
boring but it works we can enhance it

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,760
some more using flexbox and now

00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,290
especially the lower part gets a little

00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,780
more interesting so that's pretty cool

00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:21,000
and then we can enhance it some more and

00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:23,260
to whatever we want because grids and

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,120
what's cool about that is that we don't

00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,640
have to write 3 or 4 different versions

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,340
of a site we just provide this basic

00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,830
layout using floats and then we put grid

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,420
on top of that because properties like

00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:37,360
display:inline-block display tab will

00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:39,490
sell column properties floats don't work

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,310
on flags or grid items they just don't

00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:44,410
have any effect so you don't have to

00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:48,040
override them for browsers that support

00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:50,530
grids they just simply don't do anything

00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,140
anymore if the if they're applied to a

00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:56,770
grid or flex item the only time where

00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:59,680
you have probably have to use feature

00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:02,380
queries is when you override widths or

00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,950
margin something like that so that's

00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:10,960
pretty cool and grid is cool but it also

00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:12,580
introduces a new temptation let me show

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,750
you what I mean let's say we want to

00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,870
build something like that we have a

00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:19,559
heading and six items here

00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:21,780
and the HTML may look like this so we

00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:24,600
have a div and a heading an unordered

00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:26,430
list and those six items I'm going to

00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,740
use this big grid here again I'm going

00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:31,290
to create those free columns I'm setting

00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,420
a gap again and I'm placing the heading

00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:35,970
and this is what we get

00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,830
of course because only direct child

00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,870
items of a grid container are laid out

00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:42,630
in a grid and the direct child items are

00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,700
the h2 and unordered list the worst

00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,800
thing you can do is to remove the

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,720
unordered list and transform all the

00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,390
divs to lists I add all the list items

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,850
divs you should not compromise on

00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:58,620
semantics for design or deaf experience

00:27:53,850 --> 00:28:00,780
reasons don't do that please please what

00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:01,290
you could do is to good use display sub

00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,330
grids

00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:05,300
if you apply to an unordered list the

00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:08,160
list items will behave as if they were

00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:12,000
direct child items of the div themselves

00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:13,050
unfortunately display subgrid didn't

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,240
make it into level one of the

00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:18,450
specification but it will probably come

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,179
with level two I don't know when but we

00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,580
hope another thing you could do is to

00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:26,940
set the display to contents the contents

00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,710
will make the lists list items behave as

00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,410
if their parent the unordered list

00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:33,450
didn't exist at all so they would behave

00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:38,850
as if they were direct child items of

00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:40,559
the grid container yeah no Firefox again

00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:43,230
is the only browser that supports that

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,540
so what you ultimately have to do is to

00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:48,360
define another grid in this unordered

00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:50,490
list so again these blue grids three

00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:54,150
columns and gap I know that's not cool

00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:55,830
but it's it's something since the

00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:58,350
unordered list has the same width as the

00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:00,030
container you can make it span all three

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:01,770
columns and just inherit all the

00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,780
properties so you can inherit all the

00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:09,030
disparate properties it's a little nicer

00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:11,330
yeah whatever it is you do don't flatten

00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:14,640
the structure don't do that

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:17,370
of course that's not everything you have

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,900
to know about CSS and accessibility but

00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,059
it's also more than just a starting

00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:23,309
point let's say you take two of the

00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:24,630
things I showed you today and care about

00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:27,179
them in your next project you are

00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:28,970
already doing a really great job and if

00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,320
you take two more things and apply the

00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:33,140
in your next project you are working

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,049
towards a better more inclusive and more

00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:38,059
open web it's important that we as

00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:40,640
designers and developers don't just

00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:44,860
design and make websites for the way we

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,870
are using it we must not assume that our

00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:50,840
users are using a certain operating

00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:55,789
system input device browser or device

00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:57,890
and as my mentor Aaron Gusterson said

00:29:55,789 --> 00:30:01,250
designing with constraints in mind is

00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:04,370
simply designing well I know mother was

00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:06,679
a lot but there is a written form of

00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:09,530
this article online on medium that of

00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:11,539
this talk online on medium and I can

00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:13,070
recommend a very awesome book by Hayden

00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:15,020
Pickering it's called inclusive design

00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:17,559
patterns I even have it with me so if

00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:20,929
you want to take a look feel free to

00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:24,240
meet me afterwards again the slides are

00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:30,420
online thank you very much

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,420
