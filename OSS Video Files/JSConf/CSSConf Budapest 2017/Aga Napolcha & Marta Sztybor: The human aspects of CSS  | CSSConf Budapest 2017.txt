Title: Aga Napolcha & Marta Sztybor: The human aspects of CSS  | CSSConf Budapest 2017
Publication date: 2018-02-16
Playlist: CSSConf Budapest 2017
Description: 
	Paraphrasing the Michael Jackson’s song - do you remember the time when you fell in love ...with CSS? Or the your success after a tough battle with the CSS code? Are you still as excited every time you code? Have you ever tried explaining to a laic how CSS works?

These are the questions which often aren’t raised, but we’re here to take you on a sentimental journey! As founders and mentors of non-profit CSS workshops for beginners, we want to share our own experiences. After many hours spent on teaching a very diverse group, we discovered new aspects of our work and started to perceive CSS differently. The exciting fact is that CSS has proven to be a great tool for gathering designers and developers around one table, seriously!

We would like to share our findings with you by giving examples and tips how you can maintain this kind of fresh energy and open mind. With our own example, we will show how openness is important for newcomers, especially from the experts. Inspiration guaranteed & true stories included!

do you remember the time when you fell

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:16,529
in love well see ya do you remember the

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,359
first feature you were so excited about

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,060
well like Marquette which was very

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,949
popular some time ago and if you don't

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,250
remember it on websites probably you're

00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,890
very young and do you remember the web

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,460
design trends despite you back in the

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,110
days

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:36,600
yeah so it's it's very tough to get back

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,790
to those feelings and those days and if

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,850
you're a long-term marriage with

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:46,020
front-end development is in crisis and

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:48,600
if your love for CSS has burned out it's

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,930
time to do something about it and we're

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,600
the awesomes I'm Agra India as a short

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,059
intro I'm a designer and coder and doing

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,260
a front-end developer and we will find

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,570
that the awesomes which is an

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,510
organization which teaches people how to

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:07,350
create awesome things on the web and

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,150
also we do it all not-for-profit and as

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,740
a side project after work

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,500
yeah just like Kevin said we were based

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,750
in in Poland and Warsaw and if you have

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,060
any comments or questions we'd be more

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,920
than happy to read all of them for

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,430
instance in our Twitter you can see our

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,430
Twitter handle so we have to make a

00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,540
small disclaimer right now you might be

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,820
disappointed but there will be no code

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,000
and no life coding sessions

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,490
unfortunately yeah we won't get into any

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,909
technical details we won't show you any

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:46,590
brand-new CSS framework or coding

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:48,630
techniques and no fleshie CSS effects

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,729
but rather than that we will tell you

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:54,869
true stories about people that we have

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,340
met during the last two years so there

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,040
is the time in your career when you

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,020
realize that coding is cool but you need

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,689
two more interact with people a

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,579
different ground than your daily job so

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,350
this is what happened for us some time

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,670
ago and we were lucky because it's

00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,679
happened at the same

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,290
so we can see right now is our chat on

00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,540
Twitter and we are trying to set arrange

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,160
a meeting and do something together for

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,120
the community so this was the idea let's

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:24,720
do something and as you said it all

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,690
started two years ago in December 2015

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,970
yes and the idea was rather humble we

00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,989
didn't have any fixed plan and

00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,700
everything went very spontaneously so we

00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:38,010
were really overwhelmed with what

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,720
happened that this one meeting tour

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:44,730
meeting actually initiated something

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:49,890
very big and it engaged more than 3,000

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:53,190
applicants and 64 awesome participants

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,890
who were learning the basic of HTML and

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,019
CSS and among them were people from

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,810
various professions like philosophers

00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:04,650
architects designers photographers etc

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:07,170
etc yes it's good to mention that seven

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,049
people and out of them actually became

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,420
junior front-end developers and it's

00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:14,700
worth adding that we weren't aiming at

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,380
like encouraging people to change their

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,269
profession what we wanted to do is to

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,069
show that coding can be cool no matter

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:20,790
what you do daily it can be a very

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,239
useful tool

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:28,109
so we extremely proud of them and also

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,840
it included 80 hours of coding 11

00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:33,410
mentors who held this and numerous hours

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,120
of preparations preparing materials

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,549
searching for the venue and planning all

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,810
the smallest details and you might be

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:41,849
wondering right now why are we talking

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,250
about it while you showing these numbers

00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,859
because you're on a CSS conference you

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,810
would like to see some code but probably

00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:51,419
we bad that probably some of you have

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,280
ever thought that it would be good to do

00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:55,109
something for the community do a slight

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,760
project do something what you love that

00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:59,250
you can't do at work because you're

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,900
doing other things so we hope that

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,079
you'll feel inspired and if you already

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,870
run your community or around type of

00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,669
site project or team activity we'll have

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,280
some useful tips and tricks and

00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:14,970
practicalities which you can apply to

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,010
make your community even bigger so it

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,450
all started and at the very beginning we

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:19,400
did

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:22,190
and he fixed plaid we just felt that

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,280
there is the lack of such initiatives

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:26,180
connected with HTML and CSS in our

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,540
neighborhoods

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,190
so we decided to do something about it

00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,340
and it starts yes and we were observing

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:36,800
different initiatives connected with

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:39,790
front-end development coding Ruby on

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,860
Rails and we saw that they organized

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,870
very long workshops during weekends and

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,830
we decided to do something different we

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:52,010
decided to divide our whole course into

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,260
smaller and regular meetings so we were

00:04:52,010 --> 00:05:00,290
meeting in the afternoon after I will

00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:03,350
regular job and we care about good

00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:05,960
design so we prepared our own layouts

00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:11,540
for our participants and the three

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:14,450
examples are we used on a workshops and

00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:18,260
our participants were voting which one

00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:21,470
they prefer to call by themselves so

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:25,150
yeah it helps to engage people if you

00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:28,310
give them that's it the decision to make

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,050
as you probably know that to Harless

00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,420
things in the web development is cache

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,060
invalidation and naming things so we

00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,520
also have our problem to come up with

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,100
some some catchy name for our

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,100
initiatives and as you can see most of

00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,040
them are rather cheesy yeah my firm is

00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:49,160
one is fantastic but yeah in the end we

00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,920
decided to pick worth awesome because

00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,960
it's awesome and it's connected with

00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:58,400
World Wide Web because it has w3 W's and

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,910
because we want we wanted to feel like a

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,840
big awesome family we finally picked the

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:08,690
awesomes and our tagline is awesome

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:12,770
people just like us who do awesome

00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:14,780
things on the web and also there are

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:18,140
lots of communities that encourages

00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:20,150
women and join the detect community and

00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,940
we decided that

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,060
rather be open for everyone for people

00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:31,720
from different walks of life different

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:35,150
experiences different professions yes

00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,180
and we really wanted to bring new people

00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:41,810
into our industry so we really wanted to

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,820
encourage beginners and what is a one of

00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,770
our goal was to break the nerd

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,660
stereotype we really wanted to show that

00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,220
we were like cheerful people and of

00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,620
course we love spending time in front

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:56,479
come in front of computer screen but

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:58,820
this is not the only hobby we have it

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,160
all started and we set up our own

00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:04,220
webpage and also wanted to look

00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,979
professional so it's required to have on

00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,650
Facebook fan page and we created an

00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:13,160
event and was waiting if anyone would be

00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:17,000
interested in learning coding and HTML

00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:19,820
and CSS basics but rather we been

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,360
overwhelmed about how many applications

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:27,620
we received and we imagine there were

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:29,510
more than 1000 and 800 of them yes it

00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,820
was a really big number and we had to

00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:36,349
read all of them and we had to select 20

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,729
final participants it was extremely

00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:40,729
tough because people were very

00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:44,330
hard-working ambitious talented but that

00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:46,969
decision was made and it consisted of

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:51,439
eight classes divided

00:07:46,969 --> 00:07:54,039
two hours yeah this is our program yeah

00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:57,729
we try to divide our program into like

00:07:54,039 --> 00:08:00,049
edible chunks not to make our

00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:02,360
participants feel overwhelmed by the

00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:04,909
program so we started with the very

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,979
beginnings as you can see and started to

00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:10,189
getting more advanced things and people

00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:12,049
really love building layouts and first

00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:14,929
we taught them how to use floats and

00:08:12,049 --> 00:08:18,709
later showed how the grid works to show

00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:21,499
that the total different approach and we

00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:24,049
also engage friends from our industry as

00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:26,539
mentors and they were really grateful

00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:28,879
for them and they really helped us with

00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:32,659
mentoring and tracking progress of our

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:36,439
participants and even if you're an

00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:38,689
expert in the industry you can see that

00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:42,469
teaching others is a really tough nut to

00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:46,009
crack and we have some lesson learned

00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:48,290
for example we unintentionally started

00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:51,019
to use technical jargon and for example

00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:54,290
for people from outsider tech bubbles

00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:56,329
slack is just a mysterious words yes and

00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,759
many people were asking so how they

00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:00,800
should actually approach learning HTML

00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,589
CSS shouldn't be approached just like

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,779
foreign languages or maybe should they

00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:07,850
learn all HTML tags by heart

00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,769
so at the time we realize it's so easy

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,540
to forget about your own beginnings when

00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:14,689
you were struggling with your first line

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,879
of code so we're more aware what types

00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:19,250
of words we should use what our teaching

00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:22,040
methods we should introduce to our

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:25,459
course to make the pruning process much

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,769
more easier in these it doesn't matter

00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:30,110
how much time do you spend polishing

00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:32,029
your slides and giving the lecture the

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:34,759
most important part of the teaching

00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:38,589
process is the hands-on experience and

00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:42,529
what you can see is the layout coded

00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:45,630
totally from scratch by by one of our

00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:47,670
participants from the first edition Anya

00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:50,220
and we believe that this experience cell

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,800
learning from practical examples is more

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,420
important than some example taken

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:59,640
completely out of context

00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:01,380
and sorry w3schools yes we also paid a

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:06,720
little attention that people could

00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:09,240
practice at home so we prepared a

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,880
tutorial which is available for free for

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,690
everyone unfortunately it's in Polish so

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,730
if you'd like to contribute right now

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:20,580
feel free to to come to us we'd be more

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:23,060
than happy to have something someone who

00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,310
can help us to translate it to English

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:28,800
there are some spooky creatures in CSS

00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:31,410
and everyone is afraid of and for our

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,590
participants surprise surprise it

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:37,620
appeared to be positioning specificity

00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:40,110
yes and specificity sometimes it's even

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,570
hard for us for seasoned developers so

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,430
there wasn't surprised that that

00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,050
participants have some problems at the

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:50,340
very beginning to grasp the general

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:53,100
concept how it works and we believe that

00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,200
asking questions is a crucial part of

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,720
the learning process so there are no

00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,180
stupid questions and we wanted to our

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,880
participants to feel as comfortable as

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,350
it's possible and when we were seeing

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,840
that there are some of them is

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:09,300
struggling along with some hard code

00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,450
problem we try to approach them we are

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:15,480
our mentors to help them and we also

00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:18,210
tried to create a friendly family like

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,420
atmosphere so we divided them into

00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:24,060
smaller sub groups yes and of course we

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,190
have a problem with naming them again we

00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:28,170
needed five groups so the first idea was

00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,900
oh maybe we could use the the Brett

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:32,820
web-browser names but who would like to

00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,730
join the internet explorer group well

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,760
probably not so many people so we did it

00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:41,610
we decided to change the concept and we

00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:45,240
pick the pantent score names for for the

00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:47,190
year it was 2016 and it gave the

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,900
artistic vibe to our workshops and

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,060
people were really that identifying

00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,940
themselves with the colors so girls were

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:55,110
in rose quartz and they were very happy

00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,190
there was David who can see in the

00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,530
middle he was in

00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,650
serenity group so it was a lot of fun

00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:05,200
and there's some friendship started

00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:09,580
among her participants so it was really

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,900
worth it to try to act like like big

00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,850
family and there were some

00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,010
collaborations between people from

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,080
different professions so it became

00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,060
really interesting to see them all also

00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,640
after the workshops I guess that even

00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:24,750
some ideas for startups were initiated

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:27,550
so we're like a stirrup hop as well and

00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:30,010
people love competition so this is why

00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,200
we wanted to incorporate the l-man into

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:35,020
our work ships as well and after each of

00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,820
the classes we prepare a quiz on the

00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,260
Kahoot platform if you don't know it you

00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,950
should check it out because it's awesome

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:44,290
and there were it's very beneficial

00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:47,110
because of two reasons the first one is

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:49,630
that people were revising the moderator

00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,310
material so they were getting more and

00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,380
more experience and the second one is

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,120
just more engaging fun and we can you

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:58,090
can see right now on the video if you

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,400
can see this if not I'm so sorry but it

00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,410
is the is our Meetup and we're so where

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,790
people were playing the the quiz and it

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:10,030
was so exciting as you can see and our

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:12,040
success was to bring more designers

00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:15,490
throughout the end well our focus on

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:18,850
aesthetics really paid off and the code

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:21,550
appears to be really good so new tool

00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:23,290
it's used for designers and help them

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:26,350
communicate more efficiently with

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,470
developers yes and designers started to

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,700
like us which was very nice feeling and

00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:33,640
thanks to that we were reviving too many

00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:35,470
events for designers mainly so this is

00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,610
the workshops we gave during element

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,380
talks this is one of the biggest

00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:43,570
conferences in Poland for designers

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:44,980
gathering more than 1500 designers we

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,140
were on different conference talking

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,570
about collaboration between developers

00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:52,900
and designers we did another workshops

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:55,480
for artists and we're mentioning this

00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,310
not to boast off but to give you the

00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,790
sense that sometimes it's really good to

00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:04,390
step out of your comfort zone and and

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:06,820
check other explore order filled other

00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,240
areas other environments and it's

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,490
extremely inspiring

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,200
and it has definitely affected the way

00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:16,910
we work and the way we communicate with

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:20,180
people and was also an important part

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:23,330
first was to because the devil is in the

00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:26,029
details we also create our branding and

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:28,550
it was really attractive to people they

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:30,020
were hunting for our gadgets on our

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:33,290
events and our meetups

00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:38,830
it was really cool and we managed to

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:42,649
produce for example yeah flashy pins and

00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:45,410
they fake tattoos it was really a good

00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:49,130
integration game when people were like

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:52,339
yeah some people have had attack on

00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:54,200
their neck collar for speakers and we

00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:56,270
have them with us so if you are not shy

00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,080
please come after after a lunch break

00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:02,120
yeah welcome

00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:05,720
and also the also sucks and now so watch

00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:08,600
out because we do have one pair of them

00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:12,649
with yes and you can film happy owners

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:19,089
just like you know Kravitz so Martha

00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:22,730
good luck you don't think to be excited

00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:25,370
yeah yeah sorry you can you can give it

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:29,750
to your friend which is a girl out there

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:33,200
or unfortunately it's female sighs so

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:38,450
yeah we were running out of bigger

00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:41,839
silence yeah and now we like to focus on

00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:46,010
an important topic which became kind of

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:52,190
a buzzword in our industry and actually

00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:55,579
we believe that actions have more effect

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:58,190
that works and in fact we haven't

00:15:55,579 --> 00:16:01,940
mentioned the diversity words explicitly

00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:05,270
not any ones we were promoting our

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:10,130
events people and what's interesting

00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:12,020
about 75% of our community are women yes

00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,089
and we of course observing what's

00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,870
happening in the industry what's

00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:19,560
happening on Twitter they're here

00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:21,570
but if you're just open if you respect

00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,820
other people if you're kind diverse

00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,350
community should emerge itself so it

00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,390
shouldn't be something that you push

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,960
yourself very hard it should be natural

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:34,590
in our opinion and it happened for us

00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:36,570
I'm the coolest thing that happens when

00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:39,480
we were running the auctions that apart

00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:43,200
from jazzy workshops we create created

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:46,740
something bigger which is a community

00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:49,890
and it was really awesome to see that

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:54,120
from an inconspicuous idea it turned out

00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:55,500
something really huge yes that you need

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,340
to be aware that if you do something

00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,620
publicly that your initiative will be

00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:04,200
exposed for a critic and so friendly

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,300
comments so you have to deal with it

00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:09,060
because otherwise your enthusiast might

00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:11,580
be dumping and your it might cut your

00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:16,080
wings so some comments were like a

00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:18,870
broken record CSS is not the programming

00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:22,500
flag now yeah it doesn't really matter

00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:26,580
if this and some people were talking

00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:29,460
about 16 hours for learning just such

00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:32,790
easy things like HTML and CSS is

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,410
insanely long yeah but what is funny on

00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:37,170
the opposite there were some people who

00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:39,870
saw that well yeah like when you meet

00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:42,090
like eight times for two hours is 16

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,790
hours it's insanely short to write a

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:48,510
good-quality website so there was some

00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:50,910
opposite opinions and also the women in

00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:56,430
tech sync appeared and some people saw

00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:58,320
that our initiative is created mostly

00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,420
for women because we are pink and

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,910
cheerful social media but in fact it

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:06,330
wasn't true because we were open for

00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:08,520
everyone yes and you can imagine that

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:10,200
after all these comments after a whole

00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:13,110
year when we were organizing workshops

00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,200
meetups after I work as an additional

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,000
project we're extremely exhausting but

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,400
there is actually one thing that can

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,950
cheer you up and it's the greatest

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,660
reward for all your efforts and these

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,810
are sexist stories from our participants

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:31,480
yes mentioned some of them now we're

00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:34,180
probably probably wearing a batch of

00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,910
junior web developers some of them are

00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:40,060
successful designers communicating with

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:43,480
developers some of them creating created

00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:46,050
really awesome site projects and now you

00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:49,560
can hear them speaking by themselves

00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:57,630
this is the audio time praying right now

00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:57,630
it doesn't work can we try again

00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:06,030
No

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:15,560
yes boiler yeah we know Dennis who had

00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,710
the audio problem as well

00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:24,890
is there is there a chance or should we

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:31,850
skip it um once again sorry it works

00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:34,790
before yeah it worked now you can see on

00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:39,590
your face yeah she called it plenty

00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:41,840
there the website she's a designer yeah

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,000
she actually graduates from architecture

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,120
yeah

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,640
okay let's try so she as a designer also

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,640
now codes are designed by herself

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:58,460
no it's it should be okay

00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:03,380
oops sorry

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:05,630
yeah pictures yeah so should we try to

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:11,240
paraphrase what's happening in the video

00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:13,660
or are still having the chance to make

00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,660
this work

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,900
it worked before so maybe

00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:43,110
okay let's try again oh why we're

00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,820
editing till late night yesterday it's

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,820
worth to do it please

00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,610
okay

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:03,640
okay okay so let's give it so we can

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:06,190
tell it no so girls were talking what

00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,730
they love in CSS and what they hate and

00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:11,680
for instance a DA she said that she

00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:15,660
loves when you can create spectacular

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:18,160
things not knowing a lot about CSS but

00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,750
and here's the moment yeah she's talking

00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,800
about it

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:25,990
spectacular websites the CSS but oh no

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,090
this is not the moment whatever yeah

00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:29,950
that the spectacular thing is gonna be

00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,420
at least spectacular for you because the

00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,990
web sites can be very ugly sometimes

00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:37,870
especially when you started how to code

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:40,270
Alena hate naming things in CSS but

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,800
instead she thinks that it's a very

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:45,580
useful tool for communicating with

00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:48,340
developers because she is a designer we

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:50,680
have Magda and she said that she loves

00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:54,520
flexbox but at the same time she hates

00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:56,800
that it doesn't work every word and yeah

00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,200
Anya said that she she she's very

00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,060
worried sometimes that CSS doesn't work

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,900
with her and she doesn't know why

00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:06,970
so yeah and ferger's mostly coding it's

00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:11,560
a really great new experience something

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:15,010
that opened their eyes and show a new a

00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:19,000
new way in their profession so it was

00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:23,350
very valuable for them to learn how to

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,500
code so yeah as you seen the failures

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,690
cut and also failures happen among our

00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:32,080
participants it happened some unrequited

00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:34,660
love towards CSS life is not as rosy as

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:39,340
it's painted not luxorious

00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:41,470
our badges and fortune in socks yes so

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,330
some people abandoned coding and

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,790
abandoned every classes and it was a

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:48,310
very hard feeling for us because it we

00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:51,040
took it very personal but you know you

00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,780
need to somehow accept the fact and come

00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,420
to terms with that some people are not

00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:58,060
just so keen on coding just like we are

00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:03,580
and maybe they didn't have time or just

00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:05,809
didn't enjoy coding at all yeah so we

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,210
love meeting Queens

00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:13,820
pants with people from our community not

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:17,590
in front of computers and not have just

00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:20,359
in their chats about technology but also

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:23,119
yeah we have great fun during our

00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:25,369
meetups it's it's so called reunions

00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,749
when we invite people from former

00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:30,320
editions of the workshops and our

00:23:26,749 --> 00:23:35,529
friends and we just enjoy talking

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:39,019
together and to also love animals and

00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:42,109
they are also invited to our workshops

00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:45,349
and Freddy started learning flex books

00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:48,080
with us but we don't know if he's

00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:50,389
already grasped the idea I guess he

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,979
abandoned this in the favor for yes is

00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:56,599
great because he saw that these are like

00:23:51,979 --> 00:24:01,909
contradictory ideas yeah

00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:05,269
yeah yes so we're here at CSS confer the

00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:08,119
past and CSS con invents in general are

00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:10,399
very open and lots of people come from

00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:12,739
different parts of the world so we speak

00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:14,989
different languages we different food

00:24:12,739 --> 00:24:17,089
during our lunch time we have different

00:24:14,989 --> 00:24:20,179
hobbies but there is one thing that we

00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:23,839
have in common and this is the love for

00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:25,820
CSS and we're like a big CSS family and

00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,799
we're very grateful that we had an

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:31,129
opportunity to share our story with you
