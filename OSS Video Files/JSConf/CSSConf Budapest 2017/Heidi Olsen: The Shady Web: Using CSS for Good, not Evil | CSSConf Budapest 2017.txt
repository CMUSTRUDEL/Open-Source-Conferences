Title: Heidi Olsen: The Shady Web: Using CSS for Good, not Evil | CSSConf Budapest 2017
Publication date: 2018-02-16
Playlist: CSSConf Budapest 2017
Description: 
	Navigating the web has turned into a treacherous exercise. Between sidebars, popups, scroll overs, and pre-checked boxes, you have to avoid the content you donâ€™t want to unearth the content you do want. As these practices in distraction and diversion become the norm, marketers are pressured to follow suit.

Together we will look at the difference between influencing genuine user behavior and tricking people through the use of CSS patterns and interactions. Learn how you can add motion into your digital properties in a way that improves usability while staying true to your brand's goals.

00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:08,099
[Music]

00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:10,290
so funny story yesterday I was walking

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,860
down the streets of Budapest admiring

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,839
the architecture and I wasn't paying

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,109
social the cobblestones and I fell and

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,400
actually broke my arm no but it's okay

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,470
because this is good because I think

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,390
people tell you when you're about to get

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,220
on stage like break a leg and I broke my

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,210
arm and I feel like this is gonna mean

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:30,179
that this is gonna be the most amazing

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,949
talk ever but I'm not here to talk about

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,809
how clumsy I am even though that'll be

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,329
pretty funny I'm here to talk about the

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:41,510
shady web and how we can use our CSS

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:45,239
powers for good and not evil one second

00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:47,390
all right so what we're gonna first talk

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,710
about how frustrating the web is today

00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,420
and then we're gonna talk about how we

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,280
can be intentional about our strategies

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,890
that we use to make our web more

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,629
functional and then lastly some steps to

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,239
bring that back home and actually get

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,820
your web more animated so first a little

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,430
bit about me my name is Heidi I'm an

00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:08,670
American from Portland Oregon and a

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,830
senior a full-service agency called ear

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,450
I at Erie where we got the clients like

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,860
Nike and Taco Bell and some other

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,950
American ones they probably don't know

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,080
about and my twitter handle is here as

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,369
well my code pens so if you want to

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,909
follow me and ask me questions there

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,799
please feel free but like you said I've

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,530
been a developer about nine or ten years

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,530
and when I first got into development I

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,380
was so excited to learn everything first

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,299
I learned HTML and CSS and then I saw

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,430
that other websites had these cool

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,229
slideshows at these jQuery and so I was

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,700
like yeah I want to learn jQuery but

00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,500
then I realized that I didn't understand

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,899
how jQuery worked at all so I learned

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,720
JavaScript and then I wanted to use data

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,479
in my site so I learned PHP and all this

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,100
was fine and good but a couple years in

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:55,680
I kind of realized that I didn't really

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,329
like anything I was making it was you

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,729
know they looked nice

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,380
they were functional but something was

00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,880
missing and I realized that all the

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,770
other developers that I was following

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,740
we're doing some really cool concept in

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,929
some really cool executions and I was

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,180
like man what am I missing and I realize

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,250
that I've been focused so much on how to

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,230
do the thing

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,660
so they don't really think about why I

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,820
was actually doing it and I think this

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,560
contributes a lot to why the web is so

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:24,430
frustrating and I think that we're all

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,500
kind of guilty that this a little bit

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,480
for example this fell we happen to you a

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,430
lot you read a blog you're like halfway

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,709
through agreeing to the good meat of it

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,750
no some of those video pops up and it

00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:37,520
starts playing music now imagine you're

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,470
at work and your headphones are not in

00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,240
and all sudden your whole work knows

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,240
that you're procrastinating not working

00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,860
super frustrating my probably Lee's

00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,290
favorite experience is if you're on a

00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,330
mobile device right so you start you

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,190
know struggling through the blog and

00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,989
then Olsen this ad comes up and you have

00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,700
to scroll carefully to get to the top

00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:57,200
and if you accidentally tap a going to

00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,480
another site and then you know you're

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,700
not gonna come back and this is so

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,500
frustrating and the problem is is that

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,330
people like us are making those

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,640
experiences we're the ones who are

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,970
guilty and you know developers get

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,190
really mad about that and I think I just

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,020
want to give developers the benefit

00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,390
adult-like maybe they're not evil people

00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,790
like maybe they just don't intend to

00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,799
make these experiences so awful and I

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,840
think there's two things that happen I

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,970
think the first is that we abuse new

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,220
technologies until more sophisticated

00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:30,350
way of doing things emerges right we

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,640
like the shiny brand-new things and I'm

00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,890
definitely guilty of this

00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,200
when CSS animations we're starting to

00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,570
get supported I was like ooh like

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,820
animate all the things it's like a party

00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,410
my browser but problem was is that

00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,690
people weren't coming to the site so I

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,370
was developing to like look at the cool

00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,070
is that I was animating they were

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,560
actually there to do a thing and I was

00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,239
just getting in the way of that the

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,040
second thing that I think happens is

00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,130
that we prioritize like business goals

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,560
and metrics over the user experience

00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:02,630
take pop-ups for example really common

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,400
used to get email acquisition and

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,590
there's a lot of blog posts to talk

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,600
about how successful they are right you

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,290
get like 20 or 30 percent more emails

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,329
woohoo

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,000
but everybody hates them so why are we

00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:15,980
using them well I think it's I think

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,840
that the illusion that you do get those

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,970
emails but there's actually a couple

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,950
things are happening you're getting in

00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:24,260
the way of the person's tasks that

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:26,360
they're trying to complete and so even

00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,050
if they go past your pop-up they're

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,340
going to be fresher

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,680
with you maybe not come back to your

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,479
site also people are gonna put fakey

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,300
mattresses in there it's gonna be like

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,879
fart at fart calm edu or whatever and

00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,530
just to get past that because and then

00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:41,960
you know you have fake emails in your

00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,580
list and then let's say they're nice

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,860
people they actually give you their real

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,379
email address when those people receive

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,370
an email from you they're gonna be like

00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:51,199
they're not going to open it because

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,830
they didn't really choose to do that in

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,930
the first place and so you've all seen

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,879
this quote before I think maybe like the

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,770
million presentations I've had it but

00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,750
it's a really good quote good design

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,180
when done well becomes invisible and

00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:07,879
that's because we need to get out of the

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,069
way of our users and let them create the

00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:11,930
function at hand so that's what we

00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:13,729
really want to talk about being

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,199
intentional and I think this is really

00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:18,169
important when you think about CSS

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,819
animations because a lot of times are

00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:22,460
used for decoration so is that getting

00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:24,770
in the way is there even a use for using

00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,590
animation at all and I actually argue

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,780
yes because animation is a really unique

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,849
way to make the user feel like it's

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:36,020
something that's in real life so for

00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:39,020
example this is Ryan Gosling he's

00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:41,300
receiving some information pausing and

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,039
then shaking his head and without even

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,659
understanding or hearing anything that

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,610
he's doing you understand that he does

00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:49,039
not agree with whatever was told to him

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:52,190
now look this example from Striped check

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,469
out the user is trying to submit without

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,330
filling out the fields so in addition to

00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:57,680
just outlining the fields with red which

00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,960
has come in practice it's actually

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,279
shaking like no and that's universally

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,680
known so it's helping the user

00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,830
understand oh I messed up I need to do

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,310
something before the submits and this is

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,020
because what happens when you're

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,150
reducing what's called cognitive load

00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,259
and so kind of load refers to the total

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,539
amount of information your working

00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:19,610
memory can handle and so this is how

00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:21,169
this works every day you receive so much

00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:24,229
sensory information and stuff that you

00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:26,629
can feel or you see or you hear and your

00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:28,219
sensory memory actually stores the most

00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:30,650
important information in your cognitive

00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:32,719
load but what can also happen is when

00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,729
you receive so much information that

00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:36,649
your sensory memory can distinguish

00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,630
what's the most important and this is

00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:40,900
when you become really frustrated

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:43,670
and decisions are really hard to make

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,620
this awesome dude professor John sweller

00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:48,350
actually did a lot of studies about

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,400
cognitive load theory and with that he

00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,430
figured out a couple different

00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:55,160
strategies to help create these

00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,170
techniques to help people learn so three

00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,120
of these strategies that we can use in

00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:02,950
the web our show-and-tell

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,330
connecting context and Collin responds

00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,460
studies have shown that people respond

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,470
better to image and narration versus

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:11,120
text and narration this is why seasoned

00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,920
speakers encourage you not to have a

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,330
giant wall of text on a slide because

00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,830
the audience will attempt to read the

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:20,360
slide while listening to you it get

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:22,850
distracted here's an actual good example

00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,870
of it this is a blog post about group

00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:28,340
texting in a really crazy climate I'm

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:30,710
sure you understand that states are a

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,170
little frustrating right now so instead

00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,660
of just having a blog post with you know

00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:38,630
text and some images they're actually

00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,730
showing group text to help incorporate

00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:42,350
into that narration it really helps you

00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,090
understand exactly what they're trying

00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:47,840
to communicate a lot easier than trying

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:50,060
to read those blocks of text the second

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,280
concept is connecting context so let's

00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,660
say you have a cat I have two and you

00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,160
see it coming around the corner and also

00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,260
it looks behind it real quick and

00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,390
they're like oh god what is it and so

00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,160
you start to create a mental model of

00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,930
what you think is happening based off of

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,060
whatever you're seeing it's not based

00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,470
necessarily a fact but you need to

00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,810
inform yourself if they actually gonna

00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,550
take next and so you might be like oh no

00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,230
is there a mouse even though it's just a

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,760
can cats are just weird they do what

00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,220
they want

00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:17,960
and this is really important for the web

00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,030
because there's so many different screen

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,310
sizes when I first started making

00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:25,280
websites is so awesome because it's like

00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,980
800 by 600 go we're good but now it's

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,870
just impossible to create one experience

00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,640
for one screen size and so you're gonna

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,919
often have a lot of stuff that's off

00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,979
screen they're going to need to let the

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,840
user know that exists so these are a

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:41,030
couple examples from Google material

00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,740
design and in this first example you can

00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:46,370
see that when the user taps on the name

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,400
it reloads a new page now this is fine

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:50,510
when it's just one into like one

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,110
situation like that but imagine if you

00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,850
keep going down a rabbit

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,610
and you don't understand where you are

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,560
so in the second example which is using

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,300
animation to help connect that context

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,880
when you click on the name is actually

00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,340
showing where that content is coming

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,180
from and so you just already start to

00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,740
know where you need to go back to in

00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,380
this last strategy is called color

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,610
response so this is really important

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,460
because let's say you're driving a car

00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:19,410
you accelerate and the car goes faster

00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,760
you brake and the car goes slower but

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,160
imagine if you've never had an odometer

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,150
and how scary that would be because you

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,950
would press the pedal you're like I

00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:29,300
think it's gonna stop or you know you

00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,980
might be accelerating and this is really

00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:33,870
important for animation because you can

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,030
really provide feedback so let's say

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,790
someone submits a form you can let them

00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:40,440
know what the current status is the

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:44,280
outcome and then what the future status

00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,890
is with using all these parameters we

00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:48,480
can or these strategies rather we can

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,150
really start to make a more functional

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,860
web and so when we start to want to

00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,630
incorporate these into our work and

00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,760
making sure we're using it for good and

00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:00,090
not evil we need to identify the

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,710
problems that animation can solve so the

00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,750
first problem that we can solve is I

00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,570
need to demonstrate the functionality of

00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:08,250
a new product and I think oftentimes the

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,630
way that people approach this is they'll

00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,820
either have like a video where you can

00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,830
see all the different features or they

00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,170
have a bunch of documentation in this

00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,630
example by chase they actually have an

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:21,090
entire pop-up that blocks the navigation

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,680
and the content and even more

00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,230
interesting and I would love to know

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,660
someone who works here they have a CTA

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,830
that says see a slide show like someone

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,470
would actually want to see a slide show

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:34,140
about more of the features but it's one

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,540
way to execute it now a better way to

00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,970
execute it is to use animation and so go

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,310
ahead and play this is a website for

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:43,170
MailChimp but MailChimp does is a

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,930
software that sends email campaigns and

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:48,330
they're promoting a new integration for

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,860
Facebook ad campaigns so as you're

00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,630
scrolling down the page you can see that

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,000
they do have a video where you can

00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,620
actually see the whole process but if

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,120
you're not convinced there they can

00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,760
actually show you just little bits of

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,170
animation coupled with text to show you

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,790
what this functionality looks like

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,140
they're removing the non-essential

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,490
content and they're keeping these

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,910
animations really short so you're not

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,940
going to

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:11,550
there and watch the whole thing another

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,890
example is zoom care zoom care is

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,780
actually a convenient care clinic in the

00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:17,220
States and so if you were to fall on a

00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,840
sidewalk in the United States

00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,880
you'd want to go to zoom care and they

00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,410
would help you and so the way that this

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,010
one works they wanted to promote their

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,420
app app and as you scroll down you can

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:28,950
see that they're giving some like little

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,710
bits of information but what's really

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,110
cool is that they're actually fixing the

00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:36,180
mobile device and as you scroll each

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,980
different feature they go ahead and show

00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,870
you in the app what that looks like and

00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,070
this is really great because it's

00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,410
breaking this content into smaller

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,480
digestible pieces and they're placing

00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:49,350
the words really close to the animation

00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,240
that demonstrates it so let's go on to

00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:54,960
another problem I have a shopping cart

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,340
on my website and I think often websites

00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,900
what they do is that you're on a product

00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,980
page and you go ahead and add to cart

00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,930
and then they actually bring you to a

00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,890
whole nother page and this is just rep

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,930
t'v because they're not really

00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,520
encouraging to buy more products they

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,860
might recommend different products but

00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,890
still it's not it's not keeping you an

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,770
experience where as one of my favorite

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:16,530
t-shirt sites once you go ahead and add

00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,180
to the shopping cart a drawer will be

00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,010
revealed and it shows you where that

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:22,320
shopping cart is located and then if you

00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,640
go up to the shopping cart icon it will

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,910
actually close it again they have the

00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,470
same animation on the menu as well to

00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,640
keep it consistent so you start to

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:32,460
remember you start to learn and you

00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,460
start to anticipate these actions let's

00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,570
look a little closer at icons so when

00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,640
they're inactive they're like the

00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,380
standard shopping Hut icon that's very

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,120
recognizable same with the hamburger

00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:43,680
menu but when you hover over it it shows

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,630
you the direction that it's going to go

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,820
and then when it's active and you want

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:50,580
to close it it shows you that arrow as

00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,430
well and so those cues for interaction

00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:56,280
are really important because it's your

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,750
not going to want to you want people to

00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,110
understand where these things are thar

00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:03,210
off campus and the last problem that

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,890
we're going to solve I need to let the

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:08,460
user know that an action is taking place

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:10,680
behind the scenes and so let's say you

00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,980
have a form submit or you're trying to

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,390
load screens in an app common thing is

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,830
to just create a standard loading gift

00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,720
now this is fine

00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,710
but if your process is going to take any

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,330
more than 4 SEC's

00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,520
people are going to get so frustrated

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:25,320
with you especially if you use a loading

00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:27,120
gift like this because anybody who's

00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,060
this Mac it knows what this means is

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,360
like the wheel of death and so you want

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:35,100
to make it a little bit more like a

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,870
progress bar right so you could

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,190
virtually visually confirm what's

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,630
happening behind the scenes so you can

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,800
tell them where they've been what's

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:43,560
currently happening what's about to

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,170
happen and according to studies it feels

00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:50,340
twelve percent faster even if it is the

00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:52,860
same amount of time another thing that's

00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,600
been really like popular these days is

00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,980
skeleton screens and it's interesting

00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,690
because there's actually like

00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,970
conflicting information about a lot of

00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:01,110
people think it feels a lot faster

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,670
because you're giving a hint of the

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,190
content to come so you know what to

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,900
anticipate but some people find it

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,730
distracting because it's a new pattern

00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,250
that's just starting to emerge and so I

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,900
bet that you know a couple months down

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,120
the line when more apps are using this

00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,720
it's gonna feel more intuitive to the

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,930
user and it's gonna feel a lot faster

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,700
and so those are all really great

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,860
executions of it but I think as

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,690
developers we have a hard time bringing

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:30,090
it back to practice at our workspaces

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:32,040
and so for this next part I'd like to go

00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:35,460
over some steps that helped me bring it

00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,070
to my work common challenges that I

00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,740
think a lot of us have our time creating

00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:42,450
animations seems really time-consuming

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,030
and often times they come in late in the

00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:47,030
process and we don't feel like we have

00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:49,590
enough time to give it its due diligence

00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:51,780
establishing process to create that

00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:54,900
language between you and the designers

00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:57,420
or any of the strategists can be

00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,430
complicated and also skill there's so

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:01,220
much to learn and so many different

00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:04,080
options for it and it can be a little

00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,670
intimidating so the first step is to

00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,160
start the discussion about animation

00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,800
early in the process oftentimes people

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,180
treat animation as decoration and so it

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,980
comes like at the very end like ooh we

00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:16,530
should make the hover state of a CTA

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,760
animated or oh we have a form submit we

00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:21,090
should probably create an animated gif

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,010
but you really want to couple it as far

00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,030
in advance as possible but definitely

00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,980
after you start to talk about the

00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,930
animation or information architecture

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,410
and start asking those questions like

00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:33,529
what can animation help solve the second

00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:36,079
step is to use storyboards

00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:37,730
to brainstorm ideas quickly now this is

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,920
that pretty but this is a real thing

00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,170
that I've used to be able to create an

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,939
animation what's nice about it when you

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,980
bring something to pen and paper is this

00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:47,029
disposable you don't get attached to it

00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,889
like you would if you created a

00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:51,439
prototype right away and it's really

00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:53,930
easy to a bunch of ideas out and to be

00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:55,399
able to work with others on it once you

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:56,209
and the team feels really good about

00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:57,980
that

00:15:56,209 --> 00:15:59,959
you can go ahead and create a prototype

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,490
or motion mock-up and that could be a

00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,680
really good base of discussion because

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,790
it's actually animated there's a couple

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,019
of different tools that are really

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,360
awesome for this

00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:10,040
the first tool framer and principal are

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,089
kind of more drag-and-drop so they're

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,589
really great for like standard

00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:17,209
animations and they have a lower entry

00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:20,089
point so like your designers can work in

00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:22,249
it as well however if you need to do

00:16:20,089 --> 00:16:23,449
something that's really custom you might

00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:26,480
want to look into something like green

00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:27,470
sock JavaScript which is amazing but it

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,230
is you know it does require

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,959
understanding JavaScript for me I just

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,670
like opening up a code pen and creating

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,139
a pen I think it's really nice to be

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,759
able to have all that code there and

00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:39,800
then to sit with the designers and

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,540
strategists and kind of noodle with it

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:45,740
and make sure that the duration is good

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:47,480
the timing is good etc the next step

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,430
once you guys feel really good about

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,589
where the animation is is want to test

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,170
test and test some more and there's two

00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:56,180
components to this the first is you want

00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,399
to ask people who have not seen the

00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,559
animation before a couple questions one

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,209
is it legible and that's not even just

00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,510
text but like do you understand what's

00:17:02,209 --> 00:17:07,579
going on and second how does it make you

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:10,250
feel you can really understand a lot

00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,709
about if they're animation is creating

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:15,380
anxiety or is creating calm or how that

00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,640
feels by asking that question and these

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:18,620
questions are really important because

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,880
the more you work with animation the

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,740
more you're going to start to think that

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,250
it's too slow because you already know

00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:27,260
what's gonna say and then secondarily if

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,090
people are you know not sure if they

00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:33,620
want to animate something a B test to

00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:35,000
validate those decisions v once you

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,549
actually decide to ship go ahead and

00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,750
document those designs design design

00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:43,010
decisions in your digital style guide so

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,260
if you have a digital style guide which

00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,820
you should you can go ahead and document

00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,740
those decisions in it it's really

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,480
important

00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:51,640
when you do this to show what you have

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,620
done in what you've already tried and

00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,809
you don't want to do that'll help

00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:58,120
other developers in the future make good

00:17:55,809 --> 00:18:00,039
decisions you also want to provide code

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,049
snippets that include the duration

00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:04,120
easing and timing because that's going

00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:05,679
to help make the animations a lot more

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,299
efficient when they build new modules

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,450
and then you also want to establish

00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:12,279
naming conventions it's you know how

00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,409
messy it can get if everyone's on the

00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:16,500
same page but especially with animation

00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:18,659
to create classes that are meaningful

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,000
will help a lot

00:18:18,659 --> 00:18:24,279
and then lastly keep learning and have

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,190
fun here's a lot of resources that I've

00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,270
used to help educate me and I'll be

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,770
putting these slides online so don't

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:32,110
worry about like keeping track of that

00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:40,500
and that's it for me

00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:40,500
