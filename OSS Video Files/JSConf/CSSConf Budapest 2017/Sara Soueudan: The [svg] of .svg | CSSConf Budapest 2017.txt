Description: 
	Scalable Vector Graphics, or Documents? Both. SVG may be known more as an image format, perfect for displaying icons and illustrations, including animated ones. But there are other aspects of SVG that make it as powerful as it is, and those aspects stem from its nature as a document format, as well as its graphical nature. In this talk, Sara is going to highlight some SVG's document side and show you how it can be leveraged to improve and optimize the way we deliver content such as text and images for the Web, including SVG itself.
