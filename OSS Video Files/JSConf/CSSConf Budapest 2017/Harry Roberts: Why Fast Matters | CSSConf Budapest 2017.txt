Title: Harry Roberts: Why Fast Matters | CSSConf Budapest 2017
Publication date: 2018-02-16
Playlist: CSSConf Budapest 2017
Description: 
	We’re all—I hope!—well aware that performance is important; it’s great for business and it’s great for our users. But things are still not fast enough. With more and more emerging markets coming online, and more and more apps moving to the web platform, we’re reaching an intersection where connections are getting slower and websites are getting heavier. In this talk, we’ll learn just what these emerging markets mean to us, and how we can begin to move in the right direction.

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,300

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,420
why fast matters it's quite a long talk

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,560
I've had to trim a couple of slides out

00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,270
these slides that I share at the end

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,150
will be the full version of the talk so

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,039
check those out yeah let's get straight

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,920
into it so I'm Harry I'm a consultant

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,420
developer from Leeds which is a city in

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,890
the north of England

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,560
I'm currently focusing a lot on

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:33,420
performance so I know this is CSS conf

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,000
but a lot of my work at the moment folks

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,890
is very strongly on kind of performance

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,510
engineering helping clients make their

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,450
sites faster more reliable more

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,690
resilient and just real quickly I only

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:48,239
gone a bit of a tangent three years ago

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,789
it comes in Paris I met the organisers

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,649
of CSS called Budapest and as soon as I

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,840
heard the word CSS come from Budapest I

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,969
was like I need to be there I have to be

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,859
and for a few years it didn't happen and

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,870
I finally got the email this year I was

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,080
like yes like whatever I need to do I

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,519
will be there I arrived on Saturday I've

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,979
been exploring a city

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,630
absolutely beautiful city incredible

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,479
city really great food and drink the

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,610
people are really nice but monday was a

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,619
national holiday right so museums were

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,479
closed everything was closed so I

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:20,759
decided well Monday is the day I will

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,580
spend walking I'll spend that day

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:25,259
outside because can't go to museums so I

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,090
took a walk up to the the Statue of

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,280
Liberty anyone being up there yeah

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,860
beautiful but it wasn't on Monday it was

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,110
terrible weather this is such a bad idea

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,880
I can barely keep my eyes open so the

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,829
rain was coming in sideways my hair is

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,680
all over the place absolutely dreadful

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,850
horrible weather so I mean I'm English

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,939
right so I'm kind of used to it but

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,380
still wasn't right but then sorrow

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,090
landed yesterday owners like sorrow

00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,950
let's I need to go back it's good

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,159
weather so went up again yesterday and

00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,689
how beautiful is that look at that this

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,979
is the view I was treated to yesterday

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,520
afternoon and what I thought was quite

00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:58,520
nice was

00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:09,140
check that out anyway right

00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:12,410
let's get down to it I've got like 98

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,390
slides left I work for a lot of

00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,460
different clients right I'm a consultant

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,830
I'm very lucky very fortunate very

00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,720
privileged that in the last four you in

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,520
fact my company turns four years old

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,710
today right I've been working for myself

00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,270
for four years starting today right now

00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,210
it's my company's birthday which is

00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:31,100
pretty baller and yeah I've worked with

00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,750
some beautiful wonderful clients over

00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,210
the last few years being very very

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,970
privileged one of these clients the

00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:41,030
train line sort of Center bottom their

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:44,570
train line is a European company who

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:47,090
sell train tickets when they released a

00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,890
case that he recently a couple years ago

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,350
maybe which said that if they could

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,630
reduce latency by just 0.3 seconds

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:57,620
customers would spend around eight point

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,850
1 million pounds more every year so I've

00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,620
actually been helping them with this

00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,630
body of work it's been very fascinating

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,250
very insightful and the good news is

00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,050
it's actually kind of easy to make a

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:07,040
sight point three seconds faster right

00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,230
it's not much time at all

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,230
but at point three seconds had a

00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,750
tangible sort of measurable impact on

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:19,130
their baseline right 8.1 million pounds

00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:22,190
a year another company unfortunately not

00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:24,110
a client of mine but Netflix saw a 43

00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:27,260
percent decrease in their bandwidth bill

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:30,170
simply by turning on gzip a couple of

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:33,380
things here like who turned gzip off in

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,540
the first place like this case that he

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,700
should really say Netflix used to waste

00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:40,040
43 percent of their bandwidth bill vine

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,019
not having jeez it turned on um but the

00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,330
second thing is 43 percent is an

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:46,310
enormous number 40 imagine if you went

00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,530
to a restaurant and for some reason they

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,410
decided to give you 43 percent off your

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,209
bill it's a huge number so imagine what

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,400
that translates to translates to in

00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:57,500
savings for somebody the size of Netflix

00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,880
so they saved a huge amount of money

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,830
here GQ kind of lifestyle magazine they

00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,280
cut load time is by a very very

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:09,380
impressive 80% and in return so an 80%

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,329
increase in organic traffic so not

00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,860
search not paid for kind of completely

00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:15,080
organic traffic

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,660
and over that increase the median time

00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,370
on site went up by 32% this is a really

00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,079
great case study for when your clients

00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,000
or your your managers or whoever tell

00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,890
you that well we're not ecommerce right

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,260
we're not ecommerce so we don't think

00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:29,090
performance equals money well might it

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,590
may not do but it will increase

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,900
engagement it will keep people more

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:36,620
loyal and as much as I hate to mention

00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,450
it GQ has ads on their site right so

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,950
this will translate to more money that

00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,080
eventually it will make them more cash

00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,730
imagine increasing ad impressions by

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,570
nearly a third right so it will

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:48,950
ultimately translate to money by golly

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,440
these case studies from

00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:53,360
WPO stats calm this is a fantastic

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,100
resource if you ever struggle to sell

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,290
performance to your managers your

00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,700
clients it's full of really good

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,740
information but the reason I picked

00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,480
these three specific case studies is

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,970
because each one tells us something

00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,290
different the first one it will make us

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,290
more money right or make the business

00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:11,210
more money the second one it will save

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,370
as money right performance will reduce

00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:15,680
our costs in fact I work for a company

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:17,900
recently and just by optimizing for

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,169
performance we reduced their data

00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:23,660
overheads by 62% like we reduce their

00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:26,030
transfer by 62% just by focusing on

00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,770
performance and thirdly it will just

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:29,510
make users happier we know from our own

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,640
experience that slow websites are

00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:35,060
tedious and we don't use them we abandon

00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,710
them but what I want to talk about today

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,600
in this talk is another side to

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,160
performance because nearly all the time

00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,990
when we discuss performance we've got a

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,540
very westernized kind of very

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,490
capitalistic view of what it's about I

00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,130
want to talk about the non financial

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,440
side of things I believe there's a kind

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,150
of ethical and a moral side to

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,740
performance there are moral reasons why

00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,570
we should be fast and why we should

00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,680
focus on building fast and performant

00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:03,410
websites I've got three short anecdotes

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,210
out to share with you anecdotes aren't

00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,430
great because obviously anecdotes aren't

00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,080
the same as evidence or data but these

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,750
are three really interesting stories

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,460
that all happened to me this year so I'm

00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,750
not talking about the Internet five or

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:19,310
10 years ago I'm talking about the

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,810
internet in 2017 first one I was

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,580
organizing an event with a friend of

00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,770
mine my friend runs a really really

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,729
great coffee shop in Leeds and I sent

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,620
him an email and it was in

00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:29,509
Porter email and he just did not reply

00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,610
to me and I was stressing right so I was

00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:32,240
like we need to we need to decide what's

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,860
gonna happen

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,930
so eventually I just went into the

00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,699
coffee shop and you said look dude like

00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,180
you didn't reply to the email what's

00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:40,069
going on

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,839
he was like I'm really sorry I was on

00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,789
holiday in Thailand and I got a push

00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,069
notification telling me I received an

00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:47,749
email but the data connection out there

00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:50,809
was so weak that I couldn't actually

00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:52,729
open it I hadn't sent a huge 20 mega

00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:55,639
attachment it was just a simple plain

00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:57,080
text email but he left the data of the

00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:01,819
kind of the connectivity to actually

00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:03,080
open and read it the next one somebody

00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:04,580
sent me an email and this happens quite

00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,379
often someone sent me an email asking

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,449
for some advice just general kind of

00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:11,180
career advice and I sent a really long

00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:12,589
response and after about two weeks the

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,539
person still haven't replied to me and I

00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:15,949
was like nah that's kind of rude I did

00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:17,899
put a lot of effort into the reply but

00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:19,339
you know whatever I'll get over it but

00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:21,469
then a few days after that like sort of

00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,819
two three weeks later I get a response

00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:24,499
he's like I'm really sorry for the

00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:26,149
delayed delayed reply I've been on a

00:07:24,499 --> 00:07:28,339
really bad connection and I was like

00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:30,439
well I will forgive you if you tell me

00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:32,959
everything you mean by bad connection

00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,610
and this is what he said I'm currently

00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,069
at my parents place in Rajasthan which

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,569
is northern India since my parents don't

00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:40,909
have a computer they only consume

00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:42,709
internet through their smartphone we

00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:45,560
were alone Internet services by telco

00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:47,659
providers which in our town are still 2g

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,770
some providers claim to be 3G but I've

00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:51,110
never seen that happening

00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:53,270
right now I've got a connector sorry

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,639
right now I've connected my laptop via a

00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:58,159
Wi-Fi hotspot and opening the basic

00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,770
version of Gmail takes between 30 and 60

00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:02,120
seconds most other sites I just use

00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,999
mobile Chrome because that will make

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,270
savings for me so two interesting things

00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:11,059
here I've used the basic HTML version of

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,520
Gmail maybe five six times in my entire

00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:14,569
life and what I do I'm like god this is

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,370
the worst thing ever

00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:19,639
all right and it loads and it's fine and

00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,319
it's a bit clunky but it works this

00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,509
person has to use it all the time and it

00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,779
still takes up to a minute to load the

00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:29,689
basic version of Gmail the second thing

00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:31,279
and more interestingly here is when you

00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:33,169
go home you've probably got a Rooter in

00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:35,390
the corner of your room that beams out

00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:37,370
Wi-Fi and if you're lucky that Wi-Fi

00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,280
might be backed by a fiber network and

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,990
that's how we get online

00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,030
this guy's family a hundred percent of

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,100
the time they're getting online it's not

00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,900
via Wi-Fi it's not by a broadband it's

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,940
not a dedicated connection they don't

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,280
have a Rooter in the corner of the room

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,900
they've got a commodity Android device

00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,050
which is beaming out a 2g connection

00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:01,730
high latency low bandwidth device a

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:02,420
hundred percent of the time third one

00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,550
that happened to me

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,920
I got a DM again simply asking for

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,500
advice I'm not cold at Harry on Twitter

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,810
so I don't know who got the notification

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,190
um but this this person pinged me asking

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,790
for some advice and this is a Nepalese

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:21,500
developer now completely as a soft side

00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:23,390
kind of coincidence I'd worked out from

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,460
my Google Analytics that Nepal was a

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,310
problem region for my site my site was

00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,960
slow in Nepal so I gave this guy some

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,980
answers and I said oh by the way whilst

00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,110
I have your attention

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,700
does my website feel slow for you

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,590
because my analytics tells me that my

00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,780
website is slow in Nepal and his

00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,460
response was astounding he said no I

00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,730
don't think so I mean I click through to

00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:47,720
your site and it loads within a minute

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:49,220
and that didn't feel slow if we were to

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,960
visit a website that took a minute to

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,760
load we'd assume the website was down

00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,710
right we'd borrow the websites down or

00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,670
go somewhere else this person was like

00:09:54,710 --> 00:10:00,830
oh that's fast a minute good work

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,420
and the worst thing here right the other

00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,250
thing I want to mention is that my site

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,590
is meant to be fast right my site if you

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:10,160
visit my site from Dublin for example or

00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:13,880
from Los Angeles or whatever it'll be

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,430
fully rendered within 1.3 seconds the

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,690
exact same codebase the exact same CDN

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,930
the exact same infrastructure but

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:24,620
visited from Nepal they pay a penalty of

00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:26,870
hype 58 seconds just to visit my site

00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,190
imagine what it's like for this person

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,610
visiting sites that haven't been

00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:35,660
optimized it must be completely tiresome

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,830
it must be in fact almost impossible you

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,290
may have noticed a couple of things

00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,210
about this though um one of the most

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,740
important being that all of these

00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:46,160
stories all of these things they

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:48,020
happened in in the Far East has anybody

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,810
heard of a initiative called the next

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,610
billion users anyone heard of this yeah

00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,870
not many okay so just

00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:56,540
right because when you google it you'll

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:59,149
find this resource from quartz which is

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:02,029
a very good canonical resource all about

00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:03,529
the next billion Internet users there

00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:06,860
are roughly it's actually more than a

00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:09,529
billion but 1 billion 253 million is

00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:11,000
less catchy I guess the next billion

00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:12,890
users coming online are all coming

00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,630
online from emerging economies and what

00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:17,180
are those emerging economy economies are

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:21,040
in the Far East you may have seen this

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:24,440
graphic before more people live inside

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,019
of that highlighted area than outside of

00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,300
it even taking into account how much

00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:31,940
ocean there is under that highlighted

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,700
area more people live inside of it than

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,350
outside of it when you consider that

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:39,410
this contains places like Indonesia

00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,570
India Bangladesh very densely populated

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,420
areas it soon starts to make sense but

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,010
this is the majority of our next billion

00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,279
users these are who we need to optimize

00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:52,370
for I'm still really quickly run through

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,649
some stats around some of these regions

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:57,320
some of some of the countries in this

00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:59,480
region bangladesh average connection

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,180
about three and a half Meg only 15% of

00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,070
people are online 3.9 million broadband

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,230
subscribers represents 2.4 percent of

00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,029
the population on a dedicated broadband

00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,089
connection what we would actually call

00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:12,709
Wi-Fi or or Ethernet you know like a

00:12:11,089 --> 00:12:17,329
broadband dedicated connection but with

00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:19,430
134 million cellular subscriptions 83%

00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:21,709
of the population get online via mobile

00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:24,709
highline's hielo bandwidth that

00:12:21,709 --> 00:12:28,070
represents a delta of 34 34 times more

00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:29,500
people get online with mobile only than

00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,880
they do with broadband in Bangladesh

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,070
India three and a half Meg four of

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,449
people online 1.3 percent of the

00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,630
population have a dedicated internet

00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:41,019
connection but with 1 billion and that's

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:44,209
not a typo that's a billion with a B

00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:46,339
cellular subscriptions 79% of Indians

00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:48,230
get online with a high latency low

00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:51,880
bandwidth connection that's 58 times

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:54,440
more people these numbers only get worse

00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,079
Pakistan average connection two and a

00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,850
half Meg a fifth of people are online

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,529
1.8 million subscribers for broadband

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:04,370
represents just one percent of the

00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:06,230
population with a reliable network 126

00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:09,590
million cellular subscribers represents

00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:12,200
67% with a unreliable mobile only

00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:15,440
connection that's 70 times more people

00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,090
and finally I think these are the slides

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,950
I thought I'd cut out so this is a

00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,270
surprise to me as well these are all

00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,610
this data was meant to be skipped over

00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:25,130
in this talk fastest connection of the

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:28,130
group four and a half Meg represents a

00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,570
fifth of people online just 1.1 percent

00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:33,530
of the population have a dedicated

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:35,930
connection but weird phenomenon here 132

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:38,030
percent of the population have a mobile

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,560
connection and this represents people

00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:42,110
with more than one cellular subscription

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,270
more than one SIM card I've got two SIM

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:45,950
cards I've got a different travel sim

00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,830
that's cheaper to use abroad than my

00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,880
British one so Indonesia a lot of people

00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,850
will have more than one cellular

00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,080
subscription and the Far East is the

00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,480
fastest-growing economy on the planet

00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,720
and Indonesia is its fastest growing

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,400
country so this may represent how or why

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,880
it's got this kind of growth in in

00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:07,880
mobile but this represents 121 times

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,760
more people getting online via a solely

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,200
high latency low bandwidth connection if

00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,050
we average the data out we'll quickly

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,510
see that three and a Half Men connection

00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,890
twenty percent of people are online . so

00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,390
eighty percent of the population

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:23,420
aren't even online yet these are our

00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:25,940
next billion users only one and a half

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:28,280
percent one point four five percent of

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:29,720
this region actually have broadband

00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,180
actually have a proper internet

00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,210
connection whereas a staggering 90

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:39,650
percent of that region has a mobile only

00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:43,280
device let's contrast that we're looking

00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:45,710
at nearly 14 Meg speeds three-quarters

00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,750
of people here are online over 1/4 I've

00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:51,350
dedicated broadband and actually again

00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,960
right here 118 119 percent of people

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,970
have more than one device

00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,340
we're contrasting very very different

00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,840
views any time I do this kind of talk in

00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,480
the West I tailor kind of this slide to

00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:05,360
each individual country we are doing so

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,330
much better so much better than people

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,400
in the Far East so what does this tell

00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,630
us it tells us a few things we're

00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,430
building for a totally different class

00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:16,010
of views a completely dn't profile of

00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,960
user it also means that we need to

00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,420
change our technological decisions when

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,090
we talk about building mobile

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,620
first we normally think oh well I used

00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:26,650
Minh with media queries right that's

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:29,560
mobile first not at all mobile first now

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:31,600
means don't build by default on a laptop

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,730
I have clients who do this all the time

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,620
they will build a specific MDOT website

00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,230
and the moment most of their testing is

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:41,350
just resizing Chrome we need to build

00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:43,200
testing first and foremost on a high

00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,920
latency low bandwidth connection

00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,560
optimize for the lowest common

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,600
denominator first because speed is a

00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,720
feature right people I don't have access

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,010
to the same kind of infrastructure we do

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,050
when I go through this kind of stuff

00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,060
with clients the first question I get

00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,910
asked is how fast should we be how fast

00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,320
is fast enough and the bad news is

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,330
there's no real answer to that question

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,160
I can't answer that very quickly but

00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,260
normally if it's a very commercial sort

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,790
of a for-profit client I would normally

00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,170
say just be faster than your nearest

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,060
competitor right that's probably the

00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,190
quickest way to start just be faster

00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:19,060
than the person who you want to be your

00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:20,380
nearest sort of commercial competitor it

00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,190
was a really great tool I found almost

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:25,720
by accident called dare boost dare boost

00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,920
French startup kind of an odd name

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,440
especially when I say in my northern

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:32,070
accent dare boost sound very inspiring

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,080
but great little tool you can put your

00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:37,150
web address in there's a guy he runs a

00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,840
little site called CSS tricks I don't if

00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:40,030
you've heard of him

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,280
but I thought right well let's benchmark

00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:44,020
each other against ourselves and it

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,250
turns out I'm a little faster than his

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,800
site but then what you have to remember

00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,240
is my sites like a personal blog or as

00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,280
Chris's site is a full-on kind of

00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,540
WordPress community so you do have to

00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,980
kind of take into consideration

00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,440
differences in the actual infrastructure

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,910
in the site itself but if you're working

00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,370
with clients who don't know where to

00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,100
start optimizing for performance start

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,570
here this tool is great

00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,660
another tool substantially more

00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:09,730
expensive but also very very good is

00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,200
speed curve and these slides are all low

00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,740
contrast I'm afraid but hopefully you

00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,330
can see that we got like this historical

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,060
data where benchmarking several

00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:20,590
different sites against one another

00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:23,140
these kind of graphs these charts are

00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:24,700
absolutely fantastic for proving to

00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,790
non-technical stakeholders of the

00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:29,650
business clients managers exactly how

00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,700
well we're doing we don't need to tell

00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,000
our manager that you know

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,970
DNS overhead is down by 3% or

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,110
we've reduced number requests by 15 no

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,730
need to know about that no one cares

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:42,450
about that all right we can show them

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,830
things like this cool so how do we get

00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,030
there and this is the probably most

00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,799
important bit

00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,539
the first kind of part of this talk was

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,070
kind of a call to arms I guess I'm just

00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:52,350
kind of laying the scene setting the

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,000
scene for how bad it is using the

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,549
Internet you know in different parts of

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,530
the world this next part of the talk is

00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:00,450
going to be some sort of fundamental

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:04,200
advice and strategies on how to get

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:07,200
there I've got three kind of tips and

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,820
they're not like a BuzzFeed style like

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,520
you would not believe these three simple

00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,539
things because they're not actually

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,020
there aren't even three of them there

00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:17,760
are four but yeah these are going to be

00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,320
fairly fundamental shifts they're not

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,030
going to be necessarily easy but they're

00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,679
probably the biggest fundamental changes

00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,049
you can make to workflows and company

00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,510
culture to actually start building fast

00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:29,190
websites and properly servicing people

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,100
who don't have the same infrastructure

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,690
as we do the reason I said three tips

00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,520
when I meant before is because the first

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,940
one is actually like a throwaway kind of

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,890
a zero tip because honestly the zeroth

00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,960
step in optimizing for performance is

00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,299
just build build a fast website just go

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,830
and do it no one's gonna stop you now

00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,210
this sounds very tongue-in-cheek this

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,669
sounds very like a pointless thing to

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,799
say but genuinely this is where I start

00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:54,690
with all of my clients if you want a

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,909
fast website then make sure you've said

00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:58,679
that you want a fast website it's not

00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:00,870
gonna happen by accident it's not easy

00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,820
to make a fast website so you need to

00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,690
make sure that it's actually a goal you

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,049
need to make sure it's something that

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,760
you the team marketing design

00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:10,980
stakeholders everyone needs to focus on

00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,049
this goal so although it sounds like a

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,490
really silly throwaway comment this is

00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:17,270
probably the most important thing you

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:20,370
and your team can do is actually decide

00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:22,169
between yourselves and officially that

00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,970
you want to have a fast website and

00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:27,390
you'll be surprised how much easier it

00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,260
gets okay let's start with the proper

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,100
stuff um

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:35,640
step one understand the problem but like

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,080
really properly understand it try your

00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,080
site from a different kind of point of

00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,600
view being fast or having a fast website

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,470
from your office in a nice European

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,430
capital city with blazing fast sort of

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:49,650
fiber connect

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,170
being fast in that environment isn't

00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:53,760
fast that's not really fast if you can

00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:55,290
be fast in the middle of a field in the

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,450
middle of nowhere on a 2g connection

00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,820
then you're going to be fast everywhere

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,980
if you optimize for the worst possible

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,860
scenario everything else on top of that

00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,810
is completely free if you start by doing

00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:09,270
the hardest bit then everything on top

00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:11,430
of that is already solved and it can't

00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:13,590
get much simpler if you optimize for

00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:16,050
what you're perceived worst case

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:19,140
scenario is everything else on top of it

00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:20,970
is already solved Facebook did this

00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,690
quite well they introduce them in called

00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:27,930
2g Tuesday's this is where once a week

00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:30,540
on a Tuesday oddly enough they

00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,220
artificially throttled the speed of

00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,040
their connection to Facebook's product

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,550
to a 2g connection so anybody working in

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,200
the Facebook offices any Facebook staff

00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:42,930
visiting their products and services on

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,720
a Tuesday would be forced over a 2g like

00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,700
connection so obviously it didn't affect

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,440
regular visitors but IP ring-fencing

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,510
they basically said any any staff

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,310
visiting the site on a Tuesday are going

00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:55,530
to be forced through a 2g connection to

00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:57,570
understand what it really feels like to

00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:59,640
use our applications in emerging

00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,350
economies and they soon realized that

00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,210
like moon-like we've looked a very good

00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,120
job here and it gave them a real sense

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:08,700
of empathy of a quick dose of like I've

00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,580
been awakening and they started optimize

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,250
and they started to fix these things now

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,260
I personally as in like specifically me

00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,730
I lack the skills to actually set up

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,160
this kind of infrastructure where we can

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:22,140
IP ring-fencing but what I can do and

00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,910
what I do with clients is use a tool

00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,510
called Charles proxy anybody heard of

00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:30,030
Charles yeah it's quite a few of us so

00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,010
Charles proxy is a it's a property it's

00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,350
a network property but my favorite

00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:36,750
feature of Charles is the the throttling

00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:38,700
and you can throttle specific endpoints

00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,860
so what you can do is you can slow your

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,370
entire machines traffic down but only to

00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:46,950
certain like websites hosts so this

00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,930
means that Oh Charles is free by the way

00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:53,490
there's like a $50 paid for option but

00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:54,810
it's free what this means is that I will

00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,430
say to my clients okay all the

00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:59,190
developers go and install Charles and

00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:01,020
slow down just our website it means you

00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,820
can listen to Spotify just fine

00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,930
it means you can do email you can do

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,940
what you need to do you can get to

00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:08,010
stackoverflow nice and quickly but just

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,900
our website let's slow that down and

00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,820
let's see how it feels and the

00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,080
frustration that the developers who

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:15,360
built the website themselves the

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,960
frustration they feel is usually enough

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,190
of a motivation to start fixing things

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,990
but there's kind of some bad news

00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,580
it's not just about connection speed

00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,930
anymore so we talked a lot about you

00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,540
know the Internet's very slow out here

00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:29,880
or there's high latency solving

00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,860
connection is only half of the battle

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,320
like solving the performance over the

00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:37,110
wire is only a very small fraction of

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,520
what we need to do who's got a phone

00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:40,380
like this in their pocket this is um

00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,870
this is an iPhone 7 I never got an

00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,350
iPhone 7 and it got like a fairly new

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:48,150
Android device yeah yeah I expected that

00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,770
like most of us have got pretty decent

00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,170
phones right we're in tech we tend to

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,150
update phones fairly frequently and you

00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:57,000
know that's good for us lucky us we've

00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:59,730
got nice powerful devices unfortunately

00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,770
this isn't very representative current

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,840
advice coming from Google's performance

00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:07,200
engineering team is that the most

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,470
representative worldwide phone is the

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,900
Moto G 4 all right across a global

00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:14,880
spectrum the Moto G 4 is probably the

00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,200
one phone that they say is the best to

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,590
optimize for it's the most

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:22,230
representative on a global scale some

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:25,530
really quick sort of comparison shows

00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:28,050
that an iPhone 7s roughly twice as fast

00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:30,660
in terms of processing power than the

00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:32,460
Moto G 4 you immediately get a double

00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:35,400
performance benefit just by owning a

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:37,530
certain phone more forensic benchmarking

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,220
shows us that in most nearly every

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:44,520
single test the iPhone 7 is 3 to 4 times

00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:46,140
more capable than a Moto G 4 so imagine

00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,640
when you visit a site on your iPhone and

00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:49,110
they've got ads everywhere and there's

00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,240
loads of position:fixed stuff and it's

00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,890
like scrolling through treacle imagine

00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,750
making that three to four times slower

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,960
all right and that's what people going

00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:00,180
to be experiencing you can start

00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,400
experimenting with this I mean I'm I'm

00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,780
fairly certain everyone's seen this by

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,150
now that opening Chrome we've got these

00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,490
throttling features the networked one on

00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:10,590
the top is alright so who's used the

00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:13,620
network throttling in chrome before good

00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:14,220
amazing good it's a great start but the

00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,750
problem with

00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,299
Network throttling in Chrome as it only

00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:21,299
affects the application layer it's very

00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:23,880
very very synthetic Charles which is

00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:25,710
free does this kind of throttling but on

00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,659
the network layer so it'll actually do

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:30,000
traffic shaping it will do it will

00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:31,380
simulate packet loss for example so this

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,669
is a great sort but when you install

00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,470
Charles you will get the network

00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:36,330
throttling which is way more kind of

00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:39,000
realistic but underneath it we can see

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:41,100
CPU slow down diva these have actually

00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,049
been aliased to kind of like mid-range

00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:45,990
device and low rate and high high-end

00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:47,580
device in in dev tools but aim for a

00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:50,340
five times slowdown and evening it a

00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,990
fairly decent representation but that

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,980
said there is no replacement for real

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:58,980
devices the Moto G 4 is about 150 180

00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,240
euro I think go and speak to someone at

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,280
the company who's got the company credit

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,450
card and add one of these moto G force

00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,539
to your device level this is your

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,650
performance testing device I'm a bit of

00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:10,980
a hypocrite though I don't actually have

00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:13,470
a Moto G 4 I've got a Nexus 5 which is

00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,980
actually even worse this is from about

00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:18,750
five years four or five years ago

00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,820
the Nexus 5 is even slower than a Moto G

00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:24,090
4 so I do most of my performance testing

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:26,100
on this this is a screenshot from an

00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:27,750
audit that I sent to a client so this

00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,700
wasn't actually meant to end up in any

00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:32,549
slides this was from a report I sent to

00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:35,070
a client they just finished building an

00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:38,460
MDOT website it was literally only for

00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:40,950
mobile devices and they built it as a

00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:43,049
full you know JavaScript client rendered

00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:45,539
application and asked me hey how do you

00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:46,620
make this thing faster don't build it as

00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:48,990
a fully client rendered JavaScript

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:50,549
application but it's too late by that

00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,230
point and what we found out is that they

00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,850
were testing every developer every

00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,830
engineer had a really nice new metal

00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,990
book right and they were all on a wired

00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:59,159
connection in central London the site

00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:02,370
felt really nice and fast

00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:05,700
I plugged in my Nexus 5 I visited their

00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:10,200
MDOT web site and it took 1.8 seconds

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:11,340
just to evaluate their main act is train

00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,169
line a client I mentioned at the

00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,409
beginning point three seconds is worth

00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:18,150
eight mil to them and we're throwing 1.8

00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:20,730
seconds away just evaluating a

00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:23,490
javascript file so a processing speed

00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:25,919
has a marked impact on performance and

00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:28,300
the problem is here this is all divorced

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,150
from network speeds if I had mine

00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:33,280
five talking to the server over a like a

00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,510
fiber connection it would still take 1.8

00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,160
seconds right because this is all

00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:38,110
happening on the device so this is what

00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,000
I mean when I say that connection speeds

00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:43,480
only a small fraction of the battle

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,390
anymore so yeah build up an idea of

00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,610
realistic conditions realistic devices

00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,290
realistic kind of typography is in let

00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:54,100
you know what is the network looking

00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:55,720
like in certain parts of the world and

00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,980
processing power right these are the

00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,810
things we need to get a really good

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,030
handle on because testing from the

00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:05,380
devices that we build on is not suitable

00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:07,150
anymore step to know what's going on I

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,320
told you these weren't simple tips right

00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,340
it would be so nice for us like I'll

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,440
install this and do this and this

00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,700
plug-in and make your site faster this

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,610
is another really difficult one know

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,180
what's going on I find myself all the

00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,800
time

00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,410
especially when I work with new clients

00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,730
like what does this script do what is it

00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,950
what is he what even hits this I've

00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,780
never seen this before who's in charge

00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,910
of this who installed this well what's

00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:31,360
going on who who lives this whose life

00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:34,780
is this slide right only us to man like

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,430
I get this all the time I will build a

00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,050
site or I'll work on a site and I'll put

00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:40,780
it live and I look at the live version

00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:43,270
and I'd be like whoa I did not do that

00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,860
where does this come from more release

00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,900
tracking pixels I didn't install any of

00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,070
these tracking pixels so what is

00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,690
happening is other people are

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:51,660
contributing we'll get onto it in a

00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:53,890
second but tagger managers for example

00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:56,080
other people contributing to your kind

00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:57,610
of code base all the time circumventing

00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,950
the dev process so you end up just

00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:03,430
having no idea what any of the files are

00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:06,130
on the live product so other people

00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:09,670
teams can add things to the site quite

00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:12,820
easily not every site I'm mainly talking

00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:14,710
like anything ecommerce tag managers

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:17,730
social widgets tracking scripts

00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:21,610
retargeting ads all of that kind of crap

00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:23,910
in fact ironically things like maybe

00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:26,500
testing tools that work on the client or

00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,820
optimizing tools right these optimizing

00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,650
tools have this horrible effect of

00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,000
actually by measuring the site's

00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,670
performance we're going to making it

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,960
slower right which is the painful irony

00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:36,430
so yeah if you're in this situation call

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,730
meetings try and find out what things

00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:41,059
are find out who's using it find out if

00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,649
they even need it

00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:44,659
I've had it so many times when I go into

00:28:42,649 --> 00:28:46,759
a client and I say oh I notice you're

00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:49,100
using this analytics package and this

00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:51,110
analytics package on the same page why

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,190
is that like are we supposed to

00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,600
uninstall the other one how long's that

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,179
been there it's like I don't know just

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,470
your website you tell me and it turns

00:28:56,179 --> 00:28:59,090
out that people that we haven't logged

00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,070
into this analytics package for like two

00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,590
years but it's been on the site the

00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:05,570
whole time so this is kind of our

00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:08,059
responsibility to kind of audit and sort

00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:10,909
of work back from this let's talk

00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:12,679
briefly about tag managers honest honest

00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:17,179
show of hands who isn't sure what a tag

00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:18,710
manager is a few of us so imagine the

00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:20,450
scenario right you're a developer and

00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:23,210
somebody says to you hey can you just

00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:25,700
install this little analytics snippet

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:26,720
and you're like I'm kind of busy but

00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,100
I'll try and do it after lunch so you

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,960
quickly do that and you sneak that bit

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,190
of work in and it goes live and the next

00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,509
day they say hey Cheers that was really

00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,159
great thank you could you just install

00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:35,299
this bit as well and it's like you can't

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,850
keep doing this like I've actually got

00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:39,860
proper work to do like can you please

00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,669
prioritize it and and marketing get

00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,929
annoyed because it's like all the

00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:43,639
developers won't do what I ask them and

00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:45,259
you're well I've got work to do already

00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:47,059
so somebody invented something called a

00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:48,830
tag manager which is where the developer

00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,419
gets asked to install just one

00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,919
javascript file like can you just put is

00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:54,559
one JavaScript snippet on the site and

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,450
this tag manager is like a conduit to

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,210
like an admin panel Google tag manager

00:29:56,450 --> 00:30:01,580
Adobe tag manager which is basically a

00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:03,529
WYSIWYG where marketing departments can

00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,879
install their own analytics they can

00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:06,919
install their own tracking scripts and

00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:09,139
they're right in production JavaScript

00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:10,759
it's not production quality JavaScript

00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:13,279
oh no no but is going to production

00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:15,679
right they can arbitrarily say let me a

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,659
be test this button let me track clicks

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,119
on this link let me see how many times

00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:22,279
the carousel goeb managed to go through

00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:24,169
what's happening is you've got people

00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,820
who are non developers completely

00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:28,639
skipping the dev process and putting

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,080
JavaScript on your live site that's why

00:30:28,639 --> 00:30:31,190
when you look at the live site and it

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,409
looks very very different to what you

00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,879
actually built this is what happens it's

00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:37,009
because there are other people able to

00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:39,649
just add things into production without

00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:42,769
consulting a developer even once so in

00:30:39,649 --> 00:30:44,779
the green box we have the website right

00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:47,720
this is a company I was working with

00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:49,610
recently the green box represents the

00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:53,500
website this is what the user turned up

00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:53,500
to see the red box

00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:59,670
the red box is tracking scripts its

00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:01,980
analytics its retargeting its adverts

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,260
its it's just

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,850
it's disrespect is what that is because

00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:08,400
the user didn't want to see any of that

00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:09,900
a user did not see and if you're on a

00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,880
data plan where you're paying for the

00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,920
data as you use it right you know you're

00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,140
on a travel sim here in Budapest right

00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:18,440
and you've got several euro of data on

00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:21,030
your phone you're paying for all it red

00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,410
so we call it targeting or retargeting

00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,780
we call an analytics you know but it's

00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:26,960
it's kind of just disrespectful right to

00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:31,350
force this upon users who don't want it

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,780
so that's what tag managers are if

00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:35,550
you're running tag managers on your site

00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:37,650
or if you don't know if you are or if

00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:39,240
you want to know more about it speak to

00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:40,800
your marketing team and just ask them

00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,770
are we doing anything like this to our

00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,810
users so ya know your liabilities for

00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:47,550
years we call them assets but they're

00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:49,740
not their liabilities right they've got

00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:51,240
a chance of takers offline so third

00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,730
parties can and will our

00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:57,030
performance a client of mine used a

00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:58,800
client-side a B testing tool client-side

00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:01,290
a/b testing is the devil by the way

00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:04,020
don't do it and what it was doing is it

00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:07,080
was provide it was contributing 98% of

00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:08,910
the runtime overhead so their page 98%

00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,070
of the runtime overhead was ironically

00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:14,130
caused by a tool meant to optimise the

00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:15,000
site if you want to find out this kind

00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:17,190
of stuff

00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,010
in in dev tools you wanna go to

00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:21,870
performance run a profile bottom up and

00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:24,720
then group by domain and it literally

00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,970
lists which domains which the parties

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,900
are causing you the worst performance

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:32,790
problems at runtime so this client weary

00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,410
platform the entire site we rebuilt the

00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:36,780
whole thing and one of our first things

00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:38,340
me and the CTO we decided let's take all

00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,800
the kind of third-party stuff out and

00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:42,420
see how things go so we did we ripped

00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,970
out all the stuff put the site live and

00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,650
because it was a complete rebuild like

00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:48,540
the site didn't look sorry it was a reap

00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,980
lat forming not a redesign the site

00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,870
didn't look any different for the users

00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,310
so we didn't do email campaigns we

00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:55,110
didn't tweet about it because there was

00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:57,270
nothing new for the users to really see

00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:59,970
so what we found out is that purely

00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:05,190
organic traffic two weeks after the

00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:07,560
rebuild the kind of conversions were up

00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:10,020
revenue is up items added

00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,550
that increased time on site had gone

00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,070
down because if you're an e-commerce

00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:16,440
company and you look for a high time on

00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,990
site you're doing it wrong if you owned

00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,310
a real life shop and something spent two

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,200
hours in your shop and left with one

00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:24,330
bottle of water you've you've messed up

00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,950
right so in an e-commerce build time on

00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:27,900
site needs to be low because we don't

00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:31,140
want to trap people where to on let them

00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:32,790
turn up buy stuff disappear so what end

00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,980
up happening is the site was really fast

00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:36,360
and all metrics were up and the

00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,890
marketing team were really impressed and

00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,690
we were glad because we were quite proud

00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,850
of our work and the marketing team said

00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:44,160
can we put an a/b testing tool here to

00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:46,260
make it even better and then the CTO

00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,460
like no no no the only reason it's good

00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,430
now is because we got rid of all that

00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,080
crap like please don't don't do that and

00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:54,300
they dug their heels in and they said

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,390
look we want this tool we need to put it

00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,960
on the site so end up happening is um

00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:03,240
first paint went from 0.8 seconds up to

00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:06,060
2.1 is that yeah two point one the a/b

00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:09,030
testing tool made the site over twice as

00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:12,120
slow right it more than doubled the time

00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:14,010
to first render the site got twice as

00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:15,899
slow because of ironically adding a tool

00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:17,760
isn't meant to optimize it absolutely

00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:19,440
heartbreaking we couldn't really win

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,399
this fight as soon as you have to do

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,850
this kind of stuff you're on the

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,140
backfoot

00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:26,909
but beware of the tools you're using I

00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,980
need to speed up identifying third

00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,350
parties then so this is if you've got

00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:33,000
Chrome with dev tools experiments

00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:36,419
enabled you can find a little thing

00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,909
called network request groups nice

00:34:36,419 --> 00:34:40,169
catchy title and what that allows you is

00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:43,169
group different things going from third

00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:46,320
parties you can also turn on a product

00:34:43,169 --> 00:34:47,970
column hopefully you can like Chrome

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,740
changes so often that sometimes this is

00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:51,419
there sometimes it isn't but the product

00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:53,730
column will literally start listing

00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:56,820
which third parties your site is is

00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,770
requesting so here's the BBC and we

00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,900
noticed some oddities we turned the

00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,370
product column on I hope you can see

00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,110
we've got things from campaign monitor

00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:05,640
things from double-click this really

00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:07,830
starts to demystify where all this stuff

00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:11,100
is coming from right but also we had a

00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:15,000
problem here with a certain third party

00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:17,460
had a 35 second TCP connection right and

00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,770
that was directly linked to the load

00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,870
events the load event was stalled for 35

00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,400
seconds which

00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:24,020
any other important things that happen

00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,670
the load event were delayed by half a

00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,990
minute

00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,150
and we traced it back to this thing

00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:30,860
Rubicon project so identifying third

00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:35,660
parties has become a lot easier in dev

00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:38,960
tools now by using stuff like this so

00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:41,180
yeah being vulnerable third parties can

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,440
and will takers offline I mentioned tag

00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,630
managers they're bad for their own

00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,470
reasons well there's a specific tag

00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,780
manager

00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:49,520
it's a dhobi tag manager but it's not

00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:52,160
specific to Adobe a lot of other third

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,560
parties do this but if your third-party

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,750
ad code or whatever isn't asynchronously

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,910
loaded and that third party has an

00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:01,280
outage it can take you offline for one

00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:05,000
point three minutes that's Chrome's

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,550
built-in timeout so if this retargeting

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,560
Kotler ad code kind of tag manager goes

00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:12,320
offline we go offline for one point

00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,120
three minutes it's a complete white

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,720
screen that's a complete nothingness for

00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:19,100
the user for 80 seconds if you want to

00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:21,020
work out how to do this or you want to

00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,760
audit this yourself stick these IP

00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,830
addresses or this IP address in your

00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:27,230
hosts file basically it's a it's a

00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:28,220
publicly available blackhole server any

00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:29,420
traffic that goes to any of these

00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,860
endpoints will actually get routed

00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,600
through a server where it simulates a

00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,820
full outage again the slides are online

00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,100
so don't worry so yeah don't prioritize

00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,450
prioritize your own metrics over your

00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:40,190
users experiences there's no point

00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:42,020
having a site where you can measure a

00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,690
really accurate data but then none of

00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:46,450
the users can actually access the site

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:48,350
it's a very fine balancing act and

00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:50,360
finally I'm gonna have to really speed

00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:52,480
up measure everything measuring

00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:55,340
everything tells us two important things

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,190
one how do I know what's wrong and two

00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,900
how do I know when I fixed it most times

00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,760
when I'm asked to make a company's

00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,990
website faster they'll just say can you

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,460
make the homepage faster but it's not

00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:06,170
well okay but how do you know the

00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:08,930
homepage is a problem maybe it's a more

00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:11,240
important page furthering in the sort of

00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:12,590
search engine forward world the home

00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,210
page is very rarely an entry point

00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:17,810
anyway you probably land on a different

00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:20,750
page entirely so analytics who's got

00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:22,340
Google Analytics on their site okay who

00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:25,460
hasn't logged into it for like six

00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:27,060
months yeah I think a lot of you are

00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:28,860
lying

00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:30,690
analytics has got some really great

00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,510
information in here you can begin

00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,070
exploring things geographically this is

00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,630
a really huge gift and it will beach

00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:38,460
ball my machine for a few seconds

00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:42,300
because it's it's kind of it's a bit too

00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:44,880
large but um log into analytics behavior

00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:46,800
site speed page timings will start to

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,330
give you an overview of how your page is

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,040
performed on certain days and you can

00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:52,830
cross-reference that with specific URLs

00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,270
specific geographical locales so I work

00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:56,610
this is how I learned about in Nepal

00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:58,320
being a problem area for me and even

00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,910
cross-reference ok visitors from this

00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,860
country to these pages have a really bad

00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,840
time what's different about this page

00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,340
than it is about this other page that's

00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,650
usually quite fast and you can start to

00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,790
identify what the problem might be I've

00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,310
done this with clients before and it's

00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:12,600
been really really valuable work the

00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:14,700
tourism company who thought they needed

00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,870
to optimize for the UK it turns out

00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,520
there are the biggest market was

00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:20,270
Australia and they were the kind of most

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,130
sort of like a little served

00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,720
geographical locale you can

00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:27,870
cross-reference that with a specific

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,970
page for specific countries Brazil here

00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:31,500
turns out Brazil is a real problem area

00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,150
for me so all of the emerging economies

00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,830
we've talked about so far are in the

00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:37,890
East but turns out Brazil is also

00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:39,990
classed as an emerging market in order

00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:41,580
to purchase 500 megabytes of data in

00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:43,920
Brazil you'd have to work for eight

00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,750
point six hours on minimum wage that's

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,700
basically a full day's work on minimum

00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:50,580
wage just to purchase five hundred

00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:52,050
megabytes of data I did a little

00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,090
comparison I mentioned I've got a

00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:58,320
specific travel sim which I use maybe

00:38:54,090 --> 00:39:01,680
20% of the time so at 20% usage over 18

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,530
months I racked up nearly 15 gig of data

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:07,110
usage now for a Brazilian person working

00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:09,480
minimum wage on a postpaid data plan to

00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:12,720
purchase 15 gig they would have to work

00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:15,060
28 days that's basically an entire month

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,370
of your year spent working just for your

00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,900
data plan so when we send all that stuff

00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:21,200
over with tracking codes with tag

00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:25,920
managers we are literally costing people

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:27,570
tangible amounts of money um speed curve

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,730
right so I mentioned measuring the

00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:32,880
before measuring the before told me that

00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:34,410
I had a problem in Brazil so what I did

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,000
is I thought well if the before tells me

00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,770
that bril Brazil's that I'm going to

00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,480
implement a fix I'm gonna measure the

00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,359
after so speed curve allows you to

00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,099
geographically test

00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:43,539
your sight from different different

00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:45,819
parts of the globe

00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:47,920
so Brazil icesat-2 monitoring from there

00:39:45,819 --> 00:39:49,420
and I just pulled my sight like test

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,279
that every day for three months I think

00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,499
this screenshot says and you can quite

00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:56,499
clearly see here that the fixed islands

00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:57,849
have had benefit now this is important

00:39:56,499 --> 00:39:59,739
because we could just fix things blind

00:39:57,849 --> 00:40:00,849
in hope it worked and we don't really

00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:02,619
know we can't prove that it worked

00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:07,180
unless we're measuring absolutely

00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:08,859
everything so uhm duplicate slide here

00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:10,359
we can see that something happened

00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:13,269
something incredible happened on this

00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:16,150
day this is fantastic to take two

00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:17,680
clients managers the business whoever is

00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:19,480
you don't need to be technical to

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,239
understand that something very very good

00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,460
happened on this day so this is the this

00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,380
is the sort of major major benefit of

00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,450
the before and after is because you can

00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,609
start making more business cases say to

00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:32,109
your manager hey look you gave me three

00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:34,660
days to fix a performance issue and I

00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:37,509
can show you measurably the benefit that

00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:39,940
I had and you can use that set budget so

00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:41,799
performance budgets people in management

00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,380
don't like the word budget so it's just

00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:47,859
kind of like monitoring with alerts I

00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:50,739
set my sights up I kind of you know my

00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:53,049
site's fairly typical but I use myself

00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:54,369
as an example because I need to build

00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:56,650
faster websites if I'm gonna convince

00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:58,890
clients to pay any money for it so I've

00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:00,999
got my site set up on speed curve also

00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:03,670
and it's like there's not much going on

00:41:00,999 --> 00:41:05,140
it's a fairly typical website you'll

00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:07,180
find that I mentioned this earlier in

00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:09,700
Ireland gives it my site it'll be fully

00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:11,499
rendered in 1.2 8 seconds right every

00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,670
single day I'm under my allowed budget

00:41:11,499 --> 00:41:14,999
I'd only if you can see there's a really

00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:17,289
faint red line running across like here

00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:19,930
every single day in Ireland I'm under

00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:21,460
budget so I'm doing really well I think

00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:25,480
I'm showing off to a roomful of people

00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:28,359
I'm doing really well fully loaded again

00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,890
I'm under budget every single day just

00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:31,720
by moving over to Brazil exactly the

00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,190
exact same codebase the exact same CD

00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,559
and the exact same infrastructure just

00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:38,499
by visiting from Brazil I'm immediately

00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:40,450
paying a penalty about 50% of the time I

00:41:38,499 --> 00:41:41,980
go over budget and that's not because

00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:44,529
I've built the site badly it's because

00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:46,869
literally being from Brazil you have to

00:41:44,529 --> 00:41:50,019
pay this Geographic penalty where the

00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:51,130
internet is not as good for you again

00:41:50,019 --> 00:41:53,570
similar story with the fully loaded

00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:55,640
event it still goes over budget

00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:58,490
now this isn't even bad this isn't even

00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,740
bad what I did is in speed curve you can

00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:03,650
set up specific profiles so I create a

00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:06,290
profile called very bad Network which is

00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:09,140
a truly terrible network conditioner we

00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:11,450
get 10% packet loss we introduced half a

00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,790
second of latency we only get a down

00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:15,980
speed of 150 kilobytes a second and this

00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:17,450
is what a real sort of 2g connection

00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,240
feels like this is what it would really

00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:22,850
feel like to be that guy's family in

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:26,630
India visiting websites over this like

00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:28,640
Android phone in the corner you can

00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:30,500
barely see it but there's my line for my

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,890
budget right this is what I've got to

00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:36,110
play with and you can see that every

00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:38,840
single day I'm at least doubling my

00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:39,980
budget I'm going way over the other

00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,460
thing you'll notice is there is almost

00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:45,620
zero consistency hope you can see this a

00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:49,010
lot better this is like your Brazil

00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:50,390
Ireland San Francisco kind of speeds as

00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,310
soon as we move to this very bad Network

00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:55,010
this 2g device out in the middle of a

00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:57,740
field there is no consistency you cannot

00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,940
plan around this it's very volatile and

00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,500
it wasn't as I measured it that I

00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,480
realized that can I could look at these

00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,460
three lines and think yeah I'm doing a

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,170
pretty good job it wasn't so I measured

00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:09,950
I realized how much work there is left

00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:12,560
to do so apologies I've gone over but in

00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:14,360
closing care like just actually just

00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,800
want to do it just want to build a

00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,430
faster website it's the easiest way to

00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,510
start is actually care about doing it

00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:23,180
understand as much as you can network

00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:25,840
uses their devices their capabilities

00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,770
and then measure absolutely everything

00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,660
statistics and data you can cross-check

00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:31,460
them it's all true it's all factual I

00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:34,370
just want to say thank you for

00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,820
entertaining me for 43 minutes thank you

00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,820
very much for listening

00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:41,010
