Title: Mindfulness for Developers - Bristol JS - August 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-09
Playlist: Bristol JS
Description: 
	Presented by Arabella Tresilian.

The developerâ€™s brain works hard. Billions of neurons hyperwire to enable the coder to think multidimensionally for hours a day, under complex deadlines, day after day. An understanding of what keeps the brain/mind fresh makes for a more fulfilling and productive career. This interactive session gives participants an overview of neuropsychology for the coding mind, and presents them with a go-to tool for keeping their workplace brain-state healthy, calm and balanced.

About the speaker:

Arabella is a workplace and civil mediator, specialising in conflict prevention and mental health. She is an associate trainer to the charity Mind, leading on corporate workplace wellbeing training for the Bath region, and she's also a certified Mental Health First Aider. Most of her family members seem to be developers now, and she works from the heart of the tech world in Bath, at the Guild Co-Working Hub.

hi everyone it's really lovely to be

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,109
here thank you very much for having me

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:10,880
I've come all the way from Bath Thank

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:14,700
You other Adam for for the invitation to

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:19,680
so my presentation now is on mindfulness

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:22,859
for developers so um I'm here to talk

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,109
about mindfulness as a tool for

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,930
increasing our well-being and supporting

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:31,710
your happiness in your work as a

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:34,140
developer has anyone here got experience

00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,170
of mindfulness or is a is a practitioner

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,559
of mindfulness a little bit a little bit

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:42,180
what can I ask you to share why do you

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,149
practice mindfulness or what does it do

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,399
for you lovely it helps you to relax to

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,260
focus and not to get irritated by the

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,390
little things that pop up in the day and

00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,940
then that's a really good a good summary

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,530
and they say that if there were a pill

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:57,870
for such a thing it would be going out

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,059
of the doors but we can achieve this

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,219
ourselves the thing is that it takes

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,110
just a little bit of practice but the

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,170
upshot is that it increases your

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,909
happiness so here we have some happy

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:14,070
developers look at those the CEO even

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,320
has Joy Division on his t-shirt what is

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,960
not to love you might recognize them

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,710
these are the lovely guys from from

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,070
second and they work in baths and

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,590
they're a happy bunch but for us to

00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:31,829
secure our happiness well things can be

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:34,560
can be tricky can't name this is my

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,720
daughter here Lucia she's a developer

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,329
and she's taught me an awful lot about

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,579
developing I'm not a developer but I

00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,369
work surrounded by them and she's taught

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,110
me a lot about mindfulness now the thing

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,439
that Lucia and I have in common apart

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:54,049
from blood and jeans and so on is that

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,729
we have a similar makeup of brain so um

00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:58,920
when this year was about 12 and she

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,320
speaks about this publicly so hopefully

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,590
she's happy for me to say we identified

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,110
that her gifts were because her brain

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:11,220
was differently wired she has Asperger's

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,000
syndrome and it took only about two

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,840
years to

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,300
realize that she got it from me and so

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,700
we investigated Asperger's syndrome

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,220
which is a form of autism and we really

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:28,010
started to understand what it means in

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:30,720
terms of neurology now this is a

00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:33,750
neurotypical brain and this is the brain

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,480
of a high profile profile woman with

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,900
Asperger's room syndrome called Temple

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,120
Grandin now I'm not saying that my brain

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,060
is wired like that but what you can see

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,520
is that with Asperger's you're leaning

00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,489
towards a lot of neurological activity

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,130
and the thing that had happened for both

00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:55,350
Lucia and I is that we had found that we

00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,450
were very reactive and that we were very

00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,480
sensitive to what was going on in life

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,959
and in our environments but also that we

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,720
had a certain aptitude for focus as well

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,400
for Lucia it developed in her into her

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,060
being a brilliant coder she became a

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:16,049
full-time coder at the age of 18 but it

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,660
set us to thinking about what sort of

00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,269
environments and practices help our

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,989
brain to feel calm and to feel settled

00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:27,510
so that it can do its best work and

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:29,970
that's really when I came into

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,970
practicing mindfulness I went off and I

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,950
did an eight-week well once a week

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:39,330
eight-week mindfulness based cognitive

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:42,750
therapy cause now I should say that this

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:46,049
was only seven years ago that I got my

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,959
diagnosis up until that point I had been

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:51,870
plagued by mental health difficulties I

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,630
had moderate to severe mental health

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,910
difficulties since the age of 16 so

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,430
actually the investigations that we were

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,040
doing started to shine a light on how

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,680
things could be very different

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,049
it was the mindfulness that made more

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,390
difference to my life than anything else

00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:13,920
so that's why I'm here to share it with

00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:16,229
other people to encourage people to find

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,620
out how their brain works your brain may

00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:22,260
or may not work like this but to learn

00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,780
how in the work space and in the home

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,830
space to work with our brains so that it

00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:29,909
can give of our bare

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:32,789
just learning about my brain made me

00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:34,020
re-evaluate life I stopped doing the

00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:36,810
work I've been doing which was

00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,689
management consulting too much changed

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,840
too much movement and I practiced one

00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:45,389
solo thing which was conflict resolution

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,250
I trained as a mediator you may not

00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:50,909
think that that is a peaceful space to

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:55,939
go into but it uses my natural aptitude

00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:58,979
for wanting peace and resolution and

00:04:55,939 --> 00:05:01,259
that's why I also trained mental health

00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:03,180
in the workplace as well because I

00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:09,569
understand that when we're collaborating

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:12,180
together it can be intense so I want to

00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:13,889
challenge this rather ironic cartoon

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,680
that says why there is no such thing as

00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:19,020
a happy developer so how long would a

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,539
Twitter module take to develop I would

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:24,029
hazard a guess and say about four weeks

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:27,090
I think excellent we're demoing to a

00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:29,490
client next Friday so I don't know if

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,129
this is familiar to you but sometimes

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:36,180
when we're trying to work with other

00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:39,300
people they can bring certain challenges

00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,419
into our environment and this guy is

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,779
looking pretty unhappy about the

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,909
situation and we might imagine well what

00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:51,150
might he be thinking at that moment it

00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:52,710
might take longer yeah so he's like yeah

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:57,240
yeah I can do it in four weeks he's now

00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:59,699
got four days or something sorry he was

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,979
just being nice okay so what sort of

00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:05,729
state is his mind in and now being told

00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:07,289
that they're demoing on Friday what

00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:12,330
Adams saying is he's not in the most

00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:14,310
peaceful frame of mind yeah so the

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,009
likelihood is that when somebody else

00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:21,599
because when we're in working in teams

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:23,940
developing we're not always in control

00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:26,250
of our own schedules right so when

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:30,150
somebody else suddenly ups the ante then

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:32,520
well sometimes it's just time to go hard

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:35,039
at it isn't it you're like okay we're

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,950
Deming on Friday okay so our mind goes

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:42,070
into a very active state

00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,270
our hands do the same so I want us to

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,400
take a minute please

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:50,530
and I want you to look at your hands

00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:52,120
right now okay and I want you to

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:57,250
consider the extraordinary work that

00:06:52,120 --> 00:07:00,940
they did today and I want you to reflect

00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:03,640
on how they are the bridge between your

00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,370
brilliant brain and the incredible

00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:10,030
credibly focused work that you do at

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:13,420
your computer marvel at them now please

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:16,360
place your hands if you wish to just

00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:19,120
reverently respectfully on your lap and

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,790
feel them there maybe there on your

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,950
thighs or maybe there nestled one in the

00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:26,500
other but keep consciousness of where

00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,330
your hands are and keep thinking about

00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,820
what they've done for you today what

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:33,220
they the the amazing coding that you

00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:36,940
maybe did today and how brilliant they

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:39,010
are so now I'd like to invite you

00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,850
without awareness of your hands if you

00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:45,160
feel like it to let your eyes close very

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,320
gently if you don't feel like that you

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:51,730
keep them open or lowered or you can

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:54,730
even look at their hands here so now in

00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:57,250
this state I want you to focus on each

00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:59,020
of your fingers and maybe you start with

00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,780
a little finger of the right hand and

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,810
you just press it and then the next

00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:08,020
finger along the ring finger and then

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:12,400
the middle finger and then the the

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:15,130
pointing finger and the thumb and in

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:20,710
your own time probably even more slowly

00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:22,780
now move on to the other hand keeping

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:25,110
focus on your hands and I'm gonna leave

00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:28,740
you there for maybe 10 seconds just

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,740
focusing on your hands

00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:44,250
thank you gently thank your hands and

00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:47,580
you can open your eyes so I'd like to

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:51,990
ask you what happened there is there

00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:53,820
anything that you notice notice Thanks

00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,680
thank you for noticing this new notice

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:58,950
you're noticing it has been noted what

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:03,870
did you note or notice in that very

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:07,920
small exercise what did you notice about

00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:09,930
your fingertips that they tingled okay

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,100
was that because you were focusing on

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,360
them or do you think they focus they

00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:17,400
tingle the whole time we're just not

00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:18,630
aware of it who knows they who knows but

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,950
there is something about when we bring

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,830
our attention to any part of our body

00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,450
the tingling is often part of what

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,800
happens and in fact any of you who

00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,950
practice Qigong knows that that's

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,720
something that can be directed what else

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,950
happened what happened in your mind when

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,910
you were focusing on your hands

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:39,440
particularly when I was quiet nothing

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,940
for nothing

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,030
fantastic so was there did you get a

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,680
sense of stillness excellent did

00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:50,339
everyone have complete stillness and

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:54,170
silence in their mind yeah did anyone

00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:56,970
perhaps have a thought pass through oh

00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:00,450
my god I've reached the room of Zen this

00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,890
this is fantastic you might find or you

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:04,920
might have found that if we left it a

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:07,050
bit longer if I'd said okay I'm going to

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,180
leave you here for 10 minutes just focus

00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:13,020
on your hands that thoughts might have

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:16,290
come up and the point is that our mind

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,630
is constantly trying to give us things

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,470
to think about but when we give it space

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,640
to be quiet

00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:26,100
it does relax into it but if we don't

00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,980
give it time to be quiet and we don't

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:31,770
give it the opportunity to to stop and

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,930
slow down by for example focusing on

00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:36,150
some part of our body as opposed to

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:41,130
what's out in the world then it can race

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:45,390
on and race on and race on so what even

00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:46,620
is mindfulness well I would like to oh I

00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,750
don't know if we've got a speaker on

00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,980
here she's got a speaker yes

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:54,180
actually I don't think it needs one

00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,740
because this is this is visual okay I'd

00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:14,160
like you to have a little look at this

00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:16,500
if it plays you may not be surprised to

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,130
discover that in this metaphor your

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,050
brain is this guy okay and the cars and

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,730
the pedestrians and the traffic are all

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,580
the tasks that you're dealing with that

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,630
you're responding to across the day your

00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:33,780
brain your mind is awesome admit

00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:35,910
whoo-hoo it can do great tricks and I

00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,890
think as developers the tricks that you

00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:42,060
pull out of the bag on a daily basis are

00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:45,030
exceptional but imagine if this guy was

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:49,550
dancing all day long what would happen

00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:56,250
to him yes he would eventually conk out

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:58,500
so so when in our daily work there's a

00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,589
lot coming to us each task like the car

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,290
or the bike needs to be responded to and

00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:08,250
reacted to and when our brain gets very

00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:10,530
tired then sometimes we seek to try and

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:14,580
switch it off and on again but unlike

00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:18,000
our computers that ain't so easy so

00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:21,420
mindfulness is a practice of learning to

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,420
give the brain a rest and when you do it

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:27,210
on a daily basis or even a weekly basis

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,930
when you open up for yourself for your

00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:33,420
mind this idea that it can rest purely

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,910
completely rest and not have to respond

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,970
or react to anything it starts to get

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:45,360
stronger in the way that it responds to

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:47,490
daily tasks in our life so there is an

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,120
app which many of you may have come

00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:54,780
across which is called headspace so

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,230
headspace is an app which starts us off

00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,920
with ten-minute mediha meditations so

00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:02,400
what's the difference between

00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,610
mindfulness and meditation meditation is

00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,700
a

00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:09,180
definite activity mindfulness is

00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:12,209
definitely a state of being apps like

00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:15,810
like headspace take us through maybe a

00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:18,540
10 a 20 or 30 minute guided meditation

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:21,209
but you can have a mindful experience

00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:24,120
just by the way that you walk along the

00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:26,459
street clearing your mind of thinking

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:30,269
and just observing what's going on about

00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:32,430
you and feeling your body mindfulness

00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:35,310
can be about stopping putting your hands

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:38,670
on your lap and focusing on them to give

00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:41,390
your mind a break the relationship

00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:44,160
between the mind and the body is very a

00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:46,519
very important one for developing a

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,240
mindful state of mind

00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:52,459
so why train your brain in this way

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:58,740
let's have a little bit of brain science

00:13:52,459 --> 00:14:00,209
ok in your brain you've got something

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,180
called we've all got something called

00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:05,579
the amygdala now certainly for me being

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,019
on the autism spectrum my amygdala is

00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:09,540
slightly more reactive than a

00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:14,449
neurotypical one and that's unfortunate

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:18,510
because as you can see here the the the

00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:21,240
yes it's here the amygdala is linked to

00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,050
what is the system that relates to fight

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,070
or flight

00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:28,949
so our amygdala is the bit that responds

00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:31,110
when there's a threat so that guy that

00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:33,990
we saw in the earlier cartoon when he

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,550
was told were demoing on Friday if he's

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:37,440
feeling nervous about it

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,329
then his amygdala lights up and it goes

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,160
I know what to do about this I'm gonna

00:14:39,329 --> 00:14:43,079
send you adrenalin I'm gonna send you

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,170
cortisol and I'm gonna have you going

00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:50,250
into that Jim Carrey frenzy at the

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:52,110
computer but if this happens

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,000
time after time then we get what's

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,579
called an amygdala hijack we're so

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,250
sensitized that somebody says right can

00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:02,010
you just do this one last thing and we

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:05,010
can respond in a sometimes in an

00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:06,839
explosive manner or sometimes with so

00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:10,140
much anxiety that we start to withdraw

00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:12,449
and retreat and that's when things like

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,890
depression can start to happen so we

00:15:12,449 --> 00:15:16,589
really want to

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:21,600
work with our amygdala so that we we

00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:25,589
know how to how to slow it down when we

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,029
go into the inter meditation we're

00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:29,880
moving from what's called the

00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:32,760
sympathetic brain state which is the one

00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,310
that's ruled by the amygdala into the

00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,320
parasympathetic brain brain state and

00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,810
that's the one that you have to write

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,649
rest and digest so instead of waiting to

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,329
go to sleep

00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:48,899
we're triggering that sometime during

00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:53,760
the day so now I'd like you to take a

00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:57,110
moment to visualize yourself at your

00:15:53,760 --> 00:16:03,060
screen everyone else has gone home

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:05,910
you're still working but gently over a

00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,459
few minutes the lights start going down

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:12,540
and you can just see yourself a

00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:13,950
reflection of yourself in your screen so

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,980
I'd like you to close your eyes just for

00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:20,970
a second and visualize yourself just the

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:23,100
reflection of yourself in the screen so

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:25,920
in this image you're looking at yourself

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,680
in the screen and you take a big shrug

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,899
and you see your shoulders go off and

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,730
you go to and then they go down and then

00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,459
you see the outline of your body

00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:40,890
breathing and it's breathing quite quite

00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:44,040
it's a jerky fashion but over time you

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:46,860
watch that image and you see it's

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,660
starting to breathe more smoothly and as

00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,240
you're visualizing this please breathe

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,699
in time with that vision that you see on

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,310
the screen and feel the breath going

00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:58,829
into your body filling your belly and

00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:01,110
going out again and you've got a

00:16:58,829 --> 00:17:02,730
sensation of the visual in front of you

00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:04,500
but also more and more you've got a

00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:07,589
sense of the breathing going on in your

00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:12,959
belly and what you might start to feel

00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:17,189
is the feeling of sand settling in water

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,350
and that is the mindful state it's the

00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:20,130
state where the relaxation starts to

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,680
happen

00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,530
and as you take one more mindful breath

00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:29,280
after another you're entering the

00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:31,290
parasympathetic state so many chemical

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,400
changes are happening in your body right

00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:39,240
now as you decommission your amygdala

00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:43,770
and you allow your whole neural system

00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:47,250
to calm and to steady your now studying

00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:50,670
the vagal nerve and your body knows what

00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:53,120
to do in this state so I'm going to

00:17:50,670 --> 00:18:01,170
leave you there for maybe five seconds

00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:06,120
and just focus on that breathing thank

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:07,820
you and open your eyes so maybe now

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,460
you've done two minutes of meditation

00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:13,050
this is really what it's all about what

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,480
are the benefits of training your brain

00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:19,020
in this way well I'm going to tell you

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,420
there are many there are reasons why

00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:23,760
ninja warriors spend a heck of a lot of

00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:27,360
time meditating and not very much time

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:30,630
fighting because when you have meditated

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,810
you're able to respond with much more

00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:36,480
precision and much more efficacy your

00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:38,550
brain sees everything much more slowly

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,910
and is able to make the right move at

00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:44,460
the right moment you're able to make

00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,890
better decisions because you've got a

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,070
capacity for attending to what matters

00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:52,590
your mind is not full your mind form

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:56,300
you're poised to be able to take the

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,300
choices that you want in your daily life

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:12,040
so just somebody mindfulness makes you

00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:15,460
very patient should somebody swoop in

00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:19,270
and on your work then you've got

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:22,179
more capacity for responding rather than

00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:24,640
reacting this definitely I thanked my

00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:27,549
daughter for oh yes you've got dimension

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,290
see gulling and also squirreling my

00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:31,360
understanding is that this is when a

00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:34,210
story is snuck into the work that you're

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:37,570
doing by your manager you're able to

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,400
take on more rather than think oh my god

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,710
if they stop one more nut at me I'm

00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,990
gonna explode it doesn't mean that you

00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:46,210
have to do everything but you're able to

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:49,179
react in the way that you would like to

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:51,520
including perhaps negotiating more time

00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:55,020
or to be able to say calmly and

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,640
assertively I'm not able to do that

00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:01,299
impostor syndrome that concern that we

00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,700
might have about not knowing as much as

00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:05,799
we think we should do that settles

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:09,610
because the amygdala and the ego are

00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:11,620
very closely related so we're able to

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,720
get out of the egoic state and be more

00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:15,429
free and more open to be able to say

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,490
this is what I know what I don't know

00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:21,490
and be comfortable but really what's

00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:25,650
important is that in doing a practice

00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:29,290
like this we're going to prevent burnout

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:31,360
so anyone can become exhausted what is

00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:33,280
so poignant about burnout is that it

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,559
mainly strikes people who are highly

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,660
committed to their work you can only

00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:38,860
burn out if you've been at a light in

00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:44,140
the first place

00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:46,480
so in undertaking this act of mental

00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:48,580
self-care you're allowing yourself to

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,179
keep animated you're allowing yourself

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,650
to Kindle the passion that may be

00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:55,030
started you and your career or started

00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:59,230
you at the beginning of the day or the

00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:01,780
week so how to get started as a mindful

00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:03,790
developer there are lots of ways you've

00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:07,780
already got started just today and those

00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:10,720
two minutes of practice so you can use a

00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:12,790
headspace app for example or many others

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,090
headspace is free to start off with

00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:18,340
it's a subscription I want to give you

00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,750
that as a recommendation if it's

00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,730
somewhere that you would like to start

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,410
but there are lots of others this is

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,690
just one that's really tried and tested

00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:30,640
and that you can download and use at any

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:32,320
time you can read books I've got one of

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:37,530
them here this is a kind of classic on

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,530
mindfulness and it has a CD at the back

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:44,290
as I mentioned the relationship between

00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,140
body and mind is crucial move your body

00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:49,630
your brain and your mind really love it

00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,780
so this is one way of doing it but

00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:55,650
really the best thing to do is to get

00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:59,890
outside as often as you can

00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:02,980
being mindful in nature is good stuff

00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,900
nature begs us to be mindful the

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:08,320
environment is begging us to be more

00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:11,800
mindful nature itself is mindful so sit

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,240
by a tree get by sand running water and

00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,380
that will help you get into that

00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,060
parasympathetic state this is really

00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,190
about our mental health as well as our

00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:24,280
professional success and well-being so

00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:27,910
these are from the economics foundation

00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,830
five ways to well-being one is to

00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:31,750
connect with other people talk and

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,970
listen sometimes when we've been mindful

00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:35,800
we're able to say yeah I can slow down

00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:39,010
and there's time for me to talk to other

00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:42,460
people be active get outside move your

00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:44,110
body take notice this is really what

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,180
mindfulness is about it's about taking

00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:47,530
our attention back for ourselves and

00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,970
being able to place it where we would

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,530
like it and where it's going to fill our

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:55,270
heart and our souls keep learning and

00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:57,600
also give of your time your words and

00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,890
your presence

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,890
there's lots out there in terms of

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,780
self-care for developers and I wanted to

00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,540
use this word because mindfulness is

00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,640
about self-care all of us are under

00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:12,130
pressure in our work and our home lives

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,940
and learning to love ourselves and take

00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:16,900
care of ourselves is so important

00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:20,650
similarly there are some really great

00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:22,660
bodies like Azmi which is open sourcing

00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,250
mental illness this is changing how we

00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,419
talk about mental health in the tech

00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,249
community there's great material

00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:32,690
where you can learn but you can also

00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:36,320
share but really what I'm here to say is

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:38,629
wow you guys have amazing brains so love

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,850
your brain and treat it well and it will

00:23:38,629 --> 00:23:43,369
look after you yeah that's a beautiful

00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:46,309
question so Adam said is if about living

00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:50,119
in the now very much so

00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:52,609
so the mind has a tendency to tell

00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:54,440
stories so it wants to go to the future

00:23:52,609 --> 00:23:56,809
it's worrying about what you're gonna do

00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,730
next or it wants to go over the past

00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:00,859
like what she said to me and he said to

00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:03,259
me or did I make a mistake or oh my god

00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:05,299
I embarrassed myself but when were in

00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:08,629
the future or the past then we're kind

00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:09,919
of wearing it often in a state of angst

00:24:08,629 --> 00:24:12,830
or we're trying to move one way or the

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,049
other so yeah absolutely that practice

00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,840
of focusing our attention on what really

00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:22,129
is like our hands or our breathing or

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:24,919
the trees around us frees us from that

00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:26,899
future or past thinking and ultimately

00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:29,090
yeah we're in the now we're actually

00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:30,789
there's nothing to say there's nothing

00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:38,450
to think about things can be peaceful

00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:43,940
yeah thank you yeah yeah thank you

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:47,600
um I practice in the mornings so I take

00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:49,820
a coffee tea no I take a coffee back to

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,320
bed and I read something which is

00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,529
calming which is inspiring

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:57,379
I personally meditate in bed so it might

00:24:54,529 --> 00:25:00,320
be with an app or it might be with a

00:24:57,379 --> 00:25:02,869
YouTube video something relaxing or a

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,299
guided meditation I I like to kind of

00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:07,909
change it up quite a lot and I will

00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:11,419
normally meditate for 10 or 15 minutes

00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:13,580
if I hear it 20 that's great something

00:25:11,419 --> 00:25:15,919
special happens after 30 minutes I'm

00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,169
gonna leave you with that idea it really

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,059
does and then I get out of bed and I

00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:22,220
practice about 10 minutes of chicken

00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:24,259
sometimes with a YouTube video

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,879
I've been studying Qigong for many years

00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:27,649
so that's the kind of light that's

00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:30,470
moving meditation in the sense but it

00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:31,279
also stretches out my body yeah so in

00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,350
the mornings good for me

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,029
evenings I tend to fall asleep Michael

00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:36,770
was just saying that he meditates in the

00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:40,010
morning and in the evening

00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:42,080
maybe on the bus as well and that you

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:43,580
said that in that practice you are NDErs

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,309
able to understand what the problem is

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:48,290
more clearly this is a really good thing

00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:50,960
because people think oh well it's just

00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:52,669
zoning out I said you know what were

00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,340
there any thoughts and Adam said no

00:25:52,669 --> 00:25:57,980
what's beautiful is that after some

00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,230
extended time often you get clarity

00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:03,290
about problems that you couldn't solve

00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:05,270
or you get inspiration insight so the

00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:07,520
other thing I do with my morning

00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:10,760
meditation is I journal because man I

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,620
get some good ideas ah you know towards

00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,260
the end of my meditation and I'm happy

00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,919
to note those down so yeah thanks

00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:18,320
Michael

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,700
so the question was how how how long do

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,320
you need to practice before you see the

00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,780
benefits and my course saying well from

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,660
the very first time and I think I would

00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:29,360
say so with the headspace app I think

00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,980
they give you 10 I think it's sort of

00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,020
like get going with 10 sessions or

00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,730
something like that and so I committed

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:38,570
to those 10 sessions and by the end of

00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:40,220
10 days a streak of 10 days oh my god

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,530
this is amazing

00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:44,660
and I was definitely noticing the

00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:47,059
difference I probably needed a good ten

00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:50,000
days I needed the the inspiration and

00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:53,299
motivation to commit to 10 days to see

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,790
the benefit and for it to become a bit

00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:59,660
of a habit so yeah someday somewhere

00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:01,100
between one time and maybe 10 days and

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,020
then you're you'll start to see for

00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:06,080
yourself so the question was contains

00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:08,650
integrate this so one I would say is

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,880
have having a culture and environment

00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:13,280
where it's okay to talk about

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,080
mindfulness the state of mind and our

00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,940
well-being that might encourage

00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,350
individuals themselves to feel that

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,460
within the group they can do it they can

00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:22,160
talk about it

00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:25,910
but there are you know way any ways in

00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:27,860
which a team can be mindful together of

00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:30,049
it's very powerful because there's

00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,700
something I would say energetically that

00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:32,210
happens when people get very still

00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,370
together

00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:38,210
so it's really depends on what the team

00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:41,780
is and you know it might be that it's

00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:44,570
about going for a walk together but they

00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:47,540
you know group meditation is it is is

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:48,890
powerful it's bonding it's powerful and

00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,440
because there's some trust and

00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:51,509
vulnerability

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,200
in there as well so it would depend on

00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:56,639
each team I yeah grave definitely and I

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,710
think you know there certain people have

00:27:56,639 --> 00:28:00,659
written about running as definitely a

00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,129
form of meditation because the brain

00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:04,740
there's something about the endorphins

00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:06,809
as well it gets us into a good state but

00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,659
the repetitive action and I think as

00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:12,240
long as one can allow the mind to sink

00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:15,029
into a vague Association and attention

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,299
on perhaps the feet or the movement and

00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:20,370
allow thoughts to go away then you're in

00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:22,289
a mindful state aren't you as long as

00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:25,019
that bike ride is not chanting around

00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:27,029
like you know in the mind but people can

00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:28,710
meditate sit for thirty minutes and

00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:31,320
they're not meditating there Chum train

00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:34,259
so if we can just gently take our mind

00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:37,049
very compassionately and say yeah it's

00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:39,179
fine just just to focus on the movement

00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:42,240
of the bike or to focus on the sound of

00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:47,149
my feet and let the thoughts go and come
