Title: Mindfulness for Developers - Bristol JS - August 2018
Publication date: 2018-09-09
Playlist: Bristol JS
Description: 
	Presented by Arabella Tresilian.

The developerâ€™s brain works hard. Billions of neurons hyperwire to enable the coder to think multidimensionally for hours a day, under complex deadlines, day after day. An understanding of what keeps the brain/mind fresh makes for a more fulfilling and productive career. This interactive session gives participants an overview of neuropsychology for the coding mind, and presents them with a go-to tool for keeping their workplace brain-state healthy, calm and balanced.
