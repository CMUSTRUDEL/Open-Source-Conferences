	Debugging CSS Grid by Michelle Barker

CSS Grid gives us incredible powers for building web layouts. But with so many different ways to create a grid and place items, it’s not always easy to debug when layouts don’t behave as we expect them to. In this talk we’ll tackle some common difficulties, check out some tools for debugging and put the CSS Grid specification under the microscope.
