	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
so yeah I'm going to talk about prettier

00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:05,970
something you may have used it it's only

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,970
been around for about a year so it's

00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,550
quite new I'll go in a bit more about

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,170
what it does in a minute so I've just

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,059
started a relatively new role at a

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,039
company called immersive labs we deliver

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,520
cyber security training via an online

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:24,060
application we are hiring so if anyone

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:27,060
is if anyone's a JavaScript developer or

00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,740
even a ruby developer and/or a ruby

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,720
developer then please do you come and

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,219
pester me afterwards or give us a

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,500
message at some point in the future this

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,110
is where we start the fight I have to

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,120
polish it there may be an excess of cat

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,469
gifts in this presentation as well I got

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,870
a bit carried away with deciding how to

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,610
how to do it so yeah we're gonna have a

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,960
bit of a battle first

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,820
so tabs versus spaces and single quotes

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,399
versus double quotes in one line versus

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:58,170
multi line let's have a little show of

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:59,309
hands who would format this a and who

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:07,229
would format this piece so let's have

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:08,960
the A's first let's have B okay maybe

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,990
one of you would go B that's so cool

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,350
this you all correct this is everyone

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,820
wins

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:20,250
there isn't a C option as yet no

00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,299
semicolon yeah okay interesting okay how

00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:28,130
about oh sorry oh how about this one we

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,360
got so all on one line at the top and

00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:33,829
you know all your options on multi lines

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,390
at the bottom let's go

00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:36,630
okay that's true that's a little typo

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,920
there

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:43,170
eagle-eyed I like it let's pretend there

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,729
is four although actually it's a valid

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,020
entry an interesting point as well there

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,329
are more at the bottom so would we

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,520
format it differently if there's more or

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:56,250
less so but for the sake of argument

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,500
let's go with option a and option B okay

00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,790
interesting so I mean again we've got

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,810
some of the differences there as you

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,210
know there's a trading comma at the

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,880
bottom on the last option there's not a

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,140
trading comma at the top they do all

00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,209
have semicolons we've heard about not

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,649
semicolons already so you know again

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:12,630
we're having all these discussions and

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,610
and we're yourself down

00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,830
so you know we've been fitting a single

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,140
multi-line we didn't really talk about

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,610
parentheses so would we have a space we

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,960
know within the parentheses within the

00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,340
OREA we know within the curly brackets

00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,500
as well before the curly brackets after

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,970
the curly brackets there's quite a lot

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,710
of options so we could talk about terms

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,750
tabs versus spaces me and Adam briefly

00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,130
had a little discussion about before we

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,750
started this and then you know if you go

00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,210
spaces do you do two spaces do you do

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,640
four spaces single quotes or double

00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:41,340
quotes there's quite a lot of decisions

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,800
to be made as we're going along and of

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,790
course the magic option C which we're

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:49,560
all thinking about really is who cares

00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:53,940
right this stuffed actually just isn't

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,620
important but that's interesting you

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,080
know it doesn't actually matter right

00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,130
this is a very exasperated cat he's been

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,500
dealing with a lot of the workers all

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,500
day and he's you fella for all the

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,760
arguments about tabs versus spaces so

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,650
what if we're not going to care about

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,340
how our code looks what should we be

00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,920
caring about and really it's how it

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,480
works it's the impact to the end-user

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,680
it's time efficiency every time we stop

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,060
to think she'll I put a new line here

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,770
should have her they be putting a space

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,390
in the parenthesis should I be using

00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:24,360
single quotes or double quotes

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,520
should I be tabbing or spacing setting

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,440
up my AR editor to do what the rest of

00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,060
the team are doing it's all just wasted

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,430
time we're slowing ourselves down

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,380
writing code that at the end of the day

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,830
is to clearly declared turned into ones

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,820
and zeros for you know machine code and

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,440
you know that comes down to really what

00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,850
I kind of referred to as keeping our

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,950
flow well you know what to be focusing

00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,380
on just writing code that works well and

00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:51,210
souls problems fixes our tests you know

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:52,920
our test suite we shouldn't be worried

00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:56,430
about how code looks I mean that's

00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:58,080
ridiculous right if we spend all day

00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:59,430
looking you know think about how our

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,420
code looks we're not gonna get anywhere

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,660
we're not going to end up you know

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:04,500
writing code that works how it looks

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,120
doesn't have any effect on our

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,470
functionality and as we've seen we yeah

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,460
we can end up talking about this all

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,510
night we could you know we could be

00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,620
talking about we should be using single

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,510
quotes and double quotes and if you've

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,440
got a team maybe even the size and

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,970
number of people in here who've got a

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,410
big team that's a lot of discussions to

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,950
be had with a lot of people and you know

00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:26,370
we could end up wasting wasting days so

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:29,610
ah missing a cat gif

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,990
sorry I can see it at mine there's a

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,690
nice little one of ugh man hurting lots

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:34,710
of cats into spaces they're herding cats

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,760
it's my favorite one and it hasn't

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,040
worked but there we go

00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,729
so within a team code consistency is

00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,960
important and within a big project you

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:46,590
know if we're opening lots of different

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,600
files anytime we come to that code it

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,520
should look the same and that's why how

00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,380
code looks is important that's where it

00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,229
really is important if you've got 20

00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,430
developers working on the same code base

00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,840
when you open it up you want it to look

00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,729
the same for one developer is another

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,560
developer and you want everyone to be

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:06,000
used to how that code looks so what is

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,110
prettier I haven't really talked about

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,229
this thing prettier which is what my

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,340
talks about like I say fruit has been

00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:16,740
around for about a year now just over

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,080
their number one goal is to stop this

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,610
discussion about code formatting and how

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,080
we should format code you know single

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:26,460
quotes double quotes all that sort of

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:29,160
thing it ensures all of your code

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,270
conforms to a standard you know style

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:35,400
guide so that it always looks the same

00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:38,789
and I mean not only really talked about

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,349
it in in terms of JavaScript it does

00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:44,760
actually work on all sorts of languages

00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:48,180
so JavaScript flow typescript CSS less s

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,289
CSS graph QL markdown and like I say

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,520
it's early days for this programming

00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:53,840
language so I think you're just need to

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,760
continue to get more and more support

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,650
it's an opinionated code formatter and

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:02,699
that word is really important

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,889
opinionated it essentially a pines what

00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:06,660
your code is gonna look like it takes

00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:10,289
all of the decision-making away from you

00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:16,229
your team anyone else involved it's up

00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:18,510
to prettier how your code looks so so

00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:22,710
you know why would we use prettier well

00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:23,880
it's fully automatic so I'll come on to

00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:26,070
something like here Flint in a minute

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,260
but I don't know if you use that but it

00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:29,580
has got a fixed method but it's not

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,229
always automatic and I'd say they spend

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,490
time going back through formatting code

00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:36,690
to get it to accept my arguments it's

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:39,510
supported in lots of text editors as

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:40,840
well you can you can install plug-ins

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:48,110
for atom

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:50,810
phim vs code visual studio it's great

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,610
for onboarding as well just think if we

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,260
stop worrying you know when you've got a

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,580
new developer on board or or a junior

00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,010
developer on board who's only been you

00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,449
know learning to code for a few months

00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:02,240
as soon as you take that stress out you

00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:03,949
know just this team do single quotes

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,300
double quotes should I be putting

00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:07,490
everything on one line two lines should

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,360
I be putting you know extra spaces in

00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,580
here should I be doing

00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,940
you know spaces within parentheses or

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:16,850
not as soon as you can say we don't care

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,040
to do what you want you've taken that

00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,450
level of stress away I made onboarding

00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,950
much easier for any developers you get

00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,360
into a team that's much easier for

00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,600
anyone that's new to developing that's

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,350
much easier it's really easy to

00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,490
integrate to your to your workflow and

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,990
none of this changing a formatting has

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,880
any effect on your functionality so

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,919
anything for a few does to your code

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,600
it's not going to break it you're not

00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:40,760
suddenly gonna have you know bugs

00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,840
creeping into your code because it's put

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,220
something on a design that shouldn't

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,710
done it's you know intelligent enough

00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:51,650
not to introduce any weird characters or

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:52,880
odd markup that you shouldn't expect we

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,370
haven't really shown how it works and

00:07:52,880 --> 00:08:02,000
this is just sort of a quick gift I

00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:03,200
found of someone using it so you can

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,050
essentially see he's doing some

00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,460
refactoring here he's moving a function

00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,710
to his own you know out of the render

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,320
function he's writing some really pretty

00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:14,270
awful code there's no consent formatting

00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,770
and then prettier turns it into you know

00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:21,919
one line there he's putting it back in

00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:25,479
and it's saying that's you know doesn't

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,130
it right so it's putting it like that

00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:31,400
and another one this isn't the biggest

00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,539
gift so Paula G's for my beard to look

00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,750
but again you can essentially see this

00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:38,150
just automatically rearranging I load a

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:43,580
bad code to a much more readable much

00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:44,810
more consistent form of code so how do

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,360
we use it well

00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:50,060
like I say you can put it into your text

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,360
editor you can install a plugin for a to

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,200
more vs code and you can write the code

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,820
her v1 you

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,170
single quotes double quotes but spaces

00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,600
where you want them new lines where you

00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:02,300
want them and when you press save it

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,890
will go through an and format it that's

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,390
not actually my favorite way of using it

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:09,010
but it is a quick way to see how it

00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:11,300
works and kind of get a feel for it I

00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,460
find that if I every time I press save

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,660
my code formatting changes it gets a

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,890
little bit distracting and I can lose

00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:21,980
where I am you can do it for a get hook

00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:23,330
and you can set this up with I use

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,300
something called husky which is an NPM

00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:28,430
module that the managers all you get

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,190
hooks so you can you well I mean by get

00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:34,520
hookers you can say pre commit or pre

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:37,670
push say before I do a commit or after I

00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:41,030
do a commit do a thing and that thing in

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:42,260
this case would be prettier so you can

00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:45,290
just write your code however you want

00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,490
get it working really ignore how your

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:48,110
code looks don't worry about your new

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,990
lines whether you've got tabs you know

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,790
your indentation all that sort of thing

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:55,130
commit your code and then when it

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:56,570
commits it'll pretty all go through and

00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,730
automatically just rewrite your code for

00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,500
you without you having to look at it and

00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,690
then just next time you come back to

00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,470
your files they won't look how they were

00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:08,870
when you left them they'll be formatted

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:11,810
and just hearing that you might think

00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:14,300
that's really annoying and it kind of

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:18,590
can be it can be a bit weird coming to a

00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:21,020
file and not recognizing where you left

00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,550
it off be quite quickly get over that

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,170
you can quickly get used to the way that

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,090
pretty is going to format things and

00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:28,700
what's really important is that

00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:31,280
regardless of whether it's how you look

00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,080
how you remember it when you last left

00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:35,330
it its how the other people in your team

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,740
are gonna see it so they've never seen

00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,180
the code you've written before but when

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,010
they come back to a bit of code that's

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,330
been formatted by prettier it's going to

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:43,100
look exactly like they would expect it

00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,510
to look there's gonna be spaces where

00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,530
they're used to seeing spaces there can

00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,120
be new lines where they're seeing gliese

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,350
you're seeing in your lines and it's

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,390
gonna be indented how they're used to

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:55,070
saying it being indented and that's

00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:56,510
what's really important just kind of

00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,500
talk about get hooks just for a little

00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:00,740
bit more like ice I use something called

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:04,580
husky and you can do things pre push as

00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,710
well I run some tests if I just sort of

00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,390
pre push that no one can push stuff to

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:10,520
the repo they shouldn't

00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:11,930
and it it just runs there's another

00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:16,610
package called lint staged

00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:18,920
and what that does is it will only run

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:22,510
those commands on files that changed

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:25,280
since your previous commit so I sorry

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,380
files you have staged for commits

00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,300
essentially so if things haven't changed

00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,100
it's not going to run your test suite or

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,960
prettier on all of the files in your

00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,250
project it's going to run them on the

00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,650
files that have changed that you've

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:38,030
staged for the next commit which is

00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,710
usually the files that you've changed

00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:44,840
but you can also be selective about that

00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:50,690
as well an es Linh so most people have

00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:55,220
probably used es live before and iya

00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:59,830
Slim is really handy I've used it for a

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:02,540
few years I suppose and it it handles

00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:05,780
functionality very well so if you've

00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:08,120
forgotten too if you've got unused

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,700
variables if you've left console logs in

00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,680
your code you can actually set it up to

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:19,490
format if you've left to do's in your

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:21,500
code any sort of functionality es lint

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,530
is really good at finding those issues

00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,530
and telling you hey there's a variable

00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:28,550
that you left in your code that's unused

00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:31,760
and you get rid of that before you

00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:33,770
before you commit it you can set up to

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,540
do functionality and over the years you

00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:39,710
know yes limp has grown to a point where

00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:42,050
it's set up to do formatting so you can

00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,430
tell Ethel in there I always want spaces

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:48,140
before parentheses and that sort of

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:51,380
thing or you I want tabs or or spaces or

00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:56,030
whatever but what you are doing there is

00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:57,320
you are pushing your opinion into how

00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,780
the code should be formatted and if

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:05,060
you're just writing on your own that's

00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:07,940
okay Priti does it better but if you're

00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:11,089
working within a team all of a sudden

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:16,160
you're being you're dictating how that

00:13:11,089 --> 00:13:18,040
code should look and also I've certainly

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,620
in a situation where they've been very

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,110
stringent rules within

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,640
and we're not committed my work it's

00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,860
been you know taking sort of 10 minutes

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,930
going back through it making sure I put

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,160
all the spaces and new liens where it's

00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,980
asking me to before it will allow me to

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,820
commit and that's just Co slows the

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:40,000
whole process down so you can set up

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:42,070
prettier with es limit very easily and

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,900
you just leave the you know separate the

00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,130
responsibilities essentially yes lien

00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,870
will look after the functionality of the

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,910
code and pretty will look after the

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:54,670
formatting of your code and they play

00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:57,790
really nicely together configuration so

00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:01,480
you can dictate to prettier how it

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:03,010
formats your code you can tell it that I

00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,720
prefer single quotes or double quotes

00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:11,770
you can tell it to use spaces in

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,660
parenthesis but the ethos of prettier is

00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,380
essentially you don't do any opinions

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:18,790
you don't put do any configuration

00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:22,450
there's only a few options in there it's

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,650
not exhaustive like like es linters I

00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,250
think probably some of them they're just

00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:30,910
what about pressure essentially I would

00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,530
argue you shouldn't the one I would

00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,720
change if I was going to something like

00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,540
line length so it will automatically

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,890
when you get character a TA will try and

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:43,420
put things on to a new line so that it's

00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:45,190
most readable currently I've left that

00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,500
how it wants it to leave it but

00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:51,490
sometimes I feel on a big widescreen

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:54,250
monitor like it's a bit a bit tight so

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,410
you can before we shouldn't live any

00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,660
been using the forty months a little bit

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:01,030
I might play with some configuration I

00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,810
might not I probably won't and suggest

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:06,340
you don't everyone hates it equally I

00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,440
think that's pretty quite a good way to

00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,020
look at prettiest so it reformats all

00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,190
your code and that can be annoying but

00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,450
if everyone's off the set on the same

00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,310
page if everyone's working from the same

00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:17,920
hymn sheet then then it's not such a

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,150
problem and when I further yeah the

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,550
first couple of days I used it I was

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,380
like I'm not sure about this and

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:28,690
developers I introduced it to you're a

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:30,190
bit like you know maybe but actually you

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,260
get used to it very quickly

00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,490
and the best thing is you know you

00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,180
stopped hanging onto your but your

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:38,110
preferences

00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:40,060
things and it really does free you up to

00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,230
stop thinking about how you're

00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:44,529
formatting your code is you're going on

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,670
writing which just frees up your mind to

00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:48,160
worry about the bigger problem which is

00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,450
how your code is functioning and if

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,560
you're the boss you know pretty did it

00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,180
it's not your fault you didn't tell

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,360
anyone how you know the code should be

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,430
line you set out it pretty does its own

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,670
thing and you know it's not your fault

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:02,709
you can work your hands clean of it and

00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:03,540
that's that that's it that's me lapping

00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:05,230
up the applause so

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:11,879
[Laughter]

00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:11,879
