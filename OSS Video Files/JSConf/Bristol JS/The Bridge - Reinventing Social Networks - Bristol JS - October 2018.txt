Title: The Bridge - Reinventing Social Networks - Bristol JS - October 2018
Publication date: 2018-11-13
Playlist: Bristol JS
Description: 
	Presented by Ollie Haydon-Mulligan.

If you'd like a completely unbiased feed of your Facebook friends' posts, this tool is for you.

This project was broadly prompted by thinking about how to empower social network users. One current limitation is how separate social networks are - it's hard to feel ownership of our online activity when we are locked into so many separate networks that don't connect with each other. We thought it would cool to build a bridge between networks that let us each manage all our communications in one place.

About Pusher Sessions:

We're bringing the meetup to you. With Sessions, you can watch recordings of top-notch talks from developer meetups -- wherever and whenever you want.

Meetups are a great way to learn from our peers and to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. As developers ourselves, we at Pusher wanted to bring this great content to more people... So we built Sessions. On Sessions, you can watch talks that interest you and subscribe to be notified when new content gets added.

If you run a meetup and want to get involved, kindly get in touch.
