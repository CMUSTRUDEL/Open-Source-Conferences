React Native is one the fastest growing frameworks for building native apps. In this lightning talk we will look at starting out with React Native, itâ€™s pros and cons and how it compares to web view based solutions such as Ionic.

We will also look at how React Native compares to React, what Expo is and what basic libraries (such as React Navigation) you will need to start building your first React Native app.

Finally, we will briefly look at creating standalone apps and uploading these to Google Play and Apple iTunes, and the typical experiences involved in both.

This talk is for anyone with an interest in cross platform mobile development in general, especially React and Ionic.

Key examples used in this talk include:
